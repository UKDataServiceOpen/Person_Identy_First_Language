Saka Gu ¨venc¸","Training and Research Hospital Genetic Diognosis Center,","Izmir, Turkey Introduction: 8p inverted duplication deletion syndrome is a rare chromosomal anomaly characterized by mild to severe intellectual de ﬁcit, severe developmental delay, hypotonia, agenesis of the corpus callosum and minor facial anomalies such as prominent forehead, temporal baldness, anteverted nostrils and eversion of the lower lip. Materialsand Method: A prenatal case was investigated due to high risk for Down syndrome in ﬁrst trimester biochemichal screening and advanced maternal age (36) by amniocentesisand fetal ultrasonography (USG). Results: Amniocentesis was performed at 16 thweeks of gestation. The result of the QF PCR analysis for rapid aneuploidy screening was nor mal, but add (8p) was determined by conventional kar  yotyping. The parental karyotypes had no chromosomal anomaly. In the subtelomeric FISH study of the fetal sam ple, there was a subtelomeric deletion in the 8p region. There was no fetal structural anomaly in level II fetal USGand fetal echocardiography. The molecular karyotyping revealed a gain in 8p11.22 p23.1 region with a size of 27.2 Mb containing 122 OMIM gene and a loss in 8p23.1",2017

The gene is located each of the sex chromosomes. AmelX ispresent on the Xp22.1 p22.3 and AmelY is present on the Yp11.2, differ by a 6 bp deletion in the third intron of AmelX is not in AmelY. It is lead to be useful for genderidenti ﬁcation detecting of amelogenin homologus. It ’s fact that Y chromosome abnormalities are primarily considired for male infertility or subfertility. Meterials and Methods:Quantitative ﬂuorescent polymerase chain reaction (qf pcr) combination with conventional cytogenetic analysis has been used routinely in prenatal diagnosis. The technique, isbased on the length variotions of short tandem repeat (str) in chromosomes. Also, AmelX and AmelY sequences are these markers. In the case, fourteen weeks choryonic villussamples (cvs) with indications of omphalocele and ana  ncefalia were refered to our clinic for prenatal diagnosis. When detecting the lock of AmelY locus in cvs we analyzedthe parents immediately for amel fragments. Results: AmelX of the mother was normal level whether fetüs and father have not any size of AmelY loci but had SRY sex determining region Y marker. Conclusion: A few cases have been reported interstitial deletion of AmelY loci have oligozoospemic clinique associated with male infertility butwe had described lack of AmelY locus both fetus and the father. Interesting feature of the case that father had not dysmorphic features also is a fertile man. Genetic coun seling was given to the family. M.N. Somuncu: None. A.G. Zamani: None. E. Gok  tas:None. A.

AndrogenInsensitivity Syndrome (AIS) is an X linked disorder caused by pathogenic variants in ARgene. The aim of this work was to describe a family presenting with DSD and allthe multidisciplinary approaches that were needed to achieve the precise diagnosis and correct follow up. Mate  rials and Methods: Both clinical and biochemical char acteristics of three individuals from two generations of a family presenting with DSD are described. Karyotype, SRY FISH and sequence analysis from ARorSRD5A2 genes were performed according to the clinical clues. Results: Our index case, a 17 years old girl, presented with primary amenorrhea, normal female external genitalia, absenceuterus on MRI and 46,XY karyotype. Hormonal studies revealed high delta 4 androstenedione, very high testoster  one and low dihydrotestosterone. Her maternal aunt and heryoung sister have the same phenotype. A pathogenic variant c.1508G > A in exon 1 of ARgene was found in hemi  zygosity in all patients and in heterozygosity in the mother.A secondary 5  α reductase de ﬁciency could explain the hormonal pro ﬁle detected in our AIS patients. The man  agement includes hormone replacement therapy,prophylactic gonadectomy, psychological support and genetic counselling. Conclusions: DSD are rare however extremely sig  niﬁcant conditions that may interfere with life quality, so all efforts should be made in order to get the precise diagnosis as well as the best care possible.

At last, over 1,000 mutations have been reported in AR geneand with most of these being associated with incombatible genotype and phenotypes. Clinical ﬁndings are external genitalia at birth, abnormal secondary sexual developmentin puberty, and infertility in individuals with a 46,XY kar  yotype as typically characterized androgen insensitivity syndrome. Materials and Methods: In our case, 17 year oldfemale phenotype presented with primary amenorrhoea and the predominantly female external genitalia. Patient, had spontaneous once menarche but not continued. Radiologyresults had demostrated the absence of uterus and vagina, only right ovary avaliable. Firstly, we analyzed karyotype, then detected the gene with sequence analysis and Multi plex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli ﬁcation (MLPA) to exclude large deletions and duplications. Results: Patient had 46, XY karyotype and female phenotype, MLPA test isnormal but the results of the gene sequence is not. We detected a missense mutation in ﬁrst ekson. GAA codon was turned into GGA. Substituting at position 529 to glu tamic acide exchange to glycine. NM000044 c.5 A >G variant was neither found in ExAc or 1000 genome base. Conclusion: We have detected a novel mutation on ARgene immediately after start codon at ﬁfth nucleotide. Glutamic acide is polar aminoacide with negative charge while glycine is stayed in non polar hydrophobic group.822Lastly, the mutation may cause to physical defect on protein and native three dimensional structure.

A total of 118 pre natal samples from patients with abnormal ultrasound were selected, 58 of then were chorionic villus sampling (CVS) and 60 amniocentesis. karyotype and array CGH was per formed in all of then. Karyotype was performed according with the giemsa standar thecnique. Array CGH with a 180 K resolution, was performed with the Nimblegen CGX Cito genetic Microarrays Platform, supplied by PerkinElmer. From the 118 cases, in 9 (8,1%) was detected a chromo  somal abnormality, but when array CGH was performed,the number of samples with pathogenic chomosomal anomalies increased to 20 (17%), in all cases where a patologic karyotype was detected (9 cases), the array CGHdetected the same patologic chromosomal alteration. When karyotype was normal, in 11 cases the array detected microduplications o microdelections that can be consideredpatologics (CNAs) Our results with an increase in the detection rate are in accordance with previous publications were the patological chomosomal abnormalities detectedwith array CGH is highly increased when compared with karyoptype. This signi ﬁcantly increased detection of chro  mosome anomalies, from 8,1 to 17%, after applyingmicroarray analysis for prenatal testing with abnormal ultrasound supports the use of arrays as ﬁrst tier test for prenatal diagnosis in cases with abnormal ultrasounddetected.

We retrospectively compared QUAD vs.DUAL strategies. Material and Methods : Forty seven T21 pregnancies (ascertained 2008 –2016) by the DUAL (Kryptor; ThermoFischer Sci.; USA) were re examinedusing QUAD (Delphia Xpress  LifeCycle software; Perkin Elmer; USA) for ﬁnal risk (FR) and biochemistry only (BO) ascertainment with cut offs  1:300 (positivity) and 1:301 1:2000 (intermediate risk). Biomarker MOM levels, age  related risk, higher NT were also considered. Results: QUAD FR for 1:300 was detected in 72.34% of all cases,BO in 87.23%, while in DUAL 59.57% and 65.95%, respectively. Integration of FR with BO in QUAD increased positivity to 91.49%, while in DUAL to 74.46%. If 3 caseswith QUAD FR 1:337, BO 1:390, age risk 1:77, higher NT and age risk 1:458 had been included, QUAD might achieve 97.87% T21 detection rate. However, if 5 cases with DUALBO within 1:459 –1:810 had been taken into account, this rate would be only 85.10%. QUAD FR in > 1:2000 was 6.38%, while in DUAL it was 19.15%, with BO 6.38%.DUAL achieved lower 21.28% PAPP A prevalence versus 55.32% in QUAD. Only in one case all makers were normal in QUAD / DUAL. Conclusions: QUAD provides signi ﬁcantly higher detection rate and reliability within 1:300 risk and achieves better screening outcomes than DUAL.

Women who inherit BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations have a 50% –80% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer and a 16% –65% lifetime risk for ovarian cancer. Many women need genetic counseling and testing to learn about their risk status and its implications. Although most women who seek counseling and testing are pastreproductive age, some still are in their childbearing years. Case report . A 32 year old female at 23 weeks gestational age (G.A) with breast cancer diagnosis presented for genetictesting and counseling. Histopathological examination indicated an invasive ductal carcinoma with triple negative cancer (cancer stage 2B [pT3N0M0]). The patient ’s mother died at age 47 due to breast cancer and denied any use of alcohol or cigarettes. She had her regular menstrual periods and never used oral contraceptives. Her menarche was at11 years of age. Her family history, young onset disease, and histopathological ﬁndings suggested HBOC (Heredi  tary Predisposition to Breast and Ovarian Cancer syn drome). She underwent genetic testing for BRCA1/2, though genetic counseling was provided. The result was positive for a BRCA2 mutation. The patient wishes to knowif pregnancy impacts upon their future risks of cancer recurrence and survival. Conclusion . In cases of pregnancy  related breast cancer, consideration must be given to whe ther the pregnancy should be continued and to posttreatment fertility. Genetic counseling should be provided and the patient should be checked for the BRCA mutation, as it ismeaningful for the future of any potential children and should be provided even if the cancer is advanced or recurrent.

We aimed at determining the types and frequency of the chromosome aberrations in patientswith reproductive failure   sterility, miscarriages, stillbirths, and implantation failures after in vitro procedures. Materials and Methods: We have analysed 488 patients from ourreproductive clinics by karyotype analysis using G banding technique. Results: We detected 21 (4.3%) cytogenetic aberrations, both numerical and structural. Klinefelter syn drome was revealed in 2 out of 27 azoospermic men (7.4%). Structural chromosomal rearrangements were established in 4 out of 258 women (1.6%), and in 3 out of 230 men(1.3%). One complex three way translocation was detected in a woman, it has familial character   46, XX, t(1p31  > 11q22  > 8q12  > 1p31). The other translocations included:46,ХХ, t(7; 10)(q11; p13); 46, XX, t(9; 11)(p23; p12); 46, ХХ, t(11; 22)(q23; q11.2); 46, XY, t(5, 6)(p13; q16); 46, ХУ, t(1; 11)(p36.1; q12). One ring chromosome 21 (46, XY, r(21)) was found in an azoospermic man. In 1% of tested patients we found inversion of chromosome 9. Sex chromosome low level mosaicism was found in 1% as well.Conclusions: In about 5% of patients attending reproductive clinics cytogenetic abnormalities were revealed.

As a result,many parts of chromosomes remain deleted. The rupture is due to external or internal mutagenic factors such as ionizing radiation, free radicals, and mutations in the genesfor cell repair mechanisms. The consequences are asso  ciated with impaired apoptosis, cell division and survival. Impaired apoptosis in turn leads to hypodiploidy. Materialsand methods: We report here 4 cases with ultrasound or cytogenetic anomalies of the fetus, which have been ana  lyzed by array CGH analysis. Results: In a case with mul tiple development anomalies (agenesis of corpus callosum, tetralogy of Fallot, omphalocele) we detected multiple genomic deletions, varied from del1p36 to monosomies ofchromosomes 15, 16, 17, 19 and 22. In the second case with intrauterine retardation, severe heart malformation and fetal death, we detected deletion of 19p and additional multiplegenomic deletions   the larger were del17p13 ( > 4 Mbp), del17q21 ( > 4 Mbp), del22q13 ( > 4 Mbp). In the case with marker chromosome we established duplication of 18p(explaining the marker) and multiple additional deletions, including 1p36, 7q11, 7q21, 12q22 q24, 17p13 q21, 22q, and monosomies of chromosomes 16 and 19. Finally, morethan 300 genomic aberrations (more than 80% of them were deletions), varied between several Kbp up to 5 Mbp, were detected in a fetus with holoprosencephaly. Conclusion: Weconclude that chromotripsis could underlie the impaired fetal development, most probably due to the severe clasto  genic effect. I. Dimova: None. P. Chaveeva: None. J.

Such occurrences in phenotypically normal persons are rare, and the risk for abnormalities increases with the number ofbreaks. The majority of CCRs detected prenatally are de novo. Case Details: We present a case of fetal brain mal  formations including agenesis of corpus callosum, severemicrocephaly, malformed vermis and distinct facial features at 24 weeks gestation. Cytogenetic analysis revealed a CCR with deletions of the long arms of chromosomes 1, 5, and10 and at least six breakpoints, two on each chromosome: 46,XY,del(1)(q32.3q42,1),del(5)(q13.3q15),del(10) (q22q23). Chromosomal microarray (CMA) further de ﬁned the chromosomal aberrations as a loss of 1357 Kb on chromosome 1q41, a loss of 1409 Kb on chromosome 5q14.3 and a loss of 737 Kb on chromosome 10q23.31.These losses include 16 OMIM genes, 6 of which are disease associated genes. Parental karyotype and CMA were normal. The couple chose to terminate the pregnancy.Discussion: Interstitial deletions within chromosome bands 5q14.2q15 have been described in patients with severe mental retardation, epilepsy and variable congenital brainanomalies. The severe fetal malformations were likely the result of the extensive CCR. Using both conventional kar  yotyping in conjunction with CMA improves our under standing of such complex rearrangements, provides an additional tool for genetic counseling and facilitates par  ental reproductive choices.

Almadani","Royan, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Testicular descent is a process which is sometimes insuf ﬁcient and results in cryptorchidism or undescended testis (UDT). Cryptorchidism is a risk factorfor infertility and cancer. It has different reasons like genetic factors. Some studies have been reported about cryptorch  idism boys with chromosomal anomalies.Our purpose wasto investigate the association between cryptorchidism infertile men and their chromosomal constitutions in Iranian population. Materials & Methods: This research was con ducted on 522 infertile men with UDT who referred to Royan institute during ﬁve years. They were selected after clinical examinations, hormonal tests, and semen and kar yotype analysis. All the patients were divided into azoos  perm or oligoosperm, unilateral or bilateral group. Karyotype was performed using standard GTG bandingtechnique. Results: 348 azoosperm (66.66%), 174 oligoos  perm (33.4%) and 45 (8.62%) chromosomal alterations were detected. Among these, seven had normal variations(1.34%) and the remaining 38 patients (7.3%) had abnormal karyotypes. Unilateral UDT were diagnosed in most of the patients with abnormal karyotypes. Klinefelter and mosai cism were the most common abnormalities, in 18 (3.44%) and 10 cases (1.91%) respectively. Furthermore, sex reversal, structural and 47, XYY syndrome were detectedwith lower incidence. In addition, hormonal pro ﬁle showed the elevation of FSH and LH and reduction of testosterone in most of the patients with UDT. Conclusions: It seemsthat cryptorchidism is associated with abnormal karyotype. In case of using ART for infertility treatments, it is recommended to perform karyotype in UDT patientsbecause they may have chromosomal abnormalities.

Clinical phenotype with 18q deletion ishighly variable and mostly depends on the extent of geno  mic deletion and loss of speci ﬁc genes. For the ﬁrst time we report terminal deletion of long arm of chromosome 18 asan additional ﬁnding of noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) and thus demonstrate clinical feasibility of next generation sequencing in subchromosomal CNV detection by per forming low coverage analysis. Material and methods In house NIPT test was performed in healthy 29 year old woman in 17th week of singleton pregnancy. Genomiclibrary was prepared from cell free DNA isolated from plasma utilizing the TruSeq Nano protocol and paired end sequencing on MiSeq (Illumina). Sequencing data wereprocessed using in house bioinformatic algorithm for z score calculation. Results NIPT result for trisomy 21 and 13 was negative, however with inconclusive result for chro mosome 18 with abnormal z score of (minus) −16 showing large deletion in terminal part of q arm. A boy was born with severe polystigmatisation and hypotrophy. G bandedkaryotype and arrayCGH were performed postnatally identifying 12 Mb deletion. Conclusion Low coverage whole genome scan utilized in NIPT can be a bene ﬁcial tool in other CNV detection besides common trisomies, given reasonable size of an event, coverage depth and fetal fraction.

Enzymes involved in one carbon and transsul furation (1C/TS) metabolism in mothers and affected indi  viduals with Down syndrome in altering the likelihood of birth of a child with Down syndrome. Cystathionine betasynthase (CBS), located on chromosome 21 synthesises cystathionine from homocysteine and serine. Trisomy for CBS may be hypothesised to decrease the availability offunctional 1 C folate units. We have looked for an asso  ciation of polymorphism in the CBS gene and the risk of birth of a child with Down syndrome. MATERIALS ANDMETHODS: In our study, sixty seven DS mothers and ﬁfty three mothers who had no children with DS from Çukurova region of Turkey were evaluated. Genomic DNAwas isolated from whole peripheral blood collected on EDTA, using salting out method. The CBS genotypes were studied by PCR ampli ﬁed products.

Introduction: Genetic variants leading to haemostatic disbalance are associated with increased fetal loss occur  rence. We aimed to investigate the potential role of recentlyreported prothrombin (FII) c.*64_*66del gene variant in the etiology of fetal loss by case control study approach and functional analyses. Materials and methods: Study included 105 women with fetal loss and 154 controls. Functional assays including prothrombin activity, prothrombin plasma level, and endo genous thrombin potential were performed on plasma samples of c.*64_*66del carriers. The Cos 7 cells were transfected with two types of constructs: 1. vectors carryingwild type and c.*64_*66del mutant full length prothrombin cDNA; 2. vectors carrying wild type and mutant cDNA extended with downstream regulatory element (DSE) andexpression levels were determined on mRNA level by Real  time PCR and protein level by Western blot. Results: Among women with fetal loss, three hetero  zygous carriers were detected, while none was recorded among controls (0 R ,10.55; 95%CI 0.54 –206.43; p , 0.12). Normal prothrombin activity and plasma level wereobserved in all c.*64_*66del carriers. Endogenous throm  bin potential was increased in carriers (98% ± 6.93) com  pared to control plasma (86%), but without statisticallysigniﬁcant difference. In vitro analyses showed statistically signiﬁcant decrease in prothrombin mRNA level for both mutant constructs (p < 0.001). Decrease was observed onprotein level as well, but statistical signi ﬁcance was reached only for mutant construct without DSE (p ,0.028). Conclusion: Our study indicated that FII c.*64_*66del variant is associated with decreased prothrombin gene expression which suggests its potential role in fetal loss etiology.

 First report of prenatal diagnosis for severe genodermatoses in Egypt,P01.24,"K. Amr1, E. Rabie1,2, G. Kamah1, H. Naser1, S. Zada2,K .",Gaber1,"1National Research Center, Cairo, Egypt,2The American University in Cairo (AUC), Cairo, EgyptBackground : Genodermatoses are severe inherited dis  orders. A great success in identifying responsible genes and characterizing gene mutations paved the road for DNA  based prenatal diagnosis. Examples of severe genoderma  toses candidates for prenatal diagnosis include autosomal recessive congenital ichthyosis (ARCI), Xerodema pig mentosum (XP), Sjögren Larsson syndrome (SLS) and Papillon Lefèvre syndrome (PLS) where clinical severity affects span &/or quality of life hence urging prenataldiagnosis. Materials and methods: The study included seven amniotic samples (AF) from carrier mothers descendingfrom seven pedigrees with history of affected sibs with severe genodermatoses including; two mothers of previous ARCI cases, three XP, one SLS and one PLS. DNA wasextracted from AF by QIA gene extraction kit followed by mutational screening for XPA,TGM1 ,ALDH3A2 andCTSC genes Results : Prenatal diagnosis was successfully performed in all cases. For the three families with history of XPA, two fetuses were found to be heterozygous carriers: one forE111X mutation and the other for R207X while the third was homozygous for T125IfsX15. For ALDH3A2 gene, the fetus was affected for E331X nonsense mutation; for TGM1 gene, the two fetuses were heterozygous carriers for R264W and R143H missense mutations. The ﬁfth AF sample PLS showed homozygous wild type genotype. Conclusion : The high incidence of consanguinity and consequently AR rare disorders combined with the lack of curative therapy, points to the importance of implementingpreventive programs. Prenatal diagnosis and genetic coun  seling represent an important step in prevention and alle  viating the burden of severe genodermatoses on the family& community. K. Amr: None. E. Rabie: None. G.

A genetic abnormality in a child with healthy noncarrier parents is usually attributed to a de novo event during cell division (mitosis/meiosis). The recurrence of de novo chromosomal abnormalities can occur because of: (1)chance alone, (2) parental gonadal/ somatic gonadal mosaicism, or (3) factors associated with an increased risk of meiotic error (in recurrent aneuploidies). When unex pected recurrences happen from apparently non carrier parents, germ line mosaicism should be suspected. We report two cases that strongly suggest parental gonadal/somatic gonadal mosaicism. Case 1 refers to a healthy woman with recurrent trisomy 21 pregnancies (three). Par  ental karyotypes were normal but FISH analysis of oralmucosa cells and peripheral lymphocytes revealed, in the mother, low level somatic mosaicism for trisomy 21. Case 2 involves two brothers, one presenting autistic spectrumdisorder and intellectual disability (ID) and the other with ID and some autistic features. aCGH analysis revealed in both siblings a de novo 50 kb (93,428,335 –93,478,653) microdeletion in 15q26.1. Molecular testing of the parents strongly suggested a parental gonadal mosaicism. Having a previous pregnancy/ child with a chromosome abnormalityis associated with an increased risk of a future chromosome alteration. In case of recurrent trisomies this risk is in ﬂu  enced by maternal age, that can mask other mechanisms. Inrecurrent structural rearrangements the more likely cause is occult parental mosaicism. Gonadal mosaicism remains an important pitfall that should be considered even during thecounseling of families with de novo alterations, as it can seriously in ﬂuence genetic risk. I.M.

Macek Sr.1","12nd Faculty of Medicine   Charles University and Faculty Hospital Motol, Prague, Czech Republic,2Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Kinderwunschzentrum, Lübeck, Germany Introduction: There are 3 common variants which impact on the receptor function of the LHCGR gene   ins18LQ (rs2293275), Asn291Ser (rs12470652) and Ser312Asn (rs2293275). Thus far, their combined effect on controlled ovarian hyperstimulation (COH) was not studied.Our aim was to ascertain their in ﬂuence on LHCGR func  tion, including their genotype combinations, in Elonva  COH Materials and Methods : DNA samples from 48 “low”, 191“intermediate ”and 34 “high”responders (273 patients in total) were genotyped using fragment analysis forins18LQ and TaqMan assays for Asn291Ser and Ser312  Asn variants. Results: The genotype frequency within COH response categories was in the range 56,0% –64,7% for wt/wt, 29,4% –31,3% for wt/ins18LQ and 5,9% –6,3% for insLQ/ insLQ genotypes in insLQ variant.

No differences in gen  otype frequencies was found between ”low”,“intermediate ” and“high”responders in COH (p ≥0,05). Therefore, these variants cannot predict individual response to COH. Moreover, genotype combinations of studied variants didnot have any signi ﬁcant differences, likely due to their low number within compared categories. Conclusions: The prevalence of LHCGR gene variants ins18LQ, Asn291Ser and Ser312Asn is not statistically different within low, intermediate and high responders in Elonva COH, which precludes clinical utility of theirexamination within this context.

" Aberrant miR 346 and miR 582 3p expression in maternal peripheral plasma, fetal cord blood and placenta as a biomarker of adverse obstetricoutcomes",P01.30,"M. Su1, P. Tsai1, Y. Teng2","1Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, National","Cheng Kung University Hospital, Tainan, Taiwan, 2Department of Biological Sciences and Technology, National University of Tainan, Tainan, Taiwan MicroRNA (miRNA) was shown to regulate critical processes in fundamental cell biology and disease forma  tion. Several miRNAs are expressed in human gestationaltissue and some are identi ﬁed to be associated with placenta dysfunction and abnormal pregnancy status, such as intrauterine fetal restriction (IUGR), preeclampsia, ectopicpregnancy and recurrent miscarriages (RM). In order to investigate the roles of miR 346 and miR 582 3p in the adverse events of obstetric ﬁeld, we analyzed these 2 miRNAs of trio samples (maternal plasma, cord blood and placenta) obtained from pregnant women of healthy control (n,60), preeclampsia (n ,25), preterm delivery (n ,25), preterm premature rupture of membrane (n ,20) and IUGR (n,20). The expression level of miR 346 in all included adverse obstetric outcome groups was signi ﬁcantly higher in maternal plasma samples (all p value < 0.05) but sig  niﬁcantly lower in cord blood and placenta samples (all p value < 0.05). Besides, the miR 582 3p level in maternalplasma is also signi ﬁcantly higher in the groups of pre  eclampsia and IUGR (both p < 0.05) compared with normal controls. The results suggest these 2 miRNAs might play different roles in maternal and fetal systems to develop obstetric disorders, and these aberrant miRNAs expression could be biomarkers of adverse obstetric risks.

It is accepted that MMPs are resistant to suppression by pro gesterone. The capacity of progesterone affect to gene expression is dependent on PR A/ B that imbalanced ratio may cause progesterone resistance in endometriosis.Imbalance ratio of PR A/ B via +331G/A may be able to consequence MMP 2 , 9overexpression, which can be important in pathogenesis of endometriosis. Materials andMethods: Blood samples were recruited from 98 women undergoing laparoscopy for endometriosis and 102 healthy fertile women. Ectopic and eutopic tissues were preparedfrom twenty endometriosis and endometrial tissue from 20 non endometriosis women. After DNA extraction from blood samples, genotype frequencies were determined byPCR RFLP. RNA was extracted from tissue samples to analysis of PR A, PR B, MMP 2 , 9mRNA expressions by Real time PCR. Results: Frequency distributions of GG,GA genotypes in +331G/A polymorphism were 98.04%, 1.96% in patients and 97.96%, 2.04% in control groups respectively ( P> 0.05). We demonstrated higher expression level of PR B in eutopic endometrium of patients bearing GA compared to patients with GG genotypes ( P,0.017).

We analysed identi ﬁcation of mosaicism cases when using both methods for cytogenetic investiga  tion of CVS cells. Materials and Methods: Between 1996 and 2016 we collected 5309 ﬁrst trimester CVS in our department. Karyotyping was routinely performed by GTG  banding using the Trypsin Giemsa staining technique. Cytogenetic results were obtained in 5269 ﬁrst trimester CVS (99,2%). Investigation was performed using short term culture (STC) and long term culture (LTC) techniques. Mosaicism was estimated only for cases, investigated byboth methods (4466 CVS in total). Results: Mosaicism was identi ﬁed in 134 cases (3,0% of CVS all taken into con  sideration), of which 43 (32,1%) absolute discordant kar yotypes were detected by different methods (STC and LTC). A wide variety of abnormalities included quantitative abnormalities, supernumerary marker chromosomes, tetra ploidy and structural rearrangements. Quantitative abnormalities of autosomes (72) and of sex chromosomes (37) were most frequently encountered mosaics. Remark ably, among the 19 occurences of mosaic Down ’s syndrome in the fetus, the STC cells in 6 cases had normal karyotypes. Detection of trisomy 21 in the STC or LTC cells werealways con ﬁrmed in the fetus. Both false positive and false  negative results were obtained in trisomy 13 (12 samples in total) in STC cells. Conclusions: Decision on pregnancycontinuation after detecting mosaicism requires an indivi  dual approach based on medical history and ultrasound; in some cases additional examinations are often indispensable.

Its frequency in the general population is 1in 4000 –5000 live born girls and it is the etiology in 15% of cases with primary amenorrhea. Materials and methods: We have examined two sisters (age 22 and 15), both affected byType A MRKH syndrome by using cytogenetic and array CGH analysis. The parents underwent the same testing. Results: Cytogenetic analysis showed normal karyotype. Inone of the sisters, a breakage on chromosome 17q was detected. The detailed microarray analysis showed copy  number variations (CNVs) inherited from the parents andidenti ﬁed two copy number variations with identical size present only in the sisters: arr(hg19)17q21.31(44171888  44351152)x3 and arr(hg19)14q11.2(19373465 19768157)x3. The ﬁrst aberrant region contains KANSL1 gene, which is associated with histone modi ﬁcations and acetylation. Region 17q21.31 is a hot spot for rearranagements and itsCNVs are associated with different phenotypes.

Studies revealed the association between genetic polymorphisms and NTDs in different part of the Globe. The aim of our study was to ﬁnd out the association between MTHFR (methyltetrahydrofolate reductase) gene polymorphisms and the risk of NTDs ineastern India. Materials and Methods: MTHFR gene was screened by bi directional Sequencing in 46 mothers with NTD affected babies and 50 mothers with healthy babies. Results: Two SNPs: rs1801133 (C677T; ala > val) at exon 4 and rs1801131 (A1298C; glu > ala) at exon 7 were identi  ﬁed in our study. Our results showed that the frequency of T allele for rs1801133 was signi ﬁcantly higher in case com  pared to control (p value ,0.013, OR ,4.92, 95% CI , 1.28–18.98) and predicted as risk allele for NTDs. Simul  taneously, when we combined the variant TT genotype with the CT genotype (i.e., CT +TT), assuming a dominant genetic model, where we observed 4 fold increased riskwith the combined genotype CT +TT compared with the CC genotype. On the other hand, the polymorphism rs1801131 was found non signi ﬁcant to the association with NTDs in our sample.

Most of the methods applied in current practice of NIPT are based on z score statistics. The value of z score determines the likelihood of a sample beinghealthy. However, such tests are known to produce false negative results occasionally. Risk assessment is a way to quantify the probability of such errors. Material and methods We applied methods in prob  ability and statistics to calculate risk assessment of our z  score method more precisely. Results We incorporated the estimation of sample ’s fetal fraction of cfDNA in maternal plasma together with the832error of this estimation in the calculation of risk assessment of our z score method. Conclusion The proper calculation of risk assessment is crucial for NIPT results consulting. False positives and false negatives can lead to wrong decisions such as unnecessary amniocentesis or abortion. For this reason, it is important toknow when the administered test can fail. J.

Amniocentesis is a gold standard with high accuracy,however invasion is contraindicated in the risk of fetal infection. There is a dilemma for the pregnancy man  agement for women infected by HIV or hepatitis withhigh risk of fetal aneuploidy. In this case, non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) would help to prenatal consultant manage the pregnancy, make the decision about preg nancy prolongation, but mainly to reduce anxiety and stress in pregnant women. The aims of study: discuss about implementation of clinical NIPT protocolsfor speci ﬁc group of pregnant, namely for infected women with high risk for the aneuploidies of the fetus. Methods: at 13 week of pregnancy we used Clarigo NIPT(Multiplicom) for woman with high risk at T21 (1:4). The invasive procedure was contraindicated owing to infection by hepatitis B. Re sults: NIPT called negative trisomy status (trisomy evidence (T21): −3.8; Z score: −0.3); gender: male). After genetic consulting the preg  nancy was prolongated. The boy was born in term, weight4190 g, length 53 cm and an Apgar score of 8 –9; no phenotypic traits for aneuploidy has been detected when viewed by a medical geneticist. Conclusions:This case raised the discussing about implementation of NIPT to clinical protocols for pregnant women with very high risk for the chromosomal abnormalitiesand with contraindication of invasive procedure.

Also has been reported that to achieve asuccessful embryo implementation, presence of nucleotide variant in the P53PEX4 (R72P), may be a signi ﬁcant effect in the endometrial receptivity of patients with IVF failure. Materials and Methods: In case control investigation, p53 polymorphism PEX4 (R72P) has been assessed in 200 women. We were analyzed 100 patients with IVF failure(two or more failed cycles) as well as 100 individuals with natural pregnancy as a control group, to evaluate the risk assessment between the P53PEX4 (R72P) polymorphism and RIF. Gene ampli ﬁcation was performed using poly  merase chain reaction restriction fragment length poly  morphism (PCR RFLP) method. Results: Ourﬁndings revealed that the frequency of the mutant genotype (PP) among control was 2% compared with 3% for RIF group (p ,0. 81). In addition, the normal homozygote (RR) and heterozygote genotype (RP) fre  quencies of cases and the control group were demonstrated 47%, 50%and10%, 72%, respectively. However, the dif ference between the two groups was not statistically sig  niﬁcant (p ,0. 196). Conclusions: Data has shown that the frequencies of p53 PEX4 (R72P) nucleotide variables were similar in the RIF and healthy group, and did not consider as a genetic pre  disposing factor for RIF causes.

Rearrangements were found both in clinically unaffected in dividuals and patients with phenotypic abnormalities. Most are inherited, butapproximately one in ﬁve are de novo events and intro  duce a risk of abnormal phenotype in 6.1% of prenatal genetic counseling. Methods: In the present case, wereported the analysis results of prenatal diagnosis using G  banded karyotype, nuclear organizer regions staining and CGH array. Initial chromosome analysis of amniotic ﬂuid samples was performed by standard G banding. The kar  yotype analysis was extended on both parents culturing peripheral blood in order to elucidate the chromosomerearrangements in question.

Because of the high carrier rate of beta globin gene mutations in Iran, prenatal diagnosis(PNDs) or Pre implantation G enetic Diagnosis (PGD) are the favored procedures to prevent birth of new β tha  lassemia cases. Haplotyping, using STRs (Short TandemRepeat) markers linked to β globin gene, would add accuracy to any PND and is essential for every PGD for β thalassemia. In this research, we identi ﬁed several novel STR markers linked to the β globin gene, with the aim of increasing the speci ﬁcity and sensitivity of the diagnosis. Allele frequency and heterozygosityassessment of these STR markers were studied on 100 unrelated healthy Irani an individuals. In total, 97 alleles were detected for ten STR loci. The observedrange of allele frequencies was from 0.7% to 38%. The frequencies of genotype distributions for all ten STRs were found to be P ≥0.1876 which is in agreement with the Hardy –Weinberg equilibrium.

Parents, ﬁrst cousin marriage, with positive family history of sib recurrence with a previous 8 month  old son dead with bone dysplasia and acute exacerbation of chronic shortness by bronchiolitis, refused prenatal diagnosis. Results: Parental consanguinity, sib recurrence and clinical ﬁndings suggested STWS syndrome. Sequence analysis of LIFR gen was performed and showed a homo zygous exon 7 deletion [r.562_736del];[r.562_736del]. Heterozygous carrier status of both parents was con ﬁrmed. Conclusions: Patient survives at 18 months with an improvement in their ability to swallow and regulate breathing as literature describes. The analysis supported the clinical homogeneity of SWS, despite genetic hetero geneity. Although STWS is a rare condition and the prog  nosis is poor, management strategies could increase long  term survival. Unfortunately, at the moment the familydoesn ’t accept any genetic advice. M.

 Null allele detected in the context of paternity by DNA ﬁngerprinting,P01.56,"W. MANOUBI, A. Mili, A. Msakni, A. Saad, M. Gribaa","Laboratory of Human Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics","and Reproductive Biology Farhat Hached Universi, Sousse, Tunisia Introduction: Paternity tests enable to establish the biological relationship between a child and his allegedfather. Today, this test is based on DNA ﬁngerprinting using mainly short tandem repeats (STRs) markers. To be the father, an individual must share with the child at leastone of the two alleles of each marker studied. We report in this paper a case of null allele genetically con ﬁrmed in the context of paternity by genetic ﬁngerprint. Observation: We performed a genetic study of three members: a mother, her baby, and a supposed father. This study involved the analysis of 15 STRs markers by “Pow  erPlex 16 System ”kit. Results: Genetic analyzes were performed under the same technical conditions and showed that the VWA mar ker presented abnormal transmission between the infant and his mother for a null allele. This hypothesis was con ﬁrmed by the study of a second kit that enabled to view this alleleand showed that it is normally transmitted to the infant. conclusion: The kits used in the context of paternity by genetic ﬁngerprint use different primers in the ampli ﬁcation of markers and the detection of alleles, which is more or less the speci ﬁc polymorphisms in each population. So these kits are seen as complementary and should be used con comitantly in the identi ﬁcation by DNA ﬁngerprinting stu  dies. In this study, we have con ﬁrmed this situation by molecular genetics tools. However, their clinical and bio logical implications remain unknown. W. Manoubi: None. A. Mili: None. A. Msakni: None. A.

 Prenatal diaggnosis of atypical Turner syndrome: case report of idic(Xp) with multiplication of Xist locus,P01.57,"N. Celton, T. Dery, M. Gallet, A. Mathiron, H. Copin, G.","Morin, G. Jedraszak","University Hospital of Amiens, Amiens, France Turner syndrome (TS) is characterized by absence of X chromosome in woman. Different chromosomal anomaliesare associated to TS: monosomy X (homogeneous or mosaic) and structural X chromosome anomalies (deletion, Xq isochromosome ⋯). Isochromosome Xp is rare, only about ten cases are reported to date. Each of these patients carry the dicentric isochromosome Xp, including a variable part of Xq chromosome, in a mosaic state. We report thecase of a prenatally diagnosed girl who carries a complex X chromosome rearrangement in a mosaic state. Amnio  centesis was performed because of intrauterine growthretardation, aortic hypoplasia and atypical serum markers. Karyotyping showed a mosaic 45,X/46,XX with additional X chromosome which seems to have abnormal structure.Array CGH showed revealed presence of an idic(X)(pter  > q12::q12  > pter) with multiplication of Xq13 region (con  taining Xist locus). These anomalies were con ﬁrmed by FISH. After birth, evolution was marked by growth retar  dation and persistence of isthmic aortic hypoplasia. Chro  mosomal abnormalities were con ﬁrmed by cytogenetic analyses (FISH, ACPA, semi quantitative PCR). At the age of 1 year, psychomotor development occurs normally. Prenatal diagnosis of TS can be done fortuitously or fol lowing echographic abnormalities. In these cases, discus  sion about termination of pregnancy is dif ﬁcult because psychomotor development is usually normal outside thecases of abnormal X with Xist locus loss. For our patient, no case with Xist locus multiplication has been reported to date. Moreover, duplications of Xq12.3q13 and Xq13q21are associated with psychomotor delay and autism in boys, phenoype is normal in girls. These data make genetic counseling in this sensitive situation.

 Association of coagulation factors genes polymorphism with uncompleted carriage,P01.59,"A. Mazitova1, E. Yupatov2, E. Soldatova3, L. Maltseva2,",O. Kravtsova1,"1Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation, 2Kazan State Medical Academy, Kazan, Russian Federa  tion,3Kazan State Medical University, Kazan, Russian Federation Introduction. The hemostatic changes in blood system of the mother occur in all pregnant women as a result of adaptation of the organism to the condition of pregnancy, most of them towards changes in coagulation system. Pre vious studies suggest that mutation/polymorphism of genes encoding coagulation factors may increase a risk of840uncompleted carriage but this data are very controversial. So, the aim of this study was to determine the association of SNPs in FII, FV, FXI and FII genes with uncompleted carriage in women of Tatar ethnicity (Russia). Materials and methods. Genotyping of FII (rs1799963), FV (rs6025), FXI (rs2289252), FXII (rs1801020) genes mutation/poly morphism was performed by RT PCR with TaqMan probes in 92 women with insuf ﬁcient carriage (UC) and 161 women with uncomplicated physiological pregnancy(UPP). Statistical analysis done with packet program RStudio. Results. We observed no signi ﬁcant difference of genotype frequencies in UC and UPP women for commonlystudied in complicated pregnancies Leiden mutation (coa  gulation factor FV), prothrombin FII gene and C46T FXII gene (p > 0.05). However increased genotype CT frequencyfor FXI gene С22771 Тpolymorphism (rs2289252, located in intron region) was determined in women with UC (OR 3.19, 95%CI 1.678   6.0815) but studied polymorphismdidn’ti nﬂuence changes in hemostatic parameters such as platelet counter, PT and APTT (p > 0.05).

The successful embryo implantation dependson trophoblast proliferation, migration and invasion in the endometrium. This is mediated by locally produced mole  cular factors and hormones. Vascular Endothelial GrowthFactor (VEGF) is one of these factors that play pivotal role in human angiogenesis and embryogenesis. Materials andmethods: Blood samples were collected from control women with natural conceived successful pregnancy (n , 21) and patients with reproductive failure (n ,41): RIF   Recurrent Implantation Failures, endometriosis and Recur  rent Spontaneous Miscarriages. Genomic DNA was iso  lated. VEGFA +405G/C genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP using BsmFI restrictase. Real Time PCR and Sanger capillary sequencing were used for validation. Results: The C allelic frequency was higher in patientsgroup compared to controls (53.6% vs 24%, OR ,3.68, 95% CI, p < 0.002). In addition, we detected statistically signiﬁcant incidence of the +405 C/C genotypes in women from the patient group than in control group (37% vs 4%, OR,16.2, 95% CI, p < 0.02 when calculating against GG genotype). The results of the present study revealed asso ciation between the VEGFA +405 C/C genotype and the risk of development of endometriosis and spontaneous miscarriages. In the RIF the results did not reveal suchcorrelation. Conclusion: This test could be offered to patients with presented indications and special attention to be paid on their clinical management.

Eminovic, A.",Kurtovic Kozaric,"University of Sarajevo, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introduction: Genetic factors related to male infertility are chromosomal abnormalities, gene mutations, andmicrodeletions on Y chromosome, which are detected in about 15% of all cases of male infertility. The aim of this study was to identify the site speci ﬁc microdeletions of Y chromosome in idiopathic azoospermic and oligozoos  permic cases from Bosnian population. Materials and methods: During the 4 year period (31/01/2013 to 31/01/2017), 42 patient samples were received by the Human Genetics Laboratory, Clinical Center of the University of Sarajevo, referred for suspected male infertility for thedetection of Y chromosomal microdeletion. Both karyotype and PCR analysis for Y microdeletion (GML Y Chromo  some Microdeletion Detection System Kit, Altendorf,Switzerland) were performed for each patient. Results: In the analyzed period, 2% of patients had either chromosomal or Y deletion defect. In 1.2% of patients Y microdeletionwas detected(n ,5). Most patients had the complete dele  tion of AZFd region (n ,4), followed by partial AZFc deletion (n ,4), and complete AZFa or AZFb deletions (n ,2 patients each). Additionally, four patients had chro  mosomal abnormalities including translocations of auto  somal chromosomes (n ,2), an insertion of heterochromatin on chromosome 17q21 (n ,1) and Kli  nefelter syndrome (n ,1).

A substantial body of evidence suggests the contribution of genetic factors in birth timing and the risk of preterm birth, largely residing in the maternal genome. Materials and methods: A genomewide association study and functional analysis conducted by our group, suggest that WNT4 is associated with gestational length. Pathway analysis of the WNT pathway was furthercarried in a cohort of 86 Danish sister pairs with sponta  neous preterm birth. Results: Rare variants found in the 3 ’ and 5 ’untranslated regions of a WNT pathway gene and predicted to cause ﬁve new binding sites for microRNAs, were identi ﬁed in the Danish sister pairs. The gene is highly evolutionary conserved and expressed in cells secretingWNT. It was shown to have an important role in lung development and angiogenesis in mice, but its role in pla  cental angiogenesis was not directly studied. Conclusion:The WNT pathway gene may have a role in preterm birth, mainly mediated through its gene expression regulatory elements. Its function could have a role in placentalangiogenesis. O.

Congenital cataract is anentity clinically and genetically heterogeneous with high penetrance and represents 10% of a treatable cause of childhood blindness. Thirty percent of the cataracts are heredity with the nonsyndromic autosomal dominant form. In the present study, we analyzed a large Mexican family affected by autosomal dominant cataract in fourgenerations through whole exome and identi ﬁed the NM_005267.4:c.130 G > A (p.Val44Met) mutation on GJA8 gene.

Six mutations (M1V, T8M, W24X, W77X, V84L and E147K) were identi ﬁed; W24X was the most frequent, accounting for 71.05% of the mutant allele. Mutations in GJB6 were not identi ﬁed in our study. Further, no patients harbored bi allelicSLC26A4 mutations or the bil ateral Enlarged Vestibular Aqueduct in our study. Conclusions: The mutation pro ﬁle of GJB2 in our study is distinct from other parts of India,suggesting that the mutation spectrum and frequency of this gene alters with ethnicity and geographical origin. The absence of GJB6 mutations and low frequency ofSLC26A4 mutations pointing that additional genetic fac  tor may contribute to the Non Syndromic Hearing Loss in our population.

Hearing iscomplex process of coordinated units of ear including gap junctions, ion channels, hairy cells and several signalling and motor proteins. Any cease in development of those unitswould result with sensorineural hearing loss. Here, we aimed to investigate the miRNA expressions in hearing loss. Material and Method: 11 miRNAs were evaluated in serum samples of 38 patients with pre lingual(n ,19), per  lingual (n ,4), post lingual (n ,15) hearing loss and 12 controls. miRNAs were analysed by real time PCR(RotorGene Q, Qiagen) method using miScript miRNA primer assays and SYBR Green PCR kits (Qiagen) according to manufacturer instructions. Results: Table. miRNA expression fold regulations within pre per post lingual hearing loss patients compared to controls. Discussion/Conclusions: Signiﬁcant decreased expres  sions of apoptosis and angiogenesis controlling miRNAs (miR 126 miR 222, miR 92) in patients might be the reasonof hearing loss through over expression of connexins at supportive cells and connective tissue cells in the inner cochlea by leading ultra rapid exchange of ions.

Based on WES analysis, we identi ﬁed two novel TRIOBP mutations (p.

Typically,TRIOBP mutations lead to prelingual, severe to profound HI, thus the onset and degree of HI in our patients represent a distinct phenotyp ic manifestation caused byTRIOBP mutations. TRIOBP in the inner ear is responsible for proper structure and function of ste  reocilia and is necessary for sound transduction. Thepresented mutations disrupt TRIOBP 4 and TRIOBP 5 isoforms, forming the rootlets of stereocilia. Although TRIOBP mutations are not a frequent cause of HI, this gene should be included in multi gene diagnostic panels, especially in patients with a postnatal hearing loss. A delayed onset of HI due to TRIOBP mutations creates a potential therapeutic window for future targeted therapies. Acknowledgments This work was supported by NCN grant no. 2011/03/D/NZ5/05592 A.

Materials and meth  ods: RNA samples extracted from corneal tissues of sixKTCN and six non KTCN non related Polish individuals were used in this study. After reverse transcription, Real Time experiments using the RealTime ready Custom Panels(Roche) containing qPCR assays for 45 genes of interest normalized to reference genes, including GAPDH, IPO8 , and ACTB , were performed in triplicate for every gene. Results and conclusions: We observed a signi ﬁcant down  regulation of COL5A2, TGFB3 ,CTGF ,TEAD2 ,TEAD4 , ZNF469 ,SMAD7 , and SPARC genes and upregulation of COL21A ,SKP1 andTGFBI expressions in KTCN corneas, which was consistent with our previous RNA Seq data.

 Targeted NGS identi ﬁed a novel variant in LRP5 causing familial exudative viteroretinopathy in an Iranian consanguineous pedigree,P02.14,"M. Keramatipour, D. Kooshavar, M. Entezam, A.",Karamzadeh,"Tehran University of Medical Sciences, Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Familial exudative vitreoretinopathy (FEVR) is char  acterized by incomplete development of the retinalvasculature. It has variable expressivity even within famil  ies. Defective retinal angiogenesis, peripheral avascularity, and retival ischemia can cause hyperpermeable blood ves  sels, vitreoretinal traction, retinal folds, and retinal detach  ments. FEVR is inherited in an autosomal dominant/ recessive (AD/AR) manner. In this study a consanguineousfamily with two affected sibs of two and four years old were investigated. They had similar symptoms of aphakia, epir  etinal membrane, pigmented retinal lesions, and unilateralfunnel shaped folded retina. Target region capturing of 175 genes related to inherited eye diseases was performed on the younger sib ’s sample followed by next generation sequen  cing (NGS). The detected variant(s) were investigated by PCR Sanger sequencing for validation/segregation analysis. A novel homozygous missense variant in LRP5 gene wasdetected in the proband. It was also detected in homozygous state in her sister by Sanger sequencing. Segregation ana  lysis was consistent with AR pattern of inheritance. Thisvariant was absent in population (1000 G, ExAC, dbSNP) and disease speci ﬁc (ClinVar, OMIM, HGMD) databases, predicted to be disease causing by multiple in silico pre dictive tools (Mutation Taster, SIFT, PolyPhen, CADD) and the substituted nucleotide was evolutionally well conserved (ConSurf, phyloP, phastCons). Based on ACMG guidelinesfor interpretation of sequence variants, it is classi ﬁed as a variant with uncertain signi ﬁcance; efforts to resolve this classi ﬁcation as possibly pathogenic is undertaken. Although mutations in LRP5 are the most common cause of AR FEVR, applying NGS in less investigated populations can still detect novel variants, even in well studied genes. M. Keramatipour: None. D.

The genetic diagnosis by traditional methods is impossible due to high genetic heterogeneity and clinical variability of the IRD. Therefore, the aim of this study is the molecular diagnosis by next generation sequencing of patients with IRD. We designed a panel including 117 genes and 5 deep intronicmutations described for this group of disorders. We used SureSelect QXT(Agilent ) protocol for the library construction and MiSeq ( Illumina ) platform for samples sequencing. Data were analysed by SureCall ( Agilent ) and wANNO  VAR ( WGLab ) softwares. We used 8 patients with muta  tions of different nature previously detected in 8 genesresponsible of IRD. The designed panel had a size of 490kbp. The 67% of total reads were aligned in our interest regions. The average depth was 228×. The 98% of baseshad a depth > 50×. We detected the 100% of control mutations, consisting in: one splicing mutation, 2 mis  senses, 5 frameshifts and one 5 exon deletion; localized inthe genes: NR2E3, ABCA4, RPGR, RHO, PRPF8, CHM, PRPH2 and USH2A . The results of the control patients sequencing (coverage, reads depth and control mutationsdetection) validated this analysis as strategy for the mole  cular diagnosis of IRD. Once the panel was validated, we started to sequence a cohort of 100 patients clinicallyclassi ﬁed as IRD but without molecular diagnosis. Our results are promising as the detection rate of the panel is higher than 50% of all the patients analysed. A. Rodríguez Muñoz: None. C. Fuster: None. E. Aller: None. I. Hernán: None. R.

Proliferative DR is moreadvanced type of DR and characterised with scar tissue and pathologic neovascularization, which are weak and bleed easily. Here, we aimed to asses whetherthrombosis related gene polymorphisms [plasminogen activator inhibitor 1( PAI 1 ) and Methylenetetrahy  drofolate reductase ( MTHFR )] are associated to pro  liferative retinopathy. Methods: A case control study was conducted in patients with T2DM with proliferative retinopathy (n ,33), non proliferative retinopathy (n ,33) and non diabetic controls (n ,33). Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood and genotyped by Real Time PCR method andcompared using one sided Fisher ’s exact test. Result: The expected/observed genotype frequencies were all in equilibrium with Hardy Weinberg. MTHFR (C677T)(rs1801133) polymorphisms were signi ﬁcantly different between proliferative and non proliferative DR (p ,0,012), that having at least one T allele would 3.6 times increase the risk of having proliferative retinopathy in dia  betic patients [OR ,3,619 (95% CI: 1,290 –10,150)].

All affected individuals exhibited severe disease with an onset in the second or third decade of life and severely reduced and delayed ERG responses. Com bining 750k SNP array for all family members with whole exome sequencing of two affected family members, we identi ﬁed in this kindred two different mutations in EYS (RP25): a deletion mutation encompassing 10 of the 43 exons and a p.W1817* nonsense mutation. Segregation analysis of both mutations demonstrated that all affectedindividuals were either homozygous for either one of the mutations, or compound heterozygous for both mutations. Both mutations are predicted to cause loss of function of theencoded protein and were not present in 200 ethnically  matched controls. Thus, we demonstrate pseudo dominant heredity of RP in a consanguineous Bedouin clan caused byhomozygosity and compound heterozygosity for two dif  ferent EYS mutations :a nonsense mutation and a micro  deletion.

The spectrum of these dis orders is clinically and genetically heterogeneous. Genetic studies have highlighted more than 200 mutant genes involved in about 60% of the cases.A woman with sporadicrod cone dystrophy (RCD), from a consanguineous family, was clinically investigated at the Quinze Vingts hospital. Targeted next generation sequencing followed by wholeexome sequencing was performed on the index patient and ﬁve unaffected family members. Stringent ﬁltering keeping only variants in exonic and putative splice sites with amaximal allele frequency of ≤0.005 was applied. A variant inGUCA1B (c.357+6 T > C, p.?) was identi ﬁed in the affected patient at homozygous state, which co segregatedwith the phenotype in the family. Although the variant described herein does not directly affect splice acceptor or donor sites, it is predicted to in ﬂuence splicing. Minigene approaches are underway to con ﬁrm these ﬁndings. GUCA1B encodes one of three guanylate cyclase activating proteins, which is expressed in rods and cones. Theseproteins play a key role in the phototransduction cascade. Although GUCA1A mutations are well known to cause autosomal dominant IRDs, the implication of GUCA1B mutations in IRDs is controversial. Here we report a homozygous variant in GUCA1B in a sporadic RCD case most likely in ﬂuencing splicing. Further studies are needed to con ﬁrm this hypothesis.

The syndrome has three distinct clinical subtypes (USH1 3), which can be distinguished by their severity and age of onset. The use of next generation sequencingtechniques has improved considerably the time and cost  effectiveness of the molecular diagnosis of USH. The aim of this study was to develop a custom panel of genes toearly diagnose Usher syndrome patients in order to better plan auditory visual rehabilit ation strategies. Materials and Methods: Ten patients with clinical evidence of sen sorineural hearing loss were a ssed and tested for germline mutations at Sant Pau Hospita l. We have designed a panel including 22 genes related to nonsyndromic and syn dromic hearing loss. Librar ies were prepared using the TruSeq Custom Amplicon (Illumina) and sequenced on an Illumina MiSeq sequencer. All pathogenic variants werevalidated by Sanger sequencing and its inheritance was evaluated within each single family. Results: We have obtained high quality sequences of all the regions inclu ded in the panel ( > 99%) with covertures over 70 × . Three patients were diagnosed as Usher type 1, one as type 2 and one as type 3 due to mutations in the MYO7A (OMIM 276900), USH2A (OMIM 276901) and CLRN1 (USH3A, OMIM 276602) genes respectively. Conclu  sions: Studying genetics in sensorineural hearing losspatients will allow us to uncover causes which are pre  sently unknown improving therapy planning. Usher patients can bene ﬁt from prevention, diagnosis, prog  nostic, treatment and genetic counselling. L. Alías: None. M.P. Venegas: None. A. Pujol: None. J. Juan: None. E. Martínez: None. J.

WScan be caused by heterozygous alterations of MITF . Two unrelated families with an association of WS and ocular albinism were previously reported, suggesting a digenicinheritance in this phenotype. In these families a frameshift deletion of MITF was identi ﬁed, co segregating with the p. (arg402Gln) variant of TYR in the ﬁrst family and p. (Pro513Arg) mutation of TYRP1 in the second one. The contribution of p.(arg402Gln) in albinism is controversial in the literature, but it is suggested that this variant can beresponsible for a mild form of oculo cutaneous albinism, depending on the variant present in trans. Here we describe a 3 years old girl with ocular albinism, global hypo pigmentation, congenital deafness and iris heterochromia. We performed next generation sequencing of a panel con  taining all known albinism genes and WS genes. Weidenti ﬁed a heterozygous intragenic deletion in MITF and the homozygous p.(arg402Gln) variant in TYR. No other mutations were found. In this observation we support thehypothesis of an additive effect of MITF andTYR variants leading to simultaneous WS and albinism. A. Méleu: None. A. Trimouille: None. P. Pennamen: None. C.

WS leads to hearing loss and impairment of pigmentation of the skin, hair and eyes. The 393 patients from 364 families withcongenital hearing impairment were clinically examined in the Sakha Republic (Eastern Siberia, Russia) and three affected subjects from two unrelated families with WSphenotypes were found among this cohort of patients. Thus, the frequency of WS in patients with congenital hearing impairment in the Sakha Republic is estimated as 0.76% (3/393). We performed sequencing of coding regions of genes PAX3 ,MITF ,SOX10 andSNAI2 in affected members of these families. Two heterozygous likely nonpathogenicsynonymous substitutions: p.Asn268Asn ( PAX3 ) and p. His309His ( SOX10 ), were found in two members of one family (father and his daughter) with the WS type I phe notype. Heterozygous transition c.775 C > T in exon 8 of gene MITF leading to a premature stop codon (p.Arg259*) which is known to be associated with WS was detected inpatient with the WS type II phenotype from another family. This patient is characterized by congenital unilateral hearing loss and heterochromia of irises (right eye is dark brown,left is brilliant blue) and absence of telecant and depig  mentation of skin/hair.

 Frequency of the 8 bp deletion in exon 3 of theCYP21A2 gene in Macedonian patients with classical 21 hydroxylase de ﬁciency,P03.01,"V. Anastasovska, M. Kocova; Genetic Laboratory,","Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, University","Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia, The FormerYugoslav Republic of Introduction: 21 hydroxylase de ﬁciency is an autosomal recessive endocrine disorder due to mutations in the CYP21A2 gene. Severe enzyme de ﬁciency can present as a classical salt wasting (SW) and simple virilizing form (SV).The 8 bp deletion in exon 3 is a mutation transferred from the pseudogene which shifts the reading frame, thus pro  ducing inactive enzyme. This mutation is associated withSW phenotype. Materials and Methods: Fifty DNA samples from Macedonian patients with clinical and laboratory signs of severe form of 21 hydroxylase de ﬁciency, 22 SW and 28 SV, were collected and subjected to polymerase chain reaction for the detection of presence of GAGACTAC sequence at the position 707 –714 in exon 3 of the CYP21A2 gene. The patients were evaluated at the Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, University Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia. Results:We detected presence of 8 bp deletion on the six (6/100) of the analyzed alleles (6%), of which 4/44 (9.1%) were in SW patients, and 2/56 (3.6%) in SV form. One of the SWpatients, 4.5% (1/22), was a homozygous (8 bpdel/8bpdel), and two 9.1% (2/22) were compound heterozygote with genotypes 8bpdel/Q318X, and 8bpdel/R356W. Among theSV patients, one was compound heterozygote (3.6%) with genotype 8bpdel/V281L, and the other one (3.6%) was heterozygote for 8bp deletion with no detected mutation onthe second allele. Conclusions: The frequency of 8 bp deletion in Macedonian patients with classical 21  hydroxylase de ﬁciency, that is comparable to the most of the other European countries, supports its role in classical phenotype of the disease. 1 V.

These genes encode tight junction proteins claudin 16 and claudin 19, respectively, which are involved in paracellular calcium and magnesium reabsorption in thekidney. FHHNC is characterized by excessive renal mag  nesium and calcium excretion in urine. Early in life, patients develop nephrocalcinosis and chronic kidney failure.Patients with mutations in CLDN19 also present severe ocular abnormalities. Here, we describe the clinical mani  festations and genotype of eight new cases. Materials andMethods: The medical records of two girls and a boy and ﬁve adults, two males and three females, diagnosed with FHHNC were examined. The CLDN16 andCLDN19 genes of patients and relatives were analysed by DNA sequencing. Bioinformatics tools were used to predict the consequences of mutations. Results: Three CLDN16 mutations, c.571 G > A (p.G191R), c.485 G > T (p.G162V) and c.165_166delG  GinsC, and two missense CLDN19 mutations, c.57 G > A (p.G20D) and c.83 C > T (p.P28L), all previously described,were detected. In addition, a novel CLDN16 mutation, c.602 G > A (p.G201E), was identi ﬁed. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that this presume missense mutation alsocreates a new donor splice site and inactivates an exonic splicing enhancer. Conclusions: Genetic analysis con ﬁrmed the clinical diagnosis. Results obtained with adult patientssuggest that FHHNC may be under diagnosed. We suggest that the new mutation could alter splicing of the CLDN16 pre mRNA.

Claverie Martı ´n1","1Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain,2Hospital Virgen de la Arrixaca, Murcia, Spain Introduction: Dent disease is an X linked renal tubu  lopathy characterized by low molecular weight proteinuria, hypercalciuria, nephrocalcinosis, nephrolithiasis and pro  gressive renal failure. Two thirds of the cases are associatedwith inactivating mutations in the CLCN5 gene and a few present mutations in OCRL1 . Our objective was to describe the clinical and genotypic features of new patients diag nosed with Dent disease. Materials and methods: Nine male patients with suspected Dent disease were studied. The age range at the time of diagnosis was 0.8 –19 years. All patients presented tubular proteinuria, six presented hipercalciuria and six had nephrolithiasis or nephrocalcinosis. The CLCN5 andOCRL1 genes were analysed by PCR ampli ﬁcation of the coding exons and DNA sequencing. Results: Eight patients revealed CLCN5 mutations and one an OCRL1 mutation. A novel CLCN5 mutation c.1641G > T (p. W547C) was identi ﬁed. This presumed missense mutation, located in a mutation hotspot, also activates an exonic cryptic donor site and creates an exonic splicing silencermotif. In one patient PCR products could not be obtained using any of the CLCN5 speciﬁc primers, indicating the presence of a CLCN5 large deletion. The remaining muta  tions were three nonsense, two missense, and two small deletions that had been previously described. Conclusions: All the mutations identi ﬁed predict important structural and functional changes in ClC 5 or OCRL proteins. We suggest that mutation c.1641G > T can result in alterations of CLCN5 pre mRNA splicing.

The most common recognized genetic defects associated withCPHD include mutations within PROP1, POU1F1, HESX1, LHX3, LHX4, OTX2, GLI2 , and SOX3 . The phenotype connected to POU1F1 mutations is characterized by pro  found GH and PRL de ﬁciencies, variable degrees of TSH deﬁciency, severe proportional short stature, atypical facies and feeding dif ﬁculties in infancy. Patients harboring mutations within PROP1 gene present GH, PRL, TSH deﬁciencies in addition to variable defects in LH/FSH and ACTH secretion. Here, we present 3 cases with POU1F1mutation and 1 case with PROP1 mutation, who were molecularly diagnosed in the Medical Genetics Department of Ege University. Result: Three cases (1 female, 2 males) carrying POU1F1 mutations all had short stature. One male case with a novel mutation, p.K216T also presented withmicropenis in addition to short stature. The other mutations detected in POU1F1 gene were S50A, R265W; S50A being novel. Fourth case with PROP1 mutation also had short stature and micropenis. Molecular analysis revealed a fra  meshift p.L102CfsX8 mutation in the PROP1 gene. Bio  chemical testing showed PRL and GH de ﬁciencies in all cases. Two cases with POU1F1 defects and a case with PROP1 defect also had central hypothyroidism. Conclusion: It’s considered that in patients with growth retardation together with combined pituitary hormone deﬁciency POU1F1 andPROP1 gene mutations should be investigated.

 Can we trust genotype phenotype correlations of IVS2 mutation?,P03.09,"N. Yurur Kutlay, S. Altıner; Ankara University School of","Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara,Turkey","Introduction: Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) occurs mostly (%90) as a consequence of 21 hydroxylase deﬁciency. Although the frequency differs according to the region, nine mutations in the CYP21A2 gene (IVS2 13 A/C > G, V281L, Q318X, R356W, ClusterE6, P30L, I172N, 8 bp deletions, large deletion) are typically de ﬁned in these patients. Genotype phenotype correlations of these muta tions are fairly well known. IVS2 mutation accompanies classic CAH. Here we report two patients with homozygote IVS2 mutations together with their family, who have dif ferent clinics. Materials and methods: Pedigree charts were drawn for two patients, with classic and non classic CAH. Addition to proband, siblings and parents were also ana lyzed. PCR/RFLP was performed for frequently identi ﬁed nine mutations. Subsequently, the diagnosis was con ﬁrmed by sequencing. Results Homozygote IVS2 mutation isdetermined in the proband who has nonclassic CAH. The same mutation was found to be homozygous in her brother and mother whereas it was heterozygous in her father, all ofthem without any symptoms. The second patient with ambiguous genitalia had homozygote IVS2 mutation. Her father got heterozygote mutation, as expected. However,there was no clinical symptom in her mother although she had homozygote IVS2 mutation Conclusion: Homozygote IVS2 mutation has a well known relation between pheno type and associated classic CAH. We described this muta  tion in patients with different clinical ﬁndings. When healthy members of these patients ’families were investi  gated, phenotypic effects of this homozygote mutation were proved to be more complex. It should be noted that genotype phenotype correlations of the CYP21A2 genemutations could not always be valid. N. Yurur Kutlay: None. S. Alt ıner: None.E",2017

Hewas born by spontaneous delivery to a healthy, non  consanguineous couple.His weight was 3250 gr at birth and given Vitamin D prophylaxis. At a physical examination, hewas 76 cm tall ( −3,13 SDS), weighed 10,3 kg ( −1,9 SDS) and head circumference was 47 cm ( −1,13 SDS). There was caput quadratum, genu varum and widened metaphyses ofthe wrists. His laboratory ﬁndings were; serum calcium (Ca ,8.1 mg/dl), phosphate levels (P ,3.37 mg/dl), serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP ,1383 U/L), magnesium (Mg ,2,12 mg/dl), parathyroid hormone (PTH ,787 pg/mL), serum 1,25(OH)2 D3 level was10 pg/mL. Radiological ﬁndings were; cupping and fraying of the metaphyseal regions of ulna radius and femur tibia. The patient was treated with calcium carbonate and calcitriol. When patient was 6 years old, his calcitriol dosage was 15 ng/kg/day andhe was 110 cm tall ( −1,04 SDS), weighed 19 kg ( −0,75 SDS).

 Unexpected results in an assay commonly used in cystic ﬁbrosis diagnostics: the role of DNA sequencing of the CFTR gene in atypical electrophoretograms,P03.11,"A. Holubova ´, L. Dvor ˇa´kova´, M. Schwarz, M. Macek Jr.,",M. D. Libik,"Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, 2nd Faculty of Medicine Charles University and Faculty Hospital Motol, Prague 5, Czech Republic Introduction: The Elucigene CF EU2Tmassay is being widely used for cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) diagnostics, carrier testing and CF newborn screening (NBS). In some instan  ces, interpretation of its results may be dif ﬁcult since this assay could also be affected by intra  CFTR insertions and/or deletions within ampli ﬁed target sequences or variants under proprietary primer annealing sites. Methods: Manufacturer recommended protocols for the Elucigene CF EU2Tmassay and the internal diagnostic database were used. Results: During the last decade we observed 6 atypical ﬁndings: 4 in CF NBS, one in an infertile male and in CF carrier testing each. All 4 neonates were heterozygous for the F508del mutation, carrier testing detected heterozygouspathogenic variant 3849 +10kbC > T, while in an infertile male no other variant was detected. Nonetheless, due to additional “suspicious ”observations in assay electro  phoretograms (e.g. absence of wild type peak in I507del, extra peaks in mixture B or normal height 3849 +10kbC > T wild type peak) we performed targeted Sanger DNAsequencing of the corresponding exons/introns. We found a second CFTR variant in 3 cases (G509D, 2789 +2insA, I132Cfs*26), including a non CF causing variant (F508C)and a variant of unknown signi ﬁcance (VUS) within carrier testing. Moreover, positive assay results in two infertile men were in ﬂuenced by cross reactivity with another CFTR variant. Conclusions: The utilised assay is highly reliable, but targeted DNA sequencing of the CFTR gene should be considered in instances when atypical electrophoretograms/ positive results are being observed.

 Targeted Next Generation Sequencing identi ﬁes two novel CFTR gene mutations in Iranian patients with Cystic Fibrosis,P03.12,"A. R. Bitaraf1, F. Bitarafan2, M. Khodaeian2,M .",Garshasbi1,"1Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of,2DeNA laboratory, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Cystic ﬁbrosis is an autosomal recessive genetic disorder that has been associated with mutations in theCFTR gene which encodes a 1480 amino acids protein is called Cystic ﬁbrosis transmembrane conductance reg  ulator. CF affects often the lungs, but also the intestine, kidneys, liver, and pancreas. CF outbreak has been descri  bed as the highest among the Caucasians (1 in 2500) andtwo thousand cystic ﬁbrosis causing mutations have been described to date. The Targeted Next Generation Sequen  cing (NGS) has been proved to be an effective strategy forthe detection of mutations in CF. Materials and methods: The target region capture with Nimblegen chip in the gene of interest, followed by NGS. Results: The mutationalanalysis of the CFTR gene was performed in total 18 families with at least a patient suspicious to CF. Two novel mutations (c.1544_1547delATAG and c.175_176delAG)and four previously reported mutations (c.1163 C > T, c.1000 C > T, c.1520_1522delTCT, c.3107 C > T) were identi ﬁed by NGS. Conclusions: Detection of two novel mutations among the eighteen families we studied, indi  cated that the pro ﬁle of CFTR mutations in the Iranian patients are different from the mutations found in the otherpopulations. Accordingly, the molecular analysis of more Iranian patients is necessary to ﬁnd further novel mutations speciﬁc for Iranian population. In addition, the results of the assessment demonstrated that the targeted NGS is enable to identify CFTR mutations with high accuracy and speed. Thus, the technology can be used for the clinical diagnosisof the other Mendelian diseases. A. R. Bitaraf: None. F. Bitarafan: None. M. Kho  daeian: None. M. Garshasbi: None. E",2017

CFTR  related disease may arise because of multiple combining effects, such as modi ﬁer genes, epigenetic and environ  mental factors and mutations in genes that affects CF phe notypes. The IVS8 5T allele is associated with less effective use of the intron 8 splice acceptor site compared with the 7 T and 9 T alleles and causes frequent skipping of exon 9.The genomic DNA sequences of 100 patients with positive results for IRT (immunoreactive trypsinogen) or sweat tests were ampli ﬁed by using the PARseq CFTR panel and sequenced using Ion Torrent S5 runs then analyzed with bioinformatic pipeline in routine diagnostic conditions and results are shown on the table. We obtained 100% coveragefor all the target regions. NGS results were con ﬁrmed by the sanger sequencing method. Our results showed that M470V polymorphism and 5 T may affect phenotypic severity inCF. Systematic screening for CFTR mutations should contain the IVS8 5T allele for correct results. M470V polymorphisms may play a role in the development of CF like disease and causes clinical variablity. In addition, we concluded that CFTR sequencing assay by the NGS based test has increased the sensitivity and reliability of the assaythan the traditional sanger sequencing.

Moreover, little is known about the mutations tosearch according to their geographical origin in SSA patients. This can make molecular diagnosis dif ﬁcult, especially when phenotypic presentation cannot be explored (no sweat test forexample), such as antenatal suspicion of CF due to fetal ultrasound digestive abnormalities. We report here the case of a consanguineous Senegalese couple. Their 1 stchild died at day one of life in a context of meconial peritonitis. Although fetopathological analysis revealed a digestive pattern compa  tible with CF, molecular analysis was not performed at thistime. Fifteen years later, another pregnancy showed at the 2 nd trimester the ultrasound triad associating hyperechogenicbowel, moderate loop dilation and non visualization of thegallbladder in the fetus. The novel heterozygous c.4230 C > A, p.(Cys1410*) nonsense mutation was identi ﬁed in both parents. This mutation should not elicit nonsense mediatedmRNA decay (NMD) and is predicted to delete the PDZ domain of the CFTR protein. The parents decided not to test their fetus through invasive procedure, and the diagnosis ofCF was con ﬁrmed at birth (meconial ileus, typical phenotype, homozygous mutation). This case (i) reinforces the need to perform extensive genetic analyses when the ultrasound triadis observed, (ii) pinpoints that the diagnosis of CF should be considered in SSA patients, and (iii) shows the importance of clinico biological discussion and genetic counseling.

We havefound heterozygous missense mutations of the ACTG2 gene in a proportion of patients with either CIPO or MMIHS (microcolon, megacystic intestinal hypoperistalsis syn drome), as well as a MYH11 variant in a patient showing MMIHS (unpublished), thus con ﬁrming genetic and clinical heterogeneity of the CIPO spectrum. Methods : Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) approach has been applied to two sporadic cases with clinical history of severe constipation and recurrent sub occlusions, andtheir parents. In addition, a three affected and one healthy children family and two affected sibs, all diagnosed with CIPO and with parents healthy and non consanguineous,have also undergone WES analysis. Results : To date, we have got results from two of the four families under study. No variant or mutant gene sharedby affected members of these two families was identi ﬁed. Segregating phenotypes must therefore be ascribed to dif  ferent genetic causes. Overall, segregation and possibleinvolvement of AHNAK2, BMP8B, FAM86B2 and LRRIQ1 genes are considered at the moment. Detailed results will be presented Discussion : CIPO includes heterogeneous disorders that are still very challenging in terms of diagnostic assessment, possible therapeutic interventions and genetic counselling.Finding genetic causes can be of great bene ﬁt to families and improve our understanding of the correct development of intestinal motility I.

Some patientsexperience paresthesias, carpopedal spasm, seizures and basal ganglia calci ﬁcations. HYPOC1 is caused by hetero  zygous activating (gain of function) mutations in the CASR gene, encoding the calcium sensing receptor (CaSR). The activating mutations result in increased sensitivity of para  thyroid and renal cells to calcium levels, leading to hypo calcemia being perceived as normal. Methods/patients: We describe a newborn, who presented with hypoparathyroid  ism, moderate hypocalcemia and hypercalciuria. Treatmentwith calcium and vitamin D supplementation was started. The infant ’s father and his paternal grandfather had similar laboratory ﬁndings and were also medically treated.

Curia, K.Smith, A. Gomez, A. Nolazco","Hospital Britanico de Buenos Aires, Buenos Aires, Argentina Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 (HH) is a common autosomal recessive disorder of iron metabolism. It is characterized by progressive iron overload and caused by mutation in the HFE gene on chromosome 6. The pre dominant feature of HH is excessive absorption of dietary iron and its deposition in parenchymal tissues and results in cirrhosis, diabetes, skin pigmentation, testicular failure,arthropathy and others. Prevalence is estimated at 1 in 200 to 1 in 2000. 32 HH patients (10 females and 22 males) and860106 healthy controls were screened for the Cys282Tyr, His63Asp and Ser65Cys mutation, using PCR RFLP tech  nique. All patients had the following parameters: iron stu  dies including serum Fe, ferritin and transferrin saturation, serology for hepatitis B and C, liver function tests and abdominal echography. The mean age at genotype diag nosis was 54.1 years in males and 53.2 years in females. 27 from 32 (84.4%) HH patients were homozygous for Cys 282Tyr mutation. Four (12.5%) were compound hetero zygous for Cys 282Tyr/His63Asp and one (3.1%) was for Cys282Tyr/Ser65Cys. Seven (6.6%) of our 106 controls were heterozygous for Cys282Tyr and two (1.8%) wereheterozygous for His63Asp. Hereditary hemochromatosis type 1 is an underdiagnosed disorder. The most frequent form is associated with homozygosity of the Cys282Tyrmutation.

The present study was designed to screen pathogenic genetic alterations in a cohortof IGHD children in Sri Lanka. Materials and Methods: Fifty ﬁve unrelated IGHD children negative for codon 72 (GHRHR ) mutation were screened for gross GH1 gene deletion by PCR RFLP technique. The coding, intronic and promoter regions of the GH1 gene (N ,53) were screened by direct sequencing in children who were negative forGH1 deletion. In a subset (N ,40), coding, ﬂanking intronic and promoter regions of the GHRHR gene were screened by SSCP/sequencing. Results: Eighteen childrenwere found to carry pathogenic and possibly pathogenic genetic alterations. Gross GH1 gene deletions (6.7 kb and7.0 kb) were observed in two children. Three pathogenic variants (CM012951, rs863223309 and rs11568828) and three possibly pathogenic variants (rs140576665, rs779374598 and rs41295043) of the GH1 gene and its promoter were observed in thirteen children. Three possibly pathogenic variants including one novel variant (Novel:c.211 G > T, rs201267804 and rs758281879) of GHRHR gene were observed in three children. The novel variant leads to an amino acid transition from hydrophobic Glycineto moderate Cysteine at codon 71. The pathogenic effect of the variant was predicted through in silico analysis tools available online.

Macaya Hospital Vall d ’Hebron, Barcelona, Spain Microcephaly with simpli ﬁed gyration, epilepsy and permanent neonatal diabetes syndrome (MEDS) is a recently described autosomal recessive inherited syndrome caused by mutations in the IER3IP1 gene. We report the case of an infant male who presented at ﬁve weeks of age with lethargy and severe ketoacidosis. He required ICU admission with dif ﬁcult management of persistent hyper  glycaemia requiring high doses of insulin with poor response. Clinical examination revealed microcephaly without other dysmorphic features. MRI showed micro cephaly with simpli ﬁed gyration. The particular association of neonatal diabetes with the characteristic microcephalic pattern prompted the diagnosis of microcephaly with sim pliﬁed gyral pattern, epilepsy and permanent neonatal dia  betes syndrome (MEDS). The diagnosis was con ﬁrmed by the detection of a homozygous c.233 T > C mutation in theIER3IP1 gene. This mutation has been previously described in three other MEDS cases of different geographic origins.

 Molecular diagnostics of MEN1 and MEN2 syndrome in Croatia,P03.25,"A. Merkler1, H. Ljubic1, T. Dusek1, D. Kastelan1,J .","Sertic1,2","1University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia, 2University of Zagreb School of Medicine, Zagreb, Croatia Introduction: Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an autosomal dominant syndrome caused bymutations in MEN1 gene. It is characterized by develop  ment of endocrine and non endocrine tumors (parathyroid tumors, pituitary tumors, gastrinomas, insulinomas, cuta neous tumors, etc.). Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 (MEN2) is a hereditary syndrome caused by mutations in RET proto oncogene. It is classi ﬁed in three autosomal dominant subtypes (MEN2A, MEN2B and FMTC) that involve high risk for development of medullary thyroid carcinoma. Materials and Methods: 11 samples of genomic DNA were analyzed for MEN1 and 19 samples for MEN2. Sequencing of MEN1 included the whole coding region, while for RET, only exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 were analyzed. For identi ﬁcation of mutations in the coding region of these genes, Applied Biosystems 3130xl Geneticanalyzer and BigDye ®Terminator v3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit were used. Results: In 3 patients with MEN1, heterozygous muta  tions were found (p.Arg415X; p.Lys120del; p.Gln393X). In 5 patients with MEN2, heterozygous mutations were found (p.Met918Thr; p.Cys620Arg; p.Asn777Ser). Mutation p.Cys620Arg was found in three out of ﬁve members of the same family. Conclusions: Molecular diagnostics of MEN2 is important because of the genotype phenotype correlations that can be used for risk prediction of aggressive medullary thyroid carcinoma. Contrary to that, MEN1 syndromeshows no genotype phenotype correlations, however molecular diagnostics of MEN1 is relevant for identi ﬁcation of at risk family members. A. Merkler: None. H.

Guney2","1Marmara University Pendik Training and Research Hos  pital, Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Marmara University School of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: MODY (maturity onset diabetes of the young) is a form of monogenic diabetes characterized by hyperglycemia with childhood or early adult onset. HNF1Aand GCK mutations are responsible for %50 of MODY cases. More rarely HNF1B mutations cause a clinically distinctive type of MODY (Type 5) presenting with uro genital abnormalities. HNF1B gene encodes a transcription factor important in kidney and pancreas development. Case Presentation: A 34 year old male patient was referred to ourdepartment because of diabetes mellitus who had com  pliants of polyuria and polydipsia for ten years. Despite insulin and oral antidiabetic treatments, his blood glucoselevels remained over 200 mg/dl. His mother and aunt also had diabetes. He was overweight (BMI:28). Biochemical evaluation revealed hyperglycemia, hypertriglyceridemia,high HbA1C, normal insuline and C Peptide levels. No urogenital abnormality was found in ultrasonographic eva  luation. Mutations in seven genes (HNF1A, GCK, INS,HNF4A, ABCC8, KCNJ11 and HNF1B) which are com  mon causes of MODY were screened via next generation sequencing. We found a novel heterozygous variant c.1484T > A (p.Met495Lys) in HNF1B gene. The mutation was also present in his mother having similar clinical and bio  chemical ﬁndings. In silico analyses of the variation indi  cated that it is a damaging mutation. Conclusion: We reported a novel heterozygous HNF1B mutation in two MODY patients with hypertriglyceridemia but withouturogenital abnormalities.

CFTR gene was studied in unrelated Russian CF patients with atypical form ofdisease. We performed the sequencing analysis to char  acterize mutations in CFTR (27 coding exons, splice site junctions of the CFTR ,5’ UTR region including DNase hypersensitivity site located at a distance −20,9 kb from start codon). The overall ef ﬁciency of the CF allele detec  tion after sequencing was 80%. The most frequent mutatedallele, delF508 , was identi ﬁed in 25% of CF chromosomes. One patient had a large deletion from 1 intron to 3 exon (CFTR21kbdel). One novel nonsynonymous mutation wasfound p.Lys1468Arg . We identi ﬁed 4 polymorphic variants with quite high frequency in group (470Met/Val, 4700T8/9, 1393 61A/G,  8G/C) . To analyze the potential involvement of polymorphic variants in the pathogenesis of CF we used the web tool “Human splicing ﬁnder”. It was showed that the polymorphism 2562 T/G can induce the alternativesplicing site of CFTR . We hypothesize that variations in CF severity can be associated with the combination of several polymorphic alleles of CFTR .

Mures, Romania, 2Nephrology Department, Pediatric Clinic No1, Cluj Napoca, Cluj Napoca, Romania,3Genetic Department,University of Medicine and Pharmacy Tg. Mures, Romania, Tg. Mures, Romania Background: Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is the most common glomerular pathological condition encountered in children. The role of NPHS2 R229Q gene polymorphism invarious renal disorders has been investigated. The rela  tionship of gene R229Q polymorphism (p.R229Q) of NPHS2 with adolescent  or adult onset steroid resistant NSin European and South American populations has already been reported. The reason for selecting this single nucleo  tide polymorphism of NPHS2 gene is that it may in ﬂuence susceptibility or clinical course of the disease. We under  took this research to study the genetic polymorphisms of NPHS2 R229Q in romanian children with NS, as well as itsassociation with patient ’s clinical response to steroid therapy. Material and method: This study was conducted on 67 nephrotic syndrome (INS) patients and 60 controls (without renal diseases and without proteinuria). The study groups consisted of 67% cases with steroid sensitive nephroticsyndrome (SNSS) and 25% cases with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) and 11% congenital NS (CNS) that is known to be steroid resistant. NPHS2 R229Q poly morphisms were determined by the polymerase chain reaction and RFLP technique utilizing speci ﬁc primers. Results: Mutation of NPHS2 R229Q gene was found in 6% of patients with NS, and in 17.64% of those with SRNS and 14.28% in CNS patients respectively. No mutation was found in control group. Conclusion: The current research con ﬁrmed the asso  ciation between NPHS2 R229Q gene polymorphism and lack of steroid responsiveness. NPHS2 R229Q gene muta tion was found just in patient with steroid resistance (CNS and SRNS). Further studies with a larger number of patients are needed. C. Duicu: None. C.O. Marginean: None. C.

Mal tese ADPKD patients reach ESRD at an early age, generally between 40 and 50 years. Materials and Methods: Blood and saliva samples were obtained from a family withADPKD. High throughput sequencing (HTS) was used to sequence the entire PKD1 and PKD2 coding regions extending up to 50 bp into the introns in each direction.SureSelect XTTarget Enrichment capture of a 2.6 Mb region, including PKD1 andPKD2 , was followed by sequencing on Illumina HiSeq4000. HTS data was mapped to GRCh37 aspaired end libraries using NextGENe software. A BED ﬁle was used to ensure mapping to PKD1 and PKD2 and excluding pseudogenes. To remove potential pseudogenecontamination of data, the mutation list was ﬁltered against an in house database of 90 control HTS datasets and by pairwise blast of PKD1 and relevant pseudogenes.

Hyperphagia, one of the main clinical features of Prader Willi Syndrom (PWS), is a life threatening symptom because it leads to morbid obesity and associated complications. Aim. To evaluate the eating behavior in PWS Romanian patients and to identify possiblepredictors for hyperphagia. Material and methods. The study included 11 PWS patients, 4 girls and 7 boys, mean age 25.37 ± 6.36 years for girls and 10.37 ± 6.77 years forboys, body mass index (BMI) 49.88 ± 4.95 kg/m 2and 29.18 ± 16.53 kg/m^2 respectively. We applied a hyper  phagia questionnaire with 11 items divided in 3 categories:Hyperphagic Behaviour (HB), Severity (HS) and Drive (HD). Results. HB represented 85.83% of quiz variance with a Cronbach ’s Alpha Coef ﬁcient 0.88. We did not identify statistical signi ﬁcant differences between males and females for each separate question. The mean of cumulated answers for females was signi ﬁcantly larger than males. We identify a linear correlation between HB and BMI (BMI , 9.51+2.25*HB) and also a linear correlation between BMI and age (BMI ,14.40+1.40*age). We could predict the BMI depending on age and HB (BMI ,0.9717*age + 1.4713*HB). Discussions. The questionnaire evaluated important PWS eating behavior features like food steeling,eating from trash and waking up at night to eat. In our study, each additional unit of HB or age will increase the BMI with 2.25 units and 1.40 respectively. Conclusions.The weight gain could be predicted using age and some important eating behavior features.

PH1 is themost common and severe form and it is caused by mutations in the AGXT gene. We report on a 2 year old South Indian male referred to our centre for a clinical suspicion of PH,based on nephrocalcinosis, poor weight gain, high 24 hour urinary oxalate level (75.7 mg/24 h) and normal renal function. A third degree consanguinity of the parents wasreported. One elder sister died at 9 years for end stage renal disease due to nephrocalcinosis. Molecular analysis of the AGXT gene revealed two mutations both in homozygosis(c.32 C > G, p.Pro11Arg; c.167 T > A, p.Ile56Asn). An incomplete major haplotype was identi ﬁed, due to mutation in Proline 11. In literature the p.Pro11Arg variant wasreported in vitro to reduce the normal AGT activity to < 2%. The p.Ile56Asn mutation produces an unstable enzyme with a reduced activity mainly on minor haplotype. This is theﬁrst case in which these two mutations are found on the same allele, which might be leading to a severe de ﬁciency of enzyme activity and a more severe phenotype. In vitrostudies of this double mutated allele could be useful to estimate the enzymatic activity of AGT and to understand how these two mutations could interact in a non minor/non major allele. Moreover, a double mutated AGXT allele advice a careful evaluation in carriers, since the identi ﬁca  tion of heterozygosity for two mutations could also lead to awrong diagnosis of PH in them. A.

Patients present low serum levels of urate associated with excessive urate urinary wasting, and somehave severe complications like exercise induced acute renal failure or nephrolitiasis. Two types of RHUC have been reported; RHUC1, comprising most cases, is caused bymutations in the SLC22A12 gene that encodes for the urate  anion exchanger URAT1, and RHUC2 is caused by muta  tions in SLC2A9 encoding urate hexose exchanger GLUT9. Only a few mutations have been detected in Europeans. Our goal was to identify mutations associated with RHUC in Spanish subjects. Materials and Methods: Fifteen patientspresenting the clinical features of RHUC were included. Genomic DNA was isolated from blood. Coding exons of the two genes were ampli ﬁed and analysed by PCR and automated sequencing. Results: Sequence analysis revealed mutations in each patient. Three SLC22A12 mutations, c.1245_1253delGGCAGGGCT (p.L415_G417del), c.1400C > T (p.467 M) and c.1427 C > A (p.A476D), and one SLC2A9 mutation, c.374 C > T (p.T125M) were identi ﬁed. Only two patients presented the SLC2A9 mutation. Mis  sense mutation p.A476D, affecting transmembrane domain 11 of URAT1, is a novel mutation associated with RHUC1. Conclusions: Our study describes the clinical and molecularcharacteristics of the ﬁrst Spanish RHUC patients. SLC22A12 andSLC2A9 mutation screening is an important evaluation for the diagnosis, and should be carried out inEuropean patients suspected to have the disease.

It has been detected in patients with a complex clinical picture comprising irregular body movements, polycythemia, and hepatic ﬁbrosis. About 20 patients have been documented so far. Here we present a child with early onset of the disease diagnosed after two decades of persistent symptoms. Materials and Methods: Patient was followed up by pediatricians, gastroenterohepatologists, hematologist,s and neurologists in the country and abroad without the precisediagnosis. Regular analyses of the blood counts, iron in the blood and liver enzymes, as well as MRI were performed. Results: The onset of the disease was at the age of 2 years with progressive dystonia binding him to a wheelchair at the age of 10. At the age of 8 polycytemia was detected and treated by phlebotomies. Hepatic enzymes wereincreased, and cirrhosis was diagnosed during the adoles  cence. Final diagnosis was reached at the age of 30 years when the analysis of manganese in the whole blood showedelevation(499nmol/L). MRI of the brain showed hyper  sygnal of the basal ganglia explaining neurological symp  toms. Molecular analysis con ﬁrmed homozygous SLC30A10 mutation. Oesophageal varices were treated during three hospitalizations thereafter. Manganese chela  tion with disodium calcum edeteate was planned accom panying oral iron supplementation which is expected to cause some regression of the liver disease, and improve  ment of dystonia. Conclusions: We report a very rare clinical syndrome due to the SLC30A10 mutation. Speci ﬁc therapy is avail  able and will be implemented. M. Kocova: None. E. Sukarova Angelovska: None. V.

HCH has not been commonly associated with neuro  logical problems. Some authors have reported increasedprevalence of mental de ﬁciency (up to in 9% of the patients). Patient: Our boy was admitted to the hospital at the age of 3 months with seizures, which were well con trolled by anti epileptic drugs. Magnetic resonance imaging showed temporal lobe dysgenesis. A clinical diagnosis of hypochondroplasia was hypothesized because of a dis proportionately short stature with relative macrocephaly. Molecular analysis of the FGFR3 gen, detected a c.1620C > G mutation, resulting in p.(Asn540Lys). Conclusions:Recently several more cases of HCH due to FGFR3 (N540K) mutations with temporal lobe dysgenesis, accompanied by epilepsy were reported.

" Incidence of mutations in the TNSALP ,GGPS1 and CYP1A1 genes in patients with atypical femur fractures",P04.07,"E. Gonzalez Roca1, P. Peris2, S. Rodriguez2,A .","Monegal2, N. Guan ˜abens2","1Immunology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain,2Rheu  matology, Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain Atypical femoral fractures(AFF) are uncommon and often related to prolonged bisphosphonate(BP) treatment. Isolated AFF cases are linked to mutations of Tissue  Nonspeci ﬁc Alkaline Phosphatase( TNSALP ), as a pre  sentation of hypophosphatasia in adults. Mutations in the geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate synthase( GGPPS ) enzyme which can be inhibited by BPs, and in the enzyme of thecytochrome P450 superfamily( CYP1A1 ), related to the metabolism of several drugs, have also been associated with some AFF cases. Our aim was to analyse the clinicalcharacteristics and incidence of TNSALP, GGPS1 and CYP1A1 gene mutations in AFF. Methods: 17 women with AFF(aged 68 ± 10 years) were included. Sanger sequencing for the TNSALP, GGPS1 and CYP1A1 genes was performed in all patients. We analysed the ALP substrates(vitamin B6 and PEA), bone turnovermarkers, bone mass, previous antiosteoporotic treatments and the clinical characteristics of the patients and their fractures. Results : 2/17 patients(12%) presented heterozygote mutations in TNSALP (p.G288A) and CYP1A1 (p.R136H), respectively. The patient with the TNSALP mutation pre  sented increased vitamin B6 and reduced serum ALP levels. The patient with the CYP1A1 mutation had glucocorticoid  induced osteoporosis treated with BPs during only 3 years.All patients received BPs(94% alendronate) for 74 ± 45 months, and nearly 50% also received glucocorticoids. AFF were bilateral in 35% of cases and 76% had previousfragility fractures. Conclusions: Mutations in the CYP1A1 orTNSALP gene may be related to the development of AFF in some patientsreceiving BPs.

The ladybird homeobox 1 (LBX1 ) gene is essential for the survival of somatosensory neurons in the dorsal spinal cord, thus alterations in LBX1 expression levels might play role in IS etiopathogenesis via somato sensory dysfunction. The purpose of our case control study was to investigate the association between a common var  iant, rs11190870 (T/C), downstream of LBX1 and IS in Bulgarian population. Materials and Methods: The association study was performed on 105 patients and 210 controls after obtainingwritten informed consent. The mean Cobb angle was 54.6° ± 22.7 and the mean age of the patients was 11.2 ± 3.1 years. The genotyping was carried out by TaqMan Real Time PCR method. The statistical analysis was performed by Pearson ’s Chi squared test and Fisher ’s Exact Test with p value less than 0.05 as statistically signi ﬁcant. Results: The frequencies of the T allele and the TT genotype in the total group of patients and in the subgroup of patients with Cobb angle above 40° were signi ﬁcantly higher than that in the controls (p < 0.05). In addition, this case control study revealed statistically signi ﬁcant associa  tion between rs11190870 (T/C) and IS in females, adoles cent idiopathic scoliosis (AIS), familial and sporadic IS cases. Conclusions: The results con ﬁrmed previously reported associations between the common variant near LBX1 and IS in Caucasian and Asian population groups and suggested that the molecular marker rs11190870 (T/C) is an inde pendent predisposing and modifying factor of IS in Bul  garian population.

Cytokines play fundamental roles in the pathogenesis of BD. Polymorphisms within cytokine genes have been found to play a pathogenic role in the develop ment of autoimmune/in ﬂammatory disorders. Interleukin 27 (IL 27), a new pro/anti in ﬂammatory cytokine, is a great candidate for chronic in ﬂammatory disease studies. The purpose of this study was to investigate a possible asso  ciation between polymorphisms in the IL 27 gene and susceptibility to BD. Materials and Methods: Fifty Iranianpatients with BD and one hundred healthy individuals were examined for rs153109A/G and rs181206T/C IL 27 gene single nucleotide polymorphisms using RFLP PCR andARMS PCR, respectively. Allele and genotype distribu  tions were compared between groups using chi square or Fisher ’s exact test. Results: Frequencies of the rs153109AA genotype and rs153109A allele were statistically higher in BD patients comparing with the control group (p ,0.034 and p,0.011, respectively). The genotype and allele fre  quencies of rs181206 T/C polymorphism in BD patients were not signi ﬁcantly different from those of healthy con  trols. Conclusions: Present ﬁndings demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that IL 27 gene rs153109 A/G SNP may be involved in susceptibility to BD in the Iranian population. R. Dehghanzadeh: None. Z. Babaloo: None.

" Two novel mutations of FBN1 in Jordanian patientswith Marfan syndrome Abujamous King Hussein Cancer Center, Amman, Jordan Introduction: Marfan syndrome is an autosomal domi nant inheritance disorder with a 1/5000 live birth870prevalence. More than 3000 mutations have been char acterized thus far in the FBN1 gene. The goal of this study is to facilitate Marfan syndrome diagnosis in Jordanian patients using a molecular genetic testing. Material and Methods: All of the 65 coding exons and ﬂanking intronic sequences of the FBN1 gene were ampli ﬁed using poly merase chain reaction and were subjected to sequencing in ﬁve unrelated Jordanian patients suspected of having Mar fan syndrome. Results: Four different mutations wereidenti ﬁed, including two novel mutations: the c.1553dupG frame shift (p.Tyr519Ilefs 14) and the c.6650 G > A (p. Cys2217Tyr) missense mutations. Two other missensemutations, c.2243 G > A (p.Cys748Tyr) and c.2432 G > A (p.Cys811Tyr), have been previously detected. One patient was heterozygous for the synonymous substitution variantc.1875T > C (p.Asn625Asn; rs#25458). Additionally, eight variants in the intronic sequence of the FBN1 gene were identi ﬁed, of which the c.2168 46 A > G mutation was a new variant. The data provide molecular based evidence linking Marfan syndrome to pathogenic mutations in the FBN1 gene among Jordanians for the ﬁrst time. Conclusion: we detected four FBN1 mutations in four Jordanian patients. Two of these mutations were previously identi ﬁed and two are reported for the ﬁrst time, one is de novo and the other is familial. These results will facilitate the molecular genetic diagnosis of MFS in Jordan and potentially prevent disease complications on the basis of molecular diagnosis. Abujamous: A.

Seven patients with MC HGA have beendescribed in the literature. In two patients mutations in IDH1 have been identi ﬁed (p.R132H and p.R132S) as apparent somatic mosaicism. We describe the case of a 5 year old boy who presents with MC HGA. He was born term after an uncomplicated pregnancy with a BW of 2630 grams. He was subsequently found to have congenital heartdefect. He required feeds by NGT. During the 1 styear of life he developed epilepsy, disproportionate short stature, leg length discrepancy and scoliosis. He also presentedwith developmental delay. A skeletal survey identi ﬁed signiﬁcant metaphyseal dysplasia with irregularity in mineralisation of expanded, cup shaped metaphyses withradiolucent non ossi ﬁed cartilage affecting knees, ankles, wrists, elbows, shoulders; the spine was normal. He suffers from pain and swelling in ﬁngers. A marked isolated increase in 2 hydroxyglutarate has been identi ﬁed. Genetic analysis identi ﬁed a p.R132H mutation in IDH1. There was no evidence of mosaicism. Thus, this is the 2 ndreport of MC HGA associated with the p.R132H mutation in IDH1 . In view of the genetic analysis result and the clinical pre  sentation, we believe that a high level mosaicism is pos sible, which we are planning on exploring further. < !  EndFragment   > A.

Case presentation: In the present study, we performed a targeted next generation sequencing panel to screen for 16genes in a patient with clinical symptoms of albinism from non albinism parents. This identi ﬁed one pathogenic mutation in the form of c.996 G > A (p.Met332Ile Het) andone novel missense mutation, c.902CC > G (p.Pro301Arg Het) on the TYR gene. The parents were tested for all of theexon and intron ﬂanking regions of the tyrgene by direct sequencing to validate the mutations. The father was a heterozygous carrier for c.996 G > A (p.Met332Ile), and the mother was a heterozygous carrier for c.902 C > G (p. Pro301Arg). Conclusion: The novel missense mutation c.902CC > G (p.Pro301Arg) on the tyrgene, was found on molecular genetic testing of this patient which in a compound heterozygous with another mutation causes a lack of the tyrosinase enzyme and disturbs the melaninbiosynthesis process.

 Sweet ’s syndrome in a patient with compound heterozygous mutations in the Mediterranean fever gene (MEFV),P04.18,"M. Michelson Kerman, C. Vinkler, D. Lev","Wolfson Medical Center, Holon, Israel","Sweet ’s syndrome (SS) is a rare disorder that often occurs in association with other systemic diseases.The dis  order is characterized by development of nonpruritic, painful erythematous plaques with pseudovesicles, pustulesand rare bullae. SS consists of a triad of erythematous plaques in ﬁltrated by neutrophils in association with fever and leukocytosis. The pathological features of SS involvethe dermis. The treatment of choice are systemic corticos  teroids.We present an unusual course of SS in a man who carries compound heterogous mutations in the MEFV gene.A 38 year old man from Sephardic Jewish ancestry, had suddenly developed fever, malaise, artralgia and painful erythematous plaques with pustules and bullae on the theupper extremities. Diagnostic evaluation included leucocy  tosis, elevated erythrocyte sedimentation and C reactiveprotein rate. The symptoms exacerbated despite treatment with systemic corticosterids. Mutational analysis of the MEFV gene revealed compound heterozygous M694V and V726A mutations. Clinical improvement appeared after administration of colchicine.Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease characterized byrecurrent attacks of fever with serosal in ﬂammation. The FMF gene (MEFV) encodes the protein pyrin that plays an important role in modulating the innate immune response.MEFV mutations have been identi ﬁed primarily in patients from Mediterranean populations Sweet ’s syndrome has been described in a patient with classical FMF as a possiblenew cutaneous feature and has never been described as a presenting sign of FMF.We suggest that SS skin lesions might be an only cutaneous presentation of FMF.

" association of sepsis after burn injury with snp s atTLR4 in mexican population c. A. colin, r. franco cendejas, h. cortes, n. leyva, j. J. magan ˜a aguirre national institute of rehabilitation, mexico city, Mexico Although the understanding of postsurgical pathophy siology has grown in recent years, we still can ’t accurately identify patients with burns who have an increased risk of infectious complications and death. This inexplicable var iation is probably in ﬂuenced by heritable factors. Poly morphisms affecting Toll like receptor (TLR) structure and function could be candidate variations associated with sepsis development, due to their essential coordinator rolein innate immunity. The present study examined the cor relation between 6 SNPs at the TLR4 locus and sepsis in 200 post burn patients with burns of 15 percent of totalbody surface and 200 subjects from a Mexican healthy general population. This was genotyped using the 5´exo nuclease assay. Then we classi ﬁed in two groups: a) sepsis; and b) non sepsis patients. Clinical data were prospectively collected and microbiological studies were performed for etiologic identi ﬁcation. We found that the rs2737190 polymorphism is associated with the presence of sepsis while the other 5 SNPs are not.

In Russia, most studies are targeted at hypertrophic and restrictive cardiomyopathy, with insuf ﬁcient data on ARVC. Materials and Methods: In this study we analyzed a cohort of 43 patients from 13 ARVC families. The diag  nosis was established according to the Task Force Criteriaof the European Society of Cardiology revised in 2010. The assay was performed on the MiSeq (Illumina, USA), panel TruSight Cardiomyopathy Target Genes. Coding regions of46 genes associated with the development of inherited cardiomyopathies, including genes PKP2, PLN, DSP, DSC2, DSG2, JUP, TMEM43, DES, TTN, LMNA associated with the development of the hereditary form of ARVC were sequenced. Results: At present 35 patients from 10 families are tested. Pathogenic mutations were con ﬁrmed in 1 family. We have found new frameshift mutation c.355delT in the PKP2 in the patient with a de ﬁnite diagnosis of ARVC. Subsequent family assessment showed that all threeof the proband ’s children also carried this mutation. Data of remaining 8 patients are processed. Current mutation detection rate was 1/10 (10%). Conclusions: The ﬁrst results of our work suggest that Russian ARVC population is notsimilar to same European populations. Mutation detection rate is signi ﬁcantly lower than expected. More compre  hensive gene panel or exome sequencing is needed to explore new variants and genes potentially involved in ARVC pathogenesis.

Lipid metabolism is determined by genes, which mutations can lead to modulation in enzyme activity with lipid pro ﬁle change consequently. This study was carried out to estimate the contribution of lipid metabolismgene variants related to the atherosclerotic status and their association with lipid indicators in Russian population. Materials and Methods . The study involved 124 people older than 55 years divided into 3 age  and sex matched groups according to the values of intima   media thickness. Lipid pro ﬁling was measured by homogeneous enzymatic colorimetric test. SNPs in ApoE (rs769452), APOC3 (rs5128), LIPC (rs2070895) and LPL (rs328) genes were detected by allele speci ﬁc real time polymerase chain reaction method using commercial kits. Results . The distributions of genotype and allele fre  quency between patients with atherosclerosis and the con trols were equal for ApoE, APOC3 and LPL genes polymorphism. Wildtype LIPC genotype was associated with increased risk of severe atherosclerosis development(OR,2,88; 95%CI 1,02   8,13). LIPC−250A genotype homozygote carriers showed decreased total cholesterol and low density lipoprotein levels. Heterozygous carriers ofLPL Ser447Ter polymorphism had lower atherogenic index then non carriers. Heterozygous carriers of ApoE Leu28Pro polymorphism had lower triglycerides blood level then non carriers. No associations between APOC3 genotypes and blood lipid levels were observed. Conclusion .

It is characterized by inappropriatemyocardial hypertrophy that occurs in the absence of an obvious inciting hypertrophy stimulus. The genetic basis of the disease include defects in several of the genes encodingfor the sarcomeric proteins, such as myosin heavy chain, actin, tropomyosin, and titin. With the advances of genomic technologies multiple mutations have been identi ﬁed, with genotype speci ﬁc risks for mortality and degree of hyper  trophy. Materials and methods: We have analysed 5 patients meeting criteria for familial hyperthrophic cardiomyopathyby using next generation sequencing of panel of genes connected to cardiac function. First, we ﬁltered the detected gene alleles based on their frequency according to theexisting data bases   ExAC_all, ExAC_NFE, 1000g_all, 1000g_eur. Then six variant prediction programs were used for estimation of non annotated genetic variants discoveredin the genes   ClinVar Effect, SIFT, Polyphen2 HDIV, Polyphen2 HVAR, MutationTaster, FATHMM.

 Application of comparative genomic hybridization in patients with syndromic congenital heart disease,P05.07,"O. Nagy1, K. Szakszon2, G. P. Szabo2, I. Balogh1,A .",Ujfalusi1,"1University of Debrecen, Division of Clinical Genetics, Debrecen, Hungary,2University of Debrecen, Department of Pediatrics, Debrecen, Hungary Introduction: Congenital heart disease (CHD) is the most common birth defect and is a major cause of infant morbidity and mortality. The genetic background of syn  dromic CHD is very heterogenous, chromosomal aneu ploidy, Mendelian disorder and DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are responsible for the phenotype. The objective of our study was to evaluate the usefulness ofwhole genome array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) for detection of submicroscopic chromosomal aberrations in syndromic CHD cases, and to explore therelationship between the CNVs and CHD. Materials and Methods: We used Cytoscan 750 K oligonucleotid array (Affymetrix) to study 7 patients with mild to severe CHDphenotype and multiple congenital anomalies. The identi  ﬁed CNVs were con ﬁrmed by ﬂuorescence in situ hybri  dization and G banding. Results: Clinically signi ﬁcant copy number variations were found in 4/7 cases with size ranging from 1.36 Mb to 34.58 Mb. Two patients had CNVs asso  ciated with known syndromes: 8p23.1 microduplication andCri du chat syndrome. Two cases presented rare genomic aberrations: unbalanced subtelomeric translocation t(4;6) (q33;q25) causing partial deletion of 4q34.3 and duplicationof 6q25.1; microdeletion of 12q24.1. These genomic imbalances contain genes that has been associated with human CHD before. Conclusions: Array CGH has led to anincreased detection of causal chromosomal imbalances in individuals with syndromic CHD. The results emphasize the growing importance of using genome wide studies inpatients with CHD to increase the number of genomic data associated with CHD and improve the CNV phenotype correlations.

 Functional evaluation of the interaction between cigarette smoking and the coronary artery disease risk gene ADAMTS 7 inDrosophila melanogaster,P05.09,"A. Bhandari1,2,3, M. Munz1,2,3,4, J. Erdmann1,2,3","1Institute for Cardiogenetics, University of Luebeck, Lue","beck, Germany,2DZHK (German Research Centre for Cardiovascular Research), Hamburg/Luebeck/Kiel, Ger  many,3University Heart Center Luebeck, Luebeck, Ger  many,4Institute of Dental, Oral and Maxillary Medicine, CC 03, Charité –University Medicine Berlin, Berlin, Germany Coronary artery disease (CAD) is a complex disease resulting from an interplay of lifestyle and genetic causes whereby cigarette smoking has been shown to be one of thestrongest lifestyle risk factors. Previously, CAD genome  wide association studies (GWAS) have proven that gene  smoking interactions are partly mediated by ADAMTS 7 ,a CAD risk gene . Particularly, the allelic variation at rs7178051 that associates with reduced ADAMTS 7 expression conferred stronger CAD protection in“never smokers ”compared to “ever smokers ”. The loss of CAD protection in smokers is likely due to the induction of ADAMTS 7 expression in the vasculature by cigarettesmoking. ADAMTS 7 is a member of the “A disintegrin and metalloproteinase with thrombospondin motifs ” (ADAMTS) family , which plays a crucial role in neoin  tima formation and vessel stenosis . Thus, a detailed understanding of the ADAMTS 7 CAD risk gene is of sig  niﬁcant importance. We studied previously smoking exposure in Drosophila . Interestingly, our RNA seq ana  lysis results revealed high expression of the ADAMTS 7 homolog in the tracheas of smoke exposed ﬂies, indicating that it might play an important role in this gene smoking interaction. The fruit ﬂy consists of a primitive vascular system in comparison to other invertebrate models andthe molecular mechanisms that regulate the formation of the tracheal tube seem to be similar to those involved shaping the vascular tube in mammals . Therefore our main objective is to unravel the physiological role and function of ADAMTS 7 inDrosophila melanogaster and speciﬁcally to understand the interconnection between cigarette smoking and the CAD risk variants at the ADAMTS 7 risk locus observed in humans.

 Distribution of Common TP53 and MDM2 Variants Among Down Syndrome Patients with Cardiac Abnormalities,P05.10,"A. Toylu1, B. Nur2, O. Altiok Clark1, E. Mihci2","1Akdeniz University, Department of Medical Genetics,","Antalya, Turkey,2Akdeniz University, Division of Pediatric Genetics, Antalya, Turkey Introduction: Cardiac abnormalities are common in people with Down syndrome (DS), Trisomy 21, and are mostly responsible for DS morbidity and mortality. The genetic mechanism of cardiac involvement has not fullyunderstood but genes located in both chromosome 21 and other chromosomal regions are continuing to be investi  gated. To understand whether TP53 gene, which is involvedin cardiac development, has a role in clinical presentation of DS, nucleotide variants associated with TP53 functions were investigated in this study. TP53 gene codon 72 Arg >Pro variant is commonly associated with TP53 protein functions. The MDM2 protein, which involved in TP53 protein degradation, is also reported to be regulated by thenucleotide variant within its ﬁrst intron. In this study, allele distributions of these variants were assessed in DS patients with cardiac abnormalities. Materials and Methods: DS patients with or without cardiac involvement and control subjects without cardiac abnormalities were included in this study. TP53 gene p.Arg72Pro (c.C215G) variant and MDM2 gene c.14 +309 T > G variant was determined with melting analysis of hybridization probes. Results: The Pro allele frequency of TP53 gene was about 0.58 in controls and DS ( ) cardiac abnormalities. However, DS patients with cardiac abnormalities werehaving high frequency (0.66) of Pro allele. For MDM2 gene, controls and DS ( +) cardiac anomalies were dis  played similar frequency, but G allele was high (0.60)among DS ( ) cardiac abnormalities. Conclusion: The results are implying that the nucleotide variants regulating TP53 protein activities may be involvedin DS clinical presentation associated with cardiac abnormalities. A. Toylu: None.

" Genetic variation in DSP gene in patient with ARVC/ D and prolongation of QT interval s. saber, S. Dalili, A. Fazelifar, M. Haghjoo, A. Alizadeh Diz, Z. Emkanjoo Cardiac Electrophysiology Research Center, Rajaie Cardi ovascular Medical and Research Center, Iran U, Tehran,Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: TheDSP gene encodes a protein which is called desmoplakin. This protein is an important component of desmosome structure in cardiomyocytes. Mutations in DSP gene, as one of known genes are responsible to Arrhythmogenic Right Ventricular Cardiomyopathy/Dys plasia (ARVC/D) and pattern of inheritance is autosomal dominant. ARVC/D has a wide spectrum of clinical mani festations. Patients with ARVC/D often have arrhythmias which can increase the risk of sudden cardiac arrest. Materials, methods and results (Case report): 20 year oldwomen, hospitalized at our center with a history of recurrent fainting attacks. Result of blood test was normal. History of sudden death under 45 year old was positive in her family.QT interval prolongation ( > 500 msec) was calculated in electrocardiogram. Echocardiography was done and Right ventricular out ﬂow tract (RVOT) enlargement was detected. All responsible genes for ARVC/D and LQT syndrome were studied by Next Generation Sequencing (Hiseq Illumina platform) to con ﬁrm dual diagnosis. Only a reported variation (p.R1775I) was found in DSP gene and it is located in Rod domain of protein (Bauce et al, 2005). Bioinformatics tools have predicted that mentioned varia tion was deleterious. This nucleotide change was not detected in 100 ethnically matched healthy control subjects. Evidence of pathogenicity of p.R1775I has not been knownyet and it is reported as uncertain signi ﬁcance. Conclusions: Overlapping characteristics of prolongation QT interval (LQT syndrome) and ARVC/D are described in this studyand are related to DSP gene.

There are four major forms of cardiomyopathies according to the phenotype: hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM),restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) and arrythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC). We developed a new next generation sequencing (NGS) panel as a diagnosis toolfor genetic cardiomyopathies, using the TruSeq Custom Amplicon Low Input technology (Illumina). This panel includes the most common gene coding for cardiac sarco meric proteins ( MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNI3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, ACTC1 andCSRP3 ). We also included other genes known to cause cardiac phenotype: GLA, TTR and LMNA . After preparation of the library, the target regions were ampli ﬁed and sequenced on a Miseq MDsequencer (Illumina). Bioinformatics analyses were performed usingMiseq Reporter, SeqNext (JSI Medical Systems) and Smaug (home made pipeline). All mutations and variants of unknown signi ﬁcance (VUS) were con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. A total of 91 DNA from patients with different forms of cardiomyopathies were analyzed. The coverage of all target regions was satisfactory for all patients. A total of45 probably pathogenic mutations were identi ﬁed including 2 novel mutations. This method allowed molecular diag  nosis in 40% of patients. 72.5% of causative mutations werelocated in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins vs27.5% in non sarcomeric. Although sarcomeric genes are frequently involved in hereditary cardiomyopathies, the clinical andparaclinical context should encourage in some cases to explore non sarcomeric genes. This emphasizes the need of sustained clinico biological discussions to orientate thegenetic investigations in these patients. C. Mekki: None. C. Vasseur: None. R. Bhouri: None. T. Gaillon: None. V.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a primary, genetic cardiomyopathy resulting in enlargement of part of themyocardium. Materials and methods: We report on 4 years old girl with sporadic form of asymmetric obstructive HCM withoutheart failure. Diagnosis was con ﬁrmed by catheterization when hemodynamically signi ﬁcant gradient from 25 to 80 mm was measured in the left ventricular out ﬂow tract (LVOT) during sinus rhythm with change in pressure after extrasystole drop in aortic pressure and rise in gradient to 100 mm (positive for Brockenbrought Braunwald sign).Targeted NGS of 176 genes using TruSight Cardio gene panel (Illumina) was performed on DNA from the index patient. Results were validated by Sanger sequencing andsegregation analysis in the affected family was performed. Results: Two novel variants were detected in genes CACNA1C (p.Arg514Gly) and SCN5A (p.Arg800His), both heterozygous, connecting the clinical symptoms to digenic inheritance. Calcium channels that contain the alpha1C subunit play role in coupling the excitation and contractionin the heart. SCN5A codes the alpha subunit that mediates the permeability of the cell membranes for sodium ions regulated by levels of calcium. Each parent is found to beheterozygous carrier of only one of the variants. No other known pathological variants associated to HCM were found. Conclusions: Although most familial cardiomyopathies are monogenic disorders, this study underlined digenic inheritance of HMC associated with novel variants, clearlyindicating that due to diversity of the phenotype many genes remain to be identi ﬁed.S.

 Prevalence of dilated cardiomyopathy in theRussian patients with Marfan Syndrome,P05.18,"V. Rumyantseva1, U. Rogozhina1, A. Bukaeva1,E .","Charchyan1, E. Zaklyazminskaya1,2","1Petrovsky Russian Research Centre of Surgery RAMS, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction . Usually dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) in patients with Marfan syndrome (MFS) is explained by volume overloading due to aortic or mitral valve regur gitation, and progressive aortic root dilatation. Recent stu  dies of J.R.Cook et al. “Abnormal muscle mechanosignaling triggers cardiomyopathy in mice withMarfan syndrome ”have shown that ﬁbrillin 1, a structural component of the architectural ECM, is a force transmitting molecule protecting the mammalian heart againstcardiomyopathy. Materials and methods . We have performed clinical (Standard and 24 hours Holter ECG, EchoCG, Dopplero graphy, chest radiography) and genealogical examination of the 40 probands with MFS, 6 of them were children. All probands had met the Ghent ’s criteria for MFS. Affected relatives were found in 13 families. Mutational screening in theFBN1 gene was performed by PGM Ion Torrent fol  lowed capillary Sanger sequencing. Results . We had detected 30 mutations in the FBN1 gene in 31 (77,5%) index cases. Cardiomegaly was found in 30 (88%) adult probands and in 2 out of 6 children. All heartchambers enlargement, increased end diastolic volume of the LV and reduced ejection fraction were found in 15 (37,5%) index cases. Conclusion . The prevalence of DCM is very high in probands with MFS. The in ﬂuence of this complication for the long term prognosis in this clinical group might beunderestimated. We suggest that mutations in the FBN1 gene may play a direct causative role in cardiac remodeling in MFS patients. This work was supported by grant RNF № 16 15 10421 V. Rumyantseva: None. U.

The objective ofthe present study was to examine the expression of the miRNAs, miR 208b and miR 499, in AMI patients and to investigate whether these miRNAs could be useful bio markers for AMI. Methods: AMI patients (n ,50) and healthy controls (n ,50) were retrospectively recruited for a comparison of their plasma miR 208b and miR 499expression levels using TaqMan ®MicroRNA assays. Results: Our results indicate that both miR 208b and miR  499 levels were signi ﬁcantly overexpressed in AMI patients compared to controls. The miR 208b and miR 499 levels in plasma were increased by 256 fold and 675 fold, respec  tively.

We have genotyped mtDNA in several groups of patientswith coronary and carotid atherosclerosis, including group of patients with early cardiovascular death (age below 55 years), as well as common population sample, and healthypeople older than 68 years with no signs of atherosclerosis. Chi square statistics was used to compare mtDNA hap  logroups frequencies between the groups, and the differ ences with p < 0.05 were taken as signi ﬁcant. We found that mitochondrial haplogroup H1 (with population frequency 11.5%) had been more abundant in the patients with earlycardiovascular death (21.3%), and with recurrent cardio  vascular events during one year follow up after infarction (20%). On the contrary, haplogroup J had higher frequencyamong healthy elder people (17.7%) comparative to the patients with atherosclerosis (4.6%) and common popula  tion (6%).

Weaimed to assess the utility of clinical exome(CE) NGS (TruSight ONE; Illumina on HisSeq2500) in a representa  tive cohort of Czech patients with clinical diagnosis of longQT , catecholaminergic polymorhic ventricular tachycardia  (CPVT) and Brugada (BS) syndromes. Material and Methods : A total of 28 cases (22/28 LQT, 3/28 CPVT and 3/28 BS) were studied. All patients and their families had undergone clinical genetic counselling, and 1st degree relatives were referred to cardiologicexamination. ACMG.net variant pathogenicity classi ﬁcation was used. Results : In the LQT cohort the detection rate was 73% (16/22). Highly likely pathogenic variation (PV) was found inKCNH2 andKCNQ1 , in 5/22 cases, while 2/22 patients had PV in SCNA5A andRYR2 each Most of the PV was of missense type (Classes 4 –5). One case had PV in KCNJ2 and 2 patients in RYR2 . Interestingly, no PV was found in Brugada syndrome. All CPVT patients carried missenseRYR2 PV, classes 4 –5. Class III cases are still being clini  cally examined to verify their clinical phenotype. Conclusions : We report a high detection rate of PV (classes IV V) in patients suffering from LQT  (73%) and CPVT  (100%) syndromes. Although the scope of PV in CE NGS is adequate for the detection of PV in “channel disorders ”, it fails to detect PV in other genes related to cardiological disorders.

Andrikovics1","1Hungarian National Blood Transfusion Service, Budapest, Hungary,2Medical Centre, Hungarian Defence Forces, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is an autosomal dominantly inherited disorder, caused by reduced activity of the enzyme hydroxymethylbilane synthase (HMBS, also known as porphobilinogen deaminase), aspeciﬁc enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. Among diverse clinical manifestations, the most relevant features are life threatening acute neurovisceral attacks with severeabdominal pain. Mutations of HMBS gene are in the background of clinical symptoms. Detection of mutations can con ﬁrm the diagnosis of AIP in situations where clinical data are inconclusive, and prevent at risk relatives from acute attacks. Materials and methods: In the present study, we investigated 31 unrelated Hungarian families with AIP,using Sanger sequencing method. Results: Missense muta  tions were detected in 15/31 (48%) of investigated families. Beside them, 1/31 (3%) nonsense, 3/31 (10%) splice site, 9/31 (30%) frameshift mutations were identi ﬁed, while in three cases (10%) we could not ﬁnd any alterations in the HMBS gene with Sanger sequencing. We observed sixpreviously unpublished mutations. A previously not described small insertion (p.Ser75Lysfs*8; c.224insA; g.9354insA) were present in three, and a known missensemutation (p.Gly111Arg; c.331 G > A; g.9871 G > A) in 12/ 31 (38%) unrelated families. Conclusions: Similar ﬁndings of a single recurrent disease causing mutation in Swedishand Argentinian population were already published. Inter  estingly, p.Gly111Arg mutation was also common (12/26Abstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 885patients, 46%) in Argentina. Our ﬁndings further support the theory that founder mutations might be in the back  ground of AIP, but  according to the high prevalence of a mutation in two distant populations  also suggest, that there might be some mutational hot spot regions in the HMBS gene.

CTX is caused by mutations in the CYP27A1 gene that lead to the defect of the enzyme, but also toaccumulate cholesterol and cholestanol in lipophilic tissues. Chronic infantile diarrhea probably the earliest clinical ﬁnding, bilateral juvenile cataracts secondary, preceding xanthomas in the tendons and progressive neurological disorder constitute the broad clinical spectrum of CTX. Here we present four patients from two unrelated familieswith mutation of the CYP27A1 gene (homozygous c. C808T; p.R270X and homozygous c.C1333T; p.Q445X, respectively). The age range of all patients was from 5 yearsold to 17. At ﬁrst family, two patients had chronic infantile diarrhea, bilateral cataract and mild intellectual disability. MRI ﬁndings showed cerebellar atrophy and T2 hyper  intensity at dentate nucleus. In the other family, patients had chronic infantile diarrhea and mildy mental retardation but no xanthoma and cataract. Besides their MRIs were normalat initial examination. Only dysmorphic ﬁnding was coarse hair. Chenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment provided signiﬁcantly neurological improvement in all speci ﬁcally mild cases.

Combined oxidative phosphorylation de ﬁciency 1 (COXPD1) leading to early fatal progressive hepatoencephalopathy is caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutation in the gene encoding the mitochondrial elongation factor G1(GFM1). Materials and Methods: We report a newborn boy with clinical presentation of severe treatment resistant metabolic acidosis and encephalopathy from the ﬁrst hours of life leading to dead in early neonatal age. The infant was born at term from 4 thpregnancy (three successful previous pregnancies) of healthy parents, with ultrasound ﬁndings of hydronephrosis two weeks before birth. From 18thhour after birth the newborn was in deterioration with impaired consciousness and hypotonia, severe metabolic acidosis,hypoglycemia and signi ﬁcantly elevated plasma lactate levels. The tests of urine organic acids by GC/MS and blood aminoacids and acylcarnitines by MS/MS revealed gen eralized aminoacidemia (the highest deviation from the normal range seen in alanine), massive lactic aciduria, severe ketonuria, elevated excretion of 3 hydroxydicarboxylic acids and elevated branched chain amino acids. Targeted next generation sequencing using TruSight Inherited Disease panel (Illumina) was performed.Results: Two variants in heterozygous state were found in the GFM1 gene: a known pathogenic   c.748 C > T (p.

The clinical phenotype of the disease is classi ﬁed as classic (saltwasting and simple virilizing forms) and as non classic. The severity of the disease is described to be often corre lated with the enzymatic activity. Genetic testing con ﬁrms the disease and is crucial for familial studies. The aim of this work is to do clinical and molecular characterization ofthe cohort of subjects observed at the Hospital Pediatrico de Coimbra (Portugal) with the clinical suspect of CAH. CYP21A2 gene analysis was performed in 77 unrelated Portuguese patients (50 female, 27 males) with clinical and endocrinological suspicion of CAH, using direct CYP21A2 sequencing and multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁcation (MLPA) analysis. CYP21A2 mutations were iden tiﬁed in 71/77 (92%) of patients.

Severely affected CF patients with positive sweat test were referred for CFTR targetted exome sequencing. Methods: 125 potential CF patients have been sequenced using IonPGM sequencing technology and analyzed with Ion Reporter software.Genetic variants in CFTR gene known to cause CF were ﬁltered. Clinically important variants were checked and conﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Disease targeted CFTR exome analysis exposed (likely) pathogenic variants in 27.2% (n:34) of all cases. This study led to the identi ﬁ  cation of 26 different CFTR gene mutations, including 19 missense, 2 nonsense, 2 frameshift, and 3 splice site mutations. Of these, one was a novel missense variation at exon 17 A (p.Glu1044Gly; 3131 A > G) and the mostcommon ones were p.Leu997Phe, c.2789 +5 G > A, and p.

Mitochondrial respiratory chain (MRC) alteration can contribute to their development. Our objective is to analyze possible association between MRCgenes and these diseases. Materials and methods: 3731 subjects from 3 Spanish population based studies (Hortega, Pizarra and Segovia)were studied. 48 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of chromosomal genes of the MRC were genotyped. The signiﬁcantly associated genes with Obesity and DMT2 were sequenced in a part of the sample. Identi ﬁed SNPs with different allelic frequency between cases and controls were genotyped at the whole population. Results: Signi ﬁcant associations with DMT2 and obe  sity, were observed with SDHB, SDHD, NDUFS5 andNDUFS1 genes in the studied sample. The sequencing studies identi ﬁed over 170 polymorphisms in promoter and exonic regions (including intronic boundaries), and only 9 had different proportion between cases and controls. We have analyzed these polymorphisms in order to know if they could be responsible for the previously found associations.2 of these polymorphisms were associated with T2D and glycemia, and 3 with obesity and BMI. We haven´t seen any clearly functional polymorphism responsible for theseassociations, although in silico analysis indicate possible effects of these SNPs in splicing. Conclusions: Some genes codifying MRC can be involved in BMI, obesity and DMT2, although functional studies must be performed to elucidate alterations involved and their functional effect.

 Novel mutations of the ETFDH gene in three Italianfamilies with lipids storage myopathy,P06.10,"S. Missaglia1, D. Tavian1, C. Angelini2","1Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Milan, Italy,","2Fondazione IRCSS S. Camillo, Venice, Italy Multiple acyl CoA dehydrogenase de ﬁciency (MADD; MIM# 231680) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder oftencharacterized by lipid storage myopathy (LMS). In most MADD patients the disease is caused by mutations in the ETFDH gene (MIM # 231675), encoding the ETF dehy drogenase. Patients are mainly affected by recurrent epi  sodes of lethargy, vomiting, hypoglycemia, metabolic acidosis and hepatomegaly, often preceded by a metabolicstress. Sometimes, muscle involvement, myalgia, weakness, and LSM occur. MADD results in large excretion of glu  taric, lactic, ethylmalonic, butyric, isobutyric, 2 methylbutyric and isovaleric acids; indeed the disease is also known as “glutaric aciduria type II ”. To our best knowledge, 136 different ETFDH mutations have beendescribed in about four hundred MADD patients. Here we report the clinical and genetic ﬁndings of three Italian888families with four affected members. In our patients we identi ﬁed three novel ETFDH missense mutations (p. L138F, p.T151A and p.L550P), whereas the remaining three (p.A187V, p.W343R and p.D511N) have already been reported. Our patients had a juvenile/adult onset form with generalized muscle weakness, low muscle carnitine, andlipid storage in muscle. A variable decrease of OX PHOS complexes documented mitochondrial involvement. Muscle ultrastructural analysis showed massive increase of intra cytoplasmic lipid droplets, which were usually localized nearby mitochondria and were found decreased after ribo  ﬂavin supplementation. Although the diagnosis of multiple acyl Coenzyme A dehydrogenase de ﬁciency in adult life is difﬁcult, it is rewarding because of the possibility of treating patients with carnitine or ribo ﬂavin with full recovery.

 Marked reduction in the excretion of ethylmalonicacid following liver transplantation in a patient with ethylmalonic encephalopathy,P06.11,"G. Rice, A. Kuhl, A. Dalessandro, L. Fernandez, J. Scott",Schowerer,"University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, United States Ethylmalonic encephalopathy is a rare autosomal reces  sive disorder due to mutations in the gene ETHE1 which encodes for a mitochondrial matrix protein involved inmetabolism hydrogen sul ﬁde and thiosulfate. The condition often presents in infancy with hypotonia, seizures, petechiae and acrocyanosis. Death usually occurs in early childhood.The biochemical ﬁndings of the disorder are largely sec  ondary to the inhibition of cytochrome c oxidase and short chain fatty acid oxidation by hydrogen sul ﬁde leading to the accumulation of lactic and ethylmalonic acids respectfully. Treatment has been largely supportive, however, treatment with oral metronidazole and N acetylcsyteine has shownsome promise (Viscomi, 2010). Recently, a single case report of a successfully liver transplant in a patient with ethylmalonic encephalopathy was published (Dionisi Vici,2016) giving hope that the condition may be amendable to transplantation. Here we present a second case of successful liver transplantation in an infant with ethylmalonic ence phalopathy including; the clinical presentation andcharacteristic biochemical ﬁndings. Following transplanta  tion there was 10 fold reduction in urinary ethylmalonic acid excretion. We present data of pre and post transplant metabolite excretion and postulate that the reduction in circulating metabolites is a surrogate marker for improved hydrogen sul ﬁde detoxi ﬁcation. G.

 exome sequencing detected the splice site mutationin the SERAC1 gene,P06.12,A. Sedaghat,"Jondishapour University, AHWAZ, Iran, Islamic Republic","of Exome sequencing has been and will be increasingly utilized in genetic determinants of various inherited dis eases. In the present study we applied exome sequencing to a patient with symptoms including; brain atrophy, deafness, vomiting, jaundice, cholestasis, respiratory problems, motordelay, seizure, mental retardation, scoliosis, growth retar  dation, spasticity, muscle weakness & dysphagia. At result we found an insertion (chr6, 158571484, C > CCATG) inSERAC1 gene with homozygous genotype in the patient and heterozygous genotype in her unaffected parents (rs797045105). Mutations of SERAC1 cause of 3  methylglutaconic aciduria with deafness, encephalopathy, and Leigh like (MEGDEL) syndrome. Notably bioinfor  matics analysis using mutation taster (prob > 0.99) andDDIGin (prob ,86.51) showed this mutation is diseases causing. This variant had been reported in Clinvar database as likely pathogenic variant. The variant location is in theboundary of exon 4 and intron 4 –5. Interestingly Sanger sequencing of SERAC1 cDNA con ﬁrmed the insertion of nucleotides in the spliced transcripts of the gene so it ispredicted to be pathogenic due to the production a frame shift, Gly89fs. SERAC1 encodes for a protein with a serine  lipase domain. This variation disrupts the potential ofSREAC1 mRNAs for coding this domain. These ﬁndings emphasize a signi ﬁcant of role of exome sequencing application as genetic test to identify and characterize thecomprehensive spectrum of genetic variation and classi ﬁ  cation for the patients with metabolic disorders.

Molecular causes of the disease are mutations in the gene GLA, which encodes the enzyme α galactosidase ( α Gal A). The clinical picture is highly heterogeneous in terms of symptom presentation and severity. The diagnosis of Fabry disease should be con  sidered in males and females with the signs of periodiccrises of burning pain in hands and feet (acroparesthesias), cutaneous lesions of blood vessels (angiokeratomas), abnormalities of sweating capability (most often hypohi drosis), opacities of chornea and lens, early onset stroke, left ventricular hypertrophy or renal insuf ﬁciency of unknown etiology. Considering late onset variants of thedisease prevalence is estimated as 1 in 3.000. Here we present a family with clinical presentation of Fabry disease in several individuals. GLA sequence analysis of the female index patient suffering from cardiac symptoms revealed the novel 4 bp deletion c.848_851delAGAT in heterozygous state. This variant is predicted to result in a frameshiftleading to termination of protein synthesis 33 amino acids downstream of the variant and truncating the original pro  tein length by 107 residues. The same variant was detectedin the brother and the son of the index patient, both also being clinically and biochemically affected. To our knowledge, the detected mutation in the GLA gene has not been described before.

In some cases theserum total bilirubin (STB) levels exceed the 95 thpercentile for hour of life (hyperbilirubinemia). Severe neonatal hyperbilirubinemia (NH) could lead to kernicterus andresult in neonatal death. G6PD g enetic variations have been reported to be associated with NH. This study aims to identify G6PD variants involved in the development of NH in the Indonesian population. We collected blood and DNA samples consecutively from 115 and 116 healthy term  neonates with and without hyperbilirubinemia. G6PDactivity assay was measured with Randox method and NADP/NADPH ratio was measured using abcam kit. All exons and UTRs regions of G6PD gene were deep sequenced using MiSeq Illumina. For statistical analyses, chi squares test was used and p value p < 0,05 was con  sidered as signi ﬁcant.

Hurler syndrome is one of the autosomal recessive inborn errors of metabolism with the incidence of1:100000 in every live birth. Patients show different symptoms like cloudy cornea, scoliosis, hearing impair  ment, facial anomalies, Joint stiffness, liver and splenome galy. This syndrome is caused by mutations in α L  iduronidase (IDUA) gene which is located on 4p16.3 and has 15 exons encoding Iduronate Sulfatase.In this study weinvestigate IDUA gene mutation in 7 affected Iranian Families using short tandem repeat (STR) markers and Sanger sequencing. Material and methods :In the present study, mutations in IDUA gene were analyzed in a total of 7 Iranian families referred to Kawsar Human Genetic Research Center. Informed consent forms were obtainedand DNA extraction was performed using salting out pro  cedure. Haplotype analyses were done using STR markers. These 7 families showed segregation of the disease with theIDUA gene. Subsequently all exons and introns boundaries of the IDUA gene were sequenced by Sanger sequencing. Potential pathogenicity of the novel variants were evaluatedby on line soft wares such as Fathmm, Polyphen 2, Hope. Results: We identi ﬁed 3 missense mutations which 2 of them were novel. The mentioned soft wares all revealed thatthe novel mutations could be pathogenic ones.

The classical form is characterized by progressive neurological degeneration, connective tissue defects, tortuosity of blood vessels, abnormal kinky hair and is lethal in early childhood. More than 300 mutations havebeen reported in the ATP7A gene, but only 23 mutations are partial gene duplications. We report the ﬁrst Czech patient with Menkes disease and duplication of several exons of theATP7A gene. Methods: The ATP7A gene was initially screened for mutations by Sanger sequencing of all coding exons and ﬂanking intronic regions. The copy number analysis was performed by MLPA using P104 SALSA MLPA probemix (MRC Holland, NL). cDNA was prepared from RNA extracted from patient ’s blood and duplicated region was ampli ﬁed using primers ﬂanking the suspected duplication. PCR product was sequenced by Sanger method. Results: MLPA revealed a hemizygous ATP7A duplication comprising exons 5 to 10 and the duplication was con ﬁrmed by cDNA analysis. The same duplication was subsequently observed in a heterozygous state inpatient ’s asymptomatic mother. She was offered prenatal genetic testing and the duplication was identi ﬁed in a hemizygous state in chorionic villi sample.

Meta  bolic parameters according to the four genotype  combinations showed no statistically signi ﬁcant differ  ences in either group, though a worsening trend could benoted. In conclusion, common variant association of the presumably interdependent key regulators PPARGC1A and MTHFR involved in short  and long term gene expressioncontrol could associate with supplemental metabolic pro ﬁle impairment. Joint effects need to be addressed by ﬁnding adequate approaches to study gene interactions, in particularfor rs8192678/rs1801133, motivated by allele frequency, role in early development of adult onset diseases and modiﬁable nature of deleterious effect by lifestyle interventions.

The clinical/ biochemical ﬁndings in some inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are often non  speciﬁc; an early differential diagnosis made in a single urinary sample it gives an important advantage. We present the spectrum of metabolites of urine from two patients with methylmalonic acidurias [a classical form for a newbornwith a severe lethal acidosis, and the second child (3 years  old boy) having an intermittent form, presenting a hemo  phagocytic syndrome, being ﬁrst interpreted as a myelo  proliferative disease]. The fast results gave by urinary NMR spectrum (Bruker Avance 400 MHz Spectrometer) showing a high concentration of methylmalonic acid indi cates the MMA diagnosis. Beside this, we present our results and the utility of this method for rapid diagnosis and follow up in a ketolysis defect (with very high 3 hydroxybutiric aciduria) identi ﬁed in a 4 years old girl with two acute episodes of hypoglycemia during fasting due to intercurrent viral infections. The level of excretion of themetabolites in these three IEM has been well within the range of NMR detection. In the critical care setting, IEM that were not diagnosed through the neonatal screeningshould be considered as cause of acute neurologic, hepatic/ renal decline, rapid diagnosis being essential.

Unique quantitative genetics of the maternallyinherited mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) and major clinical consequences of even a subtle bioenergetic alterations are outlining their very complex etiology. Unsurprisingly, sincemitochondrial dysfunction and/or complex I de ﬁciency has been implicated in pathogenesis of Parkinson ’s disease (PD), consistent with their functional importance, certainmtDNA haplogroups and SNPs have been correlated with predisposition to various metabolic and degenerative dis  eases, cancers, and longevity. Not only mitochondrialfunction might be perturbed by mtDNA variation, either by recent deleterious mutations or ancient polymorphisms (haplogroups), also accommodation of somatic mutationsand mtDNA copy number per cell are crucial as well. In order to shed more light on the role of inherited mtDNA variation in PD and epilepsy we have analyzed mtDNAvariability in Slovak PD (228) and epilepsy (107) patients and control group from Slovak population (759). We found evidence for signi ﬁcant association of mtDNA haplogroup T1 with increased risk for PD and haplogroup I with increased risk for epilepsy. However, no or weak associa  tion have been found for major mtDNA lineages or pre viously described risk modifying lineages.

The incidence of this disease is > 1 in 5000 live births; in the pediatric population, about 25% ofmitochondrial disorders are due to abnormalities in mtDNA, whereas the rest are due to defects in nDNA. [Materials & Methods] Our team used comprehensive genomic analysisto diagnose 149 patients (Kohda et al. PLOS Gen 2016). Of those patients, eight families (nine cases), with children who were diagnosed with mitochondrial disease caused byautosomal recessive mutations, requested prenatal diag  nosis. After genetic counselling, six families (seven cases) decided to undergo prenatal diagnosis, of which fourpatients underwent chorionic villus sampling and three underwent amniotic ﬂuid sampling. As contamination was suspected in one case who had undergone chorionic villussampling, we performed additional amniotic ﬂuid sampling. Two cases miscarried. [Results] Four cases diagnosed as heterozygotes continued the pregnancy and delivered heal thy babies. Two cases were diagnosed as compound het  erozygotes and hemizygotes, and their families chose induced abortion. [Conclusions] Severe phenotypes ofmitochondrial disorders are prevalent, particularly in theneonatal and infantile periods.

The disease is mainly caused by mutationseither in the BCKDHA, BCKDHB, DBT or DLD genes encoding components of the E1 α,E 1β, E2 and E3 subunits of branched chain α keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDC), respectively. BCKDC is a mitochondrial enzyme which is responsible for the normal breakdown of BCAA. The rate of consanguineous marriage in Iran is38.6%, so the prevalence of autosomal recessive disorders is higher in comparison to other countries. Consanguinity increases the chance of the presence of pathogenic muta tions in a homoallelic state. This phenomenon has made homozygosity mapping a powerful tool for ﬁnding the probable causative gene in heterogeneous disorders likeIEM (Inborn Errors of Metabolism). In this study, two sets of multiplex polymorphic STR (Short Tandem Repeat) markers linked to the above mentioned genes were selectedto identify the probable pathogenic gene. Families who showed a homozygous haplotype for the STR markers of the BCKDHB gene were subsequently sequenced. Fournovel mutations including c.633 +1 G > A, c.988 G > A, c.833_834insCAC, and a homozygous deletion of wholeexon 3 c.

Scott Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman Introduction: Inborn errors of metabolism (IEM) are a rare cause of non immune hydrops fetalis (NIHF) and sel  dom investigated for during routine diagnostic work up. Considering the preference for consanguinity and increasedincidence of autosomal recessive disorders in Oman, IEM may be contributing to a signi ﬁcant proportion of cases with NIHF. The purpose of this study was to calculate the inci dence of NIHF in the Arab Omani population and to evaluate the diagnostic yield of a locally developed protocol to identify the etiology of NIHF in affected pregnancies.Methods Following systematic implementation of a locally modiﬁed diagnostic approach including molecular genetic testing and metabolic work up of lysosomal storage dis orders, a retrospective review was carried out to calculate the incidence of NIHF, and to assess the diagnostic yield of the protocol. Results An etiological diagnosis was estab lished in 9 of 12 cases of NIHF (75%). The majority of cases (7/9) were caused by IEM which included a novel homozygous variant in the AARS2 gene (5/7). The inci  dence of NIHF in our series was 1 in 270. Conclusion Incidence of NIHF is markedly increased as compared to published studies. IEM contribute to NIHF with a frequencyof 58% as compared to the previously reported incidence of 1–18.5%. The AARS2 variant accounts for a signi ﬁcant number of cases of NIHF in Oman. Z.

Methods: This is a preliminary case control study including a group of 73 morbidly obese adults (mean age 39year old), recruited from endocrinology service at General Hospital Valencia (Spain), between May 2016 and January 2017. A total of 138 normal weight adults as control groupwere also included. Genotyping was performed from whole blood samples by allelic discrimination Taqman assay. A multivariate analysis using logistic regression and adjustedby age and sex was used. Results: The SEC16B rs3748792 polymorphism was nominally associated with body mass index (BMI) (p , 0.007), weight (p ,0.009) and body fat (p ,5.0 × 10 −5). Nominal association was also found for the ETV5 rs7634510 with BMI (p ,0.04) and weight (p ,0.04), and for the FTO rs17817449 polymorphism with BMI (p , 0.03) and weight (p ,0.04). Statistically signi ﬁcant pre dictor of obesity was also found for these 3 polymorphisms(p < 0.05). For the other 3 polymorphisms ( SH2B1 rs8055982, TFAP2B rs760900 and FTO rs9921255) no signiﬁcant differences were observed.

PKU frequency in Iran has been esti mated to be about one per 5000 live births.Untreated patients show different levels of mental and physical retardation, so early diagnosis is very crucial in patientmanagement. PAH encodes phenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme which converts phenylalanine to tyrosine, the essential neurotransmitter precursor. Any malfunction maylead to disease state. This study aimed to identify the cau  sative mutations in PKU patients referred to Dr.Zeinalis Medical Genetics laboratory for mutation detection. Fol lowing DNA extraction, mutation screening of PAH gen was performed using direct sequencing of all exons and exon intron boundaries of the gene. Different types ofmutations were identi ﬁed which include novel splice site mutations. The mutations were including two cases with c.169 1 G > A in intron 2, four cases c.510  1 G > A inintron 5, two c.970 1 G > T in intron 9 and two c.1066 2 A > G in intron10. Heterozygosity of the identi ﬁed variants was con ﬁrmed in the parents. Any changes in invariant GT AT sequence in donor and acceptor splicing sites always will disturb recognition splice site by spliceosome. This phenomenon leads to skipping an exon or retaining intronicsequence in mature mRNA in most cases. The Human Splicing Finder website, con ﬁrmed their crucial effect of these changes on the ﬁnal splicing of the protein; thesealterations may lead to the enzyme dysfunction.

An electroencephalography showed a normal background pattern, multifocal epilepti  form activity and no electroencephalographic seizures.EEG’s in follow deteriorated and will be reported. Devel  opment is very delayed. Facial dysmorphism will be shown. An MRI at the age of 13 month showed normal anatomyand normal myelination. MR spectroscopy was normal as well. Metabolic testing in bloed and urine was normal as well as ﬂow cytometry. We report 2 years of follow up in her: she developed West syndrome and later localised epi  lepsy. Vitamin B6 (pyridoxine) has been reported to be beneﬁcial in some GPI de ﬁcient patients; apart from B6 she has mulit antiepileptic treatment. Family: the ﬁrst daughter had benigne West syndrome and develops normal. The maternal sister died from epilepsy. Whole exome sequen cing (targeted gene panels for Intellectual Disability and epilepsy) revealed compound heterozygous PIGN (phos  phatidylinositol glycan class N, OMIM: 606097) variants; apaternally inhertited p.Arg785His substitution and a maternally inherited p.Tyr249Cys substitution PIGN is one of the genes involved in the glycosylphosphatidylinositol(GPI) anchor biosynthesis and remodeling pathway.

It is de ﬁned as an intermediate metabolic state characterized by impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) andfasting glucose, thus increasing the risk of developing type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM). However, only 50% of indi  viduals with IGT progress to diabetes over their lifetime andit is still unknown whether previously identi ﬁed diabetes risk genes can also determine risk for prediabetes. Several genetic studies associate polymorphisms in transcriptionfactor 7 like2 gene (TCF7L2) with T2DM in adults, but its role for the development of prediabetes is still unclear. The aim of our study is to test if risk genotypes TC and TT ofrs7903146 are more common in obese adults (BMI > 25) with increased homeostasis model assessment insulin resistance index (HOMA IR) compared to obese controlswith normal HOMA IR. Analysis was done on a total of 218 patients, 122 of them with impaired HOMA IR. DNA samples were analyzed by PCR   direct sequencing. Gen otype and allelic distributions in patients presenting increased HOMA IR (TT: 13%, CT: 38%, CC: 49%) and in patients with normal HOMA IR (TT: 7%, CT: 47%, CC:46%) provided small, but no signi ﬁcant difference (p > 0.5) between the two groups due to the higher percentage of TT homozygous in the group with increased HOMA IR index.Our conclusion is that TCF7L2 could be one of multiple susceptibility genes for the development of impaired glu  cose tolerance and prediabetes in obese adults.

Genetic and non genetic factors have been found to be associated with RPL. A few studies have been performed to ﬁnd the association between RPL and mitochondria. The identi ﬁcation of the genetic var  iants that confer risk for RPL is essential for the detection of individuals at high risk. This study investigated theassociation of variations of D loop with RPL. 24 cases and 110 female controls from Fars ethnicity were selected. Fallowing gDNA extraction from blood, Genotyping wereperformed using direct sequ encing of HV1&HV2 regions. Results were analyzed using SPSS. The comparison of allele and genotype frequencies between cases and con trols by Chi square test revealed the T, C and C variants confer risk for the studied individual in C16069T (P  value < 0), T16362C (P value < 0.003) and T195C(P value < 0.009) variants respectively. Our analysis showed C variant (T16519C, and T152C) has protective role and can reduce the risk of RPL (P  value < 0.001, P value <0.01 respectively) Our ﬁndings is consistent with a report from the study of the three variants (T16519C, T152C and T195C) studied by Seyyed Hassani et al. According to thehigh mutation rate in D loop and a regulatory role in this region, it seems that mutations in this region can disrupt cell survival.

Severe Primary TMAuria has been classi ﬁed as the percentage of unmeta  bolized free TMA in urine being > 40% and mild/moderate TMAuria  range: 10 –39%. More than 30 variants of the Flavin monooxygenase 3 ( FMO3) gene have been reported to cause Primary TMAuria. FMO3 mutation analysis is often requested for family genetic counselling. We per  formed gene sequencing of the entire FMO3 gene coding region for 6 Irish adult probands (Group A) with con ﬁrmed moderate to severe TMAuria (% TMA range 27 –45) and for 3 adults with mild TMAuria (%TMA range 18 –20) (Group B) that presented to the Irish adult metabolic centre over the lastﬁve years. We identi ﬁedFMO3 causative (loss of function) mutations in only 2/6 probands in Group A withno other FMO3 common polymorphisms detected. One individual was compound heterozygous for the common mutation p.(Pro153Leu), c.458 C > T and a presumed novelmutation p.(Gly228Ser), c.682 G > A and the second pro  band was compound heterozygous also for p.(Pro153Leu) and another presumed novel mutation p.(Asp232Tyr),c.695 G > T.Two of the 3 individuals in Group B were homozygous for the FMO3 common variant haplotype p. [(Glu158Lys;Glu308Gly)]. These results suggest that severeTMAuria is rare in Ireland and that FMO3 mutation analysis may not be clinically indicated (and should not replace standard biochemical testing), unless there is a severe bio chemical phenotype (free TMA urine levels > 40%).

The aim of this study was to explore whetherthe T241M polymorphic variant of XRRC3 gene is asso  ciated with an increased susceptibility to type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) and diabetic nephropathy (DN) in Turkishpopulation. Materials and Methods: The study population included 238 unrelated subjects residing in İstanbul, Tur  key; 116 had type 2 diabetes mellitus, 50 had diabeticnephropathy and 72 had normal glucose metabolism. Polymerase chain reaction based restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) was used to determine thedistribution of genotypes and frequency of alleles of T241M polymorphism of the XRCC3 gene (rs861539). Results: There is no statistically signi ﬁcant association between T241M polymorphism of XRRC3 gene and T2DM or DN (OR 0.121, CI 0.89 –2.73 and OR 0.588 CI 0.43 –1.67, respectively). The multiple logistic regression revealed thatbeing male (p < 0.05), older than 45 years of age (p < 0.001), BMI ≥25(p < 0.001), family history(p < 0.001) had a signi ﬁcant impact on T2DM patients and also being male (p < 0.001) older than 65 years of age (p < 0.05) had a signiﬁcant effect on DN development. Conclusions: The results of this study suggests that T241M polymorphicvariant of XRRC3 gene is not associated with an increased susceptibility to T2DM and DN in the studied population. T.

 Violence impacts allostatic load IgE and Epstein Barr Virus levels in urban youth,P07.02,"L. F. Jackson1, M. Shestov2, F. Saadatmand1, J. Wright1","1Howard University, Washington, DC, United States,","2University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States Allostatic load is the cumulative wear and tear experi  enced by the immune system in response to chronic envir  onmental stressors. Many studies have observed increasedallostatic load in African American populations in com  parison to their European American counterparts. A key environmental stressor in the lives of young AfricanAmericans is the occurrence of violence. This violence has impacts not only in terms of criminal justice interventions, but also on the physical and mental health of AfricanAmerican communities. Understanding how the experience of violence contributes to allostatic load is a critical step in parsing and ultimately reducing its effect on at risk youngadults. Previous work has shown that there are gender effects to the experience of violence and to cortisol con  centration variation. Urban study participants (N ,557, women ,274, men ,283) were queried about their experience of community, interpersonal and intimate part  ner violence as well as assessed on key indicators of mentalhealth state. We include ﬁve stress biomarkers typed in study participants: C reactive protein, IgG, IgE, IgA, IgM and Epstein Barr Virus Viral Capsid Antigen (EBVVCA).Weﬁnd that familial violence is most correlated to elevated IgE levels (R ,0.37) and EBVVCA is strongly correlated to perceived anxiety with their local environment (R , 0.87). Naïve Bayes implemented machine learning reveals that‘ability to cope ’responses predict elevated stress bio  marker levels and allostatic load index values. These ﬁnd  ings suggest that the internalization of violence may be more important that the actual experience of violence in predicting elevated stress biomarker levels. L.F. Jackson: None. M.

 ( ) NOR and (aa) Aurora Borealis two novel deletions causing alpha thalassemia found in Norwegian patients,P07.03,"R. M. Grimholt1, B. Fjeld1, A. P. Piehler2,O .",Klingenberg1,"1Oslo University Hospital, Oslo, Norway,2Bioscienta Institute for Medical Diagnostics GmbH, Ingelheim, Germany Introduction: Alpha thalassemia is one of the most common monogenic diseases worldwide and is caused by reduced or absent synthesis of alpha globin chains, mostcommonly due to deletions of one or more of the alpha  globin genes. Sequence variants that alter gene expression or deletions involving upstream regulatory elements are lessfrequent. Alpha thalassemia occurs with high frequency in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. For people of Northern European origin, inherited hemoglobin disorders,such as alpha thalassemia, are extremely rare. Here, we describe two novel deletions causing alpha thalassemia found in patients of Norwegian origin. Materials andMethods: The study patients were diagnosed during routine hemoglobinopathy evaluation carried out at the Department of Medical Biochemistry, Oslo University Hospital, Nor way. The patients were selected for their thalassemic phe  notype, despite Norway as country of origin. All samples went through standard hemoglobinopathy evaluation.Quantitative real time PCR copy number variation (CNV) analysis was applied to detect uncommon deletions in the alpha globin gene cluster. Deletion breakpoints were char acterized using gap PCR and DNA sequencing. Results: Two novel deletions, (  )NOR and ( αα)Aurora Borealis, were identi ﬁed in altogether nine patients from two and one families, respectively, all of Norwegian origin presenting with microcytosis. The (  )NOR deletion was a result of homologous recombination deleting both alpha globingenes. The ( αα)Aurora Borealis deletion caused alpha  thalassemia by affecting the upstream regulatory element, HS 40, leaving the alpha globin genes intact. Conclusions:Even though inherited hemoglobin disorders are extremely rare in indigenous Northern Europeans, the possibility of a carrier state should not be ignored. R.M. Grimholt: None. B.

Tobetter characterize the mechanisms leading to potentially lethal events, analysis of global transcriptional changes in peripheral blood samples during anaphylactic reaction wasperformed. RNAseq based whole transcriptome character  ization of total RNA from whole blood samples of 15 patients with anaphylactic reaction was performed in threedifferent time points: at the presentation with anaphylaxis at the emergency department, 7 days and 1 month after the anaphylactic episode. Extensive characterization of differ ential gene expression, cell speci ﬁc transcriptional altera  tions, analysis of alternative splicing patterns, and functional characterization of detected alterations was per formed. Whole transcriptome expression analysis revealed striking alterations of gene expression during acute ana  phylaxis in comparison to 7 days and 1 month after theepisode.

Primary APS (PAPS) is isolated, while secondary form (SAPS) is part ofother autoimmune disorders. APS has multifactor etiology with complex interplay between genetic, immune and environmental factors. We focused our investigation to themembers of interleukin 23 (IL 23)   interleukin 17 (IL 17) axis, with the aim to analyze selected polymorphisms in genes IL 17, IL 23, TGF  β, ROR γTandFOXP3 , and to investigate correlation of genotype with corresponding cytokines ’level and with clinical phenotype in APS. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We have analyzed 50patients with PAPS, 50 patients with SAPS, and group of healthy controls from Serbia. The SNPs rs2275913 ( IL  17A), rs763780 ( IL 17F ), rs11209026 ( IL 23 ), rs9826 (ROR γt) and rs3761548 ( FOXP3 ) were genotyped by Taq  Man allelic discrimination assays, while rs1800471 ( TGF  β) was analyzed by allele speci ﬁc PCR. Serum concentra  tions of IL 17, IL 23 and TGF ß were measured by ELISA method. RESULTS AND CONCLUSION: No statistically signiﬁcant differences were observed in the distribution of genotypes and alleles of the analyzed polymorphisms in patients with PAPS and SAPS compared to the healthy subjects. The levels of IL 17, IL 23 and TGF ß were sig niﬁcantly higher in PAPS and SAPS patients than in the control group, but without correlations to the genotype. Considering clinical phenotype, majority of analyzedpolymorphisms showed correlation with vascular manifes  tations of both PAPS and SAPS, while fetal loss in SAPS was associated with the T allele of ROR γT polymorphism.

Mechnikov North Western Medical University, St Petersburg, Russian FederationIntroduction: Systemic auto in ﬂammatory disorders (SAIDs) represent a heterogeneous group of diseases. Monogenic germ line defects contribute to substantial share of SAID morbidity, however de ﬁnite genetic diagnosis of SAIDs remains complicated due to scarcity of disease  speciﬁc phenotypes and high number of genes to be ana  lyzed. Materials and methods: 18 Russian patients with non  classical clinical course of autoin ﬂammatory disease, who were negative for mutations in the most common SAIDgenes (whole coding sequences of MVK, NLRP3, TNFRSF1A and exon10 of MEFV), were subjected to multigene analysis. NGS panel was composed of 302immune related genes, including 23 genes known to be associated with SAIDs. Results: Highly penetrant mutations in SAID genes were identi ﬁed in 3 patients. In addition, 10 patients carried rare variants of unknown signi ﬁcance or low penetrant pathogenic mutations in MEFV, NLRP12, NOD2, LPIN2 and other genes. Patients carrying low penetrant mutations had milder disease course and usually did not require biologics, while those with highly penetrant mutations had more severe course and needed anti IL 1treatment. Conclusions: Targeted NGS is a valuable approach to genetic testing in SAIDs. Presence of low  penetrant mutations and their combinations may contributeto some cases of non classical (undifferentiated) SAID.

Gene expressionanalyses have been used to analyze candidate genes in biopsies of the duodenum, the target tissue of CD, or whole transcriptome in peripheral blood cells. However, all thetranscriptomic changes that happen in the different cellular fractions involved in CD remain unclear.RNA Seq wasused to analyze the transcriptome of complete biopsies from 4 CD and 4 controls; epithelial cell enriched fraction from 10 CD and 12 controls; and immune cell enriched fraction from 7 CD and 5 controls. Then, in each kind of cell, dif  ferential expression analyses were carried out using Cuf  ﬂinks, Deseq2 and edgeR. A gene was considered as differentially expressed if at least two methods detected differential expression.In complete biopsies 1057 genes were differentially expressed; 935 in epithelial fraction; and566 in immune fraction. Enrichment analyses showed that in the epithelial fraction the interferon signalling pathways were overexpressed and in the immune fraction the che mokine receptor pathway, while genes related to pathways such as cell cycle and transmembrane transport were only detected in complete biopsies.Although the enrichmentanalyses showed the usual pathways related to CD, we were able to distinguish in what fraction were changed. Thus, the analysis of each fraction is useful to clarify the role of thegenes and the underlying mechanisms involved in CD; and to improve the subsequent functional experiments. K.

 Cell free DNA from plasma and serum differ in relative content of telomeric sequences and ininimmune response activation,P07.12,"A. Zinkova1, I. Brynychova2, M. Korabecna1","1Department of Biology and Medical Genetics, First Faculty","of Medicine, Charles University and General Faculty Hos pital in Prague, Prague 2, Czech Republic, 2Department of Anthropology and Human Genetics, Faculty of Science, Charles university, Prague 2, Czech Republic Introduction: Despite its practical exploitation (e. g. in non invasive prenatal diagnostics), the biological meaningof cell free DNA (cfDNA) in circulation is not understood. CfDNA is able to bind to toll like receptor 9 (TLR9) and to contribute to immune response tunning. Telomericsequences are able to block TLR9. Methods: We stimulated THP1 cells by plasma and serum samples of young healthy volunteers. For stimulatory experiments, 7 pairs of plasmaand serum samples were used. For each sample the content of telomeric sequences was determined using qPCR in the form of T/S (telomere/single copy gene) ratios. A half ofvolume of every sample was treated by DNase. Using qPCR, we detected the alterations in TNF  αmRNA levels908before and after stimulation of THP1 cells by DNase treated and non treated samples. Results: DNase treatment of plasma and serum samples led to signi ﬁcant enhancement of their stimulatory activity (p ,0.018 and p ,0.028, respectively). Signi ﬁcant differences were observed between non treated plasma and serum samples (p , 0.018). DNase non treated serum samples stimulated the relative TNF  αexpression in higher extent than non treated plasma samples. Conclusion: The content of telomericsequences in plasma and serum may represent one of multiple factors contributing to the ﬁne tuning of immune response by cfDNA. Funding: grants no.

Copy number variations (CNVs) can contribute to the variability of the risk for complex diseases. The purpose of this study was to investigate the role of rare CNVs in SLE. GenomicDNA from 23 unrelated SLE patients and 110 healthy subjects was submitted to the genome wide human Cytos  can HD array to screen for DNA gains and losses. Detectionof CNVs was performed using Chromosome Analysis Suite 3.0 and Plink v.1.9 software. Unique CNVs in SLE cohort in comparison with those identi ﬁed in healthy controls were selected for evaluation of the population frequency using data from the Database of Genomic Variants andHapMap project. After ﬁltering for unique CNVs with population frequency < 1%, in silico evaluation of genes overlapped by the CNVs was performed to select likely pathogenic rarevariants. These CNVs were submitted to validation using droplet digital PCR as a target speci ﬁc methodology to conﬁrm results obtained from the array.

Zeinali","Dr Zeinali human genetics laboratory, Tehran, Iran, Islamic","Republic of Factor v de ﬁciency is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with 1 per 1000000 live birth. This coagulation disorder is caused by mutations in F5 gene. The Levels of Fv antigenand its coagulant activity determine the clinical manifesta  tion which ranges from mild to severe. The most common symptoms of the disease include bleeding from mocusalsurfaces and postoperative hemorrhages. Three Iranian families with 3 patients with severe bleeding symptoms were referred to Dr.Zeinali medical genetic laboratory forconﬁrmation of the clinical diagnosis and carrier detection for other family members. Direct sequencing of the F5 gene exons and intron exon boundaries was performed to iden tify pathogenic mutation in affected individuals. Three different mutations were identi ﬁed. Two of these mutations were ﬁrst reported in Iran and one of them was a novel missense mutation. Heterozygosity of the identi ﬁed muta  tions was con ﬁrmed in the parents and was not present in healthy members of the family. There is no exact report onthe number of patients in Iran. It seems that due to increased rate of consanguineous marriage, and autosomal recessive inheritance of the disease, it is expected to have highernumber of patients in comparison to western countries.

The caspase 1 depen  dent cytokine, IL 1 β, plays an important role in FMF pathogenesis, and RAC1 protein has been recently involved in IL 1 βsecretion. This study aims to investigate RAC1 expression and role in IL 1 βand caspase 1 production and oxidative stress generation in FMF. The study included 25 FMF patients (9 of them during attack and remission), and25 controls. RAC1 expression levels were analyzed by real  time PCR. Ex vivo production of caspase 1, IL 1 β, IL 6 and markers of oxidative stress (MDA, catalase and glutathionesystem) were evaluated respectively in supernatants of patients ’and controls ’PBMC and PMN cultures, in the presence and absence of RAC1 inhibitor. RAC1 gene was overexpressed in patients in crises compared to those in remission or controls. Caspase 1 levels were higher in LPS  induced PBMCs of patients than controls. Spontaneous andLPS induced IL 1 βproduction was comparable in patients and controls, whereas LPS induced IL 6 production was enhanced in patients, compared to controls. However,inhibition of RAC1 resulted in a decrease in caspase 1 and IL 1 βlevels, but not IL 6. LPS stimulated PMNs produced higher MDA levels in patients than controls, but these levelswere decreased in the presence of RAC1 inhibitor. The reduced catalase and GSH activities in unstimulated culture supernatants of patients compared to controls wereincreased in the presence of RAC1 inhibitor. Our results show the implication of RAC1 in the in ﬂammatory process of FMF by enhancing IL 1 βproduction, through caspase 1 activation, and generating oxidative stress, even during asymptomatic periods.J.

 Investigation of the effect of colchicine on endoplasmic reticulum stress in FMF patients,P07.23,"T. Cora, N. Kocak, B. Eser Cavdartepe, H. A.","Zainalbden, S. Nergiz","Selçuk University, Selçuklu Medical Faculty,The Depart  ment of Medical Genetics, Konya, Turkey Introduction: Familial Mediterranean fever is a reces  sively inherited systemic autoin ﬂammatory disorder origi  nated by mutations in the MEFV gene. The protein product of MEFV named pyrin (or marenostrin). Pyrin is a negative regulatory of a speci ﬁci nﬂammatory pathway, and that loss of Pyrin function is responsible for the enhanced in ﬂam  mation seen in the FMF patients. Endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress is a very conserved pathway that provides thecell for regulating endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress that is caused by the secretory requirements associated with environmental forces. In this role, the ER stress hasincreasingly been revealed to have important roles in immunity and in ﬂammation.Thirty patients were included in the study. Fifteen patients were examined prior to treat ment and 15 during treatment with colchicine (1 –2 mg/day). Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mono  nuclear cells (PBMCs) by Trizol Reagent and standardchloroform extraction method. cDNA was synthesized from 1 μg of total RNA using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA synthesis kit. Expression levels of genes (GRP78, CHOP,EDEM1) associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress were analyzed by RT qPCR. Fold changes were calculated using the  ΔΔCT method. The statistical signi ﬁcances were esti  mated applying two tailed student ’s t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: When we compared the results of the analysis of the group using colchicine with thegroup that did not use it, we found that ER stress related gene expression levels were a difference in the group not using colchicine.

G6PC3 de ﬁciency is a recently char  acterized cause of congenital neutropenia variably asso  ciated with multisystem involvement. To date, less than 100patients have been described. Case report. A 5 year old girl, born preterm to healthy consanguineous Italian parents, was referred to our hospital for proportionate prenatal onsetgrowth failure (height and HC −2 SD; weight −4 SD) and mild to moderate neutropenia. Review of records and fur  ther investigation highlighted: stomatitis, persistent in ﬂam  mation of unknown cause (normal faecal calprotectin) but no amyloid deposition, mild global developmental delay, neonatal pulmonary hypertension, congenital heart disease(atrial septal defect, mild tricuspid insuf ﬁciency, vascular ring), low serum HDL cholesterol, renal dysplasia with sub  nephrotic proteinuria, treated bilateral inguinal hernia,effusive otitis media. Previous ﬁndings and appearance on physical examination (prominent super ﬁcial veins, trian  gular facies, unilateral congenital ptosis, epicanthus, bluishsclera, bilateral abnormal palmar creases, proximally placed thumbs, mild clitoromegaly) led to a clinical diagnosis of G6PC3 de ﬁciency. In agreement, combined whole exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping found the causative genotype NM_138387.3(G6PC3):c.[84_107del]; [84_107del]. At follow up visits neutrophils rangedapproximately from 500 to 1400/ μL. Conclusion. The novel homozygous 24 bp indel in exon 1 of G6PC3 we report here is associated with a syndromic phenotype towards thesevere end of the clinical spectrum.

Bracaglia","Children Hospital Bambino Gesù, Rome, Italy Introduction: Macrophage activation syndrome (MAS) is a severe complication of rheumatic disease, currently classi ﬁed among the secondary forms of HLH (secHLH). Primary HLH (pHLH) is caused by mutation of genes encoding for proteins involved in cytotoxic functions. Mice carrying heterozygous mutations in more than 1 pHLH genecarry a higher risk to develop HLH following viral infec  tion, suggesting that accumulation of partial genetic defects may be relevant in HLH. We aim at analysing, with nextgeneration sequencing (NGS), genes involved in pHLH in MAS and in secHLH. Materials and Methods: We per  formed Targeted resequencing on patients using a panelincluding the principal HLH related genes ( PRF1, UNC13d, STX11, STXBP2, Rab27a, XIAP, SH2D1A ) on the Illumina MiSeq ®and NextSeq550 ®platforms. We applied in silico studies, using SIFT and PolyPhen softwares, only to variants with an allelic frequency ≤1%. Results: We studied 39 patients: 24 MAS and 15 with HLH secondary toinfections. In 19 patients we identi ﬁed at least 1 hetero  zygous variant in one of the analysed genes with a detection rate of 49%. PRF1 gene was the most involved in MAS patients and RAB27A variants were more frequent in secHLH. All secHLH patients carrying variants in 2912different genes showed higher frequency of recurrences and disease severity compared to patients carrying one or no variants. Conclusions: Re occurrence and disease severity of disease tend to be more frequent and more severe in patients who carry mutations in two genes.

It affects 1 of 5000 males. HA is caused by mutations in F8gene located on the Xq28 chromosome. More than 3000 mutations were described in this gene. The most common mutations in patients with severe HA (FVIII:C < 1%) are: the intron 22inversion (Inv22)   40 –45%, the intron 1 inversion (Inv1)   2–5%, gross deletions   2 –5%. Materials and Methods: In this study we looked for Inv22, Inv1 and gross deletions in93 families from Russian Federation with varying HA severity using IS PCR method (Rossetti L.C.,2008) and multiplex PCR. Results: Inv22 was found in 36,6% cases.Mothers of probands with detected Inv22 (DNA were available in 8 cases) were determined to be carriers of this mutation. Standard Inv1 wasn ’t revealed in this cohort. A complex rearrangement resulting in intron 1 inversion and exon 2 –13 duplication was found by means of additional quantitative MLPA in 1 case (1%). Gross deletions weredetected through multiplex PCR in 2 cases (2,2%). More  over, mutations of other types (small insertions, deletions and single base substitutions) were revealed by multiplexPCR in 12 cases (12,9%). The two systems ’effectiveness reached 52,7%. Conclusions: The results of this study are consistent with literature data. The Inv22 frequency inRussian Federation, as well as all over the world, is very high.

Patients were evaluated for Hurley stages, accompanying symptoms and autoin  ﬂammatory diseases and pedigree analysis. All exons and exon intron boundaries of the MEFV gene was sequenced on the patients ’DNAs. Results: MEFV mutations were found on 18 of 44 alleles (40.9%). 50% of individuals had parental consanguinity. Three patients were already diagnosed with FMF. Five (22.7%) individuals were compound heterozygous. Onepatient was homozygous for both M694V and R202Q mutations. Six cases were heterozygous. One patient with accompanying ankylosing spondyloarthropathy and acneconglabata and another patient with recurrent pyoderma gangrenosum had compound heterozygous mutations without classical FMF symptoms. Conclusions: This preliminary study remarks that MEFV mutations are seen in patients with HS autoin ﬂammatory spectrum diseases. Dysregulation of MEFV  related path  ways may be responsible in some patients with HS. Homozygous and compound heterozygous patients should also be investigated and followed up for FMFmanifestations.

The detection of these mutations provides valuable informationfor diagnosis, prognosis and follow up of MPN patients. Currently, the methodology for the detection of these mutations encompasses a combination of 3 different assays.The aim of this study was to develop a single tube PCR method for the detection of the most common MPN muta  tions. Materials and methods: For the development of theassay we used control DNA specimens containing known amounts of the mutant allele (0%  75% for JAK2V617F or each of the 4 MPL mutations) prepared for QA and inter laboratory validation within the EU MPN network and DNA from patients with known CALR indel mutations detected by Sanger DNA sequencing. The method is basedon a single tube multiplex allele   speci ﬁc PCR reaction (for JAK2 V617F and MPL mutations) and size difference (for CALR mutations) using 8 different pairs of primers labeledwith different dyes followed by capillary electrophoresis. Results: Using this assay we obtained 100% speci ﬁcity and 100% sensitivity for the detection of each of these muta tions at the detection level of 1% of the mutant allele. The assay was clinically validated using DNA samples from 317 MPN patients which were previously analyzed by standardmethodology.

KS results from a constitutional extra X chromosome. It is well established that males with KS have an increased risk of malignancy, including breast cancer and germ cell tumours. However, published literature regardingthe risk of haematological malignancies in males with KS are con ﬂicting; some reports suggest an increased risk of leukaemia development, whereas others have determined itonly a chance association. Results: We present a case of 5  year old male patient with de novo T cell acute lympho  blastic leukaemia referred to Department of Paediatric andHaematology in October 2016. The boy was initially clas  siﬁed into low risk group. Since the MRD from day 15 was high (0,54%), the patient was reclassi ﬁed to the inter  mediate risk group. The hematological remission was achieved after completion of the induction protocol. Kar  yotype and FISH analysis performed from the bone marrowsample determined patient ’s karyotype as 47,XXY,del(5) (q31),add(7)(p?), +8,del(9)(p21),der(12)?,add(16)(q?), mar1 3, 2[10]/46,XXY[7].nuc ish (D5S23,D5S721x2),(EGR1x1)[120/200].nuc ish (CDKN2Ax1,CEPx2)[80]/ (CDKN2Ax0,CEPx2)[80].nuc ish(TCRx2)[200]. The addi  tional copy of X chromosome in all analyzed metaphasesraised a possibility of KS, thus to assess whether or not this is ade novo change, karyotyping and FISH was performed on blood sample and the result was: 47,XXY[37].nuc ish(CEPXx2,CEPYx1)[200]. Conclusions: Scarce literature reports exist regarding the association between KS and ALL in children. The complexity of our patient ’s karyotype, involving chromosomal rearrangements, deletions of EGR1 andCDKN2A genes, but no rearrangement in TCR gene is challenging in treatment choice and prognosis and requiresfurther follow up.

It is mostly known as a complex disorder caused by the convergence ofgenetic and environmental factors. We aimed to identify the putative gene responsible for the disease in familial forms. Methods: Seven Turkish families with two to four affected members (17 in total) were chosen for the genetic analyses. We performed linkage analysis followed by can  didate gene approach in two of the families, and in ﬁve families, the candidate gene was analysed for mutations. Results: The disease gene was mapped to 13q13 with a cumulative maximal LOD score of 4.81. The region har boured Laccase (multicopper oxidoreductase) domain  containing 1 (LACC1 ) gene, relevant to the disease. Muta  tional analysis of all coding exons revealed homozygoussevere mutations in three families: c.3 G > A (p.Met1?), c.1240 C > T (p.Arg414Ter) and c.988_990delATT (p. Ile330del). Conclusion: In the three families with LACC1 muta  tions, JIA is a monogenic disease with inter  and intra  familial clinical variability. Protein studies can revealwhether LACC1 mutation underlies the disease in the remaining four families. The families exhibited the clinical heterogeneity typical for the disease. Our results establishthat LACC1 mutations can cause recessive systemic, oli  goarticular and polyarticular JIA as recently reported in three families.

In AL amyloidosis patients,Abstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 915immunoglobulin is deposited in tissues before a large tumor burden develops; therefore, AL amyloidosis patients typi  cally do not present with overt multiple myeloma (MM) at the time of diagnosis. In this study, we performed whole exome sequencing (WES) of in bone marrow (BM) and peripheral blood (PB) cells and laser dissected plasma cells.Materials and Methods: 10 AL amyloidosis, and 2 MM patients were included.. After extraction of DNA from total nucleated cells of BM and PB samples, WES was per formed using Illumina HiSeq 2000. In addition, laser microdissection (LCM) was performed for 5 patients for sorting of > 200 plasma cells. Results: No previouslyreported hotspot mutations in hematologic malignancies were found in 10 AL amyloidosis patients by WES of BM cells. We intensely investigated for the presence of 95variants of AL amyloidosis that was recently reported, however, none of these mutations were found. In our patients, non recurrent variants were found in each case ingenes including GBP4 ,SH2D4A , and AR. In addition, plasma cells obtained from LCM, non recurrent mutations found in each case including HIST1H4I . Conclusions: Our results was concordant with previous studies of WES of AL amyloidosis in that unifying mutation by WES is absent in AL amyloidosis.

Materials and Methods: 13 patients detected between Jan 2004 and Dec2016 were retrieved and their electronic records reviewed by treating physicians. Urinary mevalonate was assayed by gas chromatography mass spectrometry. Analysis of theMVK gene (12q24, NM_000431.3) was performed using Sanger sequencing method. Results: The frequencies of gastrointestinal and joint symptoms were 54% and 62%,respectively. Severe symptoms (high episode frequency, splenomegaly and renal amyloidosis) that lead to the introduction of biologics were presented in 7 patients. Urinefrom fever episode was positive for mevalonic acid (range 2   127 mg/g creatinine, N < 0.1) in 11 patients, while the urine from afebrile interval was always negative. Mutationswere identi ﬁed in both alleles in all 13 patients. Three large deletions were found. The most common point mutations (87.5% alleles) were p. V377I (11/21) and p.R40L (6/21).Conclusions: With molecular genetic method all Czech patients were diagnosed.

RARS is a subtype of MDS characterized by isolated erythroid dys plasia with 15% or more of the erythroblasts in the bone marrow containing iron laden mitochondria forming a ring around the nucleus. Aims and methods The aim of the present study is to assess the presence and signi ﬁcance of any alterations of the mitochondrial genome in the pathogenesis ofRARS. We evaluated a total of ﬁve patients with RARS diagnosis. After clinical diagnosis, Perl ’s staining, kar  yotyping and MLPA assay were performed onbone marrow. Total DNA was extracted from CD34, bone marrow, peripheral blood and buccal brushing cells and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) was Sangersequenced. Results Several mtDNA mutations were found in all patients but particularly in one, a 56 years old man, whoearly progressed in RAEB2/AML. We found homo  and heteroplasmic mutations at different proportions in the analyzed cell types. Conclusion / Summary A possible role of the mtDNA mutations including the novel ones which might be speci ﬁc of CD34 cell population will be discussed as possiblecontributing factor to the disease to establish whether mtDNA might represent a novel molecular marker for the diagnosis and/or prognosis of RARS.

During the Bosnian war (1992 –1995), DU ammunition was used in Hadzici area, where DU was measured in soil, air and water. Materials and methods: We collected clinical and genetic data on hematological malignancies in the Hadzici (DU con taminated) and Ilijas (control) areas from 1996 to 2015. Results: We found 717 patients with hematological disease (437 from Hadzici; 280 from Ilijas). No increase in Hodgkinlymphoma, non Hodgkin lymphoma, and multiple mye  loma was noted. There were 66 patients with myeloid malignancies (44 in Hadzici and 22 in Ilijas). We assessedclinical and genetic risk factors in the analyzed patients. Compared to European age adjusted incidences per 100,000/year, MDS, CML, and MPN incidences were 5.3,3.4, and 2.4 times higher, respectively. Our data suggests that longer chronic exposure produced higher number of patients. The median age at diagnosis of MDS, CML, andAML patients from Hadzici was signi ﬁcantly lower com  pared to Ilijas (p < 0.05). 22% of AML patients from Had  zici achieved complete remission after ﬁrst treatment, compared to 67% in Ilijas (p < 0.05).

 Decreased Severity of Experimental Arthritis in Peptidylarginine Deiminase Type 4 Knockout Mice,P07.43,"A. Suzuki1, Y. Kochi1, H. Shoda2, K. Fujio2,K .","Yamamoto1,2","1RIKEN, Yokohama, Japan,2The University of Tokyo, Tokyo, Japan Objective . Previously, peptidylarginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) was identi ﬁed as a susceptibility gene for Rheu  matoid arthritis (RA) by genome wide association studies. PADI4 is highly expressed in bone marrow, macrophages, neutrophils, and monocytes. Peptidyl citrulline is an inter esting molecule in RA because it is a target antigen of anti  citrullinated peptide antibodies (ACPAs), and only PADs (translated protein from PADI genes) can provide peptidylcitrulline via modi ﬁcation of protein substrates. The aim of this study was to evaluate the importance of the PADI4 gene in the progression of RA. Methods . We generated Padi4 knockout (Padi4 −/−) DBA1J mice. Padi4 −/− DBA1J and wild type mice were immunized with bovine type II collagen (CII) to develop collagen induced arthritis(CIA). Expression of various in ﬂammatory cytokines and Padi genes in immune cells was detected by real time TaqMan assay. Cytokine concentration in sera was mea sured by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Localization of PAD4 and PAD2 protein was indicated by immunohis  tochemistry. Results . We demonstrated that the clinical disease score was signi ﬁcantly decreased in Padi4 −/−mice and Padi4 expression was induced by CII immunization. In Padi4−/−mice sera, serum anti type II collagen (CII) IgM, IgG, and in ﬂammatory cytokine levels were also sig  niﬁcantly decreased compared with those in wild type mice sera. Interestingly, Padi2 expression was compensationallyinduced in CD11b +cells of Padi4 /  mice. Conclusion .O n the basis of these studies, it appears that Padi4 enhances collagen initiated in ﬂammatory responses. Our results revealed that PAD4 affected on expression of various cytokines and also controlled Padi genes. A. Suzuki: None. Y. Kochi: None. H. Shoda: None. K. Fujio: None. K. Yamamoto: None. E",2017
 A streamlined work ﬂow for routine gene expression proﬁling of single cells,P07.45,"C. Chang, D. Jensen, H. Fan, K. Shelton","BD Genomics, Menlo Park, CA, United StatesIntroduction: Recent technological advances in","sequencing has enabled whole transcriptome analysis (WTA) of single cells, expanding our appreciation for the high level of heterogeneity in cell lineage and function. However, single cell WTA studies are often cost prohibiting for high throughput analysis. Moreover, a signi ﬁcant por  tion of sequencing reads consist of high expressing house  keeping genes and genes of low variability. In this study we describe a comprehensive work ﬂow of using WTA data to design a primer panel for highly multiplexed PCR. Material and Methods: Using BDTMResolve ’s single cell platform, we captured thousands of cells from dis associated mouse spleen. Around 1000 cells were sub  sampled for WTA. Using data generated from WTA we designed a gene panel consisting of 482 primers for immunecell related genes, using an algorithm that selects optimal polyA sites to use for individual transcripts. We then tested the custom gene panel on ~1000 cells subsampled from theoriginal sample by highly multiplexed PCR. Results and Conclusions: Based on gene expression, we were able to reconstruct all the major immune cell com partments as well as rarer subsets in both WTA and Tar  geted assays. With signi ﬁcantly fewer reads in the targeted library, we achieved higher capture ef ﬁciency and detected low abundance transcripts that weren ’t found in the original WTA. This work ﬂow, which leverages pilot WTA data to identify highly variable genes and design primers for sub sequent transcriptional pro ﬁling of similar samples, is a comprehensive and cost effective approach to study tissues at the single cell level.

Genetic screening of 22 beta globin gene and 21 alpha globin gene mutations common for the Indo  Mediterranean region was performed for 98 sporadic and familial cases suspected for thalassemia intermedia or tha  lassemia minor. Results . 67 patients were diagnosed as simple hetero  zygotes for b0or b+globin gene mutations responsible for thalassemia minor or intermedia with speci ﬁc hematological features. 10 cases were detected with alpha single or doublegene deletions. Four patients with intermediate beta  thalassemia were detected with simple heterozygous beta globin gene mutations with co inheritance of triplicatedalpha globin gene rearrangement. All ﬁve families involved in the study were detected with alpha or beta globin gene mutations while only one familial case with typical tha lassemia intermedia was detected with beta globin com  pound heterozygous genotype. Conclusion . This study recon ﬁrms the previous reports on distribution of asymptomatic or intermedia thalassemia in Armenia. 75% detection rate of mutations emphasizes the importance of provision of genetic testing among patientswith suspected phenotype.

XLA (frequently called Bru  ton’s Agammaglobulinemia) is caused by mutations inBruton ’s Tyrosine Kinase ( BTK) gene, leading to abnormal B cells development. Here we want to report a case of Bruton ’s Agammaglobulinemia that was caused by new deletion in BTK gene. Case presentation The patient (a 6  month old boy) was born at term to non consanguineous parents. No family history of PID. Both parents and oldersister are clinically healthy. He was breastfed till 3 months. At 3, 5 months of age he presented acute viral infection with glue ear. At 4 month   serous meningitis, at 5 month  laryngotracheitis and serous meningitis. The levels of immunoglobulins were decreased for Ig A and IgG isotypes. The virtual lack of CD19 +B lymphocytes was de ﬁned. Additionally there was found a complete absence of KREC (kappa deleting recombination excision circle) in dried blood spot (retrospectively). Intravenous immunoglobulintherapy was started at 6 month of age. Results The mole  cular diagnostics of coding region of the BTK gene was performed, con ﬁrming the clinical diagnosis of XLA. DNA sequencing analysis of patient showed a 13 bp deletion in exon 2 (c.64_76delCCTCTAAACTTCA), leading to occurrence of frameshift and premature termination codon(p.Pro22fsTer28). This mutation was not described earlier. The mother and the sister of proband showed hetero  zygosity at the same position.

All patients reported to date presentmild to moderate developmental delay, in particular speech delay, and half of them hearing loss. The smallest over  lapping region has approximately 2.2 Mb and includes thetranscription factors TBX2 andTBX4 genes. These genes have been implicated in a number of developmental path  ways, including those of the heart and limbs. The TBX4 gene is also associated with the autosomal dominant small patella syndrome (SPS, OMIM 147891). Here we report a 8year old girl with moderate developmental delay including learning disabilities. The test for Fragile X syndrome indi  cated an allele within the grey area (number of repeats ~50 CGG) inherited from her mother and probably not relevant. Affymetrix Cytoscan HD chromosome microarray analysis was performed and a 669 Kb interstitial deletion wasdetected at 17q23.2 region, encompassing only ﬁve OMIM genes: BCAS3 ,TBX2 ,TBX4 ,NACA2 andBRIP1 .

Kuc ˇinskas,"Dept. Human and Medical Genetics, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania Introduction: Many studies have shown that molecular karyotyping is an effective diagnostic tool in individuals with intellectual disability/developmental delay. We report on a patient with novel 1q22q23.1 microdeletion, a possiblecause of developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies. Materials and Methods: A female, 6 years of age, was a ﬁrst child of healthy non consanguineous parents (DECIPHER 338439). The proband was born at gestational age of 40 weeks by Caesarian section because of breech presentation and oligohydramnios. She had low birthweight, cleft hard and soft palate, atrial septal defect and patent ductus arteriosus. Her psychomotor development was delayed. At age of 6 years her phenotype was remarkablefor microcephaly, short stature, upslanted palpebral ﬁssures, strabismus, thin upper lip, protruding ears, and campto  dactyly of 4 th–5thﬁngers. Brain MRI showed hypoplastic corpus callosum. She had severe global developmental delay, stereotypic motor behaviors and hyperactivity. Results: Whole genome genotyping analysis using theHumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) revealed 1q22q23.1microdeletion, 1.6 Mb in size. Real time PCR analysis of the proband and herparents con ﬁrmed the deletion in the proband and revealed itsde novo origin. The deletion involves APOA1BP,Abstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 921LAMTOR2, LMNA, NTRK1, PRCC, RIT1 and SEMA4A morbid genes. RIT1 andLMNA genes are associated with Noonan and Malouf syndromes, respectively, and partly explain the clinical features of the patient.

AP 4 is a component of intracellular transportation of proteins that is thought to play an important role in neurons. Recently, mutations in genes affecting all foursubunits of AP 4 ( AP4M1, AP4E1, AP4S1, AP4B1 ) have been found to cause autosomal recessive AP 4 de ﬁciency phenotype. Materials and Methods: Disease associatedgenome sequencing was performed in a 10 year old boy born to non consanguineous parents of Polish origin. The child presented with severe intellectual disability, neonatalhypotonia, spastic paraplegia, microcephaly, absent speech, seizures, and early onset obesity; MRI showed delayed myelination. Results: Disease associated genome sequen cing revealed the presence of two novel heterozygous var  iants in the AP4M1 gene: c.566del, p.(Leu189fs) and c.916 C > T, p.(Arg306*) in the proband. Sanger sequencinganalysis of the parents showed the independent segregation of the two identi ﬁed alterations. Conclusions: We describe a patient with novel AP4M1 mutations and a phenotype compatible with AP 4 de ﬁciency syndrome. The uncom  mon feature in our patient is early onset obesity described so far in only one family with AP 4 de ﬁciency. To the best of our knowledge, our report represents the ﬁrst non  consanguineous family with compound heterozygousmutations in the AP4M1 gene.

Mutations in ARID1B have been shown to cause syndromic and non syndromic intellectual disability. Intra  genic deletions have been previously described in patientswith ID, speech delay hypertrichosis and dysgenesis/agen  esis of the corpus callosum. We describe a patient with intragenic ARID1B deletion who has developmental dif ﬁ  culties dysgenesis of corpus callosum and dysmorphic features. This ten years old girl came ﬁrst to our clinic at the age of three years, because of developmental delay coarsefacies and macrocephaly. Developmental assessment showed low normal intelligence. She has frontal bossing, large mouth, bushy eyebrows, thin hair, myopia, andastigmatism. Brain MRI demonstrated short and thick cor  pus callosum and arachnoid cyst. At ten years head cir  cumference was 57.5 cm ( +4.0 SD), she has slurred speech and poor social behavior. CMA was done at the age of 4 y and was normal. Exome sequencing did not reveal relevant variant. At the age of ten years she was reevaluated andCMA has been repeated. A microdeletion of 144 kb in 6q25.3 was found. This deletion encompasses exon 5 in the ARID1B gene. Isolated exon 5 deletion in ARID1B has notbeen reported yet in association with ARID1B phenotype.

Array compara  tive genomic hybridization (arrayCGH) is a powerful tool for detecting relative small genomic imbalances and addsvalue to the cases with structural chromosomal aberrations identi ﬁed by conventional cytogenetics. In our ongoing study we so far included 57 children aged between 1 –11 years, referred for dysmorphic features, developmental delay, ID, different malformations. All patients had con  ventional karyotype performed. Also ten parents wereincluded in the study. We used SurePrint G3 ISCA V2 CGH 8 × 60 K Array Kit (Agilent Technologies), Nimble  Gen MS 200 Microarray Scanner and NimbleGen MS 200Software v1.1. Data analysis was done with Agilent Cyto  Genomics Software and relevant databases were consulted. CNVs detected were con ﬁrmed by MLPA (Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli ﬁcation). Our arrayCGH analysis accurately characterized the aberrations in 19 cases with abnormal karyotype. In other 16 cases arrayCGHidenti ﬁed CNVs (copy number variations) that might explain or contribue to the phenotype of patients with normal conventional karyotype. ArrayCGH revealed nopathogenic genomic CNVs in 4 cases, suggesting that the aberrations found in the karyotype were balanced, or encompassed heterochromatic regions. The results of ourstudy sustain the contribution of arrayCGH in postnatal diagnosis as it can delineate the genomic imbalances; helpin unraveling the genes involved in pathogenesis of con  genital anomalies and provide a correlation to patient ’s phenotype.

Mutations in ARX cause X linked intellectual disability. The phenotypic spectrumcomprises a series of X linked developmental disorders ranging from lissencephaly to agenesis of the corpus cal  losum with abnormal genitalia to infantile spasms withoutbrain malformations to syndromic and non syndromic mental retardation. Material and Methods: We describe a ﬁve generation Danish family with three males at the age of 18, 44, and 61 years, showing mental retardation. Except from large ears, clinical evaluation did not reveal any dis  tinct facial dysmorphic features. Whole exome sequencingwith targeted analysis of the coding regions of the X chromosome was carried out in two of the affected males, a suspected obligate carrier female, and a healthy male.Results: The ﬁltering process revealed a novel variant, NM_139058.2:c.1A>G, in the ﬁrst codon of ARX. Recently, premature termination mutations very proximal in the ARXgene have been reported to lead to reinitiation of translation and produce a truncated protein at markedly reduced level in correlation with a less severe phenotype. Conclusions:Theﬁnding of a mutation in the ﬁrst codon of the ARX gene in a family segregating non syndromic mental924retardation supports the observed genotype phenotype cor  relation reported for mutations proximal in ARX.

 Mild phenotypic changes in a child with major duplication of the short arm on chromosome 9,P08.17,"E. Sukarova Angelovska, M. Kocova, G. Ilieva, K.","Stavric, K. Kuzevska Maneva","Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Chromosome 9 is frequently involved in variable chro  mosomal imbalances due to the breakpoint sites along thechromosome, mainly on 9p. Chromosomal rearrangements include deletions, duplications and translocations. Partial duplication of 9p occurs mainly on the terminal part of thechromosome and has clari ﬁed clinical presentation. How  ever, duplication on the more centromeric part of the chromosome is rarely described. Most of the karyotype  to phenotype studies show that the severity of the clinical presentation is concordant with the length of the duplicated region. We present a young infant who was referred forcytogenetic analysis due to the hypotonia and coarse facial appearance. Karyotype survey revealed partial duplication on chromosome 9p11 –21. Parental karyotype was normal. Dysmorphic features include broad nose, up slanted and narrow palpebrae, low set ears, macrostomia, low set ears. Examination of all organs and systems revealed only minoratrial septal defect that closed spontaneously. Follow up of the psychomotor development was done, continuously with abilities on lower normal scale for the age. Partial dupli cation of chromosome 9p is one of the most frequent structural abnormalities with signi ﬁcant phenotypic simi  larity in described cases. Although the region that has beenduplicated is large and includes more than 50 genes, clinical presentation in our patient is mild without any major con  genital anomaly. We can conclude that there is no sig niﬁcant overexpression of genes in this region that can produce potentially harmful congenital abnormalities and profound intellectual disability. E.

Material and methods: We report here a family; a young non consanguineous couple with history of twospontaneous ﬁrst trimester miscarriages, followed by birth of two females and one male offspring, who presented with developmental delay, intellectual disability and associatedfacial dysmorphism at the age of 12, 10 and 2 years respectively. Conventional karyotyping and various mole  cular modalities were utilized for investigations Results : Exome sequencing showed presence of homo  zygous variation 2286 +5 G > A in intron 23 of PGAP1 gene. This variant is linked to autosomal recessive mentalretardation 42 (MRT42). This was further con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing in all affected siblings and parents. Conclusion: We report siblings with homozygous mutations in PGAP1 and enlighten the emerging clinical phenotype of PGAP1 related disease. Our study also emphasizes the utility of Clinical Exome as an ultimatediagnostic tool for non syndromic cases.

 Recovery from Rapid deterioration in individuals with Down syndrome,P08.19,"S. MIZUNO1, M. Inaba1, H. Taniai1, Y. Muramatsu1,2","1Dept of Paediatrics, Central Hospital, Aichi Human Ser","vice Center, Kasugai, Aichi, Japan,2Department of Pae  diatrics, University of Nagoya, School of Medicine,Nagoya, Japan A small percentage of adolescents and young adults with Down syndrome (DS) experience unexplained regression in behavior, activities of daily living. This acute regression, which known as “rapid deterioration ”or“catatonia in Down syndrome, ”is one of the main concerns among the families and clinicians. Since the etiology of this condition is unknown, no treatment regimens are available. Here wepresent the cases of ﬁve adolescents with DS who recovered from rapid deterioration within one year. Common features deterioration observed in these individuals were signi ﬁcant loss of speech, loss of interest, abrupt deterioration of activities of daily living, moving slowly, eating slowly, and talking to themselves frequently. Prior to onset, none had anautism spectrum disorder. Trigger episodes causing the deterioration were not apparent except in one patient who experienced parental divorce. One 17 year old femalepatient recovered from the decline after 2 months of co  sleeping with her mother, two got restored after transferring to new school or work place, and two got restored by givingtheir special schedule in day care centers.; however, since the other 11 individuals did not show any improvement, an effective management strategy remained unclear. Our casessuggest that although rapid deterioration in DS is not a rare phenomenon, recovery is dif ﬁcult, but some cases demon  strate that this condition can be reversible on early recog nition by caregivers and medical personnel. Further studies with more cases may aid in the identi ﬁcation of a treatment strategy as well as prevention of rapid deterioration inyoung adults with DS. S. Mizuno: None. M. Inaba: None. H.

Non  recurrent genomic rearrangements often result fromreparative mechanisms such as Non Allelic Homologous Recombination (NAHR) during meiosis. In the present study we performed array Comparative Genomic Hybridi zation (aCGH) using Agilent Microarray Kit, 4 × 180 K in Bulgarian patients with comparable neurodevelopmental abnormalities such as epilepsy, intellectual disability,autistic and other neuropsychiatric features. A con ﬁrmation quantitive PCR of all aberrations was performed using SYBR Green qPCR technology and ΔΔCt method. aCGH revealed three deletions and two duplications in 4 patients affecting different chromosomes. The duplications were with size 1.856 Mb and 0.687 Mb and affected 17q12 and9q33.1 regions, respectively. They were found in young  sters with absence and generalized tonic  clonic seizures, mild ID, learning disability and behavior problems. In 4years old girl with ID, ataxia, seizures and delayed speech two microdeletions affecting 1q36 and 16p13.3 were detected  regions known to be associated with microdele tion syndromes. Additionally, homozygous deletion cover  ing the ﬁrst two exons of IMMP2L gene was found in girl with similar clinical characteristics. Despite the overlappingphenotype observed in our patients it appears that it is due to different chromosome regions affected. Therefore, it is important to use more extensive genomic approaches, suchas chromosomal microarray analysis in order to clarify the actual genetic causes of these complex conditions.

So it is necessary to recognize potential structure anomalies for the family. Materials and Methods: We report 6 cases with intellectualdisability and other anomalies, 4 cases were found with segmental duplication and deletion by chromosome micro  array: 9q del/22q dup, 16p del/19q dup, 10q dup/del, 18pdel/18q dup, other 2 cases with pure microdeletion: 13qter microdeletion, 3p13 14 microdeletion. Results: Combined with FISH test and karyotype analysis, the structure ‘hide’ in were all revealed for the 6 cases as der(9)t(9;22), der(16)t (16;19), inv dup del (10q), inv dup 18q/del 18p, 13qs, der (3)ins(18;3). Among these unbalanced rearrangements, 3were inherited from their healthy parents who carried balanced chromosome rearrangements, 3 were de novo. 4 families have been provided with prenatal diagnosis atsecond pregnancy. Conclusions: Some pure segmental chromosome microdeletion or microduplication detected by chromosomal microarray usually associated with chromo some structure anomalies. Chromosome microarray, com  bined with traditional karyotyping and FISH, was useful to discover the potential structure changes underline copynumber variations, which could help provide accurate recurrence risk evaluation and allow guiding prenatal diagnosis or reproductive planning.

Galanina, I.",Kolesnikova,"Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology SB RAS, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Fragile sites on chromosomes are ele  ments of human karyotype and can be visible on metaphasechromosomes as breaks or restrictions. Two types of fragile sites can be ﬁnd one chromosomes: Common fragile sites – part of normal chromosomes and Rare fragile sites –result of repeat expansion mutation. Rare fragile site FRAXA located on Xq27.3 and appears as result of CGG repeat expansion on 5 ’promoter region of FMR1 gene. People with expanded CGG repeat in FMR1 promotes have Fragile X syndrome –most widespread reason for inheritable mental retardation. Standard method of fragility analysis isbased on routine Giemsa staining of metaphase chromo  some and microscopic screening for breaks and restrictions. Percent of counted fragile sites depends on microscopemagni ﬁcation, slides quality and accuracy of researcher. Results: We developed the method for FRAXA fragile sites detection using two colored ﬂuorescence in situ hybridiza  tion with two BACs. One is BAC clone containing full length human FMR1 gene that was used as fragile site marker, another BAC clone contains GPR50 gene. Firstvalidation of the method was made on cell cultures derived from Fragile X syndrome patients with control on normal cell lines. Statistical analysis revealed signi ﬁcance of dif  ference in signals patterns between affected and control cell lines. Patients blood samples were analyzed with using of the method.

 Paternal transmission of a FMR1 full mutation allele,P08.23,"M. Mila `1,2, Alvarez Mora1,2, Guitart3, Madrigal1,2,","Gabau3, Rodriguez Revenga1,2","1Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain,2CIBERER and IDI  BAPS, Barcelona, Spain,3Hospital Parc Taulí, Sabadell, SpainIntroduction: Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited intellectual disability and autism. The molecular defect is a CGG repeat expansion in the 5 ’ untranslated region of the FMR1 gene. Full mutation (FM) expansion from premutated alleles (PM) is only acquired via maternal meiosis. Paternal transmission always remainsin the PM range, from both PM and FM fathers. We present paternal transmission of a FMR1 PM FM allele in a 16  year old girl with a mild phenotype with learning dif ﬁcul  ties and anxiety. Material and Methods: The FMR1 CGG repeat expansion was molecularly characterized using the AmplideX ®PCR/CE FMR1 Kit and AmplideX ®mPCR FMR1 (Asuragen) in peripheral blood from the patient and her parents and in semen from the father. FMR1 gene expression analysis was performed using qPCR. Results:The patient inherited a normal allele (30 CGG, 2 AGG) from her mother and a mosaic PM FM non methylated allele (117  > 200 CGG, no AGG) from her father. Normalor slightly increased FMR1 mRNA levels were detected. The father showed an 88 CGG uninterrupted non  methylated allele in both blood and sperm cells. Conclu sion: The patient inherited a PM allele from her father that expanded to a FM in some cells and remained unmethy  lated. A postzygotic event (somatic expansion) is the mostplausible explanation for this paternal transmission. This case raises important questions such as whether prenatal diagnosis should be offered in cases in which the father istheFMR1 PM carrier.

Uti  lizing whole exome sequencing (WES) we identi ﬁed a hitherto undescribed homozygous mutation in the C12orf4gene in a 7 year old Portuguese girl born from con  sanguineous mating. Phenotypic features were subtle with deep set eyes, synophris, pointed nasal tip, retrognathia,truncal adipositas and muscular hypotonia, and were similarto those in the published cases. Her psychomotor develop  ment was moderately delayed, with independent walking at 2 years and receptive and expressive speech delay. C12orf4 is located on 12p13.3 and encodes for a 552 aminoacid protein. It is expressed in various tissues including the cerebral cortex and the cerebellum and plays a role in mastcell activation. Defects in the mast cell activations have been involved in abnormal function of the nervous system, but functional studies are needed to explore the molecularmechanisms underlying the pathophysiology of this newly identi ﬁed intellectual disability disorder.

The disease course and clinical manifes tations are variable with survival over more than two dec  ades and reportedly characteristic features such as dysmorphic facies and an elongated and thickened tonguebeing rather subtle ﬁndings. Materials and Methods: Patients with intellectual disability (ID) and movement disorders, in whom genomic imbalances and fragile Xsyndrome had been excluded, were screened for exonic variants using exome sequencing.

Both girls presented with extreme hypotonia and deceased aged 7 and11 years. Neuropathological showed brain atrophy, demyelination, wide spread nerve cell losses, and neuronal inclusions initially suggestive of a differential diagnosis of“lysosomal storage disease ”, were found. Conclusion: The investigation of these patients whose clinical phenotype was also described by Bhoj et al in 2016 extended the spectrumofTBCK mutations in IHPFR3 as a relatively new930neurodegenerative condition which is dif ﬁcult to diagnose at the clinical level. As the ﬁrst neuropathological report in IHPFR3, these patients showed massive, relatively unspe  ciﬁc neurodegeneration, except for the occurrence of a carbohydrate positive substrate.

Targeted NGS comprising exonic regions with disease causing variation (hence clinical exome sequencing; CES) has become a ﬁrst line diag  nostic  and research tool in such instances. Material and Methods: Two siblings (male 22  and female 10 years) with NCD were analyzed. Both suffered from speechdelay, intellectual disability, dysmorphic features and some autistic traits. The girl is severely affected and has unsteady gait. Following aCGH CES was used in order toelucidate the underlying genetic causes of their unclear and clinically variable NCD . Results: A novel nonsense mutation in KDM6B gene (17p13.1) was found in both of the siblings by CES. In addition, family analysis con  ﬁrmed that this pathogenic variant occurred de novo in both siblings, indicating likely germline mosaicism in oneof their parents. Conclusions: KDM6B is H3K27 deme  thylase involved in transcription of HOX genes during embryonic development, similarly to KDM6A associated with Kabuki syndrome 2. Due to the close function of both genes, variable expressivity of phenotypes associated with pathogenic variation in KDM6B could be expected. According to the published l iterature we have identi ﬁed a third“mutation ”inKDM6B linked to the development of NCD. Our ﬁndings suggest that KDM6B could be another candidate gene in intellectual disability and thus should warrant further studies in this regard.

Study and results: Cytogenetic analysis using standard G banding and FISH with labeled rDNA probes revealed an abnormalchromosome 13 with an enlarged p arm due to rDNA ampli ﬁcation in a male child, who had clinically con ﬁrmed mental retardation and an autistic behavior. This chromo some is evidently inherited from the father, who has mor  phologically the same chromosome, but is healthy. The karyotype of the mother was normal. Ag NOR stainingshowed brightly stained large whole p arm nucleolus organizer regions (NORs) in a child and normal sized NORs in his father with 13p + NOR amount mosaicism. qRT PCR with speci ﬁc primers showed highly increased levels of 18 S, 28 S and 5,8 S ribosomal RNA (rRNA) in the patient ’s blood samples compared to a normal healthy control donor. Both patient ’s father and mother had no elevated levels of rRNAs expression. Conclusions: In this case rRNA level seems to correlate with mental retardationin familial individuals with 13p +.

 Homozygous novel variant in MUT in a patient with intellectual disability without metabolicderangement,P08.31,"E. G. Utine, E. Z. Tas ¸kıran, C. Kos ¸ukcu, O ¨. Akgu ¨n","Dog˘an, O ¨.P .S¸ims¸ek Kiper, K. Bodurog ˘lu, M.","Alikas ¸ifog˘lu Hacettepe University, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Homozygous mutations in MUT , encoding for methylmalonyl CoA mutase lead to methylmalonic aciduria, char acterized by elevated levels of methylmalonic acid in blood and urine. Patients presentwith recurrent attacks of metabolic acidosis, vomiting, dehydration, and lethargy, even tually leading to failure to thrive and developmental delay. Clinical features displaya spectrum based on the frequency and severity of meta  bolic attacks and acute complications. Some mildly affected patients with undetected attacks may present laterwith isolated intellectual disability (ID). Method and Results: Homozygous novel Val489Glu variant in MUT was detected by whole exome sequencing in a 15 year old boy with severe ID. He had hand stereotypies, irre  gular sleep patterns, and attacks of crying. He never had metabolic attacks or seizure s. Anthropometric measures were at 50th centile. He had an elongated face with a high forehead and prominent ears. He was very active, he lacked eye contact and resisted physical examination.Audiological exam, cranial imaging, and metabolic tests (blood and urine amino acids, urine organic acids, blood acylcarnitine pro ﬁle) were all normal. Fragile X, kar  yotype and copy number analyses were also normal. On detection of Val489Glu variant metabolic tests were repeated and all were normal. Conclusion: Methylmalonicaciduria diagnosis requires p resence of excess metabolites in blood and urine. Although intellectually unaffected patients with excess metabolites in body ﬂuids are known, ID without metabolic derangement was reported only once in 2 patients. This novel variant in a highly  conserved residue caused no phenotype despite beingpredicted as pathogenic with in silico prediction programs. E.G. Utine: None. E.Z. Ta şkıran: None. C.

Mancini on behalf of Neuro MIG,"ErasmusMC, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Among congenital brain disorders, malformations of cortical development (MCD) are rare neurodevelopmental disorders, often resulting from genetic mutations. The emergence of novel neuroimaging and genomic technolo gies potentially challenges scientists and clinicians of ef ﬁ  ciently interpreting and translating these data for the bene ﬁt of patients. In Europe, expertise on MCD is very frag mented and con ﬁned to personal interest of a few experts and basic scientists studying cortical development are not always connected with clinicians. The Neuro MIG con sortium, supported by the COST Action will, for the ﬁrst time, bring together clinicians and researchers in the ﬁeld of brain malformations, to create the interdisciplinary, pan European Network Neuro MIG, advancing the under  standing of MCD pathophysiology and translating this knowledge to improve the diagnostic and clinical manage ment. This Action will harmonise MCD classi ﬁcation, based on the advances in genetics and neuroimaging, develop guidelines for clinical management, create bestpractice diagnostic pathways, coordinate databases from different countries to utilize them for collective research initiatives aimed at developing appropriate therapies, iden tify common pathophysiological mechanisms, educate young clinicians and scientists and stimulate translational and transnational exchange. Among the planned activities aweb based platform for case discussion will be provided. This Action will join forces of MCD experts to reduce health care costs and increase the quality of life of theaffected individuals and their families. The Action is open for participation in one of the workgroups until October 2017: for those interested check eligibility ( www.Cost.eu , Action CA16118) and contact the Action Chair (G.

 Intragenic deletion in the NPAS3 gene identi ﬁed in a patient with mild intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder,P08.35,"M. Smyk, K. Sobecka, M. Bartnik Glaska, N.","Bezniakow, J. Castaneda, B. A. Nowakowska","Institute of Mother and Child, Warsaw, PolandThe NPAS3 gene encodes a transcription factor of the basic helix loop helix family involved in central nervous system development and adult neurogenesis. Disruption of NPAS3 has been described in a mother and daughter diag  nosed with schizophrenia and mild learning disability. Association studies have linked single nucleotide poly morphisms in NPAS3 with increased risk of schizophrenia, major depression and bipolar disorder. Npas3 knockout mice show a de ﬁcit in adult hippocampal neurogenesis, aberrations in synaptic transmissions and display a range of behavioral phenotypes. NPAS3 is a locus with an excep  tionally high number of human speci ﬁc accelerated reg  ulatory elements (HAEs), i.e., non coding regions highly conserved during mammalian evolution but accumulating sequence changes in the lineage leading to humans afterhuman chimpanzee split. We present a 7 year old boy diagnosed with mild intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, discrete facial dysmorphism and clinodactyly of5thﬁngers. Thus far only two NPAS3 deletions have been described in patients with mental retardation or cognitive decline and psychosis. ACGH analysis in the patient usingCytoSure ISCA, OGT detected a 392 kb deletion at chro  mosome 14q13.1 encompassing exons 4 and 5 of the NPAS3 gene. Parental aCGH analysis revealed that the deletion occurred de novo . The deletion disrupts the PAS (period, aryl hydrocarbon receptor, single minded) domain required for dimerization and removes HAEs: HCNS96,2xHAR142, HAR89, which act as transcriptional enhancers during development, particularly within the nervous system. This case further supports the causative role of NPAS3 alteration in neurodevelopmental disorders. This work was granted from National Science Centre (OPUS 2015/17/B/ NZ5/01357 to BN) M. Smyk: None.

InAbstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 933the 90% of SS patients, variations on NSD1 gene causing haploinsuf ﬁciency were identi ﬁed. Among the remaining, point mutations or small intragenic deletion in the Nuclear Factor I X gene (NFIX) were described as Sotos like phe  notype (Sotos 2) and recently proposed as Malan Syndrome (MS[MIM#614753]). NFIX is also implicated in theMarshall Smith syndrome (MSS[MIM#602535]). It was postulated that frameshift and splice site mutations around exons 6 –8 of NFIX gene may escape nonsense mediated RNA decay, and therefore exert dominant negative effect with strong deleterious consequences leading to the MSS. We present a 30 months old female referred to us in order tostudy her developmental delay and macrocephaly. The birthweight was in 50 thcentile, the length/height in 75th centile and OFC in 90thcentile. She presented frontal bos  sing, hypertelorism, slightly downslating palpebral ﬁssures, divergent strabismus, everted lower lip, and prominent chin; also pectum excavatum, several CAL spots and slightgeneralized hyperlaxity. No other relevant clinical ﬁndings were found. No pathological variations were identi ﬁed in the aCGH (qChip R, 60 K), MLPA and sequencing of NSD1 gene. Instead, a de novo frameshift variation in exon 8 (c.1112delT, p.Phe 371Serfs*30) was identi ﬁed in the NFIX gene. Variations in exon 8 are described in MSSpatients but in our case, the phenotype is likely compatible with Malan syndrome.

It is classi ﬁed into four subtypes (WS1 to WS4) according to clinical and genetic background. Absence ofclinical features characterizes WS2, while association with Hirschrpung disease or neurological involvement de ﬁnes WS4 and WS neurologic variant, respectively. WS isgenetically heterogeneous, with six genes already identi ﬁed including SOX10. We report on three new unrelated patients with WS2 and mutations in SOX10. Clinicaldescription: All three patients presented with congenital sensorineural deafness. Age at diagnosis ranged from 2 to 5 years. Pregnancy course and delivery were normal in allthree. No relevant family history, except for patient 2, with presumably affected father. All of them presented with variable degree of developmental delay.

Kokalj","Vokac ˇ1 1University Medical Centre Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, 2Biotechnical Faculty Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Introduction: Gene compensation between XX females and XY males comes usually with a random inactivation of one of parental X chromosomes in the female embryo (X chromosome inactivation, XCI, a ratio of 1:1 between bothX chromosomes). Deviation from this ratio is known as nonrandom inactivation of the X chromosome (NXCI). The XCI was analyzed in girls with idiopathic neurodevelop mental features (IND). Materials and Methods: We exam  ined DNA isolated from blood of 98 girls with IND (aged 0–21), and 115 control girls (aged 0 –16). Allele ratios of microsatellite polymorphism from human androgen recep  tor gene were used to determine XCI status. Results: XCI status from girls with IND was found to be nonrandom in60.3% (44 out of 73 heterozygotes), whereas control girls showed NXCI in 44.2% (42 out of 95), which is a statis  tically signi ﬁcant difference (p ,0.028). In subgroups of girls with IND following NXCI percentages were observed: in intelectual dissabilities (ID) subgroup 75% (p ,0.082; 6 out of 8), in subgroup with dysmorphic signs 62.8% (p , 0.046; 22 out of 35) and in subgroup with developmental delay (DD) 53.3% (p ,0.329; 16 out of 30). Conclusions: Our study identify signi ﬁcant differences in XCI pattern in girls with IND when compared with healthy control girls. We concluded that the determination of XCI may help interpret the role and effect of any genetic alterations onchromosome X detected in girls with IND. A. Erjavec Škerget: None. I. Jurkovi č:None. A.

The case group consists in 39 not intellectuallydisabled Brazilian females with male child affected by X  linked intellectual disability. To establish the X inactivation pattern, a STR in the Androgen Receptor (AR) was geno typed using the AR assay. Results: The control group pre  sented out of 120, four women with skewed ratio. However, three of them had family background of cancer, showingskewing as an indicative for cancer susceptibility. In the case group, ten presented partial skewed ratio and ﬁve had extreme skewing. Conclusions: It was possible to verify ahigher incidence of skewed X inactivation in women with affected male child, as shown by the literature. In future studies, we will further examine the association of theskewing with pathogenic CNVs in the X chromosome using microarray analysis, and hence ﬁnding the use of this assay in genetic counselling.

A X linked mentalretardation 63 syndrome caused by mutation in the ACSL4 (300157) gene and characterized by mild to severe mental retardation, behavioral manifestations, microcephaly andlanguage impairment (in some patients), have been descri  bed. Materials and methods: In this paper we report on a 10 years old boy with a complex phenotype, including severeintellectual disability (IQ 25), severe speech delay, micro  cephaly, severe growth delay, delayed bone age, and dys  morphic features. His cerebral MRI and hormonal screeningwere normal. NGS of 4813 gene panel (TruSight One, Mendeliome) and Sanger sequencing of exon 12 –14 ﬂanking regions of ACSL4 gene was performed. Results: Quantitative analyses of the NGS data identi ﬁed a hemi  zygous intragenic deletion in the ACSL4 gene, spanning part of exon12 exon 14 with a size of 5049 bp: seq[GRCh37/hg19]Xq22.3(108,903,631 –108,908,680). Only four pathogenic point mutations in patients with intellectual disability have been reported so far (Meloni et al., 2002;Longo et al., 2003; Yonath et al., 2011). A deletion invol  ving only ACSL4 gene or an intragenic deletion has not been described previously. Conclusion: The phenotype ofour patient is more severe than other cases reported before.

There are several candidate genes in this region for mental retardation and epilepsy. The main characteristics include intellectual disability, speech delay, epilepsy and speci ﬁc facial features. Our patient was an 8 year old boy with the original diagnosis of Angelman syndrome. His prenatal and perinatal periods were uneventful. His development seemed normal until the age of8 months, at which point it stalled after he developed sei  zures. His epilepsy was dif ﬁcult to control, requiring several antiepileptic medications. When he was 8 year old, hedemonstrated severe intellectual disability by unstable walking with wide based gait and uplifted arms, absence of meaningful word production, inability to communicate, andautistic behavior. Physical examination revealed failure to thrive, microcephaly, bitemporal narrowing, thick eye  brows, long and smooth philtrum, thin upper lip, borderlinelow set ears, and micropenis. Brain MRI showed only pituitary hypoplasia. Angelman syndrome was diagnosed based on his clinical features and epilepsy, although thechromosome study, FISH for 15q11.2, SNRPN methylation test, and MECP2 sequencing analysis, which were also negative, given 20% of the cases have a diagnosis with thenegative DNA methylation test. Interestingly, the chromo  somal microarray revealed de novo deletion of 7 Mb on the long arm of chromosome 9 (9q21.11 –9q21.2).

ADCA DN shows clinical overlap with hereditary sensory and autonomic neuropathy type 1 with dementia and deaf ness (HSAN1E) and is associated with PV in the same gene, i.e.DNMT1 . To date, eight ADCA DN families have been reported (coming from e.g. Italy, USA, Sweden, Canada)with four distinct underlying pathogenic variants in DNMT1 . Thus far, no cases with PV in Central European patients with ADCA DN have been reported. Methods:Following complex neurologic and clinical genetic exam  ination bidirectional Sanger DNA sequencing of exons 20 – 22 in DNMT1 was performed on the 3130xl platform (ThermoFisher Scienti ﬁc, USA). Results: We found a pre  viously described missense variant p.Ala570Val in DNMT1 in a 62 year old male patient who has been suffering fromnarcolepsy since the age of 41. He showed ﬁrst signs of hearing impairment at the age of 52, had ﬁrst signs of ataxia at 55 and became deaf at 56. Similar progressive develop ment had been documented in ﬁve other family members from within three consecutive generations. Discussion: The p.Ala570Val PV was previously detected in two Italianfamilies and one family from USA and Canada, respec  tively.

Accordingly, research aiming at the identi ﬁcation of genetic markers relevant fordiagnosis or therapy of attention de ﬁcit hyperactivity dis  order (ADHD) was not successful so far. ADHD is the most common mental disorder in children and adolescents, and can persist into adulthood. It has a high heritability of 75%   91%, which indicates a strong genetic in ﬂuence. Intense research by large international consortia focuses on ADHDas a complex disorder. Thousands of samples of affected and non affected subjects were genotyped in hypothesis  free genome wide association studies (GWAS). One of thebiggest of those studies conducted by Elia and coworkers in 2011 identi ﬁed deletions and duplications of genes coding for glutamate receptors in some ADHD patients and theirsiblings. Thus, subtypes of ADHD following a Mendelian pattern of inheritance could be assumed. Only a small number of publications on linkage analyses of large multi plex families with ADHD (Lin et al., 2013, Vegt et al., 2010; Amin et al., 2009, Romanos et al., 2008, Arcos  Burgos et Al., 2004) exist to date. In our newly founded“ADHD MoveS ”network, geneticists, psychologists, phy  sicians and bioinformaticians will continue this promising line of research investigating pedigrees with an ADHDphenotype, and additionally apply genetic, psychometrically measurable and stable cognitive and biological parameters, so called endophenotypes.

 Report of an ALS case associated with a new mutation in the TARDBP gene,P09.06,"F. Conforti1, A. Patitucci1, A. Magariello1, M. Muglia1,","R. Mazzei1, V. La Bella2","1Institute of Neurological Sciences, CNR, Mangone (CS), Italy,2University of Palermo, Palermo, Italy Introduction: Starting in early 2008, dominant muta  tions in TARDBP gene have been reported by several groups as a primary cause of ALS. To date, over 50mutations of TARDBP have been described not only in SOD1 negative fALS cases but also in sALS cases. Mate  rials and methods: The patient, a 80 year old woman, wasreferred with a history of progressive weakness of the right leg. Her family history was negative. After an extensive diagnostic workup, a diagnosis of ALS, spinal onset, wasmade. Mutation screening in ALS linked genes was per  formed by bi directional Sanger sequencing. Resources PolyPhen2, SIFT, Panther, were used for in silico char acterization of mutant protein. The progression rate ( ΔFS) gave a value of 4.2, indicating a rapidly progressing disease.938Ten months after diagnosis, she died because of a respira  tory failure. Results: Molecular analysis identi ﬁed a novel heterozygous substitution in exon 6 of TARDBP gene that leads to an amino acid change from serine to alanine at position 379 (p.S379A). Both PolyPhen2 and SIFT resources characterize p.S379A as benign while Pantherclassi ﬁcation system reports it with a SubPSEC of   1.00268, p _ 0.11948. Conclusion: We describe an appar  ently sALS patient with a new heterozygous TARDBPmutation in the codon 379 of exon 6, characterized by a late onset and a rapid disease progression.

It is pathologically character ized by extracellular amyloid plaques deposition, neuro ﬁ  brillary tangles, synapse and neuronal loss. Recently, accumulating cases have demonstrated a direct link betweenmicroRNAs (miRNAs) and AD. miRNAs are single  stranded RNAs, approximately 22 nucleotides in length. miRNAs regulating post transcriptionally gene silencing bypartially bases pairing with the 3 ’UTR of target mRNAs play important roles in several pathways such as cell pro  liferation, differentiation, apoptosis and protein secretion.Materials and Methods: The blood samples derived from 84 AD patients and 67 control subjects were composed, to identify the expression levels of 6 candidate circulatingmiRNAs (hsa miR 132 3p, hsa miR 186 5p, hsa miR 195  5p, hsa miR 219a 5p, hsa miR 3163 and hsa miR 3613 3p) for AD. Total RNA isolation was performed by TrizolReagent method from whole blood. The expression levels of selected miRNAs were analyzed by using comparativeΔΔC Tmethod in Real Time PCR. Data obtained from molecular analyze were statistically evaluated. Results: It was identi ﬁed that hsa miR 186 5p were markedly down  regulated in AD patients, while hsa miR 3163 and hsa miR  3613 3p were signi ﬁcantly upregulated in AD patients compared to controls (p < 0,05). However, signi ﬁcant dif  ferences in expression levels of hsa miR 132 3p, hsa miR  195 5p and hsa miR 219a 5p were not found between groups. Conclusions: These data indicate that hsa miR 186 5p, hsa miR 3163 and hsa miR 3613 3p may contribute to AD related neurodegeneration. Altered expression of these miRNAs might enable prospective applications as bio markers and candidates for molecular therapeutic targets. M.T. K ızıltuğ:None. M.E. Erdal: None. A. Özge: None. B.

Patients and Methods Healthy 11 year old boy attendingregular school. Pervasive developmental disorder was sus  pected at four, with severe ODD, and ADHD. Conventional and molecular karyotypes were performed. FISH experi ments were completed using BAC clones for breakpoint ’s approach. Gene expression assays were done using Taqman probes. Results The patient´s karyotype was 46,XY,t(8;17)(q24.3;q22)dn. aCGH revealed no genomic imbalances. FISH analysis showed that the CTD 2599D24 probe span  ned the translocation breakpoint at 8q24.3, involving 2genes ( TSNARE1 and BAI1 ). Breakpoint at 17q22 was delimited between RP11 293B16 and RP11 277L08 probes, with a gene encoding a non characterized proteininvolved. Gene expression assays showed low BAI1 gene expression in the proband, compared to controls. Conclu  sion We speculate on the potential pathogenicity of thegenes contained in the 8q24.3 region that are likely to be disrupted by the translocation breakpoint, and responsible for the clinical features of our patient. BAI1 gene is mainly expressed in the brain. Recently, in vivo studies suggest that BAI1 regulates spatial learning and synaptic plasticity in the hippocampus. BAI1 also interacts with BAIAP2/IRSp53 ,a gene with a potential role in autism and psychiatric dis  orders. Thus, we propose that the impairment of BAI1 gene is responsible of our patient ’s e behavioral phenotype. Further studies are ongoing to elucidate the exact breakpoint of the rearrangement.M.

Genetic factors play an important role in the etiology of ASDs; it has been estimated that sub  microscopic copy number variants (CNVs) are the cause ofASDs in ~ 5 –13% of patients. We elected to use aCGH to evaluate its ef ﬁcacy for identi ﬁcation and characterization of CNVs in a cohort of 178 patients with ASDs and toidentify novel ASDs genes. The analyses of the patients ’ genomes were performed using genome wide oligonucleo  tide microarrays (180k; Agilent Technology, OGT) with anaverage resolution of 30 kpz. We identi ﬁed 25 CNVs in 21 out of 178 (11.8%) patients. Pathogenic or likely pathogenic CNVs were detected in 12 (6.7%) patients, whereas CNVsof unknown clinical signi ﬁcance were found in 6.2% of patients with ASDs. All of the identi ﬁed CNVs were sub  microscopic in size (between 75 kb and 4.54 Mb) and thuscould not have been detected by standard karyotype ana  lysis. Our study further con ﬁrmed the potential of aCGH in elucidating the etiology of ASDs, demonstrated by theidenti ﬁcation of two novel genes: ARHGAP24 and SLC16A7 as pathogenic for ASDs and three genes: SNX19 , PIGN andHCN1 as candidate for ASDs.

Maviog ˘lu2,S .C¸am1","1Manisa Celal Bayar University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept.","of Medical Genetics, Manisa, Turkey,2Manisa Celal Bayar University, Faculty of Medicine, Dept. of Neurology, Manisa, Turkey Introduction: Episodic ataxia type 2 (EA2, OMIM#108500) is an autosomal dominant inheriteddisorder characterized by ataxia, dysarthria, vertigo, nausea and weakness. EA2 is due to mutations in the calcium voltage gated channel subunit alpha1A (CACNA1A) gene mapped to the 19p13.13 chromosomal location and plays a role in taking a calcium ion into the cell by a voltage gated channel. METHODS: CACNA1A gene sequence analysisincluding all coding exons and exon intron boundiries was performed. RESULTS: We examined 20 year old female patient who has been suffering from attacks of ataxia,headache, vertigo and also muscle weakness which has been progressed increasingly since the age of 13. Cranial MRI was showed hyperintensities consistent with frontalsubcortical demyelinating plaques in pericallosal, corpus callosum, periventricular white matter. Sequence analysis was revealed a heterozygous mutation in CACNA1A geneNM_001127222.1: c.2259_2260insCG; (p.A754Rfs*6) and c.561 G > A (p.T187T). While we examined both parents for the mutation, father was found heterozygous carrier andmother was not present. CONCLUSION: In this study a novel CACNA1A mutation was reported. According to In silico analysis softwares this mutation causes prematurestop codon and therefore it could be the cause of disorder. Although the father was the carier of the mutation, the absence of the clinical ﬁnding is suggesting the incomplete penetrance or expressivity difference. Also synonymous mutations might considered for the cause of clinical ﬁndings by making changes in protein expression and function.Therefore the reason of the disorder in this patient could be both gene and synonym mutations.

Complex AD etiology suggests the contribution of both genetic and environmental factors.Nowadays, there are about 150 AD susceptibility genes. However, their role in AD pathogenesis is generally unclear. Materials/methods We evaluated 150 AD susceptibility genes in a clinical cohort of 450 children with autism and intellectual disability, which were studied using SNP array molecular karyotyping and an original bioinformaticstechnology (Iourov et al., 2014). Results Unique CNVs of APP, PSEN1, NOS3, HFE were found in 5 patients (1%). These CNVs possiblyincrease AD risk in adulthood. CNVs of CR1 andCLU had a higher frequency (4.8%). Partial duplication of CR1 and partial triplication of CLU were found in 12 and 10 indi  viduals, respectively. Partial CLU loss was found in a patient. CR1 andCLU CNVs were de ﬁned as benign. Conclusions Studying AD susceptibility gene CNVs shows that at least two types of candidate genes for this disease exist. The ﬁrst type encompasses genes affected by rare CNVs, which are likely to be involved in AD patho genesis, whereas the second type encompasses genes affected by common CNVs, which are likely to be benign. Furthermore, the second type is probably considered asrelated to AD because of the common involvement in genomic variations producing false positive results in genome wide association studies.

Torres Dı ´az, R. Sola, M. Toledo, C.","Sanchez Hernandez, C. Alonso Cerezo; Hospital Universitario de la Princesa, Madrid, Spain Introduction: The Apolipoprotein E (ApoE) is a glyco  protein that transports lipids, thus maintaining and repairingneurons. The codifying gene is located in the chromosome 19.Two single nucleotide polymorphisms lead to changes of two amino acid ’s positions resulting in three major alleles ε2,ε3 and ε4. Temporal location is the most common form of pharmacoresistant epilepsy and is usually treated by surgery. The objective is to know if Apo E major alleles areassociated with the prognosis of pharmacoresistant surgery patients with temporal epilepsy. Materials and methods:We selected 63 pharmacoresistant epileptic patients (38 womenand 25 men) according to ILAE ’s criteria with temporal location. We classi ﬁed them in two groups based on the outcome of surgery using the Engel classi ﬁcation. The scales I (50) and II (1) refer to patients free or with rare seizures and III (7) and IV (5) to a worthwhile improvement or not after surgery. The genotype was determined with theLightCycler ®Real Time PCR System.

The majority of genetic defects in GRN consists of loss of function mutations, causing haploinsuf ﬁciency. Herein, we present the case of a 67 year old right handedman with a 6 year history of gradually progressive beha  vioural disturbances with irritability and sometimes aggressiveness, social withdrawal and obsessive repetitivebehaviors. In the family history, we found an uncle from the paternal line affected by dementia with behavioral disorders and progressive language dif ﬁculties. Considering the early onset and the positive family history, a genetic analysis was carried out, showing the presence of a novel heterozygous missense mutation c.53 C > T in the GRN gene. The het erozygous C to T transition resulted in a threonine (ACG) to methionine (ATG) substitution (p.Thr18Met). In our patient, we identi ﬁed a GRN missense mutation that was predicted to be probably damaging by the PolyPhen 2 software (with a score of 0.995, sensitivity 0.68 and spe  ciﬁtcity 0.97), and deleterious by the SIFT software (with a score of 0.01). GRN c.53 C > T was not found in 150 control subjects, but was detected in the ExAC browser with a very low minor allele frequency (MAF ,4.5 × 10 −5). Our ﬁndings suggesting that (1) rare coding variability in GRN may in ﬂuence the susceptibility to FTD and (2) highlight the importance of genetic analysis also in sporadic forms ofFTD.

Peculiar laboratory ﬁndings are acanthocytosis and McLeod blood  group phenotype. The disease includes CNS features similar to Huntington ’s disease and neuromuscular manifestations. Patient and methods: We report the case of a 52 year oldpatient with moderate dysarthria, scratching skin lesions, limb hypotonia and muscle wasting with reduced tendon reﬂexes, diffuse choreic movements with prominent oro  lingual dyskinesias and walk instability. He had a family history of chorea and seizures in the maternal grandfather, whilst both his parents and his sister did not show anyneurological anomaly. Brain MRI revealed caudate atrophy. Electromyography and nerve conduction study suggested sensory motor axonal polyneuropathy of lower limbs.Blood tests showed prominent CK elevation. We also observed the presence of acanthocytes.

A genome wide association study by the CORtisol NETwork (CORNET) consortium identi ﬁed com  mon variants at genes SERPINA6 (Serpin Family A Member 6)/SERPINA1 (Serpin Family A Member 1) in ﬂuencing the morning plasma cortisol and its binding protein in adults. Here, we investigated effect of these SNPs on diurnal and stress induced salivary cortisol levels in Finnish children ’s from Glycyrrhizin in Liquorice (GLAKU) birth cohort. Methods: Diurnal salivary cortisol (seven samples/day) and salivary cortisol during the Trier Social Stress Test for Chil dren (TSST C, seven samples) were measured in 186 children (50.5% girls; mean age ,8.09 years, SD ,0.31) with genome wide genotyping. We extracted 6 SNPs (r 2< 0.7) showing p values < 5 × 10−8in the CORNET meta analyses and calculated weighted polygenic risk score (PRS). Asso  ciation between PRS and cortisol measurements were ana lysed with mixed model and linear regression analyses using SPSS Statistics 24. Results: PRS associated with higher diurnal salivary cortisol at bedtime (p values < 0.008;PRS*time interaction p < 0.000032); higher nadir and cortisol awakening AUC increment (p < 0.030); and cortisol max  imum values upon awakening minus bedtime values (p <0.011). In TSST, PRS associated with maximum cortisol after stress minus baseline values (p < 0.042; PRS*stress time interaction p < 0.009), and cortisol maximum slope (p <0.043). Linear regression analyses with Bonferroni ’s correc  tion threshold p value (p < 0.0083) showed two SNPs rs7161521 ( SERPINA6 ) and rs4900229 ( SERPINA1 )a r e signiﬁcantly associated with cortisol single indices.

OBJECTIVE: Recent studies have con ﬁrmed that the suppressive function of regulatory T cells (T (reg)) is impaired in MS patients and that the FOXP3 gene is a crucial transcription factor in the regula  tion of CD4 +CD25+FOXP3 +Treg cells. Polymorph  isms in the promoter region of the FOXP3 gene may alter the gene expression level and, therefore, contribute to the disease susceptibility. METHODS: The present study aimedto investigate the possible association between single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs3761548 and rs2232365 in the FOXP3 gene and predisposition to MS. We conducted a case control study on 410 patients with sporadic MS and 446 healthy controls. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction restrictionfragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP). RESULTS: Signi ﬁcant differences in distribution of both rs3761548 and rs2232365 A allele were found in MS patients incomparison to controls. Haplotype frequencies were also different among the studied groups. The A A and C G haplotype blocks showed a signi ﬁcant difference between case and controls. CONCLUSION: we have provided fur  ther evidence for the association between genetic variations and haplotypes in FOXP3 and MS in Iranian population R. Dastmalchi: None. E",2017

Material and Methods: We included 60 (45F Female/ 15M Male) patients with HSSch, 99 (45 F/54 M) HS, and 100 (61 F/39 M) non smoker controls (NSC). The geno typing of COMT (rs4680 and rs6269), MPO (rs233327) and CNR2 (rs2501432) genes was determined by PolymeraseChain Reaction Restriction Fragment Length Polymorph  ism (PCR RFLP). Results and Discussions: The distributions of genotypes and allele frequencies were compared among the groups. The cases with HSSch had higher COMT (rs4680) Val/Val genotype than the HS and NSC groups (p ,0.001 and 0.034, respectively). The cases with HS had higher Val/Met genotype than HSSch and HNC groups (p ,0.001, p , 0.033, respectively). The frequency of Val allele was higherin HSSch than the HNC goups whereas the frequency of Met allele was higher in HS than in the HSSch groups (p , 0.047 and 0.001, respectively). The cases with HS hadhigher COMT (rs6269) LH genotype than the HSSch group (p:0.047).The cases with HHS had higher CNR2 TT gen  otype than the NSC group (p:0.019). The results of thestudy might suggest that the Val/Val genotype of COMT gene (rs4680) is associated with an increased risk for HSSch ’s and Val/Met genotype is associated with an increased risk for HS ’s. Both the LH genotype of COMT (rs6269) and the TT genotype of CNR2 are associated with an increased risk for HS ’s in Turkish population. *This study was partially supported by istanbul University ONAP BAP (47815) program .

Incomplete penetrance of theaffected genes and variable expressivity usually is indicated as cause of clinical features. Here we present two unrelated patients from Lithuania with opposite CNVs in the 16p11.2region. Methods and results: SNP CGH analysis using Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 BeadChips has been performed. 571 kb microdeletion at 16p11.2(29628020_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the ﬁrst male patient who has expressive and receptive language delay with minor facial and behavioral abnormalities.Smaller 366 kb microduplication of almost the same chro  mosome 16 region (29833488_30199805 hg19) has been detected in the second female patient with severely delayedspeech development, global psychomotor retardation, hypernasal speech, muscular hypotonia and dysmorphic features. Discussion: 16p11.2 region is a variable site withmany clinically insigni ﬁcant small CNVs detected. Larger CNVs, encompassing disease related genes, are subject for interpretation on clinical signi ﬁcance when neurological features are manifested. 16p11.2 CNVs are often detected in ASD patients but our patients do not manifest any similar features. Delayed speech is the only common clinical fea ture in both of our patients and it is one of most frequent features indicated in patients with 16p11.2 CNVs. Invol  vement of this genomic region in speech development hasbeen con ﬁrmed by several studies although candidate genes have not been determined yet.

2q11.2 distal deletion syndrome: case pre sentation and review of the relevant literature,P11.022,M. Matsuo,"1, T. Yamamoto1,2, K. Saito1;1Institute of","Medical Genetics, Tokyo Women ’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan,2Institute for Integrated Medical Sciences, Tokyo Women ’s Medical University, Tokyo, Japan. Introduction : The 22q11.2 microdeletion syndrome, the most common submicrosco pic chromosomal deletion syndrome, involves a complex genomic region witheight low copy repeats(LCRs) (named A to H). Approximately 90% of 22q11.2 microdeletion cases have a common 3 Mb deletion, spanning from LCR22 A to D,resulting from LCR mediated non allelic homologous recombination. Also, distal 22q11.2 microdeletion mediated by LCR22 D to H has recently been recognizedas a clinical entity. Herein, we report an additional case with a distal deletion. We also review the relevant literature. Case : The proband, a 25 year old man who is the ﬁrst child of a healthy non consanguineous Japanese couple, was delivered vaginally at term weighing 1865 g. Cleft lip,microtia, and aortic valve stenosis were recognized after birth. He was able to walk at age 18 months. He showed an articulation disorder at around age 4 years, and submucosalcleft palate was recognized. His intelligence quotient score by WISC III was 77 at 14 years. Results : The results of G banded chromosomal analysis and ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization analysis for the 22q11.2 deletion were normal. Chromosomal microarray testing showed arr 22q11.21q11.22(21,798,705 – 22,916,612) × 1(hg19). Conclusion : This case had a 1.1 Mb deletion ﬂanked by LCR22 D and E, and presented growth restriction and acongenital heart disease other than conotruncal defect, consistent with previously reported cases. It is estimated that haploinsuf ﬁciency of the MAPK1 gene, with essential function in embryonic development, encompassed by LCR22 D and E would be responsible for these features.

 Unusual genetic ﬁnding in a patient suspected to have Alstrom syndrome,P11.03,"G. Pemovska1, M. Kocova2, E. Sukarova Angelovska2,",J. Marshall3,"1University Clinic of Endocrinology, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of,2University Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of,3The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, United States Introduction . Alstrom syndrome is rare disease caused by mutations of the ALMS1 gene presenting with diabtes mellitus type 2 (DM2) beginning in childhood accompaniedwith retinal dystrophy and blindness. Other organs such as kidney could also be affected. Hyperandrogenism can aslo appear. On the other hand, COHEN syndrome is caused bymutations in the COH1 gene and presents with speci ﬁc facial and body features, retinal changes, severe ambliopy, obesity with glucose intolerance and leukopenia. Material and methods . A female patient 35 years old presented with fatigue, abdominal pain and headache. She was diagnosed with diabetes mellitus type 2 since child hood. Her vision started to fade since puberty and she was virtually blind. She was obese and her menstrual cycling was irregular and amenorrhoea followed. Patient was fol lowed up by regular testing of HbA1c, FSH, LH, estro  genes,testosterone cortisol and ocular examinations. Next generation sequencing was applied for the genetic analysis. Results . Hypertension, retinitis pigmentosa, reasonably controlled DM2(HbA1c7%) and hyperandrogenism (high testosgterone levels and reversed LH/FSH index) weredetected. Genetic analysis for ALMS1 gene did not detect any mutations. However, she was a compound heterozygote for two COH1 mutations, one disease causing VPS13B:c.6656 G > A (p.Cys2219Tyr) and one neutral VPS13B: c.1028 A > G (p.Gln343rg). Conclusion . Symptoms of Alstrom and Cohen syndrome might overlap and differential diagnosis is needed. Despite the complete genetic analysis it is not clear whether the diagnosis of Cohen syndrome can be made in this patientsince she carries only one pathogenic COH1 mutation. G. Pemovska: None. M.

We present results of 19th year ’s observation of phenotype changes in the girl with monosomy 7q36.1 →qter and trisomy 9p21.1 →pter. In addition, the unexpected others imbalances, which could further modify phenotype, were detected by molecular studies. Materials and Methods: Phenotype analyzes of thegirl were performed at age of 2, 5, 8, 16 and 19 years, according to quantitative method of Munchen Dysmor  phology Data Base (MDDB) Array CGH was carried outusing the (OGT) CytoSure ™ISCA oligoarray set (Oxford Gene Technology, Oxford, UK), and interpreted using CytoSure Software Version 4.5.3 [hg19; GRCh37,Feb2009]. Results: Numerous dysmorphic features, such as asymmetric face, sloping forehead, high diffuse frontal hairline, hypertelorism, ﬂat nasal bridge, thick tip of the nose, short philtrum crowded, misaligned teeth, high palate, macrogenia, low set ears, hypertrichosis, lordosis, sacral dysostosis, dystonia and distinct developmental pro ﬁle, with intellectual disability and delay of speech development consistent with Rethore s., HPE 3 and Currarino s. were found. We detected loss of 7.56 Mb at 7q36.1 →qter and gain of 28.05 Mb at 9p21.1 →pter, con ﬁrming karyotype imbalance as a result of paternal translocation with the breakpoint at PRKAG2/7q36.1 (MIM *602743) and thegain of 144 kb at Xq27.1 region that contained SOX3 gene could explain the phenotypic features observed in this girl. Conclusions: aCGH studies might be essential in elucidat ing the effect of genomic changes on the phenotype. Polish Grant   N/ST/ZB/16/001/1106 A.T. Midro: None. B.A. Kedra: None. B. Panasiuk: None.

Linkageanalyses and genome wide association studies have identi  ﬁed several genomic susceptibility regions for NSCL/P. The WNT genes including WNT3 are strong candidates for NSCL/P, since they are involved in regulating mid face development and upper lip fusion. Materials and Methods: This study tested association of the WNT3 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs3809857 G/T and rs9890413 G/ A, with the risk of NSCL/P in an Iranian population. The allelic and genotypic frequencies were determined in 113unrelated Iranian subjects with NSCL/P and 220 control subjects using PCR and RFLP methods. A p value of < 0.05 was considered statistically signi ﬁcant. Results :The rs3809857 GT genotype was signi ﬁcantly lower (P ,0.039, OR,0.55, 95% CI ,0.30–0.97) in the NSCL/P (21.2%) than the control group (30.42%). For the rs9890413 G/Apolymorphism, neither genotype nor allele frequencies were signiﬁcantly different between the two case and control groups. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the WNT3 rs3809857 GT genotype may have a protective effect against NSCL/P in Iranian population. H. Farrokhi Karibozorg: None. A. Ebadifar: None. K.

 Evaluation of three patients with Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba Syndrome,P11.06,"E. Mihci1, E. Manguo ğlu2, P. Özüçetin2, F. Algül2,B .N .",Güzel1;1Akdeniz University School of Medicine Depart,"ment of Pediatrics Divison of Pediatric Genetics, Antalya, Turkey,2Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Antalya, Turkey. Bannayan Riley Ruvalcaba Syndrome(BRRS) is a rare disorder cause by a mutation in the PTEN gene which isdetected in 60% of patients with BRRS and located on chromosome 10q23.3. BRRS occurs both in an autosomal dominant and a sporadic manner. The characterized clinicalﬁndings of BRRS are multiple lipomas, macrocephaly, hemangioma, hamartomatous intestinal polyposis, devel  opmental delay and speckled pigmentation on the malegenitalia. The penile maculae are possibly the most marked and valuable characteristic for diagnosis of BRRS. The PTEN is a tumor suppressor gene that has a signi ﬁcant role in the molecular pathways of cellular proliferation, migra  tion and apoptosis. In this report, we presented threepatients with BRRS. All of them were evaluated for clinical and radiological ﬁndings of BRRS and by molecular genetic analysis for PTEN mutation. The aim of the present report is to increase awareness of BRRS and emphasize that mac  rocephaly and genitale freckling are important clues fort he diagnosis. E. Mihci: None. E. Manguo ğlu:None. P.

Case Presentation: Our proposita was born at term via caesarean section with a birth weight of 1.95 kilograms. She was the third child to a non consanguineous Malay couple and the pregnancy was complicated with Gestational Dia  betes on diet control. She had mild laryngomalacia, gas  troesophageal re ﬂux disease and seizures. Physical signs included microcephaly, hemangioma, low set ears, cleft palate, micrognatia, sacral pit with tuft of hair and the typical BOS posture. She also had retinopathy with left eyecorneal ulcer. Her cardiovascular ﬁndings were atrial septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus. Investigations: Chro  mosomal analysis and consultation with a geneticist con cluded that she had 46 xx Bohring Opitz Syndrome overlapped with C syndrome. MRI brain showed hypopla  sia of the Corpus Callosum. Flexible Naso Pharyngo Laryngoscope (FNPLS) showed tubular epiglottis with evidence of in ﬂammation and re ﬂux. Treatment: Goal  directed holistic care was the mainstay. The recurrent lunginfections were managed with inpatient intravenous anti  biotic therapy and assisted ventilation while enteral feeding was initiated via PEG tube. Conclusion: She succumbed toa Respiratory Syncitial Virus and Pseudomonas pneumonia complicated with sepsis at the age of 2 years and 11 months.

We aimed to uncover the genetic bases of complex phenotype in a patient with r(22). Materials and Methods: r(22) was found by metaphase analysis. Micro deletions were detected by Agilent Technologies 60 K microarray and con ﬁrmed by qPCR. r(22) was con ﬁrmed and monosomy 22 was observed by FISH with CEP14/22and probe for TBC1D22A gene located close to del22q13.32q13.33. The origin of mutant chromosome 22 was determined by SNP analysis. Results: We present afour year old girl with psychomotor development delay, hyperactivity, sleep disorder, and r(22), initially revealed by cytogenetic analysis. To specify the breakpoints aCGH wasperformed; del3q13.31 and del22q13.32q13.33 were found. Del3q13.31 contains the only gene   TUSC7 , which expression is regulated together with neighboring LSAMP , associated with neuropsychiatric disorders in patients with 3q13.31 deletion (MIM615433). Deletion was inherited from healthy mother. 22q13.32q13.33 deletion leads toPhelan McDermid syndrome (MIM606232). In our patient it appeared de novo at maternal chromosome 22.

University of Acibadem, Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Genetics, Istanbul, Turkey Baraitser Winter cerebrofrontofacial (BWCFF) syn  drome is a well de ﬁned rare developmental disorder affecting multiple organ systems. It is characterized by the combination of congenital ptosis, high arched eyebrows,hypertelorism, ocular colobomata and brain malformations, such as lissencephaly and pachygyria. Other typical features include postnatal short stature, microcephaly, mild to severeintellectual disability, seizures and hearing loss. BWCFF is caused by missense mutations in the cytoplasmic beta  and gamma actin genes, namely ACTB andACTG1 .We report on a 7 year old boy with BWCFF who initially presented with history of bilaterally hip, knee and elbow dislocations and cleft lip/palate, and craniofacial features. He had afriendly persona with mild developmental delay. Walked independently at age 3, ﬁrst words were at age 3,5.The main clinical ﬁndings included mild intellectual disability, short stature, microcephaly, craniosynostosis, hypertelorism, macroblepheron, wide/puffy eyelids, high arched eyebrows, broad bi ﬁd nose, long philtrum, macrostomia, abnormal teeth, small/grooved chin, ear creases, short and webbed neck, pterygia of axilla, wide spaced nipples, umbilical hernia, broad thumb, brachydactyly, broad abnormal halluces and joint subluxation.

A case with chromosome 3 imbalance: dupli cation 3q and deletion 3p,P11.17,"E. Tasdelen , E. Gokpinar, T. Tuncal ı; Ankara Uni","versity, Faculty of Medicine, Departments of Medical","Genetic, Ankara, Turkey. Introduction: The partial duplication of 3q and partial deletion 3p syndromes are rare, but clinically recognizable conditions. It has been shown to emerge from the meioticrecombination of the 3rd chromosome containing a peri  centric inversion in one of the parents. The 3q +syndrome is con ﬁned in 3q26.3 q27 critical region and contains one or many of the conditions such as developmental delay, synophrys, long philtrum, up slanting palpebral ﬁssures, broad nose, hypertrichosis and congenital malformationssuch as heart diseases and genital hypoplasia. The 3p  phenotype is caused by deletions from 200 kb to 12.5 mb in 3pter p25 region. Symptoms and severity of the conditionsmay vary due to the size of the loss and genes effected   a characteristic of contigous gene syndromes   and can be manifested by psychomotor retardation, short stature, andcraniofacial dysmorphic features. Case Report: We here present a 3,5 years of age male with delayed development, dysmorphic facial features,strabismus and hirsutism. The patient has an operated congenital VSD. Cytogenetics revealed a structural anbnormality as 46,XY,add(3)(p26). We tested the possibleparental transmission and found out a maternal pericentric inversion. FISH analysis in subtelomeric regions showed a deletion at 3p and a duplication at 3q on the short arm ofchromosome 3. Patient ’s resultant karyotype is 46,XY,rec (3)dup(3)(q?q26.1) inv(3)(p26q26.1)mat[20].ish rec(3)inv (3)(p26)(D3S4559 ,D3S4560 +)(q26.1)(D3S4560 +). Conclusion: The duplicated segment of the rearranged chromosome most probably contains the critically de ﬁned956region for this syndrome. Hence, we will carry out high resolution methods to determine the effected genes and try to establish a phenotype genotype correlation. E. Tasdelen: None. E. Gokpinar: None. T. Tuncal ı: None.

The related gene of this disorder, elongation factor Tu GTP binding domain containing 2 (EFTUD2) is mapped in the 17q21.31 chromosomal location and consists of 28 exons. Methods:We examined Whole exome sequencing and the outcome was con ﬁrmed with Sanger Sequencing. At the same time karyotype analysis was performed to patient. Results: Thecase was consulted due to short stature and dysmorphic appearance. On the examination; microcephaly, down  slanted palpebral ﬁssure, ptosis, broad nasal bridge, high palate, retrognathia, posterior rotate ears, short neck, chest deformity, bilateral brachydactyly, clinodacty in the ﬁfth ﬁnger, pes planus. Because there is no speci ﬁc pre diag  nosis, whole exom DNA sequencing was done and an unreported c.2702 T > G (p.F901C) heterozygous splice region mutation was detected in the EFTUD2 gene. There isno mutation detected on father but study on mother still continues. Conclusions: It has been determined that the variant causing the amino acid change in the evolutionarilyconserved region is pathogenic according to the in silico prediction tools.

KSnegatively affects the formation of spermatogenesis and testosterone production. It is also increases the formation of thrombosis but molecular mechanism has not been welldescribed. Plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI 1), also known as serpine1, is a protein which in humans is encoded by the gene SERPINE1. Elevated PAI 1 is a risk factor forthe formation of thrombosis. PAI 1 gene polymorphisms in a promoter region 4 G/4 G, 4 G/5 G, 5 G/5 G were observed in patients with deep vein trombosis. In this study; PAI 1gene variants and its effects on patients with KS were examinated. Methods: Forty one KS patients (47,XXY) and 50 age matched controls participated in our study. DNAwas isolated from patients ‘periferal blood and Real Time PCR was used to detect known SNPs in PAI 1 gene. In addition, PAI 1 plasma levels were measured by EL İSA. Results: No signi ﬁcant difference was found between PAI 1 gene and KS (p > 0,05). However, signi ﬁcant difference was observed in PAI 1 plasma levels (high PAI 1 plasmalevel in KS / p ,0.020). Moreover, clinical features related to thromboembolism especially varicose veins were observed in KS patients excessively (p ,0.04).Conclusion: We think that PAI 1 gene variants may be affected by other mechanism.This study was supported by BAP 58210 B.

A clinical diagnosis of MCAP made in a newborn girl was con ﬁrmed molecularly by detection of a mosacisim for a novelmutation in PIK3CA 11 years later. Cerebellar overgrowth with impending tonsillar herniation necessitated acute decompressive surgery at age nine months and was com plicated by multiple cerebral/cerebellar infarctions post  operatively. Additional clinical features included: hydrocephalus, pronounced cerebral overgrowth withhemimegalencephaly, epilepsy, developmental delay, recurrent lingual hemangiomas, short stature and hypopi  tuitarism with growth hormone and cortisol de ﬁciency. G  banding revealed a 45,X cell line in 7% of blood lympho  cytes. FISH analysis showed 17,5% monosomy X in ﬁbroblasts and 98% in resected cerebellar tissue. NGS panel analysis in skin ﬁbroblasts revealed a novel heterozygous mutation in PIK3CA (NM_006218.2) c.3129 G > A p. (Met1043Ile) in 23% of cells. The variant was absent inblood; analysis of cerebellar tissue is pending. Report of a PIK3CA patient harbouring a germline mutation in PTPN11 led to speculation about a “second hit ”mechanism   could some germline variants predispose for somatic PIK3CA mutations? Growth regulation is impaired in Turner syn  drome, as in the RAS/MAPK pathway disorders.

Previous genetic tests performed with negative results: CGH array, deletions in subtelomeric regions, Fragile X síndrome and Opitz GBBB syndrome type I. RASopathies NGS panel is requested by thegeneticist. Materials and Methods: A NGS panel of RASopathies was performed. Paired end sequencing 2 × 151pb using TruSight One kit (Illumina) in MiSeq (Illu  mina). Segregation study in proband ’s parents by PCR ampli ﬁcation and Sanger sequencing Results: The proband is heterozygous for the Val1212Ile variant (c.3634 G > A) intheNF1 gene. Parental studies demonstrated that the variant has de novo occurrence (however, a germinal mosaicism couldn´t be excluded). The Val1212Ile missense change hasnot be previously reported as a disease causing variant but replaces an evolutionarily conserved amino acid residue; computational tools are agree on the predicted pathogenicimpact on the protein. Therefore this missense change is considered a pathogenic variant. A Noonan syndrome (NS) phenotype occurs in approximately 12% of individuals withNF1 (Colley et al 1996) and other cases of missense var  iants in NF1 associated with NS phenotype or NF1 Noonan phenotype has been previously described. The Val1212Ilevariant is localized within RAS GAP domain in neuro ﬁ  brimin as other documented NF1 pathogenic variants rela  ted to NS (Chen et al 2014). Conclusions: A likelypahogenic variant with de novo occurrence is described in NF1 gene: Val1212Ile. This case illustrate the usefulness of NGS analysis in molecular diagnosis of NS where distin guishing RASopathies from other developmental disorders with overlapping symptoms is a challenge. C.

RSTS is primarily due to mutations in CREBBP (approxi  mately 55% of cases) or EP300 (approximately 8% of cases). Herein we reported a RTS patient with a novel mutation of the CREBBP gene (c.2057dupC) who presented with atypical facial appearance, feeding dif ﬁculties and recurrent respiratory infection. Materials and Methods: DNA was extracted from EDTA peripheral blood samples using a commercial kitaccording to the instructions of the manufacturer (Invitro  gen, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The sequencing reactions were performed using the MiSeq Illumina sequencer (Illumina,San Diego, CA). Data analysis was performed by MiSeq Reporter. A written informed consent for the publication of the patient ’s pictures was given by his parents. Results: The positive ﬁndings that overlaps with RSTS was microcephaly, beaked nose, broad great thumbs/hal  luces and short stature. Sequencing of CREBBP revealed a C duplication at c.2057 position in the CREBBP gene (c.2057dupC), a frameshift mutation predicted to result in premature termination at the 726th amino acid of CREBbinding protein (p.Ala687SerfsTer*39). Conclusion: With this paper, we reported a novel fra  meshift mutation which is lead to premature stop codon inCREBBP gene.

Detection of anaplastic lymphoma kinase(ALK) rearegements in patients with non small celllung cancer (NSCLC)is highly recommended in clinical guidelines. As a result of inversion of ALK gene with EML4 gene, EML4 ALK complex occurs. EML4 ALKcomplex is continously active which results in continous cell proliferation. FISH is known as ‘’gold standard ” method in detection of EML4 ALK fusion gene, whichmostly seen in adenocarcinoma. Success rates of treat  ment with tyrosine kinase inhi bitiors after detection of this complex is high. In our study we aimed to underly theoutcomes of detection of EML4 ALK gene rearrengement in our clinics.

Aslım2","1Necmettin Erbakan University, Konya, Turkey,2Gazi","University, Ankara, Turkey962Introduction: Plants constitute a primary source of tra  ditional drugs which are highly effective in the treatment of many forms of cancer. Materials and Methods: Antioxidant content of S.grandis methanol extract (SGME) was deter  mined spectrophotometrically. The phenolic acid composi  tion of SGME was determined by LC MS/MS analysis. Theantiproliferative effect of SGME on the HT 29 was deter  mined by MTT method. Following the treatment with SGME, the change in the expression levels of the genes andproteins involved in the apoptosis in HT 29 was determined by RT PCR and Western blot. Results: It was shown that while its total phenolics content is the highest, SGME ’s licopene content is the lowest. In the phenolic acid com  position of the plant extract, vanillic acid is the component with the highest amount, while the component with thelowest amount is gallic acid. The IC 50dose of the plant extract was calculated as 250 μg/mL for 48 h. The decrease was identi ﬁed as 1.63 fold in the expression of the BCL2 gene, compared to the control. The expression of BAX, CASP3, CASP7, CASP8, CASP9, CYCS, FAS andTP53 genes increased to 1.52, 1.52, 1.76, 1.81, 1.46, 1.91, 1.18and 1.79 fold, respectively, compared to the control. According to western blot analyses, the expression levels of proteins were consistent with the expression levels of thegenes. Conclusions: It is believed that SGME would become a new therapeutic agent for cancer treatment and that it may stand out in the product oriented applications inthe pharmaceutical industry.

Cheah1,"1UCSI University, Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia,2Advanced Molecular Pathology Laboratory, SingHealth Tissue Repository, Singapore,3National University Hospital, NUH, Singapore,4Sunway University Hospital, Selangor, Malaysia Introduction: Precision medicine is an emerging approach for disease prevention and treatment that takes into account individual variability in genes, environment, and lifestyles. While some advances in precision medicinehave been made, the practice is not currently in use for most diseases. Targeted diagnostic tests such as ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) helps to determine treatment that is designed to patient ’s distinctive genetic pro ﬁle. Patients are more likely to bene ﬁt from treatment sinceFISH diagnostic tests offer clinicians a standardized and clinically validated method. Currently, information on the pattern and incidence of C MYC, BCL2 andBCL6 gene rearrangement in B cell Non Hodgkin Lymphoma (NHL) are not available for Malaysian lymphomas, which preclude the application of such knowledge into the context of pre cision medicine. Hence, this study aims to investigate the patterns of C MYC, BCL2 andBCL6 gene rearrangement in Malaysian B cell NHL using FISH. Materials and Methods:Eighty one paraf ﬁn embedded tumour samples between years 2011 to 2015 were collected and investigated via immunohistochemistry and interphase FISH. Results: Therewas a signi ﬁcant difference detected between the nodal and extranodal sites for BCL2 (p,0.01**), C MYC (p,0.03*) andIgH (p,0.006**) genes suggesting that there is an association between the lymphoma sites and the gene rearrangement. Conclusions: Undoubtedly, there is more to be learned of the B cell pathogenesis arising at differentlymphoma sites and through FISH based tests, accurate cancer diagnostics can help determine the effective therapy for patients.

The BRAF proto oncogene plays an important role in the MAP Kinase signaling pathway during colorectal tumor  igenesis. The presence of the V600E mutation at theBRAF gene in ﬂuences the response of a tumor to che  motherapy. However, the association between the V600E mutation and the clinicopathological features of CRCremains controversial. Molecular genetic analysis of KRAS, and BRAF genes was carried out in a cohort of 34 Tunisian colorectal adeno carcinoma specimens. BRAF V600E mutation was investigated using extracted DNAs from formalin  ﬁxed paraf ﬁn embedded tumor tissues and sequencing of a short fragment of 80 pb of BRAF exon15. Whereas, frequent mutations (in 20% of cases) with four heterozygous variants (G12D, G12S, G12V and G13D) were detected in KRAS, no mutation in the BRAFgene was detected. A recent meta analysis revealed that the overall BRAF V600E mutation frequency is 10.8 percent in the literature and that the V600E mutationwas signi ﬁcantly associated with advanced TNM stage, poor differentiation, mucinous histology, and tumorslocalisation (proximal colon). There was a signi ﬁcant association between BRAFV60 0E mutation and wild type KRAS. More over, many authors consider that V600E mutation could be used to supplement standard clinical and pathological staging for the better management of individual CRC patients, and could be considered as apoor prognostic marker for CRC.Further studies are jus  tiﬁed to examine the prognostic and/or predictive value of this marker in different sta ges of Tunisian colorectal cancer patients.

However, it is still uncertain how accurate estimates of cancer risk were. We, therefore, undertook to determine theprevelance of mutations in unselected ascertainments irre  spective of family history. Material and Methods: We pooled 129 index case patients with female breast cancer, unselected for family history. BRCA1 andBRCA2 mutation analysis were per  formed by Next Generation Sequencing. We analyzed allexons and exon intron connections as well as untranslated regions of BRCA1 andBRCA2 genes. Results: Among all cases, only one of the mutation carriers had a family history of breast cancer. We have identi ﬁed pathogenic mutations in 18 of 129 cases (14%). The proportion of BRCA mutations were; 39% (n ,7) in BRCA1 gene and 61% (n ,11) in BRCA2 gene. Moreover, 10 of 11 BRCA2 mutations (90%) were novel mutations that96440% (n ,4) were deleterious and 60% (n ,6) were SNVs (single nucleotide variations). Conclusion: Mutation analysis is more often suggested for speci ﬁc cases with high family risk. However, even in this small case series, our results showing the importance of general mutation screening would identify many carriers. A. Bisgin: None. I. Boga: None. O. Yalav: None. O.

 Deletion of exon 8 in the BRCA1 gene in the Czech population,P12.08,"M. Blas ˇkova´, Z. Vlc ˇkova´, R. Ala ´nova´, R. Michalovska ´,","M. Rı ´mska, M. Konec ˇny´","GHC Genetics, Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Breast cancer is the second most common cancer disease among women in the Czech Republic with incidence of 123.9/100000 women per year. Hereditarybreast cancer represents approximately 10% of cases. We tested 620 Czech families suspected for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer syndrome for the presence of LGRs inBRCA1/2 genes. In three families we identi ﬁed a rare deletion of exon 8 in the BRCA1 gene. Such a deletion was previously described in Algerian and Dutch populations andboth deletions vary in the number of deleted nucleotides. Our aim was to specify the deletion of exon 8 and compare the data to previous results from other populations. Meth ods: Isolation of DNA from two independent blood samples was performed using a QiaGen kit. Analysis of long dele  tions and duplications of BRCA1/2 genes was performed using MLPA kits Salsa MLPA P002 BRCA1 and Salsa MLPA P045 BRCA2/CHEK2. Long range PCR and San  ger sequencing was used to determine exact length of thedeletion. Results: Patient no. 1, with the BRCA1 exon 8 deletion is heterozygous for a 3.5 kb deletion (NG_005905.2: g.115421_118954del) including a part ofintron 7, whole exon 8 and a part of intron 8. Presented alteration differs from 2.6 kb and 5.7 kb deletions pre  viously described in Algerian and Dutch populations. Fur ther genetic testing revealed another two non related Czech families again carrying exon 8 deletion of the BRCA1 gene. Currently, we are testing its length and localization in orderto determine whether it represents the same alteration as speciﬁed before. M. Bla šková: None. Z. Vl čková: None. R. Alánová: None. R.

In this retrospective study we report the outcomes of BRCA clinical testing in Turkish individuals with personal andfamilial history of breast/ovarian cancer. Materials and Methods: 55 breast cancer patients and 51 at risk indivi  duals undergoing BRCA1 and BRCA2 full sequencing inMarmara University, Medical Genetics Laboratory from 2015 to 2016 were included in this study. Clinical infor  mation, including demographic and personal/family cancerhistory data were obtained. Results: 67% (37/55) of breast cancer patients and 100% (51/51) of individuals at risk reported breast/ovarian cancer familial history. Whilemutations of BRCA1 and BRCA2 were detected in ﬁve and ﬁve breast cancer cases respectively, they were one and two in individuals at risk. So, while mutation rate in theseselected breast cancer cases was 17.5% (10/57), it was 5.7% (3/52) in the risk group. Conclusion: Our results show a high frequency of mutations in our breast cancer patients.We can conclude that the criteria of the patient selection was successful. Although NGS is an ef ﬁcient method for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screening, many other genesneed to be sequenced in HBOC cases. Besides this, increasing the number of analysed genes will increase the number of variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance in clinical testing. E. Arslan Ates: None. A. Turkyilmaz: None. B.B.

Dog ˘an1","1Numune Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey,","2Ankara Training and Research Hospital, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Pathogenic variants in BRCA1 and 2 are associated with hereditary female and male breast cancer and ovarian cancer. Less commonly, BRCA2 pathogenic variants are associated with prostate cancer, pancreaticcancer, and melanoma. Materials and methods: We inves  tigated BRCA1 and BRCA2 genetic alterations. Sequence analysis and Multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁ  cation (MLPA) methods were implemented. Results: We found a pathogenic variant in 3 patients (9%). Of them, c.2800 C > T and c.5194 12 G > A are known pathogenicvariants, whereas BRCA1 exon 8 duplication is a novel alteration, which we presume it may cause breast cancer. Exon 8 duplication was also observed in a breast cancerdiagnosed female relative. In remaining patients, non  pathogenic variants were found in heterozygous or homo  zygous condition. BRCA1: Q356R (7%), D693N (12%),P871L (19%), E1038G (19%), S1040N (2%), K1183R (17%).

 The ESR1 Gene rs1801132 variation and Breast Cancer risk in Iran,P12.12,"S. Abbasi1, S. Kalbasi2","1School of allied Medicine, Tehran University of Medical","Sciences, Tehran, Iran, Islamic Republic of,2Faculty of Veterinary, University of Tehran, Tehran, Iran, Tehran,Iran, Islamic Republic of Abstract Iranian breast cancer patients are relatively younger than their Western counterparts. Evidence suggeststhat alterations in estrogen signaling pathways, including ESR1( estrogen receptor  α), occur during breast cancer966development in Caucasians. Epidemiologic studies have revealed that age incidence patterns of breast cancer in Asians differ from those in Caucasians. Genomic data for ESR1 in either population is therefore of value in the clinical setting for Iranian breast cancer. A case control study was conducted to establish a database of ESR1 polymorphisms in Iranian women population in order to compare Western and Asian with Iranian (Asian Caucasians) distributions and to evaluate ESR1 polymorphism as an indicator of clinical outcome. DNA was extracted from Iranian women with breast cancer referred to Imam Khomeini Hospital Complex clinical breast cancer group (150 patients) and in healthyindividuals (147 healthy control individuals). PCR single  strand conformation polymorphism technology was per  formed. A site of silent single nucleotide polymorphism(SNP) rs1801132 was found, The frequency of allele 1 in codon 325 (CCC →CCG) was signi ﬁcantly higher in breast cancer patients (39.6%) than in control individuals (28.9%;P,0.007). The allele CCG had also signi ﬁcant association with the occurrence of lymph node metastasis. Data suggest thatESR1 polymorphisms in exon 4 codon 325 is correlated with various aspects of breast cancer in Iran. ESR1 geno  type, as determined during presurgical evaluation, might represent a surrogate marker for predicting breast cancerlymph node metastasis.

The pre  sence of MTR 2756AA genotype appeared to be associate with 2 fold increased risk of cancer (OR ,2.00, 95%CI: 1.11–3.60). The majority of carriers BRCA1/BRCA2 mutations also had MTR 2756 AA genotype (90% to 60% in non carriers; χ2,6.3; OR ,6.0, 95% CI: 1.29 –27.91, p < 0.05), whereas frequency of genotypes containing pro  tective MTR 2756 G allele (MTR 2756 AG, MTR 2756 GG) was extremely low (10% to 40% in non carriers; χ2, 6.3; OR ,0.17, 95% CI: 0,03 –0,77, p < 0.05). The results we have obtained allow to suggest that within group of patients diagnosed with familial breast/ovarian cancer, thecarriers of MTR 2756 AA genotype have 6 fold increased risk bearing mutations in genes BRCA1/BRCA2, whereas presence of MTR 2756 G allele reduced this risk to 5 times.In conclusion, the carrying of MTR 2756 AA genotype seems to be highly probable risk factor for breast cancer in West Ukrainian population.

Gene expression of S1P1 and S1P3 was determined by Real Time PCR. Results: In this study, S1P1 and S1P3 gene expressions in tissues (1.03 and 1.16 fold, respectively) were found to be higher than PBMC samples in non metastatic breast cancer patients. In addition, in PBMC samples S1P1 levelsdecreased by 2.90 fold in patients with non metastatic breast cancer, increased by 1.33 fold in patients with metastatic breast cancer. S1P3 levels decreased by 3.35 foldin patients with non metastatic breast cancer and 1.45 fold in patients with metastatic breast cancer. Conclusions: The result of our study showed that both gene expressions werehigher in cancerous tissues than in normal tissues. The expression of the S1P1 gene in PBMCs is increased in non  metastatic breast cancer patients compared to non cancerindividuals, while it is increased in metastatic breast cancer patients. S1P3 is lower in both non metastatic and meta  static individuals than non cancer individuals.

One ofthe hallmarks of breast cancer prognosis is the increase in aromatase expression. The co expression of kisspeptin and aromatase in same cells may imply an association betweentwo. In this regard our aim was to research the possible effect of kisspeptin on aromatase expression in MCF 7 breast cancer cell line, which express both proteins. Humanbreast cancer cell line MCF 7 cells were treated with either 1, 10 or 100 nM of kisspeptin (Metastin) and/or Kisspeptin 2,3,4 (Kisspeptin receptor antagonist) (100 nM, 1000 nM)for 6,24 and 48 h. Aromatase (CYP19A1) and kisspeptin receptor (GPR54) mRNA expressions were determined byReal time PCR. Actin gene was used as an internal control. Treatment with 10 nM Kisspeptin (Metastin) increased CYP19A1 and GPR54 mRNAs expressions at 6,24 and 48 h, while this inducing effect was abolished by the addition of the Kisspeptin receptor inhibitor Kisspeptin 2,3,4.In conclusion, regulatory effect of kisspeptin on aromataseexpression is possibly mediated via kisspeptin receptor dependent mechanisms.

The aims of the study were to establish HER2 status in ductal carcinoma in situ associated to invasive breast ductal carcinoma. Materials and methods: Using immunohistochemical technique followed by chro  mogenic in situ hybridization were studied 100 casesdiagnosed at pathology laboratory of CEDMOG, with ductal in situ breast carcinoma associated with invasive carcinoma. Results: Immunohistochemical staining wasrecorded using a semiquantitative scoring system, so 42% of cases were HER2 intense positive and 65% of cases were moderate positive. Gene ampli ﬁcation was found to be with high level in 17% of HER2 moderate expression cases, 42% with low level gene ampli ﬁcation and absence of ampli ﬁ  cation in 41% of cases. The concordance between in situ and invasive component of individual tumors was 88.5%. Two cases showed HER2 gene ampli ﬁcation in the asso  ciated ductal in situ carcinoma with no evidence of gene ampli ﬁcation in the invasive tumor. Conclusions: Multiple genetic events are required for the development of an invasive phenotype; not always HER2 gene status play akey role in the progression of ductal carcinoma in situ to invasive carcinoma and other molecular alterations may by more important in tumor progression.

 Investigation of the effect of thymoquinone on endoplasmic reticulum stress in human breastadenocarcinoma cells,P12.18,"T. Duran, N. Kocak, B. Eser Cavdartepe, S. Nergiz","Selçuk University, Selçuklu Medical Faculty,The Depart","ment of Medical Genetics, Konya, Turkey Introduction: The endoplasmic reticulum is responsible for protein synthesis and folding and has an essential role in understanding cellular stress. Recently, it has been deter mined that the endoplasmic reticulum mediates intracellular signaling pathways in response to the aggregation of mis  folded proteins. New investigations imply that the unfolded protein response can trigger in ﬂammation and cancer. Thymoquinone is the active component found in the seeds of Nigella sativa and has been determined to have anti inﬂammatory effectiveness in models of asthma, diabetes, encephalomyelitis, neurodegeneration, and carcinogenesis. Studies have revealed that thymoquinone uses its anti neoplastic effect(s) by different modes of action. For these reasons, we aimed to investigate the effect of thymoquinone on endoplasmic reticulum stress in MCF7 and HEK293cells. Materials and methods: Effective doses of thymo  quinone (27 μM) in the study were determined by MTT analysis. Cells were treated with 27 μM thymoquinone for 72 h. Total RNA was isolated using TRIzol reagent. Synthesis of cDNA from the total RNA was carried out using Transcriptor High Fidelity cDNA Synthesis kit.Expression levels of genes (GRP78, CHOP, EDEM1) associated with endoplasmic reticulum stress were analyzed by RT qPCR. Fold changes were calculated by the   ΔΔCT method. The statistical signi ﬁcances were analyzed apply  ing two tailed student ’s t test and analysis of variance (ANOVA). Results: As a result, We found a difference inthe expression levels of ER stress related genes in thymoquinone treated MCF7 cells compared to the untreated group. This suggests that thymoquinone affectsthe pathways associated with ER stress. T. Duran: None. N. Kocak: None. B. Eser Cavdar  tepe: None. S. Nergiz: None.E",2017

Simultaneously, it repre sents a candidate tumor suppressor gene, whose mutations leads to the molecular pathogenesis of several malignancies (prostate cancer, breast cancer, ovarian cancer, sarcomasetc.). Together with BRCA1, BRCA2, TP53 and ATM , CHEK2 plays a crucial role in the process of DNA repair, cell cycle control and apoptosis. This gene is localized at thechromosome 22q12.1, is distributed along 50 kb and com  prises of 14 exons, however its analysis is technically dif  ﬁcult because of presence up to 16 pseudogenes. Risk of breast cancer onset in the case of CHEK2 pathogenic mutations was estimated at 20 –25% (vs. 8% in general population) and risk of prostate cancer in men at 27% (vs.13%). Carriers of the mutations have according to published data higher risk of developing also colorectal, thyroid or renal cancer, even melanomas and osteosarcomas.According to these facts CHEK2 gene is usually described as a low or middle penetrant gene. Here we describe the establishment and ﬁrst analysis of all coding region of CHEK2 gene using Long Range PCR and Sanger sequen  cing approach. The presentation would describe sequencing data and statistics about the presented CHEK2 pathogenic mutations and variants of unknown signi ﬁcance in Czech population.

It ’s the most common form of hereditary colorectal cancer(CRC). Genes involved belong to the mismatch repair system of DNA (MMR genes). Both of MSH2 andMLH1 genes present the majority of germline mutations (80%) inHNPCC. The presence of multiple genes and mutation heterogeneity are challenges for the development of diag  nostic tests for this disease which is based on a set of bio logical, clinical, endoscopic, pathological and genetic features. In this context, we report a molecular study in Tunisian patients suspected to have the Lynch syndrome.Genetic analysis showed different variations in the con  cerned genes. Our study focuses on 20 patients, belongingto Tunisian families, clinically and pathologically suspected of Lynch syndrome. In this work, we developed the optimal conditions for ampli ﬁcation and HRM (Hight Resolution Multing) study of all the exons of the MLH1 ,MSH2 and MSH6 genes, and direct sequencing exons with aberrant melting curves. We found: Three mutations in MLH1 gene, one mutation in MSH2 gene and no mutation in MSH6 gene. Also, we detect fourteen polymorphisms scattered in the three genes.

Faroese patients diagnosed with her editary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) syndrome are routinely tested for genetic susceptibility using standard gene panels. However, no pathogenic mutations withintested risk genes have been identi ﬁed in the Faroese patients so far. In order to increase the understanding of the ethology of HBOC in Faroese patients, we will perform whole exome sequencing (WES) of patients and controls. Materials and Methods : Consenting HBOC patients ( n ,50) and control individuals ( n,200) will be recruited to the Faroese Genetic Biobank, and WES will be performed with a 50x coverage. Identi ﬁed variants will be tested for association with HBOC. Subsequently, the top 50 variantsidenti ﬁed from the association analysis will be tested in 150 non cancer individuals from the HBOC families in order to determine whether the identi ﬁed susceptibility variants are hereditary. Expected results : Our goal is to identify susceptibility genes/mutations that may contribute to the cause of HBOCin the Faroese population. Further, as we are using an iso  lated population we may reveal rare mutations with large contribution to HBOC pathogenesis, mutations that havemaintained at a lower frequency in more outbred populations.Abstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 971Conclusion : The study may contribute to the develop  ment of an optimal diagnostic strategy for HBOC patients in the Faroe Islands.

HPV is a public health problem primarily affecting young people of school age and associated with cervicalcancer. Methodology: To analyse, the prevalence and the risk factors linked to HPV Infection 16/18 at the Medical School in Angola a cross sectional study with cervicalsamples of 65 female students, mean age 23.6 that had already initiated sexual activity were obtained. The detec  tion of the HPV genome was performed by polymerasechain reaction (PCR). Results: The analysis of the asso  ciation between risk factors and prevalence of HPV 16/18 was signi ﬁcant as evaluated by Odds Ratio (OR), with 95% conﬁdence interval and a signi ﬁcance level of 5%. The prevalence of cervical infection by HPV 16/18 was 26.1% (OR 2.1, IC 0654 –6740), being sexually active (OR 1.1, IC 0.347   3.487), and with a history of STI (OR 1,438, CI 0,122–16,943). Only 1.5% were vaccinated against HPV. Conclusions: The high prevalence of HPV infection 16/18and the statistically signi ﬁcant association with identi ﬁed risk factors suggest that there is an urgent need for aware  ness, early screening and vaccine coverage of youngwomen.

During the last decade, the incidence of lung adenocarcinoma has increased compared to that of squamous cell carcinoma in Romanian population as well asfor other European and Asian countries. TERT plays a crucial role in cancer cell immortality and DNA repair mechanisms have a major role in genome stability thereforegene variants in these genes may represent a risk factor in lung carcinogenesis. Evidence showing correlationsbetween TERT retained within the nucleus and increased nuclear DNA damage sustain the fact that TERT could inﬂuence several molecules and pathways involved in inﬂammation, apoptosis and DNA damage responses. The purpose of our study was to investigate the possible asso  ciation between TERT , DNA repair polymorphisms and the risk of lung cancer, in a Romanian population. For this, a group of 112 patients with lung cancer were recruited and genotyped using Real Time PCR for rs2736100 of TERT gene, Arg156Arg of XPD (ERCC2), Arg194Trp of XRCC1 gene and Arg399Gln of XRCC3 gene. Statistical analysis revealed that rs2736100 of TERT gene is associated withArg194Trp of XRCC1 gene and Arg399Gln of XRCC3 gene, especially in women diagnosed with lung adeno  carcinoma (p ,0.042). In conclusion, the results of the study suggest that polymorphisms Arg194Trp of XRCC1 gene and Arg399Gln of XRCC3 gene, could be associated with TERT mutagenesis and therefore they could representfuture biological markers for the development and targeted treatment of lung cancer.

Due to characteristic clinical features and great size of neuro ﬁbromin gene, molecular analysis is not routinely employed. The pheno  type of NF1 consist of café au lait spots, freckling, hamartomas, and benign and malignant neoplasms. Almostall patients present benign tumours which are neuro ﬁ  bromas. In about 20% of patients, intracranial malignancies appear, mainly gliomas. An increased risk of several othercancers in NF1 has been proven, including breast cancer, GIST and pheochromocytoma. About 25% of medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC) is caused by mutation in RETgene, which may lead to MEN2A/MEN2B syndrome. We report a 20 years old patient with NF1 and MTC. The patient fully ful ﬁls the diagnostic criteria of NF1, which include multiple café au lait spots and neuro ﬁbromas, plexiform neuro ﬁbromas, Lisch nodules, disseminated hamartomas of the brain, optic nerve glioma and tumours ofthe spinal cord. The other features are: tall stature, wide thorax, cryptorchidism and mental retardation. Because of spinal tumours, the patient suffers from tetraparesis. FISHtesting for deletion in NF1 locus was performed with negative result. In the age of 17, the patient was diagnosed with MTC.

Materials and Methods DNA was extracted from blood and libraries were prepared for sequencing using the Illu  mina TruSight Cancer Panel, which targets the exons of 94genes and 284 SNPs associated with cancer. Sequencing was performed on a MiSeq platform. Alignment and variant calling were conducted using the BWA pipeline. Results Within our cohort of 24 women we detected pathogenic mutations in 8 patients (33%) and variants of unknown clinical signi ﬁcance in another 8 (33%). Six (25%) of the pathogenic mutations were identi ﬁed in BRCA1 : NP_009231.2:p.Gln1777ProfsTer74 (4 patients), NP_009231.2:p.Lys653SerfsTer47 (1) and NP_009231.2:p.Cys47Arg (1). The other two were detected in BRCA2   NP_000050.2:p.Val2151PhefsTer17 (4%), and in PPM1D   NP_003611.1:p.Leu484Ter (4%). The variants of unknownsigniﬁcance were identi ﬁed in BRIP1 ,DICER1 ,FLCN , GATA2 ,MUTYH, NBN andPALB2 . Conclusions We detected some genetic heterogeneity within our cohort, while at the same time four women were found to carry the exact same mutation. It is important to establish the spectrum and frequency of genetic defects for aspeciﬁc disease within a population, as this could pave the way for appropriate nation wide genetic screening and tar  geted therapy.

The purpose of this study is to determine the prevalence of BRAF V600E mutation in PTCs in Turkish population. Materials and Methods: Seventy two PTC patients were enrolled in this study. DNA was extracted from FFPE tissue samples. The BRAF gene region including V600Emutation was ampli ﬁed by using PCR and DNA sequencing was performed with Sanger method. Results: A mutation at 15th exon of the BRAF gene was detected in 20 of 35 classical variant PTC patients. 16/20 of these mutations were BRAF V600E, 1/20 of these muta  tions was BRAF V600V and 3/20 were BRAF F583Y. Atthe same time two mutations were detected in 37 follicular variant of PTC patients, one being BRAF V600V, while the other BRAF V600E mutation. When mutation positivetumor samples were compared with mutation negative ones in classical variant group, thyroid capsule invasion, extra  thyroidal tissue invasion, and lymph node metastasis wereassociated with BRAF mutations independent from tumor size (p < 0,05). Conclusions: Considering that BRAF V600E mutation is correlated with poor prognosis of the disease according to the obtained data, larger population based studies are necessary in order to follow up to prognosis of the PTCpatients in Turkish population. Besides, to evaluate aggressiveness of the follicular variant PTCs and to use in distinctive diagnosis, RAS mutation screening should beconsidered addition to BRAF V600E in follicular variant PTC patients.

CRC results from the progressive accumulation ofgenetic variations that transform normal colonic epithelium to colon adenocarcinoma. Toll like receptors (TLRs) are a976family of transmembrane proteins that acts as innate immune sensors. TLR signaling protects the intestinal epi  thelial barrier and stimulates various in ﬂammatory respon  ses. Polymorphism located in the promoter region of TLR9 may increase colon cancer susceptibility. Materials and Methods: In total, we studied 150 patients with colon cancerand 150 healthy participants. TLR9  1486T/C polymorph  ism was genotyped by RFLP PCR. Results: There was signiﬁcant difference between frequencies for TC genotype in patients and healthy individuals (P < 0.0001). Odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI) for polymorphism in TLR9 and cancer risk were estimated(OR,3.107; 95% CI ,1.902–5.075; P < 0.0001).

Single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) might affect interleukin production and in ﬂuence disease course. We investigated the associations among three SNPs in selected cytokine genes and the risk of ULMin the Slovenian population. Materials and Methods: We included 181 ULM patients, 41 women without ULM as a control group and 92 subjects representing the generalpopulation. ULM patients were divided into solitary and multiple ULM subgroups. Genotyping was performed using polymerase chain reaction followed by the restriction frag ment length polymorphism technique or using high reso  lution melting curve analysis. Results: We found signi ﬁcant association between rs20541 (IL13) and ULM patients. TTgenotype frequency of rs20541 was higher in healthy con  trols (8.7%) compared to all patients with ULM (1.0%) ( p ,0.018). Association between SNPs and clinical char  acteristics of patients revealed differences between solitary and multiple ULM. In solitary ULM, rs1801275 (IL4R) wasassociated with the age at ﬁrst sexual intercourse ( p, 0.004). In multiple ULM, rs1801275 (IL4R) was associated with the age at diagnosis ( p,0.003) where patients with the GG genotype were younger at diagnosis compared to patients with the AA or AG genotype. Conclusions: Our study suggests that rs20541 (IL13) may be associated withdecreased risk for ULM development in Slovenian women. Additionally, rs1801275 (IL4R) predisposes the risk for solitary ULM in patients with a lower age at ﬁrst sexual intercourse and earlier onset of disease for multiple ULM. J. Krsteski: None. S.

Theaim of our study was to evaluate the correlation between XPC Ala499Val gene polymorphism and CML risk and disease phase and EUTOS scores in a Romanian popula tion. Material and methods: We included in this case  control study 82 CML patients and 99 heathy controls from Transylvania, Romania. Results: In the patients group themean age was 52 years (50 men, 32 women), while in the control group 47 years (62 men, 37 women). In CML patients 40 had the wild type genotype, 30 heterozygousand 12 variant homozygous genotype. No differences were observed regarding the genotype distribution according to the gender, ages, disease phase and EUTOS scores. In thecontrol group the wild type genotype was founded in 38 subjects, the heterozygous in 47 and the variant homo  zygous genotype in 14, with differences regarding genderdistribution.

Universidad de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain,3Insti  tuto de investigación biomédica de Salamanca (IBSAL),Salamanca, Spain Cellular adaptation to hypoxia is a protective mechanism relevant for the survival of cancer cells. Deferoxamine(DFO), an iron chelator, has demonstrated to be a potent hypoxia mimetic agent. Fe 2+depletion by DFO has shown to increase hypoxia inducible factor 1 alpha (HIF 1 α) expression. HIF 1 αis a critical mediator of the physiological response to hypoxia, and its deregulation promotes tumour angiogenesis and metastasis. The present study investigatedthe effects of DFO in the autophagy process under hypoxic conditions in colon cancer cells. The relationship between DFO and autophagy was performed in HT29 and HCT116cells lines. We carried out Western blot and Immuno  ﬂuorescence assays to observe the expression of HIF 1 αand proteins involved in the autophagy process. Cell migrationand in vitro cytotoxic effects of DFO was determined by wound healing and MTT assays. Treatment with DFO enhanced cell migration and exhibited higher expression ofHIF 1 α, p62, LC3B and BECN1, associated with activated autophagy process. We also observed a decrease in the viability of the two human colon cancer cell lines. Theseﬁndings suggest that DFO induces HIF 1 αand involves autophagy activation and cell migration promotion, that can play an important role in cancer cell dissemination. Theseresults show that DFO administration in tumours with invasive potential could be an unfavourable treatment. V. Rivero: None. M. Ovejero: None. R. Usategui: None. R.

The outcome of the affectedpatients can be quite different according to which chro  mosomes are involved. Chromosome 8 contains about 5% of the euchromatic human genome representing approx. 700genes and its abnormalities lead to variable phenotypic features depending on the type of imbalance.

We exam  ined for them the genetic alterations of various genes in chromosome 8 to ﬁnd the associations between gene copy number changes and phenotype. The patients showedstructural abnormalities of chromosome 8, two cases pre  senting parm involvement and one with unbalanced qarm. ArrayCGH detalied genes content of changed geneticmaterial: a microalteration in the short arm was detected in addition to the known chromosomal imbalance for one of two patients with abnormalities of p arm; a region of thedistal short arm containing genes involved in development or signaling of the nervous system, which presents a strik  ingly high mutation rate, could explain the neurologicphenotype of the third case. Results were validated using a panel of standard FISH probes. Using the latest technology smaller or complex chromosome defects can be identi ﬁed.

These factors can induce oxidative stress thatleads to DNA damage. The amount of occupational exposure related mutations depends on ef ﬁciency of DNA  repair protein function. Therefore it is possible to use DNA repair genes as candidate markers for the estimation of individual susceptibility to DNA damage in coal miners exposed to hazards factors. Materials and Methods: DNAdamage was evaluated using the cytokinesis block micro  nucleus assay (CBMN) in peripheral blood lymphocytes. Allele speci ﬁc PCR was used to determine polymorphisms in the h OGG1 977 C > G (rs1052133) and the Lig4 26 C > T (rs1805388) genes. Exposed group included 143 coal miners (mean age ,50.11 ± 7.36 years; mean length of service in coal mining conditions ,23.26 ± 9.66 years). As a control group, we have used venous blood extracted from 127 healthy non exposed men. Results: we discovered thatcoal miners are characterized by a signi ﬁcant increase in the frequency of binucleated lymphocytes with micronuclei (MN) (11.15 ± 3.81 ‰), nucleoplasmic bridges (NPBs) (4.04 ± 2.82 ‰) and protrusions (NBUDs) (7.23 ± 2.54 ‰) compared to non exposed donors (7.51 ± 1.83 ‰, 2.36 ± 1.27‰, 5.83 ± 2.55 ‰, respectively). The T/T genotype for theLig4 26 C > T and the G/G genotype for the h OGG1 977 C > G genes were associated with the increased fre  quency of binucleated lymphocytes with MN.

However, the mechanisms underlying such highly effective stimulation ofproliferation remain poorly investigated. We analyzed the expression levels of a wide range of target genes in human mesenchymal stem cells with combination of cerium oxidenanoparticles by RT PCR method. Introduction of CeO 2 nanoparticles was shown to result in an intensi ﬁcation of cell proliferation rate in a dose dependent manner. Theconducted analysis of the transcription pro ﬁle of human mesenchemal stem cells in the presence of cerium oxide nanoparticles con ﬁrmed an increased transcription level for mRNAs of genes responsible for proliferation and cell cycle, as well as suppression of apoptosis.

The concluded lcr1 sequence was compared with the reported lcr1 sequences in other Leishmania parasites. Leishmania infantum (strain MCAN/IR/2010/Meshkinshahr) was cul  tured in NNN media. Parasite pellets (100 million/pellet)were prepared and genomic DNA was extracted. Parasite species was veri ﬁed as Leishmania infantum by sequencing of ITS1 gene. Lcr1 gene was ampli ﬁed by lcr1 speciﬁc primers. The PCR product was electrophoresed and its restriction fragment pattern was de ﬁned. Sequence of the PCR product was analyzed by Chromas and BLAST soft wares and the correct sequence was determined, sequencing after gel electrophoresis. Our results show that lcr1 gene is completely conserved in MCAN/IR/2010/Meshkinshahrstrain. Conservation of this immunogenic gene ( lcr1) adds to its value as an immunogenic molecule against980Mediterranean visceral leishmaniasis.

Chromosomal GTG analysis of 100 metaphases of theperipheral blood revealed a karyotype with two SMCs 48, XX,+2mar. The father, paternal grandmother and one uncle all had the same abnormal karyotype with two copiesof the same SMC. One aunt and one cousin (the son of the paternal uncle with two SMCs) had only one marker. No mosaicism of the SMC was present in any family member.SKY revealed that the SMC was derived from chromosome 15, de ﬁned as 48,XX, +2der(15)(pterq12). The origin of SMC was con ﬁrmed by FISH. According to the literature only 11 cases showed two copies of the same marker as in this report. Derivatives of chromosome 15 represent the most common SMC and may be associated with mental anddevelopmental retardation, seizures, autism spectrum dis  order and infertility. However, our patient and all the affected family members have presented normal develop ment, indicating that the markers might predominantly contain phenotypically silent heterochromatic domains. The acquired numerical changes in SMC inheritance in sub sequent generations suggest gametic cell mosaicism in individuals with 48 chromosomes, which can be explained by a strong instability of the pairing complex during themeiotic prophase.

The patient was born at 40 weeks of gestation by vaginal delivery. Birth weight was 4190 g. He began to control his head at 6 months, sit without any support at9 months, began walking at 25 months. He had mild dys morphic features, such as frontal bossing, low set ears, hypertelorism, broad ﬂat nose, high arched palate, short neck. A re evaluation was conducted at the age of 9 years. His head was trigonocephalic with frontal bossing. The most common clinical features of monosomy 9p syndrome,included developmental and psychomotor delay, trigono cephaly, ﬂat midface, short palpebral ﬁssures, highly arched eyebrows, low set ears, short ﬂat nose with anteverted nostrils, thin upper lip, long philtrum, high palate, micro gnathia, short neck, enlarged internipple distance, tapering ﬁngers, ﬂat feet, and hypotonia. Trisomy 10q is also rare syndome. Characteristic craniofacial ﬁndings include a ﬂat round face with full cheeks and large prominent forehead, highly arched eyebrows, short and narrow palpebral ﬁssures (blepharophimosis), widely spaced eyes with telecanthus, a short nose, a bow shaped mouth with a prominent upper lip, and a small mandible. Our patient has both phenotypicﬁndings from monosomy 9q and trisomy 10q syndromes. This case is the ﬁrst in the literature having these rare syndromes together.",P13.11,E. akbas: None. B.

Tetrasomyfor the distal part of chromosome 15q (15q24 qter) due to a SMC is rare, indeed, only 23 cases have been reported in the literature so far, including 7 showing non mosaic tet rasomy. Some SMC are reported as analphoid, they are structurally rearranged chromosomes which acquired neo  centromeres allowing them to remain stable during mitoses.Although some common clinical features have been described, no clear link between tetrasomy 15q24 qter length, degree of mosaicism and patient ’s phenotype severity has been established. Material and methods: Here, we report a case of tetrasomy 15q25.3 qter identi ﬁed using array CGH, FISH and standard karyotype. The patient, a16 year old girl, presents intellectual de ﬁciency, facial dysmorphism, marfanoid habitus, thin ﬁngers, brachyme  tatarsy, severe scoliosis, and mitral valve prolapse. Results:The array CGH analysis revealed a gain of 16.7 Mb of the distal region of the long arm of chromosome 15 (15q25.3q26.3). Surprisingly the karyotype showedmosaicism for 15q SMC: mos 46,XX[7]/47,XX, +i(15) (qter  > q25.3:?:q25.3  > qter)[13], con ﬁrmed by FISH:.ish +i(15q)(D15S936 ++ )[13]/15q26.3(D15S936x2)[12].nuc ish(D15S936x4)[14]/(D15S936x2)[11]). The FISH analy  sis, using a 15q26.3 region speci ﬁc probe, showed one signal on each normal chromosomes 15 and two additionalsignals on each arm of the marker in 14/25 nuclei and 13/25 mitoses respectively. This corresponds to an inverted duplication of the distal region of chromosome 15 q arm.Conclusion: This newly identi ﬁed case reveals a novel mosaic tetrasomy 15q and provides new data regarding this rare chromosomal abnormality and its associated clinicalfeatures.

The usual contents are intestine, liver, and spleen. The birth prevalence of nonsyndromic omphaloceleis estimated to be 1 in 4.000 live births. Almost all cases with nonsyndromic omphalocele occur sporadic with no single genetic cause known to date. Here we performedwhole exome sequencing (WES) in a three generation family with autosomal dominant inherited omphalocele and 4 affected individuals. Materials and Methods WES was performed on two affected and one unaffected family member. Mutation analysis was performed by WES (enrichment kit: NimbleGene SeqCap ES Human Exome Library 2.0) with the Genome Analyzer II (Illumina). Read alignment and detection of variants was done with Genome Analyzingsoftware (varbank, www.varbank.ccg.uni koeln.de/ ). Results Application of standard ﬁlter criteria, con ﬁrma  tion of variants with Sanger sequencing and segregationanalysis within the family revealed two variants in SLC46A2 (c.761 G > A) and ALB1 (c.253+3 A > C).

 A Complete Work ﬂow for Human Cell Line Authentication,P13.15,"S. Jackson, K. Varma","Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc, South San Francisco, CA, United","States The study of human development and diseases relies heavily on the analysis of dissociated human cell lines grown in culture. However, an increasingly acknowledged problem is that cells grown in vitro can become mis identi ﬁed or contaminated with other unrelated cell lines. Analysis of highly variable short tandem repeats (STRs), provides a simple, inexpensive and highly speci ﬁc genetic “ﬁngerprint ”of a cell line. In this study, we describe a complete work ﬂow for human Cell Line Authentication by combining Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc AmpFlSTR Identi ﬁler STR analysis kits, Applied Biosystems ’gold standard CE instrumentation and Gene Mapper analysis software. Two different work ﬂows were analyzed. First, serial dilutions of puriﬁed genomic DNA were isolated from a number of human cell lines were analyzed using the AmpFlSTR Identi ﬁler Plus kit. Correct allelic calls were made when the input DNA amount was between 0.3 and 3 ng. Second, dilutions of suspensions of the same cells were immobilized onto Copan Nucliec Cards, and 2 mm punches were ana lyzed using the AmpFlSTR Identi ﬁler Direct kit. Correct allelic calls were made when a suspension of 5 –10 × 10 5 cells were immobilized. To test the limit of detection of contaminating cells in a culture, we prepared mixed cell suspensions of 5 × 105cells of M4A4GFP cells and HeLa cells. Contaminating HeLa cells can be detected in apopulation if they are present at greater than about 25% of the total population. Together, these results describe a facile and consolidated work ﬂow for human cell line authentication. S. Jackson: A. Employment (full or part time); Signiﬁcant; Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc. K.

Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Mental Health Research Center, Moscow, Russian Federation,3Moscow State University of Psychology and Education, Moscow, Russian Federation,4Institute of human genetics, Jena, Germany. Introduction Turner syndrome (TS) is a well known chromosomal disorder affecting 1/2000 –1/2500 newborns. This condition is associated with a variety of karyotypes,each type of which is featured by monosomy of chromo  some X. In addition, chromosomal mosaicism is likely to be responsible for 30 –56% of TS cases associated with monosomy X. Materials and methods Ninety six TS (TS  like phenotype) girls were analyzed using banding kar  yotyping (20 metaphase plates per case or 30 metaphaseplates if mosaicism revealed), FISH (50 –100 metaphase plates and 1000 interphase nuclei) and MCB. Cut off mosaicism rates (proportion of cells without chromosomeX) were 2.5%. Results Regular (classic 45,X) variant was found in 28.1%. Most cases (37.5%) exhibited chromoso  mal mosaicism affecting the whole chromosome (45,X/46,XX(45,X/47,XXX/46,XX); ring chromosome 46,X,r(X)/45, X in 8.3%; isochromosome X 46,X,i(Xq)/45,X and marker chromosome 46,X,mar(derX)/45,X accounted for 6.25%.Less frequently TS phenotype was shown to be associated with 46,X,i(Xq), 46,X,i(Xq)/45,X/46,XX, 46,X,idic(X) (q22.2)/45,X, 46,X,mar der(Y)/45,X, 46,X,del(Yq), 46,X,der(X)t(Xp;Yq), 45,X/45,X,der(20)t(20p;Yq), 46,X,del (Xp), 46,X,del(Xp)/45,X. Conclusions The present study showed the proportion of mosaic karyotypes to be as highas 67.7%. Mosaicism was detected in 39.6% of cases. According to these data, we may conclude that mosaicism is more common in TS than previously recognized. Thus,different karyotypes observed in TS allow speculations that individual approach in each case is required to improve and individualize molecular diagnosis.

It affects about 20% of people at some time during their lives. Urticaria is a complex diseasewith pathogenesis involving allergic in ﬂammation, skin lesions and hyperreactivity to environmental triggers. Therefore we analyzed common changes in genes of ﬁlag  grin (c.2282del4, p.R501X), cytokines (rs2243250 of IL4, rs20541 of IL13, rs1800872 of IL10, rs1800629 of TNFA) and toll like receptors (rs5743571 of TLR1, rs5743794 ofTLR6, rs11466617 of TLR10) in urticaria patients and healthy individuals from Volga Ural region of Russia. The patients group include 103 individuals of different ethnicorigin (Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs and individuals of mixed origin). The control group consists of 106 healthy donor without atopic diseases of respective ethnic background.Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP. We revealed that rs20541*Arg/Gln genotype of the IL13 gene (p ,0.02) and rs5743794*CC genotype of TLR6 (p ,0.0011) is associated with urticatia in Russians and TLR1 gene rs5743571*TT genotype   with urticaria in Tatars (p , 0.0054). Besides, rs5743794*C allele is associated withacute and chronic urticaria (p ,0.0209 and p ,0.0063, respectively) and rs2243250*C allele of IL4 gene poly  morphism   with acute urticaria (p ,0.0247). Allelic fre  quency of the FLG gene c.2282del4 mutation is 0.96% in patients, 2.12% in controls, frequency of p.R501X mutation   1.4% and 0.53%, respectively, but these differences arenot statistically signi ﬁcant. Thus, we found an association of urticaria with rs2243250 of the IL4, rs20541 of the IL13, rs5743571 of the TLR1 and rs5743794 of the TLR6 gene. G.F. Gimalova: None. A.S. Karunas: None. E.A.

Thesuccess of downstream tests with DNA isolated from FFPE tissue blocks however cannot be guaranteed as samples can be fragmented, chemically altered and/or heavily con taminated with carry over molecules from the source material and extraction buffer constituents. Proper quanti  ﬁcation and purity analysis after isolation are therefore desirable. In this poster we present experimental data [TM1] to demonstrate the advantages and shortcomings of the most used FFPE DNA quanti ﬁcation technologies, being A260 absorbance, Qubit ﬂuorescence and DropSense/cDrop.

 Evolving challenges of molecular diagnostics in aregional center,P14.02,"M. Witsch Baumgartner, E. Maurer, J. Zschocke","Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria","Molecular diagnostics has shifted from institutes with special expertise for individual indications to a uni ﬁed diagnostic pipeline in a regional institute. Now, each center has the possibility to perform analysis for all diseases andgenes known and doing it at the regional level. This implies different initial preconditions regarding referring reasons with phenotype description, consent of patient, analysispipeline, interpretation of results, and counseling of patients. We present a well developed approach to consider all these circumstances and we show examples. Ourapproach regards the incoming sample from the referring physician asking for elucidation of a case with an initial clinical suspicion, e.g. amelogenesis imperfecta, or a patientwith intellectual disability and epilepsy. Regarding mole  cular analysis patients should be seen in the genetic clinic or by regional partners to adequately document the phenotypeand obtain consent. The method is straight forward: library preparation for massive parallel sequencing for a targeted gene panel or a clinical exome (OMIM disease genes) both984including CNV analysis depending on suspected disease or genes. Only target genes are uncovered from the panel, no irrelevant genes are analyzed to minimize challenge of interpretation and preclude incidental ﬁndings. Massive parallel sequencing is complemented by all relevant diag  nostic methods including routine transcript sequencing,fragment analyses, Southern blot, DNA array, FISH.

Zhuchenko2","1Medical Rehabilitation Center, Ministry of Health, Mos","cow, Russian Federation,2I.M. Sechenov First Moscow State Medical Univesity, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) and neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are among leading causes of morbidity and mortality throughout the world. There have been several reports in the scienti ﬁc literature which suggest the linkage between CVDs and NDDs. Materials and Methods: Blood samples were collected from 144 unrelated patients aged 35   60 years with variousclinical records. Each of them had a family history of CVDs, including stroke, coronary artery disease, heart failure and etc. PCR RFLP was undertaken to examinepolymorphisms of 10 genes, associated with CVDs: APOE, NOS3, MTHFR, MTRR, ACE, PAI1IL 4, IL 4RA, TNF and CCR5. Results: A signi ﬁcant correlation between the simulta  neous presence of several gene polymorphisms: NOS3 (G894T or T1468A); MTHFR (C677T); APOE ( ε3) and the existing family history of acute ischemic stroke at early age was observed in 46 patients. However, the majority of these patients (n ,37/46; 80%) show no clinical signs of CVDs (normal LDL C levels, blood pressure and etc.), while 30 patients (n ,30/46; 65%) present neurological disorders in their anamnesis, such as personality changes, loss ofbehavioral skills, minimal cognitive impairments and etc. It is remarkable that none of the mentioned patients have NDDs in their family histories. Conclusions: It is known that variations in NOS3 gene are associated with high susceptibility to coronary spasm and MTHFR (C677T) and APOE ( ε3) are linked to high blood pressure. However, our research con ﬁrms that com  bination of these polymorphisms in one patient increases risks for developing neurodegenerative diseases despite thefamily history of CVDs. V. Khammad: None.

Markova2,A .",Polyakov1,"1Federal State Budgetary Institution “Research Centre for Medical Genetics ”, Moscow, Russian Federation,2National Research Center for Audiology and Hearing Rehabilitation, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Cisplatin is a widely used chemother  apeutic agent for the treatment of many cancers. However, its use is restricted by the high incidence of irreversibleototoxicity associated with cisplatin (more than 60% of children receiving it). Some studies have reported that genetic variants of TPMT (rs12201199), COMT (rs4646316), and ABCC3 (rs1051640) are conferring increased risk of developing cisplatin induced hearing loss. However in other studies the results were not replicated.The aim of this study was to replicate the previous studies in an independent cohort of Russian patients. Materials and Methods: Total of 45 patients in our study received treat ment in pediatric oncology units and had course of cisplatin based chemotherapy. Among them 16 patients developed hearing loss. SNP genotypes for rs12201199,rs4646316 and rs1051640 were determined in DNA sam  ples of patients, using multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁcation. The Fisher exact test was used to determine P values. Results: Association between TPMT (rs12201199), COMT (rs4646316) or ABCC3 (rs1051640) variants and hearing loss was not observed our cohort. Conclusions: Ourresults didn ’t con ﬁrm suitability of TPMT orCOMT or ABCC3 genotyping to identify patients at risk of cisplatin  induced ototoxicity.

The increasing frequency of the lifestyle  related diseases and the personalized treatment approach,leads to usage of genetic testing to personalize a diet plan. Materials and Methods: A set of 45 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNPs) in 40 genes, related to lipid meta bolism, absorption and fats storage, insulin sensitivity, inﬂammation, oxidative stress, detoxi ﬁcation, osteoporosis, methylation and food responsiveness were studied by theQuantStudio 12 K Flex Real Time PCR System in 20 Bulgarian probands. Results: The mean age of the probands is 32,8 with gender ratio 17:3 female to male. After holistic analysis of the SNPs results, was found that each proband is predis  posed to at least one social signi ﬁcant disease, but 12 of them show genetic risk of three or more lifestyle disorders (predominantly atherosclerosis, osteoporosis and insulin insensitivity). Two probands have a high risk for hemo chromatosis development, seven   for adult lactase de ﬁ  ciency and three are carriers of COMT 472 G > A (catechol  o methyltransferase) polymorphism, requiring a change inconsumption of catecholestrogens and dose reduction of certain catechol drugs. All probands received recommen  dation regarding the diet, physical activity and surroundinghazards. The follow up is in progress. Conclusion: This small, but growing cohort is the ﬁrst report among Bulgarians, using a personalized approach inthe nutritional and daily habits optimization, based on their genetic background and personal gene diet interactions, affecting nutrient metabolism and transport.

Changes in dopamine neurotransmis  sion affect the brain reward system in a direct way. Fur thermore, changes in the reward system in ﬂuence the eating behavior in human beings and animals. VMAT2 transporter proteins terminate DA function by moving into vesicles indopaminergic neurons. Materials and Methods: In this study, the control group which includes 214 individuals and obese group that involve 234 subjects were investigated forVMAT2 (rs363399 and rs4752045) polymorphisms. Touch  down PCR technique was used for the ampli ﬁcation of VMAT2 polymorphisms.The PCR products of rs363399 and rs4752045 were cleaved by using MspI, and AciI restriction enzymes, respectively. The restriction products were determined by electrophoresis using a 5% agarose gelwhich was stained with ethidium bromide. Results: When the groups were compared in terms of eating behavior, the number of the subjects who ate for reward was signi ﬁcantly higher in obese group ( p,0.03). According to the statis  tical analysis, the subjects who did regular exercise were signiﬁcantly higher in control group ( p,0.02). Conclu  sions: Our ﬁndings demonstrate that eating behavior may affect the development of obesity. Moreover, doing regular exercise might be protective for adult obesity. There was noassociation between VMAT2 genotypes and obesity. It requires further studies in order to understand the relation  ship between VMAT2 genotypes and obesity.

Families with tentative diagnosis of rare diseases are referred to Hacettepe Rare Diseases Bio bank holding 35.000 DNA samples and 1.200 cells/tissues from 5.800 families with neurological (46%), metabolic (19%), nephrological (15%), gastroenterological (9%),immunological/haematological (5%), chest diseases (3%) and dermatological disorders (3%). This extensive bior  egistry facilitate discovery of novel genes, diagnostic andprognostic biomarkers, and therapeutic research. Long child bearing age, multiple affected families and observation of new phenotypes with unknown genes is an added value forresearch and spectra of clinical phenotypes makes hunting for modi ﬁers more approachable. We used these avail  abilities as an advantage and established a Zebra ﬁsh Research Laboratory. Our aim is to create patient speci ﬁc disease models by using genome editing tools in zebra ﬁsh in order to understand underlying mechanisms of diseases.Muscle disorders and corneal dystrophies are ongoing research subjects. Also we generate knockout models to test candidate ultra rare genes identi ﬁed by our university researchers revealed by exome sequencing. Furthermore, we are planning to form a catalogue of mutant zebra ﬁsh stocks consisting of speci ﬁc mutations that we hope will contribute to future studies of drug and treatment.

 Functional analysis of the mutated actin to study its effect on congenital myopathy,P16.01,"F. Mohajer1, J. Razmara2, S. Parvizpour3, M. Shamsir1","1Universiti Teknologi Malaysia, Johor, Malaysia,2Uni","versity of Tabriz, Tabriz, Iran, Islamic Republic of,3Tabriz University of Medical Sciences, Tabriz, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Congenital myopathy is a broad category of muscular diseases which its symptoms appear at the time of birth. One of the types of congenital myopathy is nemalinemyopathy which is characterized as a disease with variable range of severity. Nemaline bodies are observed in the biopsy samples. M46T in actin is one of the causes of thiskind of myopathy. M49 is located in the D loop which is responsible for the stability of the F actin by wrapping around Tyrosine 171 of the adjacent G actin and ﬁt itself in the hydrophobic groove of it. To our knowledge, the effects of this mutation have not been studied yet. Materials and Methods: Wild and mutated types of actin was modelledusing EasyModeler2.1. The structure of mutant is compared with wild actin protein. Conformational changes were simulated using GROMACS 4.6.3 software package for100 ns. Results: It was realized that M46T changes the structure of D loop in a way that D loop is no longer able to beﬁtted properly in the hydrophobic groove. Moreover, Threonine is more polar and hydrophilic than Methionine which affects the polarity of the D loop and weakens the hydrophobic interaction between two adjacent G actins.Conclusion: These changes seem to be related to the abnormal assembly of the F actins which result in the nemaline myopathy.

CentoMD ®is a browser  based tool that enables access to a high quality repository of genetic and human phenotype ontology (HPO) based clin ical information. Methods: Data are gathered following a case oriented model, where patient information, standar  dized HPO clinical data, testing methodology and detectedgenetic variants are compiled together. Curation process is divided in three phases: variant wise, case wise and warnings wise procedures. All patients provided informedconsent before inclusion in the DB. Once included, all patient data are fully anonymized. The classi ﬁcation of genetic variants is done according to ACMG guidelines.Detected genetic variants are ﬁrst classi ﬁed into one of three classes: clinically relevant variants (CRV); clinically irre  levant variants (CIV); and variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VUS). Results: The patient cohort ( > 115,000 genetically screened individuals in CentoMD ®v3.2) is highly hetero  geneous covering the global population ( > 110 countriesworldwide). The observed age at genetic diagnosis ranges from prenatal stage to > 80.0 years. More than 660 million988variant detections are included. Approximately 55% of the CRV and VUS variants are novel. Notably, > 3% of the genetic variants previously reported in the literature as being pathogenic, were reclassi ﬁed based on strong internal evidence as clinically irrelevant.

Mis match in repair of unpaired nucleotides in genes can also be seen in CRC.The Wnt/ β catenin is an important cell sig naling pathway in intestinal homeostasis and usually isunregulated in CRC.Axin1 is an important component of this pathway and a negative regulator of Wnt/ β catenin signaling, which interacts with some proteins in β catenin degradation complex. Mutations in this gene increases the risk of CRC therefore the knowledge of these changes can play an important role in the early detection or treatment ofCRC.in this paper using novel bioinformatics approaches we determined the nucleotide sequence of exon5 of axin1 which could be mutated and was selected as one of the mostimportant SNPs(nucleotide70 G/T and position 304372 with rs34440193). Then using the Swiss Model software we predicted the tertiary structure and using Chimera andDeep View Molecular Viewing softwares the importance of mutation in this area was studied at their protein level. Mutation in this area causes a change in leucine whichstrictly is aliphatic amino acid to Methionine and changes the electrostatic forces, band distance, overall Protein energy and Reduces its stability.

 Copy number estimation from targeted and shallowsequencing in cancer samples,P16.06,"A. Venier, A. O’Hara, W. Sherman, Z. Che, S. Shams","BioDiscovery, El Segundo, CA, United States","Introduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) is mainly used to obtain sequence variants (SNVs). However, obtaining copy number results from NGS has gained momentum in both research and clinical applications, usingwhole genome, whole exome and targeted sequencing panels. Materials and Methods: Here we introduce the BAM (MultiScale Reference) algorithm to function with shallowand targeted sequencing data, as well as WGS and WES, using a novel dynamic binning approach. This approach uses a Hidden Markov Model to segment the genome intotarget areas using the reads in targeted regions and the backbone areas using the off target reads and additional areas. Results: Shallow WGS data and targeted panel NGSdata, as well as WES with normal depth of coverage, were used for the testing. The results were compared with those from microarray, BAM ngCGH (matched) and BAM(pooled reference). Differences in overall read depth resul  ted in variable sample quality across the cohorts, however most sample quality was adequate for copy number esti mation and a quality threshold was assessed. Results indi  cate that relative copy number can be estimated and is comparable to the results achieved with microarray for thesame targeted regions. Conclusion: The BAM (MultiScale Reference) method has been tested in a variety of cancer samples. This is an ideal tool for copy number estimationwith NGS results in cancer samples because it provides a way for non matched pair analysis with genome, exome and targeted NGS. A. Venier: None. A.

 F1174V Mutation Alters the ALK ActiveAbstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 989Conformation in Response to Crizotinib in NSCLC: Insight from Molecular Simulations,P16.07,"F. Dehghanian, M. Key, S. Vallian","University of Isfahan, Isfahan, Iran, Islamic Republic of","Crizotinib is an ef ﬁcient antineoplastic drug for treatment of non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC), which is identi ﬁed as an anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) inhi  bitor. F1174V is a recently identi ﬁed acquired point muta  tion relating to the Crizotinib resistance in NSCLC patients. The mechanism of Crizotinib resistance relating to F1174Vmutation as a non active site mutation remains unclear. In this study, the molecular dynamic simulation was used to investigate the possible mechanisms by which F1174Vmutation may affect the structure and activity of ALK kinase domain. The results suggested that F1174V mutation could cause two important secondary structure alterations,which led to the local conformational change in ALK kinase domain. This causes more positive free energy in the mutant complex in comparison with the wild type one. In addition,our structural analyses illustrated that F1174V mutation could result in some important interactions, which represent the key characteristics of the ALK active conformation.This study provided a molecular mechanism for ALK Cri  zotinib resistance caused by F1174V mutation, which could facilitate designing more ef ﬁcient drugs.

Successful identi ﬁca  tion of these few variants requires annotation with variousfeatures, especially function prediction score and con  servation score. Different annotation data is scattered across various databases, which makes manual annotation a time consuming and tedious process. Methods: To facilitate the annotation process, we developed a desktop application called Variant Annotation Analyzer (VAA) together withweb based Variant annotation service (VAS). VAA relies on VAS for automatic annotation. The VAS acts as front  end for dbNSFP database which aggregates many of variantdatabases. We have also developed prioritization process based on user preference. Results: VAA supports automatic annotation of variants in VCF ﬁle format. Annotated var  iants can be further ﬁltered, sorted, prioritized and exported. Modular architecture based on plugins allows easy imple  mentation of new features and additional annotation pro viders. Conclusion: The VAA application and the VAS web service provide researchers with rich and automated anno  tation of variants in a fraction of time compared to manualannotation. With the option of further prioritization it pro  vides a powerful tool for fast identi ﬁcation of potential candidate mutations among loads of irrelevant variants.

The Catalog contains data on over 35,000 associations fromover 2,700 publications, covering a wide range of human diseases and traits in an expanding number of ancestral backgrounds. The volume of eligible data continues to growwhich has led to delays between journal publication and inclusion in the Catalog.

This evolution, mainly in bioinfor  matics, offered innovative tools for classifying newer or existent copy number variations reports into more precise categories and diminish the VOUS account. We appliedthese tools on cytogenomics data of a cohort of 123 patients from Cytogenomics Laboratory of FMUSP in order to ﬁnd common types and subtypes of CNVs in Brazilian popu lation. No gender or age was discriminated in this analysis. The data of 123 patients were collected from multiple SNP  arrays experiments from different platforms. Bioinformaticstechniques were used to classify CNVs into ﬁtting cate  gories and statistics were calculated with RStudio (1.0.136). Only duplications and deletions were considered. Amongthe 123 patients, 109 CNVs consisted of deletions and 160 CNVs were duplications, some of them concomitants. Also 135 indels were classi ﬁed as pathogenic, 107 benign and 27 VOUS. The chromosomes X, 9, 22 and 7 showed the most number of alterations: 39 (14.5%), 24 (8.9%), 23 (8.6%) and 21 (7.8%), respectively. Our study revealed that Bra zilians patients present more duplications than deletions, which, in accord to DGV, is not the same in other popu  lations. And the most affected chromosome is the X. Thereﬁnement of bioinformatics tools and the help of databases of CNVs made the classi ﬁcation easier and more precise, letting researchers evaluate more data in less time with moreprecision and con ﬁdence in different populations.

Recently, algorithms extendingGAs by including phenotypic information to improve accuracy GPAs were introduced. Here, we compare the performance of a GA and two GPAs in identifying likelydisease causing variants found in patients from our WGS cohort (HICF2) to test the methods ’clinical validity. Methods: One GA (VAAST) was compared with two GPAs (Exomiser v7.2.1, VAAST +Phevor) using WGS data from seven RD patients. The cases included singletons and trios, different inheritance patterns (autosomal/ de novo dominant, autosomal/X linked recessive) and known and novel gene candidates. Phenotypic data was described using the Human Phenotype Ontology. Strong candidate variants,identi ﬁed manually by human disease experts with our clinical analysis pipeline, were used as benchmarks to test the algorithms ’effectiveness in prioritizing causal variants. Results: The algorithms ranked the benchmark variants in the top eleven for all seven cases. Phevor +VAAST ranked ﬁve benchmark variants ﬁrst, followed by VAAST (4/7) and Exomiser (3/7). While the GPAs did not sig niﬁcantly increase the number of benchmark variants ranked ﬁrst, they reduced the number of high scoring var iants requiring further analysis, saving time and costs. Particularly for a consanguineous case with many homo zygous variants, the GPAs accelerated the analysis, down grading variants unrelated to the phenotype. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate the usefulness of ranking algorithms for analysing clinical RD cases,while also making a case for collecting structured phe notypic information to improve clinical work ﬂows.

Registries should strive to be more Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, andReusable for humans and computers (FAIR), to conform with emergent global standards. To promote the establish  ment of FAIR RD registries, the National Centre for RareDiseases, Istituto Superiore di Sanità, Rome, Italy (CNMR  ISS) and DTL/ELIXIR NL have organized ‘Bring Your Own Data ’workshops (BYODs) for RD registry managers since 2014: a hands on learning experience where RD (data) experts and Linked Data experts collaborate to enable integrative questions across individually FAIR registries.We present acquired insights and the organisational road  map of these BYODs, encompassing (i) a preparatory phase with two webinars for registry managers, (ii) the two dayBYOD, (iii) a follow up phase to foster the results of the BYOD. The friendly environment of a BYOD stimulates open information exchange between experts from widelydifferent disciplines. Registry managers experience how preparing data for linking at the source makes dif ﬁcult queries easy. They learn about the requirements to make aregistry FAIR and their role as managers. Since the ﬁrst BYOD, we shifted focus from data only to managerial advice. We see a growing interest, positive feedback, andfollow up in the areas covered by the BYOD.

Sev  eral methods are available and the choice is sometimescontroversial. For a reliable DE analysis that reduces False Positive DE genes, and accurate estimation of gene expression levels, a suitable normalization approach(including correction for confounders) is mandatory. Materials and Methods: Several normalization methods have been proposed to correct for both within sample andbetween sample biases. RUV (Removing Unwanted Varia  tion) is one of them and has the advantage to correct for batch effects including potentially unknown unwanted var iation in gene expression. In this study, we present a comparison on real life paired end sequencing data for ER +Breast Cancer tissues versus matched controls between RUVg (using in silico negative control genes) and more commonly used methods for RNA seq data normalization, such as DESeq2, edgeR, and UQ. The set of in silicoempirical negative control genes for RUVg was de ﬁned as the set of least signi ﬁcant DE genes obtained after a ﬁrst DE analysis performed prior to RUVg correction. Resultsand conclusions: Box plots of relative log expression (RLE) among the samples and PCA plots show that RUVg per  forms well and leads to a stabilization of read count acrosssamples with a clear clustering of biological replicates.

Number of repeats varies widely in population which makes it a suitable tool for forensic ana lysis. In addition, several genetic diseases are associated with extreme prolongation in exonic regions, such as CTG motif exceeding 50 repetitions in DMPK gene is known tocause myotonic dystrophy. Materials and methods: We propose algorithm for identi ﬁcation of fragments originat  ing from STR locus of interest. The method accounts fornatural deviations from expected sequence, such as varia  tion in repeat count, sequencing errors, ambiguous bases and conjunction of several basic motifs. In addition weimplemented a calibration of aggregated allele counts to correct for copy number defects caused by the polymerase induced stutter effect. Results: We designed genotyping toolfor STR motifs, called Dante. Sequenced DNA fragments are pro ﬁled against motifs of interest that can be de ﬁned in a conﬁguration ﬁle. Allele genotypes with associated call conﬁdences are reported in a form of summary table. Conclusions: Precise genotyping of STR alleles from DNA fragments is useful addition to existing NGS data analysispipelines to allow intepretation of STR loci.

 ICELL8 ™single cell system enables the enumeration of paired αand ß chain sequence information for T cell receptors from thousands of cells,P16.25,M. Srinivasan,"WaferGen BioSystems, Fremont, CA, United States","Single cell RNA seq has quickly become the method of choice to identify and classify cell types present in complextissues based on cell to cell gene expression differences. A number of different methods exist to process thousands of cells in a single experiment. Low throughput methods suchas FACS can sort cells based on phenotypes but is expen  sive on per cell basis None of these methods enable a direct link between observable phenotypes and gene expressiondifferences at a single cell level for thousands of cells per experiment. To address this need, we developed a singlecell system, ICELL8 ™, that enables researchers to select cells based on ﬂuorescently labeled biomarkers (such as red ﬂuorescent protein or Hoechst/propidium iodide live/dead stain) and further process only the single cells of choice for genomics applications. The system uses nanowell arrays up to 9600 wells with well volumes up to 1 μl, which can beﬂexibly con ﬁgured to perform multi step method develop  ment at very low costs.

Theplatform architecture has been designed to use general purpose, open source software in all layers on which the platform is built, seeking to take advantage of the latestdevelopment in computer science while ensuring scal  ability. The platform requires centralised authentication, real time access to combined  omics data and phenotypicinformation, interoperability with catalogues of resources, and communication with international initiatives such as the GA4GH Beacon project and the GA4GH/IRDiRC Match Maker Exchange. To ful ﬁll these requirements, a mix of technologies and applications are deployed in an996environment using Foreman and Puppet to provision and manage the hardware layer. Most physical resources are managed through DCOS (based on apache mesos), which abstracts all the resources (CPU, memory and storage) away from machines, enabling a fault tolerant and elastic dis  tributed system (kernel layer). Many of the applications arerunning inside docker containers, orchestrated by Marathon. To cater for different data access requirements, we use a set of differentiated solutions. Hadoop hdfs was chosen forhigh throughput processing, elasticsearch for low latency queries, and RDBMS (postgres, mysql) for ACID transac  tion requirements. The Extract Transform Load (ETL)pipeline is used to parse genomics data, consolidate sample information by genomic coordinate, enrich the data, and load the product into elasticsearch.

The aim of the present work was to evaluate the prevalence of tet(M) in Tunisian isolates and to gain an insight into its origin andevolution. Twenty Ureaplasma parvum ,t w o Ureaplasma urealyticum and 48 Mycoplasma hominis isolates, recov  ered from Tunisian patients with urogenital and infertilitydisorders, were evaluated for their resistance to tetracyclines and interrogated by PCR ampli ﬁcation for the presence of tet(M) and int Tn . The resistance rates to tetracyclines were 22.72 and 25% among U.parvum andM. hominis isolates, respectively. All resistant isolates harboured both tet(M)andint Tn sequences. Molecular typing indicated that the tetracycline resistant U. parvum and M. hominis isolates were not clonal. Taken together, these data indicate that a single tet(M) gene sequence type, most probably trans  mitted via a Tn 916/Tn1545  like transposon, contributes to most of the tetracycline resistance in U. parvum andM. hominis isolates in Tunisia. Because this tet(M) gene sequence type was harboured by different Mycoplasma spp. and by phylogenetically distinct isolates within these spe cies, one could reasonably argue that it may have bene ﬁted from an ef ﬁcient horizontal transfer context, making it highly competent to spread.

The use of SNP based arrays will not only allow the detection of CNVs, but also generate genotyping information. This “extra”infor  mation can be used to increase diagnostic yield and toassure test quality. Increasing the diagnostic yield can be achieved by uncovering uniparental disomies (UPDs), regions of homozygosity (ROH), parental origin and allelicimbalances. Here we present applications to analyze CytoScan array data (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc) for rapid detection of such uniparental disomies (UPDs) and parent oforigin annotation of de novo deletions and duplications. Validation and performance data is also presented. Materi  als and Methods The development of the applications wasbased on using the genotype data from patients with known genetic aberrations. This resulted in two windows execu  tables that do not require prior installation, MyUPDFinderand MyPODFinder. Results MyUPDFinder was primarily designed to detect UPDs and parental origin of de novo deletions, whereas MyPODFinder detects parental origin ofde novo duplications. Samples with known relationships and aberrations were used for validation. New ﬁndings include cases with complete uniparental heterodisomy.Conclusions MyUPDFinder and MyPODFinder are suitable for SNP duo/trio analysis.

 An Integrated clinical variant con ﬁrmation tracking and primer designer system,P16.29,"K. Brugger, M. J. Garner, S. Abbs","Genetics laboratories, Cambridge University Hospitals,","Cambridge, United Kingdom With the current increase in genetic and cancer diag  nostic screening, there has also been an increase in demand for PCR based con ﬁrmations of identi ﬁed variants. The increase is due to large scale genome projects like the DDD and 100.000 genomes project, and the education of the general public regarding the availability of these tests. Withthe increased number of con ﬁrmations (~100/month) being performed in our laboratory the previous method of manually designing primers and tracking con ﬁrmations is no longer feasible in a high throughput environment.Here we present a web based con ﬁrmation system that can be run on a standard computer. Alternatively, the primer designerpart of the system can be run on its own if needed, out  putting either text or PDF reports. The system allows the users to setup con ﬁrmations; entering patient and variant information, and then track the whole process from select  ing primers, tracking primer orders, ongoing con ﬁrmations and the reporting of the con ﬁrmations. When selecting primers for a con ﬁrmation the user is informed if any of the primers have already been purchased and if any primer combinations have previously worked or failed. Further more, when possible, the primer design captures full exons +/  10 bp of the introns to ensure that the primers can be reused while also ensuring the primers do not contain anycommon SNPs. Finally, in the primer selection phase all primer pairs are analysed for pairs giving multiple products. All of these contribute to signi ﬁcant time and cost savings for the laboratory. K.

Besides the serum cholesterol level, Lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] is an independentrisk factor for the development of atherosclerosis and other related cardiovascular diseases. Correlation of telomere length [TL] with Lp(a) as a marker of increased oxidativestress and cell replication in risk of atherosclerosis has so far not been assessed. Materials and Methods: 26 HH patients with Lp(a) level higher than 500 mmol/L and 32 HHpatients with Lp(a) lower than 100 mmol/L, were matched in levels of total cholesterol, LDL, HDL, age, anthropo  metric data and sex ratio. For every participant relative TL[rTL] were assessed using rTL QPCR method. Data were statistically evaluated using t test. Results: Results indicate statistically longer rTL (1.086 ± 0.04387) in HH patentswith Lp(a) lower than 100 mmol/L compared to rTL (0.8937 ± 0.03543) in HH patients with Lp(a) level higher than 500 mmol/L (p ,0.0013). Conclusion: Results of our study indicate a strong correlation between higher levels of Lp(a) and shorter rTL, which might be the result of an earlyinﬂammation stage of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular diseases. The national screening program is important for detection of HH and prevention of HH with increased risk for complications. Nevertheless, additional biomarkers to assess the risk for arteriosclerosis are of outmost impor  tance.

Dysregulation of lncRNAs (e.g. HOTAIR) in tissues was detected in breast cancer (BC). Plasma samples are examined as liquid biopsies,therefore research and potential use of lncRNAs as plasma markers became highly topical.

Total RNA from plasma samples was isolated using miRNeasy Serum/Plasma Kit. Data analysis was performed using qBASE + and STATISTICA. Results: Although a pre ampli ﬁcation recommended for quanti ﬁcation from small starting RNA amounts was used, only 6 lncRNAs were detected in all plasma samples (Cq < 35). 11 lncRNAs were not detected in any samples. No signi ﬁcant difference was observed in expression of plasma lncRNAs between the BC patients and healthy donors despite the fact that our panel contained the lncRNAs whose expressions were previously reported assigniﬁcantly different at the level of cancer and control tissues. Conclusion: Detection of lncRNAs in plasma is due to its low levels quite dif ﬁcult as compared with tissues.

Sechenov First Moscow Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation,5Russian Medical Academy of Postgraduate Education, Moscow, RussianFederation Introduction Natural epigenomic variations in humans are poorly understood. For instance, long contiguous stret ches of homozygosity (LCSH) are consistently observed to be abundant in a human genome, but the role of these epigenomic variations in behavioral variability of the gen ome remains to be established. Recently, it has been shown that LCSH spanning loci of imprinted diseases (i.e. Angelman and Prader Willi syndromes) are associated withintellectual disability, autism and epilepsy (Iourov et al., 2015). Here, we have attempted to evaluate spectrum of epigenomic variations (LCSH) involving imprinted genes,which are not associated with a speci ﬁc disease. Methods Using SNP array molecular karyotyping (Affymetrix), we evaluated genomes of 350 children with intellectual dis ability and ASD. An original bioinformatics technique (Iourov et al., 2014) and a gene imprint database were applied to address LCSH pathogenicity involving imprintedgenes. Results LCSH involving imprinted genes was found in 263 (75%) individuals. LCSH encompassed following imprinted genes: PSIMCT 1 (33.4%), LIN28B (8%), RB1 (7%), ZC3H12C (6.9%), DNMT1 (5.4%), MAGI2 (5.1%), NPAP1 (3.7%). Proportions of individuals exhibiting these LCSH are given in parentheses. We have not found theseepigenomic variations to possess phenotypic effects. Con  clusions This study evidences for an additional type ofinterindividual (epi)genetic variations, which are likely to be benign in cases of the aforementioned genes in contrast to imprinted genes located at 7q21.3, 7q31.2, 11p15.5, 15p11.2 (according to Iourov et al., 2015). These natural epigenomic variations should be taken into account in future diagnostic and basic genomic/epigenomic studies.Supported by the Russian Science Foundation (project #14  15 00411). S.G.

Multi  parameter analyses and ROC curves were conducted withMATLAB simulation environment. MiRNAs that were found deregulated between OA and healthy cartilage were further analyzed by Webgestalt, TargetScan and DIANAbioinformatics we b tools. We identi ﬁed 279 differentially expressed miRNAs in OA patients ’serum compared to controls (p < 0.05 καιFDR < 0.05). 205 miRNAs (73.5%) were upregulated and 74 (26,5%) downregulated. 6 miRNAs were validated by real time PCR and con ﬁrmed the microarray data. Among them, miR 33 3p and miR 4284 had the highest down regulated values and AUC > 0,8 in ROC analysis. Bioinform atics analysis revealed that the deregulated miRNAs were involved in the TGFb,adherens junction pathway and biosynthesis of unsatu  rated fatty acids, as well as proteoglycans, glycosami  noglycan, AMPK and mTOR signaling pathways amongothers. Furthermore, it appeared miRNA enrichment showed participation in in ﬂammation biological func  tions. MiRNA arrays along with bioinformatics analysescould be proven a useful tool for the identi ﬁcation of prognostic and therapeutic targets in osteoarthritis. MiR 33 3p and miR 4284 could be proposed as novel bio  markers for early osteoarthritis development. *These authors contributed equally.

Kashuba","Institute of Molecular Biology and Genetics, Kyiv, Ukraine","Introduction: Previous studies demonstrated that BRAF mutation in thyroid cancer is mutually exclusive with RASSF1A promoter hypermethylation but often occurs together with methylation of RARbeta2 .A s RASSF1A , RARbeta2 and GSTP hypermethylation is common in prostate cancer we were aimed to check their interrelationwith BRAFV600E mutation in this type of tumor. Mate  rials and Methods: DNA from 18 urine samples of cancer patients and 6 non cancer individuals was isolated byphenol chlorophorm method. All samples were analyzed for the presence of normal BRAF alleles. After bisul ﬁte treatment MSP Real time P CR was performed to detect hypermethylation of RASSF1A ,GSTP and RARbeta2 promoters. Results: Normal BRAF allele was found in all 24 samples, BRAFV600E mutation was detected in onetumor and one normal sample. Methylation of RASSF1A was present in 17/18 tumor samples, GSTP andRARbeta2 promoters were hypermeth ylated in all samples from cancer patients. One sample from non cancer individuals had all three genes hypermethylated. Other normal sam  ples showed hypermethylation of one or 2 genes of set.In normal sample with BRAF mutation we found hyper  methylation of RASSF1A and RARbeta2 . Conclusions: We didn ’t found any correspondence between BRAF mutation and hypermethylation of studied genes.

In order to reconstruct and explain the pat  terns of genetic diversity evident in modern humans, an understanding of both past and present population dynamicsis crucial. Several studies have shown that genetic data from ancient individuals are indispensable when reconstructing past population histories. We for the ﬁrst time use the ancient genomics approach in South Asia to reconstruct the complex human population history of Indian Sub continent. We are exploring the recent technological advancement todirectly test these hypotheses using ancient and modern human DNA in India. We have collected several ancient skeletal remains from different time scale of human civili zation ranging from early Mesolithic, Neolithic, Harappan (Indus Valley civilization) and Megalithic culture.

Given the unique historical features of this genetically isolated popu  lation, going back thousands of years, this initiative will provide scienti ﬁc and health bene ﬁts for both the Armenian and international communities. Materials and Methods: Armenian individuals (n ,25) traced to Bayazet, Erzrum, Artsakh and Kharpertzi were recruited. Leukocyte DNAwas subjected to whole exome sequencing. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was performed on 15,000 common, single nucleotide polymorphisms from theArmenian and from 200 companion exomes representing over 10 worldwide populations. In addition, the Armenian individuals ’carrier status for selected autosomal recessive disorders was determined. Results: PCA analysis showed that Armenian genomes were genetically most related to American/European Caucasians and Ashkenazi Jewishindividuals, while appearing distant from Mexican/His  panic, Indian, and African populations. Based on pre  liminary data, individuals from Bayazet were most distantgenetically from European/American Caucasians. Known mutations in the MEFV gene causing familial Mediterra  nean fever were detected at frequencies expected (17.5%),but surprisingly, mutations for recessive disorders more typical of other ethnic groups, including Gauche disease, Fanconi anemia type C, and phenylketonuria, were identi ﬁed. No deleterious variants were found in the major genes associated with familial breast/ovarian and colon cancer.

The present study aims to determine the prevalence of consanguineous marriages and associatedfactors in Rabat, Morocco ’s capital. Materials and Methods: A prospective study was conducted within a randomlyselected sample (810 couples). All information was based on structured face to face interviews. Results: The results indicate that 21% (95% CI: 12.3 –28%) of marriages are consanguineous, among which 70% are between ﬁrst cou  sins. According to these results, educational level, place of residence (urban or rural), childhood residence and the ageatﬁrst marriage have an in ﬂuence on the choice of ﬁrst spouse for women. Multivariate analysis of data shows that the probability of marrying a relative is signi ﬁcantly higher among women who spent childhood in the countryside: they have eighteen times more likely than their urban counterparts. Moreover, according to the results, womenwho marry at a young age are more likely to accept this type of alliance, that is, ﬁve times more than the women who marry later. However, these two variables have no sig niﬁcant effect among men.

 CYP2D6 3 and 4 alleles frequencies among VolgaTatars,P18.10,"A. Garayeva, O. Kravtsova, A. Varfolomeev","Kazan Federal University, Kazan, Russian Federation","INTRODUCTION. CYP2D6 is a member of the cyto  chrome P450 gene superfamily which contributes to the metabolism of up to 25% of clinically used drugs. The interindividual variations of treatment response and toxicityof metabolized drugs are in ﬂuenced by the polymorphism of the gene and strongly depends on ethnicity. So, the aim of this study was to determine the frequencies of “slow” allele variants CYP2D6 *3 and CYP2D6 *4 in ethnic group of Tatars. METHODS: Genotyping of CYP2D6 *3 and *4 alleles (rs35742686 and rs3892097 respectively) was per formed on DNA samples extracted from venous blood from 583 unrelated persons of Tatar ethnicity from Republic of Tatarstan (Russia) using real time PCR with TaqManprobes. The statistical analysis was performed using R program package. RESULTS: In Tatars one of the most important “slow”allele variants CYP2D6 *3 had frequency of 0.6% which is between the Europeans (2%) and Mon  goloids (0.2%) whereas the frequency of CYP2D6 *4 was 11.2% which is much closer to the Asian populations fre quency (11% in Mongoloids vs 19% in Europeans). How  ever, 76.7% were identi ﬁed as homozygous extensive metabolisers (EM) with no mutant alleles, almost 23% werecarrying one mutant allele (heterozygous EM) and only 2 persons (0.34%) were classi ﬁed as poor metabolizers that were carrying both mutant alleles. CONCLUSION: Sinceallele variants of CYP2D6 gene can play essential role in interindividual and in interethnic differences in the meta  bolism of many therapeutic agents, the obtained resultscould be used in the prognosis of pharmacotherapy ef ﬁcacy in populations of Tatars.

Mutantalleles of these enzymes are involved in adverse drug reactions.. Population studies have demonstrated signi ﬁcant ethnic differences in the distribution of TPMT and NAT2variant alleles among various ethnic groups. The aims of this study were to determine the frequencies of allelic var  iants in the TPMT , and NAT2 genes in the Bahraini popu  lation and compare them with the frequencies in other ethnic groups. Materials and Methods DNAs were isolated from per  ipheral blood leucocytes of 265 healthy Bahraini volunteers. TPMT*2 was detected using an allele speci ﬁc polymerase chain reaction (PCR) assay. PCR RFLP assay was appliedfor the determination of TPMT*3 A (*3B). TPMT*3 C and NAT2 variants (*5,*6 and *7) were detected using an allele  speciﬁc real time PCR assay. Results Genotyping of TPMT revealed frequencies of 0.949, 0.008, 0.008 and 0.036 for TPMT *1, *2, *3B, and *3 C, respectively. No TPMT*3 A was detected in theanalyzed samples. The frequencies of speci ﬁc NAT2 alleles were 0.150, 0.405, 0.397 and 0.047 for *4 (wild type), *5 (T341C), *6 (G590A) and *7 (G857A), respectively.

The evaluated Ne/N ratio was 0.125 (95% CI [0.077; 0.271] for g,2 (corresponds to 1941), 0.114 (95% CI [0.065; 0.280] for g ,1 (corresponds to 1966), and 0.124 (95% CI [0.065; 0.341] for g ,0 (corresponds to 1991). The esti  mates of Newere approximately one tenth of the Lithuanian census population size. Conclusions: We conclude thatnatural levels of ﬂuctuations such as variance in size, reproduction, sex ratio, and the degree to which generations overlap probably in ﬂuenced the small values of Ne/N in the Lithuanian population. Considering our results however, we think that the true Neis contained within the bootstrap conﬁdence interval.

 Exome sequencing of an Arabian set reveals diverse novel variants,P18.15,A. M. Alkhateeb,"Jordan U of Science and Technology, Irbid, Jordan","Arab genome is poorly represented in human genome databases such as the 1000 genome project and HapMap.Arabs represent a unique genetic structure due to wide  spread endogamous and consanguineous marriage and to admixture over the centuries with migrating subcultures ofAfrican, Asian and European ethnicities. With the objective of getting better understanding of the genetic structure ofArabian genome and examine its diversity we analyzed the genome of six apparently normal unrelated males of Ara  bian decent.

Family based studies have indicated that more than 60% of variations in susceptibility to thrombosis are attributable to inherited components. Although morethan 99,5% of genetic material is conserved among different ethnicities, the frequencies of variants and common genetic factors for thrombosis vary widely. There are few studiesthat directly compare the variation in distribution Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR C677T gene mutations according to ethnicity. According to this fact, thatdistribution of above mentioned mutations in Georgian population hasn ’t been studied before, the aim of our study was to detect and compare the rates of distribution of thesemutations among Georgian population and different ethnic groups. Materials and Methods: 1340 unrelated Georgians were genotyped by PCR analyses for last seven years.Results: distribution of studied mutations in Georgian general population is high and resembles upper data of Caucasians.

Our aim now was to explore families with late AO ( ≥50). From the data registry at Unidade Corino de Andrade, we analysed the descendants of late  onset cases. For statistical analysis, SPSS v.23 was used. Among 178 offspring of those initial late AO cases, 105(59%) had early AO ( < 40) (59% males, 41% females). Moreover, 65% inherited the disease from their mother, while 35% from the father (p < 0.05). In contrast, 73 (41%)had AO ≥40 (47% males, 53% females), with no parent of  origin effect. In the 3 rdgeneration, only two individuals(2.9%) had AO ≥40, while 30 were still asymptomatic (44.1%). The remaining 36 (52.9%) presented early AO. Within the asymptomatic group, we found a mean higher age at observation when the transmitting parent had AO ≥ 40. None of the offspring in the 2ndor 3rdgeneration had an onset later than their 1stgeneration. We found anticipation in most of the siblings, showing that this is not an isolated event. When anticipation of AO was seen, the reverse could not be found in subsequent generations. We con ﬁrmed a parent of origin effect, but associated only with the transi  tion from late to early AO. Due to the different clinical presentation of FAP in later onset patients and the abruptdecrease in AO often seen in just one generation, it is crucial to explore the mechanisms that may lead to this phenomenon.

Ribeiro2,1","1Research Center for Anthropology and Health (CIAS), University of Coimbra, Coimbra, Portugal,2Department of Haematology, Centro Hospitalar e Universitário de Coim  bra (CHUC), Coimbra, Portugal Introduction: Elevated HbA2 levels provide diagnostic evidence for beta thalassemia trait. This study aims to examine the genetic basis of HbA2 variability in beta  thalassemia carriers using SNP variations previouslyreported associated with HbF. Material and Methods: Sixty one β thalassemia carriers of Portuguese descent (34 females and 27 males) aged 2 –77 years (mean 32.7), with HbA2 levels ranging 3.4 –6.8% (mean 4.78), were selected. HbA2 and HbF levels were determined by HPLC. Twelve SNPs in loci BCL11A ,DCHS2 ,HMIP ,HBG2 ,RNF113B , GLP2R andKLF1 were genotyped using TaqMan assays or by PCR RFLP. Informed consent was provided by all the participants. Associations of SNPs with HbA2 levels wereassessed by linear regression under a dominant genetic model using PLINK. Results: Linear regression showed nominal signi ﬁcant association between the rs61746132 minor A allele on DCSH2 gene and HbA2 levels after adjustment for age and sex (P ,0.039), remaining signi ﬁcant after adjustment for HbF (P ,0.039). A nominal signi ﬁcant association was found between the rs3817621 minor C allele on KLF1 gene and HbA2, unadjusted (P ,0.019) and adjusted for age and sex (P , 0.038), however the signi ﬁcance was lost when adjusting for HbF. No nominal signi ﬁcant associations were observed for the remaining analysed SNPs. Conclusions: Our resultssuggest a relationship between HbA2 levels and rs61746132 located at DCSH2 gene which is overexpressed in bone marrow stromal cells. The KLF1 gene promoter common variation rs3817621 was found signi ﬁcantly associated with HbA2 levels which appear to be mediated by the effects of this locus on HbF expression. L. Manco: None. C.

Our aim was to study the incidence of HPV types in samples of Bulgarian patients from different PAP groups and to studythe role of DNA methylation in the progression of HPV infected cervical samples. Materials and methods: We genotyped 19 high/medium risk HPV types in 69 cervicalsamples by allele speci ﬁc hybridization. Then we measured hypermethylated DNA fraction in promoters of 22 genes, connected to cellular stress and oncogenesis by real timePCR arrays in two HPV positive groups: PAP I/II and PAP III/IV. Results: The most prevalent were HPV 16 (31.9%), followed by HPV 66 (29%) and HPV 56 (14.5%). Therewas statistically signi ﬁcant difference between PAP groups   75% of PAP III/IV samples were HPV positive versus 43% of PAP I/II samples. In PAP III/IV we found anincrease in hypermethylation of more than 1.5 times for genes Rara, Gadd45G, BNIP3, SCARA3, Mlh1, Xpc and CDKN1a. Conclusions: We suggest an association betweenHPV cervical progression and hypermethylation (inactiva  tion) of important tumor suppressor genes and genes, con  nected to oxidative stress protection.

The largest contribution to the gene pool of mitochondrial haplogroups in the region was madeby the lines H (24,9%), U (20,7%) and T (11,5%)   together they account for about half of all mtDNA haplogroups in the Volga Ural region. In the populations of the Volga Uralregion 33 mitochondrial genomes were completely sequenced, all belonging to the paragroup H * (samples not related to the H1 H14 lines). Three populations wereidenti ﬁed with haplogroup H55: Mari (8.6%), Arkhangelsk Bashkirs (6.8%) and Chuvash (2.9%). In the Udmurt population a new haplogroup H99 was discovered with afrequency of 4.6%. Most of the Y chromosome gene pool in the studied populations falls into three haplogroups: R  M269, R M198 and N M231, with frequency ranging from49% to 100% in different populations. Based on the research on the new markers (Pamjav et al, 2012;.. Under  hill et al, 2014), we conducted a study of the individualbranches of haplogroup R1a M198.

 Reconstruction of the early population history ofAfricans in the Americas through St. Helena Island (South Atlantic) and New York City,P18.22,"G. Johnson, F. Jackson","Howard University, Washington, DC, United States","Improved sequencing technologies allow for ancient DNA research of historic remains of underrepresented groups, which can provide riveting insights into their bio logical history. The combination of molecular genomic analyses and morphometric anthropometric assessments, within bioarchaeological and historical contexts, give amore accurate perspective on the signi ﬁcant events that occurred in the past. The investigation focuses on the status of early to mid 19 thcentury Africans on their way to enslavement in the Americas and the status of late to 18ththrough mid 19thcentury enslaved Africans and African Americans in New Amsterdam/New York City. Thisinvestigation reconstructs the early population history of Africans in the Americas using these two important source populations. There is an examination of the range ofdemographic and morphometric diversity discovered among the liberated Africans buried at St. Helena. A goal is to determine if there is any similarity with that observedamong individuals found in the New York African Burial Ground. It is hypothesized that skeletal remains on St. Helena show evidence of disease and trauma similar to theskeletal remains found on the New York African Burial Ground. Furthermore, the suggestion is that the range of ancestral genomic variability found in the South AtlanticAfrican remains is similar to the range of genomic diversity observed in the New York African Burial Ground. Toge  ther, these sites provide a continuum of insights into theearly population history of these African peoples. G. Johnson: None. F. Jackson: None. E",2017

The aim was to carry out the population genetic survey of one of the indigenous population of the Karachay Cherkessia Repub  lic, Karachays, and compare it with other ethnic groups,Abazins, and Nogais. The Karachays are a Turkic speaking people of the North Caucasus. Methods: DNA samples from healthy unrelated individuals (383 individuals) wereexamined for nine polymorphic DNA loci of nuclear gen  ome: diallelic markers CCR5 (del32), ACE (del/ins), D7S23 (KM19), NOS3 (VNTR), and polyallelic loci THOI (STR),FABP2 (STR), CFTR (IVS6aGATT), PAH (VNTR), DATI (VNTR) by PCR. Results: Allele and genotype frequency distributions were obtained for Karachays. Analysis ofalleles frequency of autosomal DNA markers revealed genetic differentiation between populations Karachays and other indigenous populations of the Republic. The highestlevel of genetic diversity in a diallelic system was estimated for the locus ID/ACE, H obs,0.4960, in a polyallelic system   for the locus THOI (STR), Hobs,0.7804. The index of mean heterozygosity was 0.4565. The index of mean intra  populational differentiation ( FST) was 0.0101. The highest level of intra populational differentiation was revealed atlocus VNTR/eNOS ( F ST,0.0216), the lowest one   at the locus КМ19 (FST,0.0027).

To calculate T/S ratios (telomere ampli ﬁcation/ single copy gene ampli ﬁcation (36B4)), the samples ran in duplicate in the same well position, for three times. Telomere and 36B4 gene ampli ﬁcation were done in different plates. All the samples quanti ﬁed against a 5 point standard curve using a mixture of 5 genomic DNA with different chronological ages as areference DNA. K562 genomic DNA was included in each plate as a quality control and to avoid more than 5% coefﬁcient of variation between different plates.

 An evaluation of de novo mutation content in the Lithuanian exome,P18.26,"L. Prancke ˙niene ˙, A. Jakaitiene, V. Kucinskas","Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Faculty of","Medicine, Vilnius University, Vilnius, Lithuania De novo mutations (DNMs) are the ultimate source of genetic variation and one of the driving forces of evolution. Early studies of mutation rates in humans focused on rela  tively small and speci ﬁc loci or on the de novo incidence of disease. Family based whole genome sequencing has begun to identify DNMs that provide more direct measures of mutation rates. Therefore in our study we have focused onthe DNM content and intensity of Lithuanian whole exome ’s data. Sequencing of 48 trios exomes was per  formed using SOLiD 5500 system. Sequencing data wasgenerated by Lifescope. DNMs called by two alternatives programs, VarScan and VarSeq. Called DNMs were ﬁltered by applying the genotype quality and number of reads ﬁl  ters.

R package was used to estimate rate of DNM. We estimated 189 (VarScan) and 121 (VarSeq) DNMs respectively. In our calculation DNM rate is the probability of calling position as a DNM in a trio with respect to sequencing depth. DNV rate varies between families and it ’s somewhat higher for Lithuanian exome data as compared to 1.5 × 10−8estimated in other research.

Several studies suggested the link between dis turbances in melatonin production and impaired insulin, glucose, lipid metabolism and antioxidant capacity [1]. Also, genome wide association studies reported an intro ninc single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP: rs10830963) as a candidate variant of glucose homeostasis and type 2 dia  betes [2 –5]. In Korean population study, the rs10830963 was signi ﬁcantly associated with gestational diabetes mel  litus [7]. Materials & Methods: We tested the association in a Korean population which was recruited by direct to consumer genetic predisposition service (GeneStyle  Direct TM, TherageneEtex Co., Ltd.). From Jul. 2016 to Nov. 2016, total 272 individuals were participated and obtainedthe written informed consents. We obtained the self  assessment questionnaire which including the items such as birth year, sex, height, weight, waist circumference, andthe disease history of hyperlipidemia, type 2 diabetes mel  litus, and fatty liver disease.

Here we evaluated admixture at genomicscale and characterized the ancestry related mosaic organi  zation of chromosomes (local ancestry) in order to identify regions with larger than average African ancestry. Materials and Methods: The study was performed on samples from 146 individuals that were genotyped for 580 K variants. Overlapping SNP data from EUR, NAF andSSA from public resources was utilized to estimate both global and local genetic ancestries by means of ADMIX  TURE, LAMP LD and ELAI software. Whole genomesequencing data (30 × ) from a subset of 14 samples were used to study variants with extreme allele frequency dif  ferences between EUR and Africans within the identi ﬁed regions. Results: ELAI provided better ﬁtting estimates than LAMP LD based on comparisons against ADMIXTUREestimates. Local ancestry estimates allowed identifying a signiﬁcant departure from the genome wide average Afri  can ancestry (|Z score| > 3) in the major histocompatibilitycomplex region. A ﬁner examination of sequence variation in this region validated this observation. Conclusions: Our results provide a basis for admixture mapping studies in the Canary Islanders and supports the existence of genetic footprints introduced by African1012ancestors that can be associated with population disparities in disease traits.

Sequence analysis revealed, 412haplotypes in 22 ethnic groups. In spite of that 65% sequences were observed once, 11%, twice, 8% thrice, 5% four time and 2.2% ﬁve times. The most common South Asian haplotypes are observed, M 46%, N 7%, and R 13%, while West Eurasian haplotypes are U 18%, H 5%, J 4%, W 3% and T 2% in 22 ethnic groups. A random match prob ability between two unrelated individuals was found to be 0.01 to 0.06%. While genetic diversity was found to be 0.991 to 0.999, with nucleotide diversity ranging from0.0089 to 0.0142. The con ﬁguration of genetic variation and heterogeneity further unveiled through Multidimensional Scaling and phylogenetic analysis. The results revealed thatPakistani ethnic groups are the composite mosaic of West Eurasian ancestry of numerous geographic origin and theyreceived substantial gene ﬂow during different invasive movements and have a high element of the Western provenance.",P18.29,S. bhatti: None.

 Are CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotypes associated withnicotine dependence among physicians in Estonia?,P18.32,"M. Pauskar1, M. Raag2, K. Loigu2,K .P a ¨rna2, K. Huik1","1Department of Microbiology, Institute of Biomedicine and","Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 2Institute of Family Medicine and Public Health, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, Tartu, Estonia Introduction: The AA genotype (rs16969968) of CHRNA5 gene has been associated with increased risk for nicotine dependence (ND) and lung cancer. Physicians are well de ﬁned and homogeneous sample, giving the unique opportunity to study genetic architecture of smoking beha  vior. Therefore, we aimed to evaluate associations between CHRNA5 genotypes and susceptibility to ND among phy sicians in Estonia. Materials and methods: DNA samples of 823 physicians (218 daily smokers matched by gender and age with 605 non smokers) were analysed. CHRNA5rs16969968 genotyping was carried out by using TaqMan Allelic Discrimination Assay. ND was evaluated using The Fagerström Test for Nicotine Dependence (FTND). Chi squared test and Fisher ’s exact test were used to compare the distributions of CHRNA5 rs16969968 and FTND. Results: The mean age in both groups was 53 (SD ± 13)years and approximately one third of the physicians were men. The CHRNA5 rs16969968 genotypes were in Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium. The distribution of the genotypes didnot differ between smokers and non smokers: AA (11.5% vs 10.9%), AG (44.0% vs 45.5%) and GG (44.5% vs 43.6%) (p > 0.05). The CHRNA5 rs16969968 A allele fre quency was similar among smokers and non smokers   55.5% vs 56.4% (p > 0.05), respectively and no associations of FTND scores (0 –5v s6 –10) with the risk allele and genotypes were found (p > 0.05). Conclusions: Based on our results CHRNA5 genotypes are not associated with the nicotine dependence among physicians in Estonia. Thisstudy was supported by the Estonian Research Council grant PUT 299.

Trebuak Podkrajek1,P .",Kotnik2,"1Unit of Special Laboratory Diagnostics, University Chil  dren’s Hospital, UMC Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2Department of Endocrinology, Diabetes and Metabolism, University Children ’s Hospital, UMC Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia Background: The increasing prevalence of morbid obesity is one of the major public healthcare problems worldwide. The environmental and genetic factors involvedin the aetiology of obesity are subject of great research interest. Genome wide association studies identi ﬁed several genes associated with obesity. Obesity associated geneticvariants in melanocortin 4 receptor ( MC4R ) are found in approximately 2% of obese individuals. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of MC4R  associated obesity in a cohort of obese Slovenian children and adolescents. Materials and Methods: Promoter and coding regions ofMC4R gene were analysed in 224 children and adoles  cents (113 females/111 males; mean BMI SDS 3.32 ± 0.77, mean age 13.2 ± 3.9 years) using direct Sanger DNAsequencing. Results: Eight unique previously reported genetic var  iants of MC4R (NM_005912.2) were identi ﬁed in 22 par  ticipants, of them 2 were classi ﬁed as pathogenic (c.542 G > A, c.631_634delCTCT), 1 as potentially pathogenic (c.335 C > T), 3 variants of unknown clinical signi ﬁcance (c.*42 T > C, c.*60 C > T, c. 178A > C) and 2 non  pathogenic polymorphisms (c.307 G > A and c.751 A > C). Four participants were carriers of pathogenic MC4R variants, including two individuals with the variant c.335 C > T. Conclusion: The estimated prevalence of MC4R asso  ciated obesity in Slovenian paediatric population is between 0.9% and 1.8%, warranting the routine analysis of MC4R gene in diagnostic protocols of severe obesity. The reportedfrequency of obesity associated MC4R genetic variants is in concordance with previously published reports from other populations.

OPRD1 is one of the most important genes related to drug dependence,tolerance, reward pathway, hypoxia/ischemia, and meso  limbic dopamine system. We aimed for the ﬁrst time in Iranian population, to characterize the impact of rs2236857,rs2236855, and rs760589 on occurrence of opioid addiction among patients underwent Methadone Maintenance Treat  ment. Furthermore, association of these variants withinsomnia and libido were investigated for pharmacoge  nomics aspects. Samples were examined among 202 healthy and 202 opioid addict subjects, all men (20  60 years old).Genomic DNAs extracted from whole blood samples by Salting Out procedure. The gene variants were genotyped by Allelic discrimination Taqman assay. All analysis wasperformed by SNPalyze ver.8.1 software. According to the single locus analysis, rs2236857 [P ,0.002, OR ,1.52; 95CI (1.16 –1.99)], rs2236855 [P ,0.001, OR ,1.58; 95CI (1.20–2.09)], and rs760589 [P ,0.03, OR ,1.30; 95CI (1.02–1.67)] had signi ﬁcant contributions between groups in the current study, all under a co dominant hereditarymodel. By haplotype analysis, four haplotypes were sig  niﬁcant in cases and controls. The most common haplotype with overall frequency 36% involved T C G (major major major alleles) represented highest signi ﬁcancy among the study group (P ,3.3E 8). In conclusion, rs2236857, rs2236855, and rs760589, variants of OPRD1, might have aremarkable association with opioid addiction.

Three regions of p53and two of VEGFA were ampli ﬁed by PCR followed by direct  sequencing using saliva extracted DNA. Results: Eighty four participants (28 males, 56 females) were recruited. Family history of POH was prevalent. In majority (n ,62) both eyelids were affected. Mixed (pigmentary vascular)was the most common type. Fourteen polymorphic SNPs were found, eight of them are not reported before. A sig  niﬁcant association was observed between CT genotype in VEGFA rs3025039 and type of POH (p ,0.044), as well as visible vessels in eyelids (p ,0.035). Presence of vascular type was signi ﬁcantly associated with VEGFA rs699947 (p ,0.010). Involvement of both eyelids and homogenous pigmentation was signi ﬁcantly associated with TT genotype inp53 codon212 (p ,0.011).

 Individuals with hereditary Primary Arrhythmia Syndrome represent A Phenotypic Variability of ANK2 Mutations,P18.39,"E. Shkurti1, S. Diamant2","1University of Medicine, Tirana, Albania,2University","Hospital Center Mother Theresa, Tirana, Albania Introduction Alterations in ANK2 have been reported to be the source of assorted arrhythmia phenotypes. The occurrence of ANK2 mutation transporters in hereditary primary arrhythmia syndrome (IPAS), nevertheless, is uni dentiﬁed in Albanian. By means of a next generation sequencer, we intended to recognize ANK2 mutations in the cohort of IPAS individuals, in whom conservative Sangersequencing not succeeded to recognize pathogenic muta  tions in main contributing genes, and to appraise the clinical features of ANK2 mutation transporters. Materials and Methods We monitored 524 probands with IPAS and investigated 42 genes counting entire ANK2 exons applying a bench top NGS (MiSeq, Illumina) orcarried out whole exome sequencing applying HiSeq2000 (Illumina). Results 10 of 524 probands (1.8%, aged 0 –55 years, 7 males) were discovered to hold 6 dissimilar heterozygous ANK2 mutations. ANK2 W1535R was recognized in 3LQTS individuals and 1 symptomatic BrS and was calcu  lated as harmful by numerous forecast software. Altogether, as to phenotype, there were 7 LQTS, 1BrS, 2 IVF. Aston  ishingly, 3/7LQTS patients had the attained category of LQTS (aLQTS). An overall of 6 of 11 individuals had acknowledged malignant ventricular tachyarrhythmia. Conclusions Assorted ANK2mutations are correlated with an widespread variety of phenotypes, counting aLQTS, particularly with ventricular ﬁbrillation, instead of “ankyrin  B”syndrome. E.

 Age of R261 mutation in PAH gene in Karachay Cherkess Republic (Russia),P18.40,"I. A. Kuznetcova1, P. Gundorova1, R. A. Zinchenko1,2,A .",V. Polyakov1,"1Federal State Budgetary Institution «Research Centre for Medical Genetics», Moscow, Russian Federation,2Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inborn metabolic disorder, caused by mutations in the PAH gene. That results in decreased metabolism of phenylalanine andsevere intellectual disability. The highest frequency of PKU is found on the territory of the Russian Federation in the Karachay Cherkess Republic (1:850 newborns). Thispopulation is characterized by individual PAH gene muta  tion spectrum with major mutation R261*(allele frequency 67,3%, carrier frequency in Karachays 1:16). Materials andMethods: DNA samples of 26 PKU patients with homo  zygous mutation R261* and 60 healthy Karachays were investigated. STR markers, ﬂanking PAH gene D12S1588 (4,82 cM to gene PAH ), D12S1727 (2,81 cM), D12S78 (1,87 cM), D12S338 (1,87 cM), D12S317 (4,28 cM) were investigated by AFLP method. Results: For each markerlinkage disequilibrium was determined and the age of the mutation was calculated. Linkage disequilibrium was 0,58 ± 0,16, 0,71 ± 0,15, 0,92 ± 0,08, 0,93 ± 0,08 and 0,73 ± 0,12respectively. In D12S78 and D12S338 linkage dis  equilibrium was not observed, so we did not consider them. The resulting age by three markers D12S1588, D12S1727and D12S317 is 11.1, 12.2 and 7.2 generations respectively. The average value of generation number while mutation existed in the population amounted to 10,2 ± 2,7. Since theaverage generation age is 30, we ﬁnd that the mutation started spreading about 305 ± 80 years ago. Conclusions: R261* mutation began to spread in Karachays about 100years before the population growth started (1800s) and further dissemination continued in parallel with1016demographic growth. That explains the rapid spread of R261* mutation in Karachays. This work was partially funded by RFBR grants 14 04 00525 and 15 04 01859 I.A. Kuznetcova: None. P. Gundorova: None. R.A.

 Obesity increases the prostate cancer risk in Koreansunlike Europeans: a Mendelian randomization Study,P18.42,"S. Lee1, S. Byun2,J .O h2, J. Sung1","1Seoul National University, Seoul, Korea, Republic of,","2Seoul National University Bundang Hospital, Seongnam, Korea, Republic of Introduction: Conventionally accepted risk factors of prostate cancer (PCa) are challenged, as large genomic dataallows causal inference using Mendelian Randomization analyses. Unlike epidemiologic studies, obesity showed no association in a large Caucasian study. Two recent GWASon PCa in Asians suggested more similarity than ethnic differences in genetic architecture, which makes the large ethnic gap in PCa more elusive. We attempted to examinethe association between PCa and obesity/lipid pro ﬁles in Korean men, who still have lower incidence but rapid surge in the PCa rates. Methods: We involved 4,122 healthy menfrom the Korean Genome Epidemiology Study, and 1,001 PCa cases with genetic information. Based on previous GWAS reports, we constructed genetic risk scores (GRS) asgenetic instrumental variables (IV) representing BMI, LDL/ HDL cholesterol, and triglyceride. Two stage least square regression analyses were performed to test causal associa tions. Results: The GRS explained 1.15%, 1.85%, 4.03%, and 2.31% of the phenotypic variance for BMI, LDL, HDL, and TG, respectively. All GRS were not pleiotropic to oneanother (F statistic < 5). GRS for BMI was associated with increased PCa risk (OR per SD increase in BMI GRS 1.61 [1.20   2.17 95% CI]; p value 0.001). All GRS IV for lipidswere not associated with altering PCa risk. Conclusion: Our ﬁndings suggest obesity per se might be a true risk factor of PCa for Koreans unlike in European descendants, and notthrough dyslipidemic complications. Whether and to what extent these ethnic differences can explain the current gap in PCa might ensue further studies. S. Lee: None. S. Byun: None. J. Oh: None. J. Sung: None. E",2017

It classically de ﬁned as a microvasculopathy that primarily affects the small bloodvessels of the kidney as a complication of diabetes mellitus (DM). Recently, case control studies demonstrated that the TCF7L2 (transcription factor 7 like 2 gene) variants were strongly associated With an increased risk of type 2 dia betes. The aim of this study was to investigate the asso ciation of three variants at the TCF7L2 (rs7903146(C/T),rs12255372 (G/T) and rs290487(C/T) with development of retinopathy in an Iranian Population in the north of Iran who have type 2 diabetes (T2D). The genotype and allele ana lysis of three SNPs were performed in 205 DR and 257 diabetic patients without retinopathy (DNR). Genotypes were determined by using TaqMan technology Allelic dis crimination on an ABI7300 system. A signi ﬁcant difference was observed in allele T frequency between DR and DNR subjects in both rs7903146(C/T) and rs290487(C/T). (P , 0.0006 and p ,0.002 respectively).

Since 2002, speci ﬁc villages are screened for genetic variations known to cause rare and severe disorders, where carrier frequency is ≥1 in 60 in the reference popu  lation. Today, this Health Ministry funded screeningincludes over 18 rare severe diseases. Summarizing 15 years’experience in screening Galilee and Golan Heights Druze communities, we were able to resolve the diagnosisof multiple patients, each with a unique disease, who were homozygous for the same sequence variant prevalent in heterozygous form in several villages. Mutations causingCockayne syndrome, Donohue syndrome, and Primary Hyperoxaluria type 1 (PH 1) are three such examples. Interestingly, the genetic variation that underlies Prolidasedeﬁciency (p.Ser202Phe in PEPD ) and the genetic variation that causes PH 1 (c.33_34delC in AGXT ) were prevalent in both Moslem and Druze villages. Over the last decade, wehave witnessed dramatic changes in attitudes toward genetic screening in the four non Jewish sectors in the region we serve and survey. Furthermore, consanguinity rates in theGalilee and Golan Heights have dropped in recent years, indicating changes in traditional customs that may lead to broader acceptance of inter village marriages, which mayresult in dissemination of founder Druze mutations across different villages. Thus, it is essential to assess the estab  lishment of a central screening test for the identi ﬁcation of couples at risk for affected babies among the entire Druze population. L. Kalfon: None. M.

First described in Portugal by Andrade (1952), Portuguese patients have been characterized by early onset (35.4 yrs). However, AO now ranges 19 –82 yrs and asymptomatic carriers aged > 90 yrs are known to havechildren with late and early onset. Materials and Methods : From the data registry at UCA, we retrieved data on 2713 patients (1461 men) and 604 asymptomatic carriers (212men) on regular follow up: gender, AO or age at last examination (ALE for asymptomatic carriers). We used t and Mann Whitney tests. Survival curves for AO (ALE ofasymptomatic carriers included as censored data) were estimated by Kaplan Meyer methods and compared by gender using a log rank test. Statistical analysis used SPSSv.23. Results :mean AO was signi ﬁcantly different in men (33.4 y) and women (37.6 y), (p < 0.001); in the asympto  matic group no gender differences were found for meanALE (38.0 vs. 38.6). In the early onset group women had later onset (32 y) than men (29 y) (p < 0.001), while in the1018late onset it was 53 y (women) and 57 y (men) (p < 0.005). With survival analysis, overall gender distributions were different, as well as when AO < 40 yrs; however, when AO≥40 yrs, no signi ﬁcant differences were found. Conclusions: probably due to a pool of older asympto  matic women, gender differences were no longer apparentfor AO ≥40, whereas conventional tests showed gender differences in opposite directions in the groups with AO < 40 and with AO ≥40. Next we should explore whether we have more than one underlying distribution for each gender. A. Sousa: B.

" Association study of genetic variations in CD1A, CD1D and risk of tuberculosis in an Iranian Population",P18.49,"M. Taheri, M. Naderi, M. Hashemi, H. Danesh, F.",Bizahani,"Zahedan University of Medical Sciences, Zahedan, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) caused by Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB), is still a public health concern, and leading cause of morbidity and mortalitythroughout the world especially in Africa and Asia. Cluster of differentiation 1 (CD1) is a family of glycoprotein which expressed on antigen presenting cells (APC). They are belongs to major histocompatibility complex class Ι(MHC) and participate in presentation of lipid antigens to T cells. The current study aimed to examine the possible associationbetween CD1A and CD1D polymorphisms, and risk of pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) in an Iranian population. Material and Methods: This case control study was conducted on 172 PTB patients and 180 healthy subjects. The CD1A rs411089, CD1A rs366316, CD1D rs973742, CD1D rs859009, CD1D rs859010 polymorphism weregenotyped using PCR RFLP. Results: The results demonstrated that CC genotype of CD1A rs411089 polymorphism in recessive modelincreased the risk of PTB in comparison with TT +TC genotypes (OR ,2.71, 95% CI ,1.36–5.40, P ,0.004). GC genotype as well as GC +CC genotype of CD1D rs859009 Polymorphism decreased the risk of PTB (OR , 0.49, 95% CI ,0.29–0.85, P ,0.01 and OR ,0.53, 95% CI,0.31–0.89, P ,0.01, respectively). Conclusion: Our results proposed that CD1A rs411089 polymorphism may increase the risk of PTB, but CD1D rs859009 Polymorphism decreased the risk of PTB. Fur thers studies with larger sample sizes and different ethni  cities are necessary to con ﬁrm our ﬁndings. M. Taheri: None. M. Naderi: None. M. Hashemi: None. H. Danesh: None. F. Bizahani: None.

Additionally, we will construct a high quality whole exome data set for demographic inference of the Faroese population. Materials and Methods: From the 1500 individuals recruited to the FarGen infrastructure we will select 24 healthy trios in addition to 600 healthy single  individuals, representing six sub regions of the archipelago.The trio lineages will be veri ﬁed by the national genealogy registry at the Genetic Biobank ( www.genetics.gov.fo ). The 72 genomes and 600 exomes will be sequenced usingIllumina technology and aligned to the human reference genome. Further data processing will be performed using the Genome Analysis Toolkit, in addition to various sta tistical packages for de novo variants detection and genetic stratiﬁcation measurement. Expected results and perspec  tives: The two data sets will establish a standard of com parison in identi ﬁcation of disease associated genes. Additionally, the genomes will provide a haplotype  resolved resource for downstream imputation of genome wide association data, as well as the large number of exomes will permit an evaluation of the degree of popula  tion strati ﬁcation in the Faroese population.

 Haplotype analysis for ﬁve unrelated patients with a novel ATP7B gene mutation,P18.51,"S. Ghashghaei, Sara Ghashghaei1, Hassan Dastsooz2,","Majid Fardaei1,2","shiraz university of medical sciences, shiraz, Iran, Islamic Republic of Abstract Introduction: Wilson disease which is a rare autosomal recessive disorder of copper metabolism is due to the disease causing mutations in the ATP7B gene. With the use of combination of markers such as SNPs on a single chromosome, it is possible to determine the structure of haplotype in the human genome, in which can providenotable information regarding the origin of the mutation in human genetic disorders. Since we found a novel mutation in exon 18 of ATP7B gene in ﬁve unrelated patients affected by Wilson disease, the purpose of this study was to deter  mine a SNP haplotype analysis for these families and also 48 unrelated individuals to show whether they have thesame origin. Materials and Methods: DNA was prepared from these cases and then PCR was performed for four regions cov ering four SNPs with higher frequency in our population which included c.1216 T > G (exon2), c.1366 G > C (exon 3), c.3903 C > T (18), c.4021 +50 G > C (19). These SNPs are located in upstream and downstream of this novel mutation. Then, the PCR products were subjected to DNA sequencing using both forward and reverse primers (Euro ﬁns Genomics, Germany). Results: 3 different haplotypes were found in the present study and the patients with the same mutation had the samehaplotype (T G T C). The most prevalent haplotype in this study was G C T C. Conclusion: Since these 5 geographically separated families with the same mutation had the same haplotype, we concluded that this mutation possibly had the same origin in this population. S.

Accordingto tradition, after the Muslim conquest of Persia (present day Iran) in the 7th century CE, some Zoroastrians sailed to India to escape persecution. The date of their arrival in Indiais unknown; traditional sources place it variously between 716 and 936 CE. We explore the genetic legacy of Zor  oastrianism in detail using novel genome wide autosomal(Affymetrix Human Origins SNP array) and Y/mtDNA genotype data for Iranian and Indian Zoroastrian indivi  duals. By comparing these with other publicly availablegenetic data, and exploiting linkage disequilibrium infor  mation in the autosomal genome, we infer the demographic processes, including the extent, timing and sex speci ﬁc components of migration, admixture and isolation, that have contributed most to the genetic landscape of modern Zor  oastrians. In addition, we assess genetic support for claimsof patrilineal recent common ancestry among Parsi priests. Finally, we identify candidate genomic regions under positive selection in Zoroastrian populations, which mayrelate to the prevalence of diseases or distinct phenotypic traits in the community.

The man was referred to the Genetic Department during his fertility investigation. Materials and Methods: Karyotypic analysis, Chromosome Y microdeletion analyses and proper Genetic Consultation. Results: Genetic analysis revealed (i) mosai cism 45,XO/46,X der(Y) and (ii) complete deletion of AZFb+c regions (sY121, sY127,sY134, sY254, sY255 markers deleted).These ﬁndings are in agreement with published data supporting that Yq microdeletions may cause Y chromosome instability, leading to 45,XO cell lines. Men with this genetic pro ﬁle should be discouraged considering a TESE/ICSI program, as presence of testicular spermatozoa has never been reported. In our case, “bad news”was not an option for our patient, as anxiety, isola  tion, fear, emptiness, insecurity, guilty, shame and personal failure were his feelings. Disbelief and denial are common symptoms experienced in men coping with infertility.Genetic consultation and diagnosis are the key starting points before decision making. With active listening, open questions and encouragement by the counsellor, the manstarted to search “out of the TESE option box ”for effective alternatives, such as sperm donation or adoption. Answer  ing questions about sexual life and ability, personal image,marriage and relation was also important part of the coun  selor’s task, enabling patient to feel supported through the process and make effective choices, ﬁtted at their life style and social background. Finally, as mosaic events have higher risk for developing cancer, health screening recom  mendations were provided.Conclusion: Genetic Counsel ling help effectively to deal unexpected ﬁndings related to azoospermia.

This study reports a family with an affected hemophilia boy inAbstracts from the 50thEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference:. . . 1021which germline mosaicism in the mother complicates the X  linked inheritance of the disease. There was no family history of hemophilia in the family. It seems that denovo mutation or germline mosaicism could be responsible for the disease occurence. Direct sequencing of FVIII gene in proband revealed c.3637delA (p.I1213 > Ffs5) mutation inthe 14 thexon. Direct genetic testing of the mother showed no mutation. Additionally, we could track the mutated allele using linkage analysis with the help of STR (Short TandemRepeat) markers linked to the FVIII gene. Haplotype ana  lysis as an indirect strategy showed his mother was a carrier. One of his sisters was normal with direct mutation analysisbut haplotype mapping suggested her as a carrier. The second sister was normal with the direct and indirect approaches. The third one was carrier with bothmethodologies. Based on the obtained results, one possible mechanism could be germline mosaicism of the mother. Gonadalmosaicism usually occurs in females and can complicate data analysis. DNA testing may help carrier detection but negative results will not rule out the possibility of mosai cism. This observation suggests the importance of con  ﬁrming the carrier status of the family members with different strategies. Since mosaicism after having an affec ted child is consistent with gonadal/somatic mosaicism, the recurrence risk is signi ﬁcantly increased.

A family may expe rience stress, anxiety, sorrow or feelings of helplessness when a child is diag  nosed to have a genetic disorder which can lead to chronic care and disability. An illness in a child affects not onlythe child, but the whole family as well. Materials and Methods: In depth interviews u sing a semi structured setof questions was done between the months of November 2015 –March 2016. A total of 12 parents were inter  viewed. Results: The diagnosis of MSUD in a child is indeed a stressful event for the family. Parents experi  enced fear, confusion, and hurt, among other emotions. Having a child with MSUD had a negative impact on theirfamilies, especially in terms of ﬁnancial burden, dietary restriction, and marital con ﬂicts leading to separation. However, some parents repor ted positive effects such as increased con ﬁdence in one ’s abilities to care for the affected child and closer rel ationships among family members. Conclusion: The ﬁndings of this study re ﬂect the complex issues and problems of families with a child affected by MSUD. It will help form policies and guide  lines for genetic counseling of MSUD patients and theirfamilies in the Philippines to assist families in coping with the diagnosis and improve outcomes of affected children.

 Precision medicine and the need for generic risk literacy,P19.06,J. C. Oosterwijk,"UMCG, Groningen, Netherlands","With the advent of precision medicine and the so called mainstreaming of genetics in healthcare, genetic testing results are increasingly used outside the context of clinicalgenetics. One of the implications is that many health care workers who have little or no experience or training in interpreting and explaining genetic test results, have tocommunicate genetic ﬁndings to their patients. Moreover, the genetic tests that are currently being marketed tend to include more and more moderate andintermediate risk factors. As a consequence, the risks con  nected to these genetic test results are in shades of grey and need to be weighted and communicated cautiously. Notonly for precision purposes, but also for the purpose of genetic counseling, an aspect that is inseparably linked to communication genetic testing results. There is much attention in literature regarding the need to improve genomic literacy among health care workers and the general public. In this contribution however, we willfocus on the need to improve genetic risk literacy in order to facilitate adequate counseling. Which is the role that we as geneticists, both trained and experienced in genetic riskcommunication, could/should play in educating colleagues and the general public? How can we help making genetic1022risk understandable based on the experiences we have in the ﬁeld of clinical genetics. J.C. Oosterwijk: None. E",2017

In this study the objective was to investigate students ’opinion on their own creativity. First year medical students of the Carol Davila Medicine and Pharmacy University were asked during their training ingenetics to write an essay. Afterwards they were given a questionnaire, to state if they felt creative or not while writing the essay; and also to choose from a ﬁve level scale if they enjoyed the task and gathering information for it, if they wrote something original and if it was easy or dif ﬁcult to do so. The 6 questions of the questionnaire wereanswered by 88 students. The results showed that 41 stu  dents felt creative while writing the essay. 19.32% enjoyed (much and very much) writing it, 11.36% did not at all likethe task and 40.91% chose as answer ‘intermediate ’. 37.5% enjoyed gathering data for conceiving the essay, while 38.64% were equidistant when they answered this question.When asked if their essay was original 29.55% of students chose ‘enough ’and 32.95% were equidistant by answering ‘intermediate ’. Although some of the students had a clear  cut opinion, still most of them preferred to be equidistant.

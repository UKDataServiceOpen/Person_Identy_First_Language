Polygenes and the Prevention of Cancer,PL01.,Ponder,"University of Cambridge, CRUK Department of Oncology, Hutchison/ MRC Research Centre, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Most common cancers show a tendency to familial clustering. The  risk to a close relative of a case is increased 2  to 3 fold. Most of this  effect is genetic in origin. Our analysis of familial clustering of breast  cancer suggests that known strongly predisposing genes such as  BRCA1/2 account for only 20% of the total genetic predisposition.  A substantial part of the remaining 80% may be attributed to the  combination of many common genetic variants, individually of small  effect. If this is so, different individuals in the population will inherit different  combinations of variant alleles. By analogy with a hand of cards,  some will have a âstrongâ hand (kings and queens; high risk), some a  âweakâ hand, and most will lie somewhere in between. The result will  be a bell shaped curve that describes the distribution of risk in the  population. From the viewpoint of practical application, the critical question is not  âhow much genetic risk is there?â but âhow is the risk distributed?â. If the difference in risk between individuals at high and low risk within  the population is small (say 2  to 3 fold), this may not be helpful : but  if it is 30  or 40 fold, the implications are very significant.I will discuss  these concepts, and the progress and obstacles in finding the genes  and other factors that would make up an individual risk profile.",2003

Hastie1","1MRC Human Genetics Unit, Western General Hospital, Edinburgh,  United Kingdom, 2Department of Anatomy, Anatomy Building,  University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3Department  of Animal Biology, Faculty of Science, University of Malaga, Malaga,  Spain","Mutations in the Wilmsâ tumour gene, WT1 , may lead not only to  childhood kidney cancer but also to severe glomerular nephropathy  and sex reversal. The Wt1 gene may encode up to 24 slightly  different proteins through a combination of alternative splicing,  alternative translational start sites and RNA editing. All these  isoforms contain 4 C terminal zinc fingers similar to those found in  transcription factors. All non mammalian vertebrates express only two  of these WT1 isoforms differing by just 3 amino acids, KTS, inserted  by alternative splicing between zinc fingers 3 and 4. We have shown  that these WT1 (+KTS) and WT1 ( KTS) isoforms have remarkably  different properties, in terms of subnuclear localisation and interaction  with nucleic acids and proteins. Our findings suggest that the âKTS  isoforms function as transcription factors, whereas the +KTS isoforms  seem to function in RNA splicing. Both human genetics (Frasierâs  syndrome) and mouse knockouts show that these proteins have  different functions during genitourinary development and both are  required for survival. The +KTS proteins in particular are required  for male determination and function upstream of SRY. Mice lacking  WT1 have no kidneys or gonads and the heart is abnormal. I will  discuss some of the novel approaches we are taking to identifying the  functions of WT1 in the development of these tissues. This includes  the use of siRNA to inhibit WT1 expression in kidney organ cultures  and the use of a powerful new microscopic technique developed at  this Unit, optical projection tomography (OPT).",2003

A survey of practices in biobanking in Europe,PL05.,"Cambon Thomsen , on behalf of the EUROGENBANK  consortium","Inserm U 558, Toulouse, France","Large population based collections are only a part of the current  biobanking picture. The EU supported EUROGENBANK project  investigated human biobanking in Europe, particularly organisational,  economical and ethical issues. Data were collected from six EU  countries and 147 institutions (mostly public or non profit private)  were investigated by questionnaires and interviews. This activity  is increasing in all countries, but most collections are small; only  a few are very large. Their purpose is often research, or research  and healthcare, mostly in the context of disease studies. Specifi c  budget is rarely allocated and costs are not often evaluated. Samples  are usually provided free of charge. Good practice guidelines  are generally followed and quality controls performed, but quality  procedures are not always clearly explained. Associated data  are usually computerised and identifiable. Biobankers generally  favour centralisation of data rather than of samples. Legal and  ethical harmonisation within Europe is considered likely to facilitate  international collaboration. We propose a series of recommendations  arising from the project (Hirtzlin I et al.,  An empirical survey on  biobanking of human genetic material and data in six EU countries.  Eur J Hum Genet , 2003, in press) In conclusion, biobanking is a lively, diversified and growing activity  in Europe. Its rather loose organisation at small scale is not adapted  to forthcoming large scale projects that will need changes in the  way ethical issues are dealt with. Empirical studies such as the  EUROGENBANK survey, together with wide ranging exchange of  views at European level and multidisciplinary approaches, are useful  tools in this challenging field.",2003
What Use are Population DNA Collections?,PL06.,Zimmern,"Director, Public Health Genetics Unit, Strangeways Research  Laboratory, Cambridge, United Kingdom","The use of population DNA collections is growing across many  different parts of the world. The collections may comprise patients  with known diseases and controls, or individuals within a particular  country or geographical area. Epidemiologists make use of the data  derived from these collections either to correlate specific disease  with genetic variants or to study the combined effects of genetic  and environmental factors on disease risk. Standard case control  methodology is applied for collections based on disease, while for  collections of individuals that are followed over a period of time,  cohort study methodologies are used. This paper attempts to analyse  the utility of these collections from a public health perspective.  It investigates the extent to which such collections add to and  support the promotion of health and the prevention of disease, and  discusses the validity of their data for epidemiological analysis and  as predictors of disease risk. The establishment of these collections  is not entirely unproblematic. They raise concerns of privacy, consent  and confidentiality as well as those of working with the commercial  sector. If scientific progress is to be made, these ethical and social  implications must be addressed in tandem with the epidemiological  issues.",2003
Genetic Epilepsies,PL07.,Gardiner,"University College London, London, United Kingdom","Epilepsy is a disorder characterised by recurrent episodes of  abnormal over activity of the brain known as epileptic seizures. There  are many causes but a genetic aetiology is present in about 40% of  cases. Genetic epilepsies are usefully categorised by mechanism of  inheritance (mendelian, âcomplexâ inheritance, chromosomal) and into  âsymptomaticâ in which there is a recognisable structural or functional Plenary Lectures44 45 abnormality of the brain, or âidiopathicâ (primary) in which there is no  identifiable cause other than a presumed genetic one. In the last decade, rapid progress has been made in understanding  the molecular genetic basis of human mendelian epilepsies.  Symptomatic mendelian epilepsies are caused by a wide variety  of genes in which mutations cause abnormal brain development,  neurodegeneration or altered brain metabolism. Ten genes have  now been identified in human mendelian idiopathic epilepsies, all but  one of which encode ion channels: CHRNA4, CHRNB2, GABRA1,  GABRG2, SCN1A, SCN2B, SCN1B. KCNQ2, KCNQ3  and LGI1 .  These underlie a wide range of overlapping phenotypes. In parallel,  genes underlying spontaneously occurring mouse mutants with  spike wave epilepsy have been shown to encode subunits of voltage  dependant calcium channels. Progress in the investigation of idiopathic generalised epilepsies  with âcomplexâ inheritance such as juvenile myoclonic epilepsy (JME)  and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) has been much slower.  Association studies using SNP haplotypes in candidate ion channel  genes may allow advances in the next decade. References: 1.

Genetics of polydactyly,PL11.,Heutink,"Department of Clinical Genetics, Erasmus Medical Center Rotterdam,  Rotterdam, The Netherlands","In the past decade rapid advances have been made in the  identification of human genes that play a role in upper limb  malformations, leading to a better understanding of normal limb  development. One of the most frequently observed limb malformations is polydactly ,  with a prevalence of between 5 and 17 per 10,000 live births.  Depending on the location of the extra digit, polydactyly is divided  into pre axial, post axial, and central polydactyly. For post axial polydactyly, mutations in the GLI3  gene have been  identified and additional genetic loci on chromosomes 13q21,19p  and 7q35 have been reported.For pre axial polydactyly a major locus  on chromosome 7q36 exists. The work on this locus is an excellent  example of how collaborations between human geneticists and  developmental biologists can lead to identification of disease genes.  A pre axial polydactyly locus was identified in 1993 but mutations in  genes within the critical region could not be identified. Only by using  a combination of linkage data, cytogenetics and animal models it  could be demonstrated that the disruption of a regulatory element  approximately 800 kb upstream of the SHH  gene is the most likely  explanation for this phenotype.",2003

Preserving the Heritage of Human Genetics,PL13.,S. Harper,"Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff, United Kingdom","Although the pedigree and quantitative analysis of human genetic  characteristics and disorders began with the recognition of Mendelâs  laws, the laboratory basis of human cytogenetics and molecular  genetics is only 50 years old and the development of medical  genetics as a specific field even less. This creates a unique  opportunity for documenting the history of our field, since many of  the key workers are still alive and their records still in existence.The  urgency needed to seize this opportunity has resulted in the creation  of the Genetics and Medicine Historical Network, supported by the  Wellcome Trust, and closely associated with the European Society  for Human Genetics. All interested workers in Human Genetics can  contribute in their own areas by helping to ensure that records and  correspondence are preserved, older scientists are interviewed and  the context of key discoveries documented. This should provide a  detailed foundation on which future historians and social scientists  can base their studies, as well as making the history of genetics in  relation to medicine directly accessible to the wider public.

Mouse bioinformatics from a human geneticistâs  perspective,S01.,Borsani,"University of Brescia, Department of Biomedical Sciences and  Biotechnologies, Brescia, Italy","The laboratory mouse is the most important model organism for  studying genetic and multi factorial diseases in man. As a mammal  the mouse has many anatomical, physiological, and metabolic  similarities with humans. Furthermore genetic manipulation within the  living mouse has been established more than 20 years ago leading  to the generation of many mouse models that closely resemble the  analogous human pathologies. The recently disclosed mouse genome sequence revealed about  30,000 genes (with 99% having direct counterparts in humans) and  allowed a detailed analysis of conserved synteny between the two  species. Comparative genomics between human and mouse is a  powerful approach for unlocking some of the hidden features of  mammalian genomes such as non protein coding RNAs, antisense  RNAs and conserved regulatory regions. With knowledge of both genomes, studies of human genes can be  complemented by experimental manipulations of corresponding  mouse genes to accelerate functional studies. A variety of functional  genomics efforts are underway to analyze and to understand the  mouse genome. Strategies such as gene traps and chemical  mutagenesis are generating a large mutant mouse resource that  complements the information already available on spontaneous  mutations. Systematic gene expression studies are being carried out  on large sets of mouse genes using approaches such as RT PCR  and RNA in situ  hybridization.

Humans perceive the energy of a large variety  of stimuli, namely photonic, mechanical, thermic and chemical  stimuli, by sensory cells, either dispersed or packed in sensory end  organs. Fifteen years ago, our knowledge of the molecular bases  of the function of the various modes of sensory reception was very  rudimentary with the noticeable exception of the phototransduction  cascade. We considered that the study of hereditary sensory defects in  humans would not only have a medical impact, but also should lead  to an understanding of some fundamental mechanisms underlying  the development and the functioning of the sensory systems. In  particular, I proposed explicitly that the study of inherited hearing  loss would provide important insights into the biology of the cochlea,  the auditory sensory organ, which had thus far escaped molecular  characterisation due to the small number of each cell type that it  houses. The present outcome of this research will be discussed in medical  and fundamental terms. How the study of these defects enlightens  both their pathogenesis and the physiology of the sensory system  will be illustrated by the development/functioning of the auditory  cells and the development of the olfactory system as illuminated by  the functions of the proteins defective in Usher type I syndrome and  Kallmann syndrome.",2003
Mouse Mutagenesis for the Genetic Dissection of  Auditory Function,S08.,D. M. Brown,"MRC Mammalian Genetics Unit and UK Mouse Genome Centre,  Harwell, United Kingdom","Systematic approaches to mouse mutagenesis are vital for future  studies of mammalian gene function. We have undertaken a major  ENU mutagenesis programme incorporating a large genome wide  screen for dominant mutations (Nolan et al. Nature Genetics 25:  440 443). Nearly 30,000 mice have been produced and around 700 mutants have been recovered from the screening programme that  included tests for auditory and vestibular function. 54 phenotypes  showing balance or circling phenotypes were uncovered, while 28  mice showing hearing impairment, including late onset sensorineural  deafness, were identified. The mouse auditory and vestibular mutants  encompassed a variety of phenotypes including patterning and  planar cell polarity defects in hair cells in the organ of Corti as well  as morphogenetic mutants affecting the development and structure  of the vestibular system. Many of these mutants have now been  mapped and cloned to elucidate the underlying genetic pathways  involved. In addition, these screens for new deafness models have  identified a new class of mutants whose hearing loss is due to  middle ear inflammatory disease. Otitis Media with Effusion (OME)  or âglue earâ disease, inflammation of the middle ear epithelial lining,  remains the most common cause of hearing impairment in children.  The availability of these novel mouse models represents an exciting  opportunity to study the genetics of OME in both mouse and humans.",2003
Development of the inner ear   the zebrafish model,S09.,Whitfield,"Centre for Developmental Genetics, Department of Biomedical  Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom","The zebrafish is a convenient genetic model system for the study of  the inner ear. Embryos are accessible at all stages of development,  and are optically clear, enabling the otic vesicle to be observed in  the live animal. Both forward and reverse genetic approaches are  available. We are characterising a number of mutant lines that form  models for human disease, including colourless/sox10  (a model  for Waardenburg Shah syndrome) and van gogh/tbx1  (a model for  DiGeorge syndrome). Both sox10  and tbx1 code for transcription  factors that are strongly expressed in the otic epithelium, and both  mutants have severe sensory and non sensory otic abnormalities.  We are also interested in the signals from surrounding tissues that  act to pattern the otic vesicle. We have demonstrated a role for  Hedgehog signalling from midline structures (the notochord and  floorplate) in the patterning of the anteroposterior axis of the zebrafish  ear. A loss of Hedgehog signalling gives rise to a striking partial  mirror image duplication of anterior otic structures, concomitant with  a loss of posterior otic domains. Ectopic activation of the Hedgehog  pathway has the reverse effect: ears lose anterior structures and  show a mirror image duplication of posterior regions at the anterior of  the ear.",2003

Phenotypic manifestations of microdeletion  syndromes,S13.,Devriendt,"Centre for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium","During recent years several well known genetic syndromes were  found to be caused by submicroscopic deletions. This has lead to  a better clinical delineation of these disorders. The identification of  genes implicated will lead to insight in the mechanisms underlying  malformations, mental retardation and behavioural disorders.  Strikingly, several microdeletion syndromes have a highly variable  expression, providing an unique opportunity to study mechanisms Scientific Symposia              46 47 causing this variability. Differences in size of the deletion are not a  frequent cause of variability, given the frequent origin by unequal  crossing over between flanking duplicons. However, the few unique  individuals with smaller deletions will be instumental in delineating  the critical deletion region, and thus the implicated genes. Examples  are Smith Magenis syndrome and the del8p23.1 syndromes.  Another (rare) cause of variability is the unmasking of recessive  alleles, as for instance in a del22q11 deletion patient with Bernard  Soulier disease. The most probable explanation is the existence of  genetic and environmental modifiers. Intelligence is multifactorial,  and it is therefore not unexpected that in for instance PWS and  VCFS, IQ is correlated with parental intelligence. Approximately 50  75% of individuals with a del22q11 have a congenital heart defect.  Recently, a functional polymorphism in the VEGF gene was found  to be a modifier for the occurrence of a heart defect in individuals  with a del22q11. However, this still does not explain the frequent  observation of discordant monozygotic twins with a del22q11 for  a heart defect. Possible explanations are second hits, non shared  environment and stochastic factors.",2003

A Model for the Molecular Basis of FSHD,S15.,"G. Tupler1,2","1Biologia Generale e Genetica Medica, University of Pavia, Pavia,  Italy, 2Program in Gene Function and Expression, University of  Massachusetts Medical School, Worcester, MA, United States","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) is a complex  disease with a peculiar involvement of muscle groups, highly variable  severity, and unpredictable progression. The disease has been  causally related to deletion of subtelomeric D4Z4 repeats at 4q35.  We observed that a number of genes mapping at 4q35 are over  expressed in the FSHD affected muscle. We showed that an element  within D4Z4 specifically binds a multi protein complex consisting of  YY1, HMGB2, and nucleolin. We demonstrated that this multi protein  complex  binds D4Z4 in vitro  and in vivo  mediates transcriptional  repression of 4q35 genes. Based on these results, we propose a  model for the molecular basis of FSHD. In normal individuals, the  presence of a threshold number of D4Z4 repeats leads to repression  of 4q35 genes by virtue of a DNA bound multi protein complex that  actively suppresses gene expression. In FSHD patients, deletion of  an integral number of D4Z4 repeats reduces the number of bound  repressor complexes and consequently decreases (or abolishes)  transcriptional repression of 4q35 genes. As a result, these genes are  inappropriately over expressed, ultimately leading to disease onset  and progression. Our results also provide insights into the biological  function of DNA repetitive elements in gene transcription and their  potential role in human diseases.",2003

Gonadotrophin function and sexual development,S17.,Huhtaniemi,"Institute of Reproductive and Developmental Biology, Imperial  College London, London, United Kingdom","The unraveling of structures of gonadotrophin and gonadotrophin  receptor (R) genes, and the human mutations detected in these  genes, have provided us with novel tools to clarify the role of  gonadotrophin action in sexual differentiation and in molecular  pathogenesis of certain disturbances of sexual differentiation,  development and fertility. Moreover, the mutations detected are very  elucidating by providing further information about known and less well elucidated actions of gonadotrophins. Only one inactivating  mutation of the LHÎ² subunit has so far been described; a man  with normal intrauterine masculinisation but complete blockage of  postnatal sexual development. The phenotype can be explained  by the stimulatory effect of choriongonadotrophin on fetal testicular  androgen production, inducing the intrauterine masculinisation.  However, pituitary LH is crucial for stimulation of the postnatal  testicular activity. Both loss of function (inactivating) and gain  of function (activating) mutations of gonadotrophin receptors  are known. Completely inactivating LHR mutations cause in  males pseudohermaphroditism, with external female genitalia,  missing uterus and lack of female secondary sex characteristics.  Incomplete LHR inactivation causes micropenis and hypospadias  with varying severity. In females, the phenotype is relatively mild  with anovulation and infertility. Activating LHR mutations cause in  males early onset gonadotrophin independent precocious puberty  (testotoxicosis) but no phenotype has been found in females, for  unknown reasons. Inactivating complete FSHR mutation causes  in women hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism with lack of follicular  development. If inactivation is incomplete, the phenotype is  secondary amenorrhoea with arrested follicular maturation. In men,  FSHR inactivation causes disturbances in spermatogenesis, but  no azoospermia or absolute infertility. This is at variance with men  reported with FSH ligand mutation, who all are azoospermic. The  reason for the discrepancy remains unclear. Only one activating  mutation of FSHR has been described in a hypophysectomised male,  who had persistent spermatogenesis despite absent gonadotrophin  secretion.

Exon Skipping Mutations in Human Disease,S19.,R. Krainer,"Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory, Cold Spring Harbor, NY, United  States","Accurate splicing depends on the canonical consensus sequences  that define exon intron boundaries, as well as on information present  in the coding regions. Exonic splicing enhancer (ESE) elements are  very prevalent and might be present in most, if not all, constitutive  and alternative exons. ESEs are recognized by a class of splicing  factors, the SR proteins, which promote splicing by recruiting  spliceosomal components to the correct splice sites. Point mutations in coding exons can disrupt critical ESEs, thereby  causing the entire exon to be skipped. Such an alteration in the  splicing process has drastic consequences for the expression of the  gene product, as it can result in deletion, frameshifting, mRNA decay,  or a combination of these changes. Predicting or determining which  mutations cause exon skipping is important for accurately assessing  phenotypic risk. I will review our work on prediction, identification, and mutational  analysis of ESE motifs. I will also describe an approach we recently  developed, which is based on small synthetic compounds that can  be specifically targeted to an inefficiently spliced exon, promoting its  inclusion. These compounds were designed to emulate the function  of natural SR proteins, and should be a valuable tool to understand  the mechanisms of ESE dependent splicing, and to modulate  alternative splicing of specific pre mRNAs. They might also provide  a new therapeutic approach to treat diseases associated with exon  skipping.",2003
Spinal muscular atrophy: Perspectives of a therapy  by restoring the splicing pattern of SMN2,S20.,"Wirth , L. Brichta, Y. Hofmann, K.

An almost  identical copy of the gene, SMN2, fails to compensate for the loss Scientific Symposia46 47 of SMN1 due to a silent mutation in exon 7 that disrupts an exonic  splicing enhancer, resulting in major production of exon 7 skipped  SMN2 transcripts. Thus, SMN2 mainly produces a defective protein  and only to a minor amount a full length SMN2 protein which is  identical to the SMN1 protein. We identified three trans acting  splicing factors (Htra2 beta1, hnRNP G and RBM) being able to  restore the splicing pattern of SMN2 with high efficiency when they  are over expressed. hnRNP G and RBM bind to Htra2 beta1 which  directly binds to SMN pre mRNA forming a functional complex that  modulates/enhances SMN2 exon 7 inclusion. Furthermore, we  were able to show that increasing amounts of valproic acid (VPA), a  histone deacetylase inhibitor and a drug used in long time epilepsy  treatment for three decades, restores the splicing pattern and  increases the SMN2 protein level 2 4 fold in cell cultures of SMA   patients.

Three genes have been identified involved in the  autosomal dominant forms of AD, the Ã amyloid precursor protein  gene ( APP) and two homologous genes presenilin 1 ( PSEN1 )  and presenilin 2 ( PSEN2 ). Although the risk of AD for carriers of  mutations in these genes approaches 100%, the contribution of  these genes to the occurrence of disease is lower than 0.5%. On  the population level, the apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) gene is a more  important genetic determinant for the early onset AD as well as the  predominant late onset form, explaining up to 15% of the incidence  of disease. In addition to the evidence for other Alzheimer loci  on chromosome 9, 10 and 12, there is increasing evidence for a  role of cholesterol metabolism and vascular factors in Alzheimerâs  disease, i.e. atherosclerosis and blood pressure.

Cholesterol Lowering approaches to Alzheimerâs Disease  â From Basic Science to Diagnosis and Treatment,S26.,"Beyreuther1, Tobias Hartmann1, Colin L Masters2","1ZMBH, University of Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany, 2Department  of Pathology, University of Melbourne, Parkville, Australia","Several lines of evidence suggest a role for cholesterol on beta  amyloid production. Suppression of cholesterol neosynthesis by  statins strongly reduces the formation of AÃ40 and AÃ42 species in  vivo and in vitro. A recent clinical study revealed that this reduction  of Abeta production could also be achieved in the brains of patients  with AD that were treated with simvastatin. Lowering of CSF Abeta  and 24S hydroxycholesterol, the brain specific cholesterol metabolite,  was most pronounced in patients with mild to moderate AD. CSF  Abeta was determined with a novel commercial ELISA assay for  the determination of the Abeta42/Abeta40 ratio. The latter has been  shown to be a valid biological marker for the diagnosis of MCI and  AD. Experiments in cell culture suggest that the processing of APP  by beta secretase (BACE) is affected when cholesterol levels are  lowered. Because cholesterol is required to transport APP, BACE and  presenilin to compartments in which beta  and gamma cleavage does  occur, intracellular cholesterol transport regulates the amyloidogenic  processing of APP. Alterations in cholesterol transport have important  consequences for both, APP processing and the localization of the  presenilins, which are essential components of the gamma secretase  complex. Exposure of neuronal cells to cholesterol transport  inhibiting agents resulted in a marked decrease in beta secretase  cleavage products of full length APP. Alpha secretase activity was not  increased because the corresponding APP fragments released by  alpha secretase were not elevated.

Both polyalanine tract expansions and frameshifting deletions in  HOXD13 cause similar forms of this condition, but it remains unclear  whether other kinds of HOXD13 mutations could produce different  phenotypes. Here we describe a six generation English family in  which a novel combination of brachydactyly and central polydactyly  co segregates with a missense mutation that substitutes leucine for  isoleucine at position 47 of the HOXD13 homeodomain. We have  compared the HOXD13(I47L) mutant protein both in vitro and in  vivo to the wild type protein and to an artificial HOXD13 mutant,  HOXD13(IQN), which is completely unable to bind DNA. We have  found that the mutation causes neither a dominant negative effect  nor a gain of function, but instead impairs DNA binding at some  sites bound by wild type",2003

Linkage analyses in nine inbred  and non inbred families (from Morocco, Tunisia, Portugal and  Lebanon) recently allowed us to localize the disease causing gene to  chromosome 18q21.1 (Zmax=9.65 at t=0 at locus D18S1126, interval  of 1.8 cM). Several known genes within the critical region were fi rst  regarded as possible candidate genes but were finally excluded by  direct sequencing. One predicted transcript proved to be located in  the interval, FLJ20071 indicated a gene initially composed of nine  exons but detailed in silico analysis finally deduced a total of 17  exons the first of which is non translated. Genomic sequencing of  this gene, that we propose to name Dymeclin, identified non sense  (580c>t, 610c>t, 656t>g, 1447c>t), frameshift (1877del a) and splice  mutations (IVS10 1125+1g>t, IVS11 1252 1g>a) in all affected  patients of our series. One patient with non consanguineous parents  was found to be a compound heterozygote (656t>g and 1877del  a). RT PCR and northern blot analyses indicated that Dymeclin/ FLJ20071 is widely distributed, especially in fetal chondrocytes and  brain. The predicted protein product (669 aminoacids) yields little  insight into its likely function as no homology to any known protein  family was found. However, electron microscopic study of cutaneous  cells of an affected child revealed dilated rough endoplasmic  reticulum, enlarged and aberrant vacuoles and numerous vesicles in  several cell types of the skin. We conclude that DMC is consequent  upon loss of function of the Dymeclin/FLJ20071 gene, presumably  involved in intracellular digestive process.",2003
Skeletal muscle is the primary tissue involved in the  pathogenesis of murine X linked myotubular myopathy.,C03.,"Zahreddine, F. Bedez, N. Messaddeq, V. Laugel, J. Laporte, A.  Buj Bello, J. Mandel","IGBMC, Illkirch, France","X linked myotubular myopathy (XLMTM) is a severe muscle disorder characterized by hypotonia and generalized muscle weakness in  newborn males. Patients muscles present hypotrophic fibers with  centrally located nuclei. The MTM1 gene mutated in XLMTM encodes  a ubiquitously expressed phosphatase, called myotubularin, that  dephosphorylates phosphatidylinositol 3 monophosphate PI(3)P.  Myotubularin belongs to a large family of phosphatases conserved  from yeast to human. We have recently identified novel members of  this family and extended to 14 the number of myotubularin related  proteins in human. Eight are predicted to be enzymatically active,  whereas the remaining proteins present substitutions at catalytically  essential residues. Mutations in the MTMR2 gene, the closest  homologue to MTM1, result in the demyelinating neuropathy Charcot  Marie Tooth type 4B1. We developped an animal model for XLMTM  by homologous recombination. The constitutive Mtm1 knockout  mice present a severe generalized myopathy with reduced life  expectancy, and show the presence of hypotrophic muscle fibers with  central nuclei. To determine the primary tissue involved in XLMTM  pathogenesis, we have generated skeletal muscle and neuronal  myotubularin deficient mouse lines by a conditional gene targeting  approach. Only the Mtm1 skeletal muscle deficient line developped a  phenotype identical to that observed in the classical knockout model.  In contrast, the neuronal mutant line did not show obvious clinical or  histopathological symptoms. These results demonstrate that muscle  is the primary tissue involved in XLMTM pathogenesis. Although  MTM1 and MTMR2 share very high protein similarity, act on PI(3)P  and are both ubiquitously expressed, these two genes implicated in  different pathologies do not functionally compensate.",2003

Meitinger1,2","1Institute of Human Genetics, GSF Research Centre for  Environment and Health, Neuherberg, Germany, 2Institute of Human  Genetics,Technical University, Munich, Germany","Mutations in the human PANK2  gene have been shown to  occur in autosomal recessive pantothenate kinaseâassociated  neurodegeneration (PKAN), a syndrome originally described by  Hallervorden and Spatz. The phenotype includes progressive  dystonia, rigidity, choreoathetosis, spasticity, retinitis pigmentosa,  optic atrophy, parkinsonism or seizures, reminiscent of the spectrum  of symptoms seen in mitochondriopathies. The pantothenate kinase catalyses the first and rate limiting step  in the biosynthesis of coenzyme A, a key molecule in energy  metabolism.We determined the genomic structure of hPANK2  and  identified two alternatively used first exons. The resulting transcripts  encode distinct isoforms of hPANK2, one of which carries an N  terminus with a predicted mitochondrial targeting signal. Using an  in vitro  import assay and in vivo  immunolocalisation experiments  mitochondrial localisation of this isoform could be demonstrated,  while the other localised to the cytoplasm. To test for additional functional pantothenate kinase activities  in human cells which could complement hPANK2 mutations, a  complementation assay was used. In this experiment hPANK4 could  be demonstrated to possess pantothenate kinase activity. Loss of function mutations in the hPANK2 core domain are known  and are predicted to abolish both hPANK2 isoforms. Mutations in  the N terminal domain leave the cytosolic isoform intact. Taking  into account that the phenotype is indistinguishable in patients with  either of these mutations, the following conclusions can be drawn:  First, it is the deficiency of the mitochondrial hPANK2 activity which  is responsible for the symptoms of the syndrome and second, the  deficiency of the cytosolic activity can be compensated by other  kinases.",2003

There is evidence that maternal but not paternal  duplications of chromosome 15q11 q13 can cause autism. The  Angelman gene ( UBE3A ) maps in 15q and is imprinted with  paternal silencing in brain. Based in part on the duplication data,  we hypothesize that over expression of UBE3A  is the major cause  of autism, perhaps most commonly through brain specific failure of  paternal silencing. Using the AGRE and NIMH/Stanford sib pairs, we  found evidence for increased sharing of paternal alleles in 15q11 q13,  with the greatest sharing centromeric to the imprinting center (IC)  at D15S817 ; sharing was greater for the 77 AGRE than for the 56  NIMH sib pairs with a Chi square of 5.48 ( P = 0.02) for the combined  data. We propose that autism may be caused in the majority of cases  by epigenetic imprinting defects arising on normal or particularly  susceptible paternal 15q chromosomes during spermatogenesis or  after fertilization, but before the time of MZ twining, leading to brain  specific over expression of UBE3A . Rather than the widely accepted  multilocus model for autism, we propose a mixed epigenetic genetic  environmental model with a principal imprinted gene in chromosome  15q. A combination of de novo and inherited contributions could  explain why concordance for autism is high in MZ but low in DZ  twins. Evidence will be presented for an epigenetic modifier locus for  autism. A mixed epigenetic genetic model may be relevant to other  complex disease traits.Concurrent Sessions48 49",2003

","The Marinesco âSjÃ¶gren syndrome (MSS), first described in 1931,  is an autosomal recessive condition characterised by somatic and  mental retardation, congenital cataracts and cerebellar ataxia.  Progressive myopathy was reported to be among the cardinal signs  of MSS with myopathic changes on muscle biopsies and in several  reports a specific dense membranous structure associated with nuclei  in muscle fibres. Hypergonadotrophic hypogonadism and skeletal  deformities related to a major hypotonia can also be observed. The  major differential diagnosis of MSS is Congenital Cataracts, Facial  Dysmorphism and peripheral Neuropathy (CCFDN) syndrome, which  is localised to 18qter while no genetic localisation has yet been  reported for typical MSS. Using homozygosity mapping strategy in two large consanguineous  families of Turkish and Norwegian origin respectively, we have  identified the MSS locus on chromosome 5q32. Indeed a whole  genome scan performed in the Turkish family identified two candidate  regions (5q32 and 7p14.2) with homozygosity by descent in  affected siblings. High density mapping of these two regions in the  Norwegian family excluded linkage to the 7p14.2 region and revealed  homozygosity and haplotype sharing between the six affected  individuals over 6 consecutive 5q32 markers. LOD score calculation,  including the consanguinity loops, gave a maximum value of 2.9 and  5.2 at Î¸ = 0 for the Turkish and the Norwegian families respectively,  indicating linkage between the disease and the D5S1995 D5S638  haplotype spanning an 8.7 cM interval.

Several  mathematical models for the estimation of individual breast cancer  risk have been proposed, however, no single model integrates  family history, hormonal factors and benign breast disease in a  comprehensive fashion. A new model by Tyrer and colleagues has  addressed these deficiencies. Therefore, this study has assessed  the predictive and discriminatory value of the Tyrer Cuzick model  against established models namely: Gail, Claus and Ford. Methods:   The goodness of fit and discriminatory accuracy of the models was  assessed using data from 3151 women attending the Family History  Evaluation and Screening Programme. All models were applied  to these women over a mean follow up of 5.26 years to estimate  risk of breast cancer. Results:  The ratios of expected to observed  numbers of breast cancers (95% confidence intervals [CI]) were  0.68 (0.53 0.88) for Gail, 0.75 (0.59 0.97) for Claus, 0.65 (0.51 0.84)  for Ford and 1.07 (0.84 1.39) for Tyrer Cuzick. Of the 65 cases of  breast cancer, 59.7% of women were assigned risks using the Gail  compatible with chemoprevention under the IBIS protocol. The  proportion for Claus, Ford and Tyrer Cuzick were 48.4%, 38.7%  and 74.2% respectively.

Autosomal dominant  and recessive forms of EDA, indistinguishable from the X linked  form, have been also described. Two different disease genes have  been hitherto identified. Mutations in EDA 3 encoding EDAR, a TNF  receptor, result in both dominant and recessive forms. In addition,  mutations in a recently identified gene, EDARADD (for the Edar  Associated Death Domain) have also been shown to cause recessive  EDA. We report on a large moroccan family with an autosomal dominant  EDA. The eight affected individuals presented with hypotrichosis,  hypodontia, and anhidrosis. Genetic analysis showed linkage to  chromosome 1q42 q43 where the Edaradd gene is located. We  screened the 7 exons of this gene and found a novel missense  mutation (G335  >T) which changed a leucine residue into an  arginine (Leu 112  >Arg). Thus the EDARADD gene accounts for  both recessive and dominant EDA. EDAR is activated by its ligand,  ectodysplasin and uses EDARADD to build an intracellular complex  to activate NF kB. This missense mutation probably affects the  interaction of EDARADD with EDAR and the dowstream signaling  pathway which plays a crucial role in the differentiation of skin  appendages.

Since no chromosomal amplification, duplication or insertion could  be detected at this locus, we hypothesize that the chromosomal  anomaly is due to a cytogenetically visible epigenetic change. Since  methylation can influence chromosome condensation and gene  expression, we investigated the methylation status of this locus by immunostaining with anti MeC antibodies. This analysis showed that  the locus is hypermethylated, thus supporting our hypothesis.",2003
An investigation of factors associated with the  breakpoints of recurrent inversions,C17.,"Jacobs , S. Youings, J. Barber","Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom","We have ascertained 169 apparently independent inversions  detectable on the light microscope excluding those generally  considered to be common polymorphisms. Of these, 54 were  represented more than once; two occurred 6 times, one 4 times, two  3 times and the remaining 32 twice. Thus the great majority appeared  unique. To see whether our 21 different recurring inversions resulted  from repeated independent events or were identical by decent, we  examined 3 previously reported large series of inversions and a  compilation of records of all abnormalities seen in a large number of  UK cytogenetic laboratories (the Oxford Database). We found that  only 8 our 21 recurring inversions were also seen more than once in  at least two other series. The human genome contains many repeated sequences including  many hundreds of olfactory receptor (OR) genes and duplicons.  Among our 42 recurrent inversion breakpoints we found only 6  which occurred in OR regions and, of these, only 2 involved both  breakpoints of a single inversion. We identified 15 breakpoints that  could have involved known duplicons but, again, only two of these  involved both breakpoints of a single inversion. Thus while illegitimate  recombination between repeat sequences is strongly associated  with genomic disorders, OR genes and duplicons do not appear to  play a major role in the genesis of inversions detectable at the light  microscope level. Our results will be discussed in the light of breakage hot spots versus  founder effects and experiments to differentiate between these two  possibilities.",2003

Sister chromatids are held  together in both mitotic and meiotic divisions by a protein complex  termed cohesin. The proteins constituting the cohesin complex  differ between the two types of cell division and components of  the meiotic cohesion complex have recently been identified. We  have characterised two of these proteins, STAG3 and REC8, in  human germ cells. Using polyclonal antibodies we have been able  to determine expression and location of these proteins in the initial  stages of meiosis. In cells at pre leptotene and leptotene of prophase  I, prior to formation of axial elements and the synaptonemal complex  (visualised using an antibody against the protein SCP3), STAG3 and  REC8 are present as diffuse nuclear signals. In these early meiotic  stages, SCP3 accumulates within nucleoli. Both STAG3 and REC8  colocalise from zygotene to diplotene, forming linear structures  along chromosome arms. In these cells, SCP3 changes from  being nucleolar to colocalising with the cohesin proteins. In human  fetal oocytes that show abnormal disruption of the axial elements  or synaptonemal complexes, SCP3 staining shows a correlated  disruption whereas the cohesin proteins may show normal linear  elements. Our observations suggest a model of meiotic chromosome  organisation in which the cohesin proteins first form a core structure  (the cohesin axis) which acts as a scaffold for the subsequent  formation of the synaptonemal complex.Concurrent Sessions52 53",2003

Muscle eye brain disease (MEB),  Walker Warburg syndrome (WWS) and Fukuyama congenital  muscular dystrophy (FCMD) share the combination of congenital  muscular dystrophy and brain malformations including a neuronal  migration defect. The genes underlying FCMD ( Fukutin ) and MEB  (POMGnT1 ) are implicated in O glycosylation. To unravel the  genetic basis of WWS, we adopted a candidate gene approach  in combination with homozygosity mapping in 15 consanguineous  WWS families. Analysis of the locus for O mannosyltransferase 1  (POMT1 ) revealed homozygosity in 5 of 15 families. Sequencing of  the POMT1  gene revealed causative mutations in 6 of 30 unrelated  WWS patients. These results indicate that WWS is genetically  heterogenous. A genome wide linkage analysis indeed suggested the existence of at least two additional WWS loci. In order to elucidate  the remaining WWS patients we have extended our candidate gene  based mapping strategy. Homozygosity was observed for four WWS  families at the Fukutin  locus. So far, Fukutin  mutations had been  restricted to Japanese FCMD patients, whose phenotype is clinically  much less severe than WWS. These FCMD patients are predicted  to maintain residual Fukutin activity. In contrast, mutation analysis  in one of our WWS families revealed a homozygous nonsense  mutation. This result shows that homozygosity for a null mutation in  the Fukutin  gene causes a WWS phenotype. In conclusion, evidence is presented that WWS can be due to  mutations in two genes, POMT1  and Fukutin , and that at least two  more genes are required to explain the majority of remaining WWS  patients.",2003

Six probands were found to be compound heterozygotes  for the Y165C mutation and the G382D missense mutation. The probands exhibited a relatively young age at diagnosis of  colorectal cancer (mean 45 years, range 22 65 years), and a wide  variety in number of polyps (ranging from a few to hundreds).  Pedigree studies of these families suggests the presence of late  onset colorectal cancer in the parental generation of probands.

Carriers of Familial  Adenomatous Poylposis (FAP) were recruited to a randomised  placebo controlled trial of 600mg aspirin and/or 30 grams of resistant  starch. Substantial epidemiological evidence supports the view that  these interventions might prevent the development of adenomatous  polyps, the precursor of colorectal cancer. 206 FAP carriers received  treatment. Completed data on 133 subjects followed for at least one  year have been analysed. Neither intervention resulted in a significant  reduction in polyp number as assessed either by the endoscopist or  blinded review of rectal videos. The mean size of largest polyps was,  however, significantly reduced in the aspirin only group (p=0.01). A  secondary analysis used data from those who had stayed more than  one year, suggesting higher compliance. Here, both aspirin alone and  the combined aspirin/resistant starch group achieved significance  (p=0.04 and p=0.03). Those treated with starch had significantly shorter crypts  (p<0.0001,95% CI 0.87,0.96); those treated with aspirin had longer  crypts and a 37% increase in crypt cell proliferation. These data  suggest that aspirin and resistant starch are protective against cancer  but with different modes of action. Aspirin may act later, preventing  progression of small adenomata. FAP carriers are an ideal study group since their molecular defect is  shared with a majority of sporadic colorectal cancers and any FAP  chemoprevention strategy is likely to have general relevance.

It is strongly associated with  HLA DQ2 and DQ8, but other genes are expected to contribute  to CD as well. We therefore performed a genomewide screen in  67 Dutch families with affected sibpairs that met strict diagnostic  criteria. Fifteen additional families were available for follow up of  interesting regions. As expected, highly significant linkage to the  HLA region was detected. More importantly, significant linkage was  also present on chromosome 19, with a multipoint maximum lod  score (MMLS) of 4.43 (nominal p = 6.2 x 10 6). The importance of  this region was further supported by single point analysis, showing  ten consecutive markers in this region with a lod score >1. This locus  is distinct from other regions reported on chromosome 19 showing  weak evidence for linkage. It accounts for a 2.6 fold increased risk to  siblings, compared to a risk of 4.6 of the HLA region. Furthermore,  we identified suggestive linkage to chromosome 6q21 (MMLS =  2.79, nominal p = 3 x 10 4). This locus lies ~70 cM downstream from  the HLA region, and has also been implicated in other autoimmune  disorders like type 1 diabetes mellitus, suggesting the presence of an  autoimmunity susceptibility gene in this region. Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a major non HLA  locus involved in CD in the Dutch population.

These genes occur in clusters, and have evolved by gene  duplication followed by adaptive selection, and some appear to have  a signalling role in addition to antimicrobial properties. By using a  combination of multiplex amplifiable probe hybridisation (MAPH)  and semi quantitative fluorescence in situ hybridisation (SQ FISH),  we have found that a cluster of beta defensin genes at chromosome  8p23.1 which is polymorphic in copy number. Chromosomes have  between 1 and 8 copies, and that high copy number alleles (â¥7  copies) are visible by G banding cytogenetics as a euchromatic  variant at 8p23.1. The repeat unit is a minimum of 240kb in size and  contains at least three beta defensins (DEFB4, DEFB103, DEFB104),  a defensin like antigen SPAG11, and part of an olfactory repeat  region. Iincreased copy number of the repeat unit was correlated with  increased expression of DEFB4 in a panel of cell lines derived from  individuals with different copy number of this beta defensin cluster.  Variation in defensin levels due to copy number polymorphism may  be functionally important in the susceptibility to infection. Duplication  alleles may provide the raw material on which divergent adaptive  selection can act on each duplicate defensin gene.Concurrent Sessions56 57",2003

Feder et al identified the most common  and the most prevalent form of hereditary iron disorder (HH1, OMIM  235200) in 1996. Since then other types of HH have been described:  Juvenile or type 2 HH (OMIM 602390), type 3 HH (OMIM 604250)  associated with mutation of TFR2  and type 4 HH (OMIM 606069)  associated with ferroportin. The hepcidin antimicrobial peptide  (HAMP, OMIM 606464) was described to play an important role  in iron metabolism and recently Roetto et al reported that HAMP   mutations in two Greek families were associated with a phenotype  of severe HH classified as juvenile. Methods . We studied the HAMP   gene in 31 patients with HH phenotype and one or no mutation in  the HFE  gene, and 100 blood marrow donors as controls. We used  D HPLC analysis to scan the HAMP  coding sequence in our subjects  and sequencing in the patients presenting an altered profile. Results .  We identified two novel mutations (175C>G and 212G>A) in HAMP   in four patients who already carried one mutation at the HFE locus.  Discussion.

Transcriptional profiling of Parkinsonâs disease  genes in vitro.,C35.,"J. Baptista , J. Hardy, M. R.

Two recessive mutations in DJ 1 have been reported that appear to  encode loss of function alleles. Although the precise function of DJ 1  is unclear, it has some possible effects on transcriptional regulation.  The aim of the current work was to examine the effects of DJ 1 on the  expression of genes in the dopamine synthesis pathway. We have shown that that the expression of genes involved in  the dopamine synthesis pathway is altered in response to over  expression of wild type, but not mutant, Î± synuclein. We are currently  exploring three strategies to identify common effects of different PD  genes on transcriptional regulation. These experiments have been  performed in a human neuroblastoma cell line, M17 that express the  full complement of dopamine synthesis genes. First, we have used  quantitative RT PCR to look for effects of Î± synuclein expression  on DJ 1 steady state mRNA levels. Second, we are examining if  DJ 1 has any effects on dopamine synthesis genes. Third, we are  analyzing the transcriptosome of cell lines whose expression of DJ 1  or Î± synuclein is altered. Using these three approaches we hope to  identify common pathways that are regulated by different PD genes. Bonifati V et al., (2003) Science 299(5604): 256 259.",2003

We investigated  the association between two polymorphisms of the MMP9 gene  (C 1562T in the promoter and R279Q in the coding sequence) with  plasma levels of MMP9 activity, and long term prognosis in 1054  patients with proven CAD followed up for a mean period of 3.8 years. MMP9 activity was increased in patients suffering from future  cardiovascular event (66.3 vs 59.7 ng/ml; p = 0.02).  The two  polymorphisms were in strong linkage disequilibrium, generating  three haplotypes CR, CQ and TQ with frequencies of 0.64, 0.22 and  0.14, respectively.  Haplotype analysis revealed that the TQ haplotype  was associated with increased MMP9 activity (+5.4 [0.04 â 10.4], p  = 0.003) by comparison to the CQ and CR haplotypes.  In order to investigate the potential association between MMP9 gene haplotypes  and long term prognosis in CAD patients, a new statistical model for  haplotype based survival analysis was developed.  In the subgroup  of patients with stable angina (n = 716), the CQ and TQ haplotypes  were associated with increased risk of future cardiovascular event  (HRR = 1.55 [1.06 â 2.28] and HRR = 1.45 [0.90 â 2.35], respectively;  p = 0.04) independently of MMP9 activity. These two HRRs were not  significantly different (p = 0.44), suggesting an effect of the Q279  allele alone on prognosis. In conclusion, our study suggests that genetic variation of MMP9  influences both MMP9 activity and prognosis in CAD patients.",2003

PGD for monogenic disorders commonly  involves blastomere biopsy from 3 day cleavage stage embryos,  and PCR based diagnosis. However, single cell DNA amplification  has inherent difficulties, including contamination risk, PCR failure,  and allelic drop out (ADO). Furthermore methods must reliably  and accurately characterize the embryo genotype for the relevant  disorder. We have >5years experience with single cell genotyping  and PGD, using a method based on denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis (DGGE). Although accurate, the method is technically  demanding, time consuming, and not highly sensitive, providing  results in about 80% embryos. To simplify protocols, reduce diagnosis  time, improve sensitivity, whilst maintaining accuracy and monitoring  ADO, we established a protocol based on real time PCR, using  fluorescent hybridisation probes for mutation detection. We designed,  standardized and validated mutation detection probes for the  common b thalassaemia mutations world wide (and HbS), through  mutation analysis in >200 carriers, and additionally 25 prenatal  diagnoses (Clinical Chemistry, accepted for publication). We adapted  the method to PGD using nested PCR, with the second reaction in  LightcyclerTm capillaries, including fluorescent detection probes  for melting curve analysis for allele assignment. The LightcyclerTm  protocol was applied in 10 PGD cycles. Results (available within  5hours) were obtained in 81/89 blastomeres (91%), of which  genotypes in 69 blastomeres also analysed with the DGGE PGD  protocol, were completely concordant. Thus PGD using mutation  detection with real time PCR is more sensitive, accurate and  moreover very rapid.",2003

QF PCR amplification using several markers for  chromosomes X,Y, 21, 18 and 13 was successfully achieved on all 15  samples of coelomic fluid (CF), placental tissue and maternal blood.  Multiplex analyses of maternal blood samples and chorionic tissues  allowed to confirm the fetal origin of the cells and, eventually, to  identify maternal contamination of the CF samples. Prenatal detection  of fetal gender was successful in all cases. When tested with  autosomal primers, seven samples were found to contain exclusively  fetal DNA. Eight samples contained small amounts of maternal  DNA that did not interfere with the QF PCR analysis. One fetus was  correctly diagnosed as affected by trisomy 13.

Chromosome instability in female early embryonic  development,C40.,"V. Kovaleva1,2, L. G.

The predominance of females segregating chromosome aberrations  to their offspring has been explained mostly by selection  disadvantage of unbalanced products of spermatogenesis. However,  analysis of data from the literature supports the idea that somatic  cells of early female embryos are similar to female germ cells in  that they are prone to malsegregation. The goal of this study was to  compare the sex ratio (male to female ratio) of carriers of presumably  mitotic occurring chromosome abnormalities to identify any sex  biases. In examining the literature, we found a female prevalence  in cases of mosaicism associated with uniparental disomy. This  predominance was highest at gestational age < 16 wk (sex ratio is  0.17), which diminished at later stages of fetal development indicating  potential correction of trisomies predominantly in females. There  is a threefold prevalence of 46,XX/45,X mosaics over 46,XY/45,X  mosaics in prenatally diagnosed cases, which also suggests a  gender specific postzygotic chromosome loss. Finally, there is a  female predominance in carriers of de novo homologous acrocentric  translocations/isochromosomes, both balanced and unbalanced,  with or without mosaicism. Homologous acrocentric rearrangements  mostly result from post fertilization events, not meiotic. Mosaicism  results from later gestation postyzygotic formation, while formation  in the first zygotic clevage results in nonmosaics. Thus, these data  suggest that females may have gonadal mosaicism for aneuploidies  and structural rearrangements more often than males. This may lead to the maternal origin bias in offspring with trisomies or structural  rearrangements (especially Robertsonian translocations). We  conclude that there is likely a sex specific difference in chromosome  instability in early embryogenesis.",2003

Most sporadic BWS  cases result from epigenetic errors resulting in methylation changes  at differentially methylated sites on the maternal chromosome within  an 11p15.5 imprinted gene cluster. Angelman syndrome may also  result from epigenetic alterations at a maternally imprinted gene  cluster. Recently two children diagnosed with Angelman syndrome  born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) with sporadic  imprinting defects were described (Am J Hum Genet 2002;71). This  has led to suggestions that artificial reproductive techniques (ART)  may increase the risk of imprinting errors. We have reviewed our  referrals of BWS to assess if there is an association between BWS  and ART. We identified 6 BWS cases conceived using ART out of  149 BWS cases, or 4%. Since the precise nature of conception of the  BWS cases studied was not always documented, the actual figure  may be higher than this. In the UK, 1.0% of pregnancies occur after  assisted conception. Based on these data, if the proportion of births  after ART in BWS and the general population were similar, we would  have expected 1.4855 of the 149 BWS patients studied to have been  born after ART. To test the significance, a Poisson approximation to  the binomial gave a two tailed p value of 0.009. As 3 of our cases were after IVF and 3 after ICSI, it may be that  in vitro cell culture, rather than a specific ART predisposes to an  increased risk of imprinting disorders.",2003

Extrapolation from mouse studies has been extremely useful, but  there is an important need to develop high resolution human gene  expression maps. Four justifications are: (a) human and mouse  gene lists are different; (b) some human and mouse orthologues  have diverged very considerably in sequence; (c) there are important  examples of expression differences between highly conserved  human and mouse orthologues [2]; (d) some human attributes  (notably cognitive functions) can not be modelled in mouse.

"," Cardiac hypertrophy was induced in nephrectomized Sprague Dawley  rats, followed by a whole genome RNA profiling study on cDNA arrays  (Rat Unigene 1, 27,000 clones). After data mining, about 1,000 genes  potentially involved in cardiac remodeling were identified: growth  factors, cytoplasmic signaling molecules, cytoskeletal proteins, as  well as members of cell cell and cell extracellular matrix contacts.  With this information, 1,100 clones were extracted, re arrayed, PCR  amplified, quality controlled and spotted onto nylon membranes  and glass chips. This sub array was again hybridized with samples  from animals confronted with the disease for 2, 8, or 12 weeks,  respectively. Already in the 2 weeks samples it was obvious that  the remodeling of cell contacts and extracellular matrix (ECM) had  started: Components of adherens junctions (cadherin 2 type 1, beta  catenin, alpha actinin), tight junctions (claudin 3), and the extracellular  matrix (collagens) were up regulated. Strong expression of tissue  inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMP 1,  3) is another indicator  for ECM stabilization. Moreover, we could identify members of the  renin angiotensin hormonal system (endothelin converting enzym,  renin binding protein), growth factors (TGFbeta, TGFbeta receptor  binding protein), and second messengers (protein kinase C receptor)  as potential signal transducers. Interestingly, the pattern changes at  later time points (8, 12 weeks). In particular cytoplasmic cytoskeletal  proteins (keratin, kinesin), focal adhesion proteins (integrin alpha  1, actin, tropomyosin 6, dynactin, plectin), and ECM components  (laminin) seemed to contribute to fibrotic growth of the heart and  increase of blood pressure.

Here, we  further investigate the pattern of nucleotide changes in 220 of  these non genic conserved blocks by PCR amplification and  sequencing in 12 additional species representing all mammalian  clades. We find that a large fraction of these regions (total of  55519 bps) are highly conserved in multiple mammals ranging  from 25% to 90% of the 220 blocks, depending on the species,  which supports functional conservation.

In addition, we observe a highly  significant heterogeneous pattern of species specific substitutions  that suggest species specific selective constraints. Finally, we  have compared the pattern of substitution within these non genic  sequences with alignments of equal species coverage from protein  coding and non coding RNA genes. Discriminant analysis shows  significant differences between these three classes of conserved  sequences. We have built models that make use of the conservation  characteristics to classify a given sequence in one of the above  3 categories. These models will be very useful for the functional  characterization of conserved sequences in the human genome.Concurrent Sessions58 59",2003

This hypothesis predicts an association between the position of  neocentromeres and the position of ancient centromeres inactivated  during karyotypic evolution. Multiple neocentromeres have been  reported in 15q24 26, which contains a high density of chromosome  specific duplicons, rearrangements of which have been implicated  as a susceptibility factor for panic and phobic disorders with joint  laxity. We have investigated the evolutionary history of this region  in primates and found that it contains the site of an ancestral  centromere which became inactivated about 25 million year ago.  This inactivation has followed a non centromeric chromosomal  fission of an ancestral chromosome which gave rise to phylogenetic  chromosomes XIV and XV in human and great apes. Detailed  mapping of the ancient centromere and two neocentromeres in  15q24 26 has established that the neocentromere domains map  approximately 8 Mb proximal and 1.5Mb distal of the ancestral  centromeric region, but that all three map within 500kb of duplicons,  copies of which flank the centromere in Old World Monkey species.  This suggests that the association between neocentromere and  ancestral centromere position on this chromosome may be due to  the persistence of recombinogenic duplications accrued within the  ancient pericentromere, rather than the retention of âcentromere  competentâ sequences per se . The high frequency of neocentromere  emergence in the 15q24 26 region and the high density of clinically  important duplicons are, therefore, understandable in the light of the  evolutionary history of this region.",2003
Systematic screen for human disease genes in  yeast,C48.,"Prokisch1, C. Andreoli1, C. Scharfe2, S. Huber1, K. Hoertnagel1, T.  Meitinger1","1TU Munich, Munich, Germany, 2Stanford University School of  Medicine, Stanford, CA, United States","Mitochondria are essential organelles of eukaryotic cells. High  similarity between yeast and human mitochondria allows functional  genomic study of Saccharomyces cerevisiae  to be used to identify  human genes involved in disease. To date, more than hundred  heritable disorders have been attributed to defects in nuclear  encoded mitochondrial proteins in man. Many mitochondrial  diseases remain unexplained, however, in part due to the fact that  only a fraction of the mitochondrial proteins have been identified.  Systematic functional screens using whole genome pool of yeast  deletion mutants have identified 160 proteins, which presumably  play important roles for the maintenance of respiratory competent  mitochondria. High throughput protein protein interaction analyses,  in silico predictions and expression profiling have delivered additional  sets of potential new mitochondrial proteins. We developed a  database (http://ihg.gsf.de/mitop), which integrates these data and  allows their analysis regarding mitochondrial functions by including  the knowledge of published studies listed in databases such as  SGD and MIPS. These data provide a comprehensive picture of  the cellular processes and molecular components required for  mitochondrial function. With this mitochondrial proteome set in hands we determined the  human orthologs, which provide a list of 150 human proteins with a  potential mitochondrial localisation. Among these are known disease  proteins with unknown subcellular localisation. For identifying new  candidates of mitochondria related disorders, we screened the  OMIM entries and established a catalogue of at least 250 potential  mitochondrial diseases. The correlation of the genomic map positions  of the two datasets allows a focused screen for disease genes.",2003

In such populations, there exist very  complex genealogies with unknown loops. So the true inbreeding  coefficient of an individual is often unknown. Good estimations of  the inbreeding coefficient ( f) are important as it has been shown that  underestimation of f may lead to false linkage conclusions. When an individual is genotyped for markers spanning the whole  genome, it should be possible to use this genomic information to  estimate his f. To do so we propose a maximum likelihood method  that takes into account marker dependencies through a hidden  Markov model. This methodology also allows us to infer the full  probability distribution of the identity by descent (IBD) status at each  marker along the genome and provides a variance for the estimates.  We simulate a full genome scan mimicking the true autosomal  genome for (1) first cousin pedigree (2) quadruple second cousin  pedigree.

In a range Concurrent Sessions60 61 of studies, linguistic â genetic correlations (Sokal 1988, Poloni et  al 1997, Gray and Jordan 2000, Rosser et al 2000) are significant  for populations separated by significant physical barriers. However,  although geographically close populations: are typically less  divergent in genetics than distant ones (as one would expect), this  increased similarity is not paralleled in linguistic distance. W e argue  that this apparent mismatch in geographically close populations  results from an interdisciplinary discrepancy over admixture. While  geneticists accept gene flow between populations, and factor this into  their calculations, comparative linguists typically remove loan words  when establishing language family relations, hence underplaying the  contribution of admixture. Addressing this discrepancy may reveal  more accurate matching of linguistic and genetic trees for close  as well as distant populations. However, linguists must reconsider  their current practice in excluding evidence of contact, investigating  new methods of diagnosing and using borrowings. We report one  approach, using lists of more and less conservative meanings,  and applying the tree selection programs of Felsenstein (2000) to  language data. Our results are also shown to correlate significantly  with independent measures of phonetic distance. We argue finally  that this foregrounding of contact induced change necessitates the  investigation of network diagrams as well as family trees for the  representation of genealogical linguistic relationships.",2003
The first metric linkage disequilibrium map of a  human chromosome.,C52.,"J. Tapper , N. Maniatis, N. Morton, N. E. Morton, A. R. Collins","Southampton University, Southampton, United Kingdom","Recent descriptions of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns have  focussed on delimiting blocks corresponding to regions of low  haplotype diversity. The HapMap project aims to determine common  haplotype patterns within these blocks so that a few haplotype  tag single nucleotide polymorphisms (htSNPs) can be used to  define each haplotype. In comparison, a metric LD map, with map  distances analogous to the centiMorgan scale of linkage maps,  provides additional information by characterising inter block regions  which define the relationship between blocks. Such maps avoid  arbitrary block definitions and give an additive scale that is useful  to determine optimal marker spacing for positional cloning. LD  maps also provide insights into the relationship between sequence  motifs and recombination since the pattern of LD is closely  related to recombination hot spots and their resolution is higher  than existing linkage maps. Using LDMAP to analyse SNP data  spanning chromosome 22 (Dawson et al., 2002), we have obtained  the first whole chromosome metric LD map. This map identifies  regions of high LD as plateaus or blocks and regions of low LD as  steps reflecting variable recombination intensity. The intensity of  recombination is related to the height of the step and thus intense  recombination hot spots can be distinguished from more randomly  distributed historical events. The map defines optimal SNP spacing  for positional cloning and suggests that the minimum number of  SNPs required to cover the genome is around 50,000. The map is  also closely correlated with the most recent high resolution linkage  map and a range of sequence motifs including GT/CA repeats.",2003

When the number  of polymorphisms investigated within a study is large and the hidden  structure of the relationships among them complex, the use of data  mining tools to extract the relevant information is a necessity. Here,  we propose a fully automated method for detecting informative  combined effects among several polymorphisms (and other non  genetic covariates) within the framework of association studies. The  sequential heuristic algorithm, called DICE, combines the advantages  of the regressive approaches with those of large scale data  exploration. Importantly, DICE considers the problem of interaction between polymorphisms as an effect of interest and not as a  nuisance effect. The algorithm compares at each step a wide variety  of candidate models and chooses the one(s) that provide(s) the  best approximation to the data while having the smallest number of  parameters. To avoid difficulties related to the null hypothesis testing  theory, the selection for the best model(s) is based on an information  criterion to be minimized. DICE identifies a subset of polymorphisms  and/or non genetic variables, which individually or in combination, are  associated with the phenotype. Several applications on real data sets  demonstrated that the method was able to recover results already  found using other approaches, but in addition detected biologically  sensible effects not previously described.",2003

Since  endometriosis occurs spontaneously in nonhuman primate species  with menstrual cycles, we investigated the prevalence and familial  aggregation of endometriosis in a large colony of rhesus macaques. 142 Rhesus macaques with endometriosis were identified mainly  from necropsy and surgical records between 1981 and 2002 of  a colony at the University of Madison Wisconsin. Females that  had died aged â¥10 years without endometriosis, had both ovaries  until at least one year prior to death, and had a full necropsy, were  considered unaffected. All affecteds were used to build one large  multigenerational pedigree and 9 nuclear families comprising 1,602  females in total. The prevalence of endometriosis among necropsied rhesus  macaques in the colony was 31.4% (95% CI: 26.9 35.9%);  prevalence increased with rising age at death and calendar  period. The average kinship coefficient was significantly higher  among affecteds compared to unaffecteds (p<0.001),  and a higher  recurrence risk for full sibs (0.75, 95% CI: 0.45 1.0) was found  compared to paternal half sibs (0.47, 95% CI: 0.42 0.52) and  maternal halfsibs (0.26, 95% CI: 0.10 0.41).

Candidate  low penetrance genes are involved in a variety of pathways, for  example, steroid hormone metabolism. As increased exposure to  estrogens is considered to be a risk factor for breast cancer, the  human aromatase gene ( Cyp19 ) and gene cytochrome P450c17Î±  (Cyp17 ) are plausible candidates for low penetrance breast cancer  susceptibility.

Blood group A has been shown as a risk factor for GC. Northern Iran is an endemic region for GC. Methods: In this prospective case control study, we enrolled Iranian  gastric cancer patients under the age 50 and sex matched controls  over 50. All the patients and (if alive)/or their family members were  interviewed and their pedigrees were drawn. The blood group of the  patients were also tested or obtained from the in patients records.

In this study we intended to understand the influence of the  alterations in this gene (GSPT1/eRF3) that can be involved in  susceptibility for the development of gastric carcinoma. Gene expression was investigated by Real Time PCR and a  significant overexpression of eRF3 was observed in about 40%  (7/17) of gastric tumour samples (mainly adenocarcinoma intestinal  type, with different states of differentiation), when compared with  the noncancerous adjacent tissue. A significant correlation between  the presence of the 149 bp allele of the STR region and cancer  (freq= 5%, Ï2 =15,506; p=0,008) was also detected using fluorescent  STR allelotyping. LOH was found in circa 30% (19/55) of the  informative cases. Breast (mainly ductal carcinoma), lung (mainly  adenocarcinoma)and endometrium tumours were also investigated  and similar expression patterns were detected. Our results shows that GSPT1/eRF3 may have a role in  (de)controlling cell cycle or (de)regulation protein synthesis.",2003
Identification of polymorphisms in multidrug  resistance gene in leukemia patients,P009.,"Kaya1, U. GÃ¼ndÃ¼z1, F. ArpacÄ±2, A. Ural2, &. GÃ¼ran2","1Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey, 2GÃ¼lhane Military  Medical School, Ankara, Turkey","Multidrug resistance(MDR) is a serious limitation to effective  chemotherapeutic treatment of many cancer types including  leukemia. One of the most important proteins the overexpression  of which is responsible for the MDR in many cancer types is P  glycoprotein. This protein is the product of the MDR1  gene. In many  studies, single nucleotide polymorphisms C3435T, G2677T, T 129C  in MDR1 were shown to correlate with P glycoprotein expression in  normal tissues.I n this study, these polymorphisms were compared  in 16 resistant and 12 non resistant acute leukemia patients and 17  healthy individuals. In the acute leukemia patient group the C3435T   polymorphism seems to have a preventive effect since 58.3%  patients having T/T genotype are non resistant while 59.3% patients  having C/C genotype are resistant to chemotherapy. The G2677T Cancer Genetics62 63 polymorphism conferred no advantage for the drug resistance  phenotype. In this case resistant and non resistant patients have  approximately same allele ratio, having G/G genotype about 80%  (p=1). Any effect of the T 129C polymorphism on resistance could not  be detected since all the patients were homozygous for the wild type  T/T genotype. In the Turkish population the incidence of the T allele  (73.5%) for C3435T polymorphism was significantly higher (p=0.025)  than the C allele (26.4%), indicating that the Turkish population  shows greater P gp mediated resistance than populations that have  higher C allele. The incidence of G allele for G2677T polymorphism  is high (84%). The incidence of T 129C C allele is too low to be  detected in 45 individuals.",2003

Acquired aplastic anemia (AA) is a rare disease in which  pancytopenia most probably derives from an autoimmune attack  towards the hematopoietic stem cell by autoreactive T cell. The initial  activation may be due various triggers such as genetic events, drugs  or infections. Genetic factors related to the immune response may  influence T cell activation and the release of myelotoxic cytokines.  In order to evaluate if genetic variations of the mechanisms of T cell  control and of the capability of producing myelosuppressive cytokines  may have a role in the origin of AA, we analyzed the distribution of  the polymorphisms of CTLA4, TNF Î±, IFN Î³, and IL 10 (see table) in  52 patients with AA and in 100 normal controls. The lack of difference between patients and controls regarding  IL10, TNF Î± stands against a role for these polymorphisms. It is  still to be evaluated whether these polymorphisms may impact on  the outcome of the disease. The increased expression of CTLA4  in AA patients vs controls seems to indicate a pathogenic role for  these polymorphisms. It is a further support to the autoimmune  pathogenesis of AA. Furthermore analysis of CTLA4 haplotype  suggest a role as a risk factor in this condition. In addition our results  suggest a role of IFNÎ³ in the pathogenesis of this condition.

Germ line mutations in breast cancer  susceptibility genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 account for the majority of  families with hereditary breast and ovarian cancers. Carriers of these  mutations have an increased life time risk of developing breast and  ovarian cancers. Population genetics studies aimed at determining  the relative contributions of these genes in hereditary breast and/ or ovarian cancers have shown a wide variation among different  populations .The frequency and the types of germline mutations  involved in Turkish breast ovarian cacers are not well known. Exons  10 and 11 of BRCA2 gene are hot spot regions for determining  of susceptibility to breast cancer. In this study, we screened exon  10 of BRCA2 gene in 35 families with breast/ovarian cancer by  heterodublex analysis with non radioactive silver staining technique.  Altered fragments were determined at exon 10 1 of BRCA2 gene.  BRCA2 (codon 289; 1093 A to C) different sequence alteration  was identified in 17 individuals of 6 (17.1%) families by sequencing  analysis.

Overexpression of Rad51 protein have been reported in different  human cancers like pancreatic adenocarcinoma and invasive ductal  breast cancer. In the present study we describe the isolation, sequencing and fi rst  functional characterization of the promoter of human Rda51 gene.  We cloned and sequenced an 8.1 kb 5Â´ flanking region of HsRad51  gene and identified the promoter region of this gene. Analysis of 1.5  kb of DNA upstream of the initiation of translation revealed that this  sequence has a high GC content, lacks a TATA element and contains  a number of putative transcription factor binding sites. The regulatory sequence crucial for rad51 promoter activity were  characterized between  543 and +106 bp. In this region, a minimal  promoter sequence including E2F /GABP or/and Ets1/PEA3  transcription factor binding sites, as well as a proximal promoter  sequence with an P53 binding site were identified. The sequence  between  43 and +204 bp shows down regulate function, which can  be effected by a single base substitution of C to G.

The BRCA1/ 2 mutation frequency in families with four or more cases of breast  cancer only was significantly less than in all the rest of the sample (P  < 0.03), and less than in families with four or more cases that include  ovarian cancer (P < 0.005). Families without BRCA1/2  mutations  predominantly had breast cancer only (77%). Conversely, the majority  of families with mutations included cases of ovarian cancer (61%).  These results characterize the families with BRCA1/2  mutations in  Russia and show the type of family without mutations. SNP analysis has defined two major haplotypes of BRCA1 : a  consensus sequence (haplotype A) and a sequence with a set  of SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium (haplotype B). Proband  groups with and without BRCA1/2  gene mutations showed different  haplotype frequencies (P < 0.03). Moreover, in the latter group the  AA genotype was decreased relative to the control individuals (P <  0.03), with odds ratio 0.29. The data may suggest a connection of the  BRCA1  gene variations with familial breast cancer without BRCA1/2   gene mutations, possibly in association with another gene or genes.",2003

Moreover, in mice,  alleles involved in susceptibility or resistance to tumours, are often  preferentially amplified (or deleted) in the tumours themselves, which  allows us to narrow down the regions to a reasonable number of  candidate genes to test. Thus, in an attempt to validate selected QTL in human breast cancer,  4 candidate genes, FasL (1q23), CSTF1 and STK15 (20q13.2), and  CCND1 (11q13), were investigated using association study on 2300  East Anglia Breast Cancer cases matched to EPIC controls.

","Approximately 36,090 persons will be diagnosed with breast  cancer this year in Brazil and 9,115 will die. This type of tumor may  occur in the same family associated with other cancers in 30% of  cases. About 5 10% may be due to inherited germline mutations in  autosomal highly penetrant susceptibility genes corresponding to  hereditary breast cancer syndromes (HER) and 20% corresponding  to familial clustering (FAM), where there is interplay between genetic  and environmental factors. The principal goal from this research  is to evaluate the correlation between breast cancer and other  malignancies to establish risk categories. For this purpose, 858  records from patients seen between 10/1999 and 02/2002 by our  Oncogenetics Department were studied. We selected 332 cases with  breast cancer with first and/or second degree relatives affected by  malignancies. Details such as the site of the primary tumor and the  age of onset was considered. The association with 24 tumors was  observed and family history of cancer was classified in FAM (271) or  HER (58 cases). In the FAM the more prevalent associations were  with breast cancer (176), stomach (90), colorectal (87), lung (63),  uterus (55), prostate (50), head/cervical (49), lymphoproliferatives  (32), thyroid (15), urinary bladder (12), ovary (9), sarcomas (7), and  others. Some rare aggregations were also observed as melanoma  (21) and pancreas (13). All patients at high risk were identified and  received oncogenetics counseling. This study emphasizes that some  familial clustering are suspected of HER and must be considered as  high risk, with implications on the follow up. Funded by: CAPES/FAEPA",2003

Recently, the  CHEK2  Breast Cancer Consortium (2002) reported that an 1861delC  mutation (previously known as 1100delC) confers a low penetrance  susceptibility of breast cancer in BRCA1/2 negative families. This  low penetrance susceptibility was confirmed in the Finnish population  by Vahteristo et al. (2002). Also published in 2002, the German Consortium for Heredity Breast  and Ovarian Cancer (GCHBOC) reported the mutation profile and  frequencies for the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes in the German  population and as an extension of this work the German CHEK2   Consortium has investigated the mutation spectra for the entire  coding region of the CHEK2  gene, which consists of 14 exons. Based on our results of over 500 probands that are negative for  mutations in both the BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes, the low penetrance  susceptibility previously reported by others for the 1861delC mutation,  located in exon 13, holds true for the German population with the  exception that the observed frequencies are lower. Interestingly, a  novel mutation in exon five that causes a severely truncated protein  could not be associated with hereditary breast cancer. This result and the low overall frequency of mutations discovered during the  complete screening of the CHEK2  gene indicate that aberrations  in the CHEK2 protein have a minor impact for the development of  familial breast cancer in the German population.",2003

Since the Non Ashkenazi  Jewish way of life in the diaspora was essentially similar to that of  the Ashkenazi Jews, it seems plausible that a few founder mutations  would also be detected in that ethnic subset of Jewish individuals.  A single mutation in BRCA1 (1100delAT) was initially detected in a  Lybian family with breast/ovarian cancer. Subsequent analysis of  the rate of this mutation in 135 seemingly unrelated high risk Jewish  families of North African origin, revealed that 6 additional unrelated  patients harbored the same mutation (4.4%). Haplotype analysis  showed that all mutation carriers had an identical BRCA1 intragenic  haplotype. The rate of this mutation in unselected Jewish individuals  of the same ethnic origin with breast and ovarian cancer as well as  the occurrence of this mutation in the population at large are ongoing.

The purpose of the study was to  determine the number of referrals being seen annually, their gender  distribution and the proportion with high risk of developing bowel  cancer. Method: Hospital computer records and/or department referral books  were used to identify cases between the years 1992 to 2001. Result: A total of 1088 bowel cancer files were reviewed (Familial  Adenomatous Polyposis families were in a separate register). The  numbers of referral showed a 9 fold increase over the 10 years.  There was a 67% to 33% female to male ratio and a 23% to 77%  affected to non affected (relatives) individuals. The majority of  referrals were from Hospital Surgical departments (40%) and General  Practitioners (35.2%). 18% of families met the Amsterdam or Modified  Amsterdam criteria, 65% families were classified as moderate risk  and 17% as low risk. 42 families have been identified with mismatch  repair mutations. 60% of referred individuals were recommended  to have regular colonoscopy ranging from 18 monthly to 5 yearly  depending on their risks. Conclusion: There has been near 10 fold increase in individuals with  suspected hereditary bowel cancer referred to the regional genetics  service in the last ten years. After verification of family history, 60% of  individuals were recommended to undergo screening colonoscopy.  The increase referral numbers is mostly likely to be due to cancer  genetic awareness among healthcare professionals.",2003

Up to 50% of hMSH2  mutations are thought to be hemizygous where single or multiple  exons are present in only one copy. Such dosage DNA deletions are  undetectable using routinely employed screening methods. A fluorescent based quantitative real time PCR assay has been  developed to determine the exon copy number for hMSH2 and  hMLH1. Exon copy number is determined by comparing the  fluorescence generated during the exponential phase of amplification  of individual exons to that of the control standard Î² globin. PCR  amplification conditions for all hMSH2 and hMLH1 exons have been  optimised for the use of SYBR green quantification. To compensate  for differing PCR efficiencies amplification co efficients were  established to enable accurate quantification relative to Î² globin.

We also  examined the molecular genetic changes of APC, K ras and p53  genes in the epithelium of patientâs tubular adenoma. DNAs were isolated from peripheral blood of patient and from  the microdissections of deparaffinized tissue sections. Each  microdissection was first preamplified by using primer extension  preamplification (PEP) method. PCR was performed using specific  pairs of primers. PCR products were analysed by heteroduplex,  RFLP, LOH analysis and sequencing. The genetic analysis confirmed the APC gene codon 1309 germ line  mutation and the diagnosis of FAP in this patient as a first case in her  family. By using microdissection and PEP PCR we were able to prove  germline mutation and LOH of the APC gene. K ras gene codon 12  and p53 gene exon 7 mutation were detected as well. This results show the importance of genetic analysis in the  differentiation of polyposis syndromes and evaluation of the risk for  development of colon cancer.",2003

There were 24 mutations among patients (65%). Twelve mutations  were revealed for the first time. Such a high proportion of new  mutations may be suggestive of a de novo  origin of a significant part  of APC mutations. Only the frequent European mutations 1309del5  and 1061del5 were found recurrent in Russia. By SNP analysis we  showed that polymorphisms 1458C/T, 1635A/G and 4479G/A are  in linkage disequilibrium and characterize a haplotype (named B).  The consensus sequence defines the most frequent haplotype A.  There were three other haplotypes. Four of five 1309del5 mutations  were found on haplotype A and one on haplotype B. The presence  of haplotype A in genomes with non recurrent mutations was  significantly less than in genomes with recurrent mutations (P<  0.05). The proportion of haplotype A in genomes with non recurrent  mutations was decreased nearly twofold in comparison with the  control group. These results may suggest a linkage of different  mutation types (recurrent and non recurrent) with different haplotypes  and, possibly, an origin of non recurrent mutations predominantly on  haplotype B. Alternatively, the observed difference of the haplotype  frequencies may be connected with heterogeneity of the sample with  the same clinical characteristics. It should be noted that the haplotype  distribution in the group of patients with FAP but without mutations  was the same as in the control group.",2003

Aim:  To assess  whether the APC gene D1822V variant and two novel COX 2 variants  influence NSAIDs effect in CRC development. Population:  302  cases and 297 controls belonging to a hospital based case control  study performed between 1996 and 1998 at Hospital of Bellvitge.  Epidemiological and dietary questionnaire was delivered. Methods:   Genotype was assessed using the LightCycler. Heterozygous (AT)  and homozygous (TT) allele were analysed as a single group. COX2  (D28235 nt1629 and D28235 nt5209) and NFKB (4098 RS59)  variants were assessed. Multivariate methods based on logistic  regression analyses were used. Alleles were in Hardy Weinberg Cancer Genetics70 71 equilibrium in cases and controls. Results:  No increased risk was  observed between the variant allele and cancer risk. The protective  effect of NSAIDs consumption decreased with allele T of D1822V  (OR=0.84 [95%CI 0.33 2.14] vs allele A OR=0.28 [0.13 0.59]).  We found a complex interaction between polymorphism in COX 2  (D28235 1629; D28235 5209), NFKB1 (4098 RS59) and D1822V  APC variant. Individuals with allele G of D28235 1629 in combination  with 1822V, and individuals with allele A of NFKB plus 1822V have  higher risk of development CRC. However individuals homozygous  GG to D28235 5209 with 1822V are protected.

Only about two hundred families suffering from LFS have been  described in the world, with germline TP53 mutations found in about  70% of them. Members of LFS families are affected mainly by soft  tissue sarcomas, osteosarcomas, breast cancer and brain tumours.  The frequency of childhood cancer is also very high. The possibility of  reliable presymptomatic molecular genetic diagnostics in the absence  of efficient tumour prevention and therapy is a serious ethical  problem. In our presentation we demonstrate several pedigrees of childhood  cancer patients suffering from typical tumours and germline TP53  mutations found in these families. Generally, mutations in the  TP53 gene are predominantly missense and very heterogeneous.  The families have therefore been analysed by automated DNA  sequencing of the TP53 gene and/or by the Affymetrix DNA chip  technology. We also discuss some problems of genetic counselling  and subsequent health care in the affected families. Based on the  analysis of our web database of published germline TP53 mutations  (www.lf2.cuni.cz/projects/germline_mut_p53.htm) we point to specific  tumour types in childhood carriers of germline TP53 mutations  and to the possibility of anticipation in this disorder.

All three clinical subtypes of the MEN  2 syndromes (MEN 2A, MEN 2B and familial MTC (FMTC)) are  caused by germline mutations in the RET proto oncogene which  encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor expressed in tissues and  tumors of neural crest origin. Since MTC is associated with high  mortality, presymptomatic identification of mutated gene carriers  by DNA analysis allows earlier identification of subjects at risk in  this familial cancer syndrome and provides the basis for preventive  thyroidectomy. MEN 2A and FMTC commonly result from germline missense  mutation in one of six cysteine codons in the cysteine rich  extracellular domain of RET. These codons are as follows: 630, 634,  609, 611 618 and 620. MEN 2B is caused by germline mutation in  codon 918 (M918T) in more than 95% of cases. Our purpose was to perform mutation analysis of the RET  protooncogene for MEN2 patients and patients with apparently  sporadic MTC to exclude the hereditary forms of this tumor.

","Pancreatic cancer (PC) is the fifth leading cause of cancer  related mortality with a very poor prognosis. The only recognized  environmental risk factor is cigarette smoking.

To investigate the  inherited components in PC we started to enroll families with FPC  and with pancreatic cancer melanoma syndrome (PCMS) in the  German Familial Pancreatic Cancer Case Collection (FaPaCa). In  a total of 40 families the spectrum of cancers and diseases was  analysed. A combination of PC and breast cancer was found in  five (12,5%) families. Up to date, BRCA2 germ line mutations have  been identified in two out of 14 FPC families. PC and malignant  melanoma was present in six (18.8%) families. A CDKN2A germline  mutation was found in 2 of 5 PCMS and in none of 18 FPC families.  We observed the joint occurrence of PC and BCC in three (7,5%)  families. A fourth family demonstrated with multiple BCC and PC.  A familial accumulation of PC and BCC has not been described as  yet. Thus, the joint occurrence of PC and BCC may represent a new Cancer Genetics72 73 hereditary tumor predisposition syndrome.

Geurts van Kessel",UMC St,"Radboud, Nijmegen, The Netherlands.   To date, eight families have been described in the literature in  which constitutional chromosome 3 translocations segregate with  a predisposition to the development of renal cell cancer (RCC).  Through a multi center study we have identified several additional  families with RCC and chromosome 3 translocations. Previously,  we found that loss of the derivative chromosome carrying the  3p arm and subsequent VHL mutations constitute critical steps  in the development and progression of these RCCs. In addition,  we hypothesized that genes located at or near the translocation  breakpoints may be related to tumor initiation (Bodmer et al., 2002).  Therefore, we have set out to positionally clone the translocation  breakpoints and to characterize them in detail. In one of our RCC  families with a t(2;3)(q35;q21) translocation, two novel breakpoint  spanning genes were identified. The breakpoint spanning gene  on chromosome 3, named DIRC2 , encodes a putative membrane  spanning protein belonging to the major facilitator super family  (MFS) of transporters. The gene disrupted by the breakpoint  on chromosome 2, named DIRC3 , forms fusion transcripts with  HSPBAP1 , a JmjC Hsp domain gene that maps proximal to the  breakpoint on chromosome 3. Currently, we are characterizing these  (fusion) genes in detail at the cell biological and functional level.  Together with known and novel genes to be identified by us and  others, these studies should lead to a unified model for hereditary  RCC development in families with chromosome 3 translocations.

However, not all RCC have  VHL inactivation, and in other cancers with HIF overexpression (e.g.  gliomas), somatic VHL mutations are not found. Recently FIH 1  (factor inhibiting HIF) was reported to interact with HIF 1a and VHL   and to repress HIF 1a transcriptional activity. We hypothesised that  mutations in FIH 1 might result in HIF dysregulation. To test this  hypothesis, we analysed 35 sporadic gliomas and 15 clear cell RCC  without VHL mutations for evidence of FIH 1 mutations. We detected  a SNP in exon 1 of both glioma and RCC samples. This SNP was  also present in 45% of the normal samples. To date, we have not  been able to implicate FIH 1 inactivation in the pathogenesis of RCC  or human glioma, however epigenetic inactivation has not been  excluded and FIH 1 inactivation may be relevant in other types of  cancer",2003

These factors however are unable to predict the individual course of the disease. For these reasons, new methods are  necessary to identify those patients who are at risk for development  of recurrent and invasive carcinoma. Therefore the expression  pattern of the PAX5 gene in the superficial TCC, its prognostic  value and its correlation with p53 immunohistochemistry and  mutation analysis were evaluated. Study comprised 61 patients with  histologically confirmed TCC. PAX5 expression was evaluated using  the RT PCR and determined semiquantitatively. The presence of  p53 mutations was determined by the SSCP and confirmed by direct  sequencing. The p53 immunohistochemistry was performed with  DO1 antibody and evaluated using HSCORE (HS) method. PAX5  overexpression was found in 50 patients with superficial TCC. Its  quantity however correlated neither with the stage nor with the grade  of the tumour. p53 mutation was confirmed only in 1 patient with  pTaG2 tumour in exon 5 (deletion of proline 128). On the contrary,  positive immunohistochemical staining of p53 was detected in most  patients. Quantity of p53 immunochistochemical positivity did not  correlate with the quantity of PAX5 expression. Using the cutoff  values, 7 of 8 patients with future progression had p53 and 4 had  PAX5 overexpression, respectively. In conclusion, our data indicate  that the expression of the PAX5 gene is a frequent event in superficial  bladder TCC and might be used as diagnostic tool.

"," Activating point mutations in the FGFR3 gene have been  demonstrated as the causative agent of several genetic skeletal  malformations and are highly prevalent in several types of cancer .  The expression of a constitutively activated FGFR3 in bladder and  cervix tumors provieds the first evidence of an oncogenic role for  FGFR3 in carcinomas. Currently, FGFR3 appears to be the most  frequently mutated oncogene in bladder cancer. It is mutated in  almost 50% of all cases and in >70% of recurrent superficial bladder  tumors cases. Detection of FGFR3 mutations in this patient poulation  could be fundamental in determining treatment follow up and  prognosis of bladder cancer. The four point mutations in the FGFR3 gene that are most often  associated with bladder cancer are: S248C, S249C, S371C  and Y373C. To detect these mutations simultaneously, we have  developed the FibroTestâ¢ kit, which utilizes the Prontoâ¢ technology,  a single nucleotide primer extension reaction, followed by ELISA.  This post amplification mutation detection system, benefits from the  high specificity in which DNA polymerase incorporates nucleotides  into the elongating strand. Results are determined by a standard  ELISA reader. More than 110 bladder carcinoma samples, taken from either fresh  biopsies or paraffin embedded blocks were screened for mutations in  the FGFR3 gene. Comparison of FibroTestâ¢ with a standard SSCP  method on the same set of samples provided identical results. FibroTestTM allows fast and precise testing for these mutations in  tumor derived and body fluid samples and may become an integral  part of follow up, evaluation and treatment of bladder cancer patients.",2003

However, several  lines of evidence suggest that HPV infection alone is insufficient  to generate the malignant phenotype and other additional events  are required. In this study we investigated whether the aberrant  promoter methylation of some tumor suppressor genes is involved  in the genesis of cervical squamous carcinomas. To determine  the role played by DNA promoter methylation in squamous  carcinoma susceptibility, we analyzed 25 samples of cervical  epithelial dysplasia for frequency of CDKN2A,  RB1, MLH1, MGMT,  HIC1, N33, CDH1 genes aberrant methylation. Morphologically  normal cervical mucosa was used as a control. The presence of  methylation was determined by multiplex methyl sensitive PCR.  The results of research are shown in the table. Statistical analysis  was performed using Fisherâs exact test. Since the frequency of CDKN2A, RB1, MLH1, HIC1  genes methylation in dysplasia samples  was significantly different to that in control samples, we conclude  that detection of these genes promoter methylation could be used  as a molecular marker for early diagnostic of cervical squamous  carcinomas. Using set of three microsatellite markers (D5S107, D5S406,  D13S153) we investigated the frequency of microsatellite instability  (MSI) as well.

In  the study, the frequencies of aberrant methylation on the promoter  of the P15, P16, E cadherin, APC, GSK 3 and SOCS 1 genes were  7.5% (15/200), 8.0% (16/200), 6.0% (12/200), 12% (24/200), 2% (4/ 200) and 3.5% (7/200) for cancerous tissues, respectively, whereas  the frequencies were 3.5% (7/200), 6.0% (12/200), 7.0% (14/200),  2.5% (5/200), 0.5% (1/200) and none for nearby non cancerous  tissues, respectively. The methylation status of these genes had no  clear relationship with cancer cell types. Our results suggest that  inactivation of these tumor related genes through methylation of CpG  islands may play a limited role in the development of colon cancer ,  and methylation inactivation of these genes except SOCS1 may  occur at the pre cancerous stage.

Using RT PCR, we have shown that STAP is ubiquitously expressed,  suggesting that its function is not merely a hepatic one. We present  a hypothesis for the involvement of STAP in TOC. Partial loss of  function of STAP, a peroxidase, might lead to a higher concentration  of free radicals at sites of injury (skin and oesophagus being  particularly susceptible due to their constant exposure to frictional  and thermal damage). Free radicals are known to activate hepatic  stellate cells, and a similar process at other sites could lead to  fibrosis. Activated stellate cells are known to produce the ZF9  transcription factor, which can transactivate the keratin K4 promoter  in certain oesophageal cancer cell lines.

Frequent epigenetic inactivation of the SLIT2 gene  in gliomas,P077.,"Dallol1, D. Krex2, C. Eng3, E. Maher1, F.

The Slits (Slit1  3) are ligands for the ROBO  family of axon guidance receptors. In a  recent report we demonstrated that promoter region of human SLIT2   was frequently hypermethylated in several tumours and the silenced  gene transcript suppressed the malignant phenotype in in vitro   assays. In this report we undertook epigenetic, genetic and expression  analysis of SLIT2  gene in a large series of gliomas and glioma cell  lines. Promoter region of SLIT2  was found to be methylated in 71%  (5/7) of glioma cell lines and was unmethylated in five DNA samples  from normal brain tissues. The hypermethylation of the SLIT2   promoter region in glioma cell lines correlated with loss of expression  and treatment with the demethylating agent 5 aza 2â deoxycytidine  reactivated SLIT2  gene expression. In primary gliomas SLIT2  was  methylated in 59% (37/63) of tumours analysed. In addition, SLIT2  expression was down regulated in methylated gliomas relative to  unmethylated tumour samples as demonstrated by quantitative real  time RT PCR. Loss of heterozygosity analysis revealed that SLIT2   methylated gliomas retained both alleles of a microsatellite marker  within 100kb of the SLIT2  gene at 4p15.2. Our data indicates that  SLIT2  is frequently inactivated by promoter region hypermethylation  in gliomas and may be a good candidate for a glioma tumour  suppressor gene (TSG) located at 4p15.2. Furthermore, our data  suggests that a detailed analysis of both the cancer genome and  epigenome will be required to identify key tumour suppressor genes  involved in glioma development.",2003

To investigate  the role of candidate genes, selected by bioinformatic tools according  to the physical mapping of the LOH region and their plausible  oncosuppressor function, we performed RT PCR analysis of CASP9,  EPH2A, PAX7, DAN and DVL1 genes. RT PCR on 8 chordomas evidenced the presence of DAN and PAX7  transcript fragments of the expected size in all samples. Conversely  the CASP9 specific fragment was observed only in three tumors,  while EPH2A was observed with one exception. Peculiar DVL1  transcripts with a size smaller than expected, were observed in four  tumors, but also in the normal counterpart, nucleus polposus, which  however also showed the transcript with the typical size. Following  sequencing, the smallest DVL1 fragment showed the skipping of  three exons leading to frameshift and predicting a truncated DVL1  gene product. The study, describing the most numerous cohort of  chordoma patients so far recruited, points to a common molecular  lesion at 1p36.2, suggesting a putative role for CASP9, EPH2A and  DVL1 genes as oncosuppressor, possibly implicated in chordoma  development.",2003

"," Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most common primary  neoplasm occurring in the central nervous system of adults. Chromosome analysis of glial tumours can provide important  pathobiological data; however, conventional cytogenetics has been  unable to identify consistent chromosomal aberrations in this group  of tumours.

In this study, chromosomal abnormalities in 15 cases of GBM were  analysed. In all patients, trisomy 7, monosomy 10, p53 deletions  and EGFR gene amplification using interphase FISH analyses were  investigated. In 5 cases, comparative genomic hybridization (CGH)  to identify genomic imbalances (losses or gains of chromosomes)  across the entire tumour genome was performed. Three cultivated glioma cell lines were analyzed by spectral  karyotyping (SKY) to determine complex structural rearrangements  not resolved by the G banding analyses.

This region of chromosome 16 was identified as the  common fragile site FRA16D. The loss of heterozygosity frequently  observed in cancer has been traditionally associated with the  existence of a tumor suppressor gene in an affected area. However,  chromosomal rearrangement associated with common fragile sites  has been also observed in various tumors. Therefore, there is an  open question if genomic alternations affecting genes which reside in  common fragile sites are a cause or just a consequence of the cancer . It was previously reported that WWOX  behaves as a tumor  suppressor gene when ectopically expressed in breast cancer cell  lines. Additionally, aberrant transcripts with deletion of exons 5 8  and 6 8 were detected in various cancers but not in normal tissues.  Those alternatively spliced WWOX  mRNAs were found in tumor cell  lines which do not have genomic deletions of appropriate exons.  Our current studies are focused on WWOXÎ6 8  aberrant transcript.  We observed that WWOXÎ6 8  mRNA is frequently present in breast  cancer, at about 30% examined tumors. Our preliminary studies  suggest that at least in some fraction of tumors expressing WWOXÎ6  8, presence of this transcript can be associated with more aggressive  phenotype.

Quantitative analysis of methylation status at CpG  islands using PyrosequencingTM technology,P090.,"Pettersson , S. Eriksson, A. Alderborn","Pyrosequencing AB, Uppsala, Sweden","Methylation of cytosines at CpG dinucleotides is an epigenetic  modification of DNA that has profound effects in the mammalian  genome. The methylated status of CpG islands present in the  promoter region of a gene has a significant influence on its  expression. DNA methylation has been shown to play important roles  during embryonic development and X chromosome inactivation. In  addition, tumorigenesis is characterized by aberrant methylation  patterns resulting in, for example, silenced expression of tumor  suppressor genes. Methods for analysis of methylation patterns usually rely on bisulfi te  treatment of denatured DNA, which converts non methylated  cytosines to uracils. Since methylated cytosines are resistant to this  treatment, differentially methylated CpGs can, by this procedure, be  analysed as artificial C/T single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). PyrosequencingTM technology is a rapid and accurate real time  sequencing method for analysis of short to medium length DNA  sequences. Simultaneous genotyping of multiple SNPs can be accurately performed and the allele frequencies of several SNPs  in a pooled sample correctly quantified. In this study, we show that  Pyrosequencing technology is a fast and reliable method for the  detection and quantification of methylation differences at specific  CpG sites. Multiple closely positioned CpG sites are analysed  separately in one reaction and the degree of methylation at individual  CpG sites determined.",2003

","The use of anticancer drugs in appropriate combinations has led  to major improvements in the treatment of malignant disease.  Unfortunately, in many cases such success is limited by the  development of resistance to the chemotherapeutic drugs. Studies  with model cell lines have revealed that simultaneous resistance  to unrelated drugs, or multidrug resistance (MDR), can readily  develop in mammalian cells. This raises the possibility that similar  MDR tumor cells may also arise in vivo in human cancers, limiting  a patientâs response to chemotherapy. Our laboratory became  interested in studying MDR cell sub lines developed by treatment  of the T cell leukemia cell line CCRF CEM with increasing levels of  the anthracycline, epirubicin. The MDR phenotype is associated with  an expanded chromosomal region (ECR). We have been interested  in the nature of this extra DNA and the molecular events that give  rise to amplification. As part of these studies, we have compared  the content of the amplified unit in different derived E sub lines.  We microdissected this expanded region and PCR amplified the  chromosomal DNA in order to produce sufficient DNA to determine  its chromosomal origin and for use as a source of material to  investigate candidate drug resistance genes. We demonstrated  that the selection against epirubicin actually elevated the level of  the multidrug resistance associated protein (mrp) gene. The probes  prepared by chromosome microdissection should be useful for  studying the organisation and function of DNA sequences within the  ECR.

The patterns  of the karyotype alterations may provide insights into the genetic  pathways of disease progression. Results: We developed a simplified computer readable cytogenetic  notation (SCCN) by which chromosome findings are normalized  at a resolution of 400 bands. Lossed or gained chromosomes  or chromosome segments are specified in detail, and ranges of  chromosome breakpoint assignments are recorded. Software  modules were written to summarize the recorded chromosome  changes with regard to the respective chromosome involvement.  To assess the degree of karyotype alterations the ploidy levels  and numbers of numerical and structural changes were recorded  separately, and summarized in a complex karyotype aberration score  (CKAS). The SCCN and CKAS were used to analyse the extend and  the spectrum of additional chromosome aberrations in 94 patients  with Philadelphia chromosome positive acute lymphoblastic leukemia  (ALL) and secondary chromosome anomalies. Dosage changes of  chromosomal material represented 92.1% of all additional events.  Recurring regions of chromosome losses were identified. Structural  rearrangements affecting (peri)centromeric chromosome regions  were recorded in 24.6% of the cases. Conclusion: SCCN and CKAS provide unifying elements between  karyotypes and computer processable data formats. They proved to  be useful in the investigation of additional chromosome aberrations in  Ph positive ALL, and may represent a step towards full automation of  the analysis of large and complex karyotype databases.

CLL cells can be infected by EBV but cannot proliferate,  whereas normal resting B lymphocytes produce immortalized cell  lines after infection. We have investigated expression of cell cycle genes (p130, pRb, p27,  p21,) at the mRNA and protein levels in cultured B CLL lymphocytes  and in EBV transformed lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs). For  estimations of mRNA we have used RNAse Protection Assay; the  protein level was studied immunocytochemically. We observed increased levels of p27 mRNA in normal lymphocytes  compared to EBV infected B cells. B CLL nonstimulated cells  exhibited very high levels of p27 mRNA, decreasing slightly after  72h stimulation. P27 protein had nuclear cytoplasmic localization for  both B CLL cells and normal lymphocytes. P27 protein in LCL cell  was almost undetectable or localized in the cytosol. LCL showed  increased levels of p21 mRNA, but very low pRb and p130 mRNA  levels. Our data suggest that the mechanisms involved in EBV  transformation may include âsilencingâ of critical cell cycle genes pRb,  p130. A high level of p21 makes it possible to maintain the latency in  EBV infected cells. Our and other data imply that p27 mRNA levels  may be altered in a cell type specific manner. Increased expression  of p27 in B CLL cells may be a valuable marker responsible for the  inability of B CLL cells to undergo apoptosis.",2003

FA homozygotes have a high risk of developing acute  myeloid leukaemia (AML) and certain solid tumours. It is possible  that acquired FA gene inactivation may predispose to the sporadic  development of such malignancies. Methylation is a well recognised  mechanism of gene inactivation in human malignancy. We therefore  investigated FA gene methylation in AML patients samples and cell  lines by sodium bisulphite sequencing. FANCF  promoter methylation  was detected in an AML M7 cell line (CHRF 288) that was known to  have absent FANCF protein expression on Western blot analysis and  where sequencing of FANCF  had not revealed any mutations. FANCF   was unmethylated in blood from healthy individuals. Investigation of  FA gene methylation in sporadic adult AML samples did not reveal  further cases of methylation of FANCF  (36 patients examined), or  FANCA  (40 patients), FANCD2  (21 patients), FANCC,  E, or  G  (5 7 patients). FANCF is localised to chromosome 11p15.1, close  to 11p15.5, which harbours a large domain of imprinted growth  regulatory genes important in cancer. Although it is not known how  this process is regulated, the finding of FANCF  methylation raises the  possibility that regional silencing in this chromosomal domain may  include FANCF , leading to gene inactivation, disruption of the FA  pathway, genome instability and an increased risk of AML.",2003

We irradiated 33  (24 diagnostic and 9 relapse) paediatric ALLs with ionising radiation  (IR) and assessed p53 and p21 protein induction at 4 and 8hrs post  IR. In addition, we evaluated cleavage of the PARP1 protein, also  involved in the DNA damage response, which is cleaved early during  apoptosis. 10/24 (41.7%) diagnostic leukaemias showed a normal  p53 response and cleaved PARP1 by 8hrs post IR. 8/24 (33.3%)  showed defective PARP1 cleavage and normal p53 transcriptional  activation except one (4.2%), which showed defective p53 and  p21 upregulation, suggesting an upstream defect, e.g. ATM. 3/24  (12.5%) tumours exhibited normal PARP1 cleavage but reduced p21  induction after IR. 3/24 (12.5%) tumours had low levels of PARP1  with subsequent cleavage after IR. These also exhibited reduced  p21 induction, possibly due to low PARP1 protein, which post  translationally modifies p53 after DNA damage. Of these, one (4.2%)  carried a heterozygous TP53 G818C mutation. 3/9 (33.4%) relapse  tumours had an abundant p53 DNA damage response with normal  PARP1 cleavage. 5/9 (55.6%) had defective PARP1 cleavage after  IR, one (11.1%) with reduced p53 and p21 induction, suggesting  an upstream defect. Finally, 1/9 (11.1%) tumours had low levels of  PARP1 and p21 proteins. Defective cleavage of PARP1 suggests that  damage induced apoptosis is impaired in a subset of paediatric ALL.

The coexistence of aneuploid subclones in the same leukemic  population for all the five chromosomes suggest that all the  abnormalities observed in our B CLL patients are secondary events  occuring during disease progression. Statistical correlations were evidenced between 11q23, 13q14 and 14q32 deletions and patientsâ clinical characteristics: 14q32  deletion showed a significant association with the presentation age  (p=0.008); while 11q23 deletion was associated with the presence of  lymphoadenopathy (p=0.04), the need of chemotherapic treatment  (p=0.0002) and a shorter treatment free interval (p<0.0001).  Interestingly, the presence of 11q23 deletion was found to predict  rapid disease progression even in the patients with low risk stage at  diagnosis.

Here, we have investigated  the effects of PML on the dihydrofolate reuductase (DHFR) promoter,  which is mainly regulated by Sp1. On functional analysis, transient  transfection of PML into mammalian cells, U2Os and HeLa, resulted  in a significant repression of the DHFR promoter. The DHFR  promoter also contains DNA binding sites for the E2F transcription  factor. Transient transfections into the Sp1 negative D. Melanogaster   SL2 Cells, indicated that the repression of the DHFR promoter activity  by PML is achieved through the Sp1, but not the E2F DNA binding  sites of the promoter. When the Sp1 DNA binding sites were replaced  with an unrelated DNA binding site (GAL4), the repressive effects  of PML were lost, confirming the necessity of the Sp1 DNA binding  sites for PMLâs repressive effects. These data demonstrated that PML  could function as a negative regulator of the DHFR promoter, which  may represent a novel mechanism for the known repressive effects of  PML on cellular growth.Cancer Genetics84 85",2003

It seems a homeodomain gene, HOX11L2 at 5q35,  undergoes ectopic expression after juxtaposition with enhancers  posited in the far downstream region of a zinc finger gene, BCL11B  active in normal T cell development. However, this rearrangement  has yet to be documented clinically. We describe the karyotypes of  4 pediatric T ALL cell lines analysed using panels of BAC clones  covering the 5q35.1 and 14q32.2 regions revealing two homeobox  targets at 5q35 (NKX2E as well as HOX11L2). In all 4 cell lines  juxtaposition of homeobox genes with 3` BCL11B was effected  by submicroscopic insertions (<1Mb) rather than straightforward  translocations. Although a human retroviral element (HERV HD1)  was present close to breakpoints at 14q32.2, these were too widely  scattered to involve retroviral insertion. Interestingly, 2/4 cell lines  showed downregulation of BCL11B indicating that this gene is  not required to support the malignant phenotype unlike its close  homologue, BCL11A which is involved in B cell tumors.

Conventional cytogenetic analysis  in patients with translocation t(9;22) revealed also trisomy 11 and  isochromosome (17)(q10) in two CML patients, translocation t(2;22)  in an AML M6 patient, and translocation t(3;10) and trisomy 9 in  an AML M5 and in a Myelofibrosis patient, respectively. A 14 year  old patient with translocation t(15;17), displayed also translocation  t(3;8) in all metaphases in cytogenetic analysis. It can be concluded  that although FISH technique is essential in revealing specific  chromosomal alterations important in diagnosis, conventional  cytogenetic analysis maintains its role as a gold standard in detection  of secondary chromosomal alterations that are closely related with  the prognosis and management of haematological malignancies.",2003

All Polish NBS patients carry a homozygous  founder mutation, 657del5, within the NBS1 gene. The very high risk  of developing lymphoid malignancy among these patients at an early  age and relatively low frequency of that type of tumor by the age of  20 years in the general population in Poland, imply that heterozygous  carriers of the 657del5 NBS mutation should be more frequent  among cancer patients. In addition, the observation that close  relatives of NBS patients also have an elevated cancer risk suggests  a potential pathogenic role of NBS1 mutations in heterozygotes as  well. In order to investigate the role of the common founder mutation  657del5 in the pathogenesis of lymphoid malignancies of childhood  and adolescence we screened blood samples of 268 patients from 1 1  Polish pediatric hemato onclogy centers. Four heterozygous carriers  were found vs. approximately 1.5 expected. Germline 657del5  mutation was found in 1/125 patients with non Hodgkin lymphomas  (NHL), and in 3/143 patients with childhood acute lymphoblastic  leukaemias (ALL). In addition, 4 new NBS patients were identified  within that group. Our results, in contrast to earlier German studies,  clearly show a higher prevalence of the major NBS1 gene mutation,  657del5, among pediatric patients with lymphoid malignancies (~1/ 67) than in the general population in Poland (~1/190). Further studies  on possible involvement of the NBS1 gene in that type of cancer are  warranted.

","Primary cutaneous CD30+ large T cell lymphoma (CD30+ CTCL) is a  well defined subset of cutaneous lymphoma usually characterised at  presentation by solitary or localised skin lesions and good prognosis.  Although frequent spontaneous regression may be observed, skin  relapses occur frequently. The genetic changes involved in the  pathogenesis of CD30+ CTCL are largely unknown. Moreover,  no predictive marker for the risk of cutaneous relapse has yet  been identified. From this point of view, a systematic investigation  for chromosomal aberrations correlated with clinical outcome of  neoplasm is warranted. The purpose of our work was to investigate the cytogenetic  abnormalities involved in a series of CD30+ CTCL samples fulfilling  both the EORTC and WHO criteria, by the use of comparative  genomic hybridisation (CGH). CGH analysis revealed a non random distribution of chromosomal  imbalances between relapsing and non relapsing tumours. The mean  number of changes in non relapsing tumours was 0.33 (range, 0 1),  compared with 6.29 (range, 1 16) in relapsing tumours. The recurrent  chromosomes involved in relapsing cases were chromosomes 6  (86%), 9 (86%) and 18 (43%). While chromosome 9 was mostly  affected by gain, chromosomes 6 and 18 mainly contained regions of  loss, exclusively on 6q and 18p arms. Although further studies, such as microsatellite analysis, are  required to delimit the minimal deleted region, for the first time our  data pinpoint small chromosomal regions where putative tumour  suppressor gene(s) involved in the pathogenesis and the clinical  outcome of CD30+ CTCL may be located.",2003

First case : one patient out of 61 with CML at diagnosis exhibited  in all bone marrow cells, beside Ph chromosome, an extralong  marker originating from a translocation t(1;1)(p31;p36). The marker  was absent in peripheral blood cells, so that it is not a constitutional  change, but acquired, and possibly involved in leukaemogenesis. Second case : a 4 year old boy with B cell ALL showed in bone  marrow cells a derivative chromosome resulting from a translocation  t(7;9). Trisomy 7p and monosomy 9p resulted as a consequence of  this translocation. Usually, chromosome 7p anomalies are described  in T cell ALL. The translocation t(7;9)(pter p11;q11), generating 7p  trisomy, has not been reported by date, either in childhood or adult  ALL. We suppose that this chromosomal rearrangement does not  indicate a bad prognosis, because complete remission was rapidly  achieved after induction chemotherapy (FRALLE protocol).

Analysis of event free survival (EFS) revealed  significantly shorter survival in patients with complex chromosomal  rearrangements in high hyperdiploid cells in comparison to those  with only numerical changes (p=0,0002). Complex rearrangements  were always connected with rather fast progression of the disease  and poor response to the therapy, even in patients with primary good  pognosis.

The loss of genetic material in tumour cells is usually  indicative of the inactivation of tumour suppressor genes. The region  of 12p has been largely studied by molecular genetic and molecular  cytogenetic methods to identify candidate tumour suppressor genes  involved in leukemogenesis. The TEL/ETV6  gene is not a classical  tumour suppressor gene but is often deleted or rearranged in a  variety of hematological malignancies. In this study we present 10 patients with deletion del(12)(p) found by  conventional cytogenetic analyses in bone marrow cells. PatientÂ´s  diagnoses were either lymphoid or myeloid leukemias. We used FISH with the locus specific DNA probe LSI  TEL/AML1 (Vysis TM) to assess deletion of  TEL /ETV6  . To  excluderearrangements of 12p we examined two patients by  FISH with whole chromosome painting probe for chromosome 12  (CambioTM). Multicolor FISH (24xCyte, MetaSystems) was applied in  two patients with complex karyotypes. Deletion of TEL/ETV6  was found in five of eight patients examined.  No translocations of 12p were confirmed. The region closely linked to the TEL/ETV6  gene probably contains  one or more genes (tumour suppressors) which play a role in the  progression of oncogenesis. We suppose that in patients where  deletion of TEL/ETV6  is not confirmed, other genes with tumour  suppressor function were inactivated.

However,  during the evolution of the disease, additional cytogenetic and  molecular aberrations frequently occur. We present four patients  with Ph+CML and additional anomalies, for whom the cytogenetic  investigation was performed, after different therapeutic approaches,  from bone marrow samples using classical methods. The first case, received interferon Î± (IFN Î±) as sole therapy.  Alongside t(9;22) there were identified: +8, +6, +16,+17. The second case was treated with imatinib mesylate for 12 months,  in accelerated phase (AP). The cytogenetic investigation revealed  hyperdiploidy (47 51 chromosomes) with two Ph chromosomes plus  trisomy 8 and 9. The third case received IFN Î± along with chemotherapy and was  referred for karyotype investigation, in AP. Beside Ph, a derivative  chromosome 1, which seems to result from a complex translocation  involving chromosomes 1, 3, 8 and 9, was observed in all cells. W e  intend to apply FISH in order to elucidate this rearrangement. The fourth case developed AP after 30 months of IFN Î± associated  with chemotherapy and was treated with imatinib for 3 month prior to  karyotype examination. Apart of Ph, a small supernumerary marker  chromosome resembling G group was observed. Complex structural rearrangements may occur in CML in addition  to well known secondary chromosome changes and form marker  structures that require extensive analysis.

In  dental practice may be encountered a vast spectrum of clinical  manifestations in patients with isolated hypodontia. It is generally  assumed that variation in clinical phenotypes is cause by different  mutated genes. Two mutated genes, MSX1 and PAX9, causing  a few forms of human hypodontia, were identified. Intraoral and  radiographic examinations were performed. We analyzed phenotype  and inheritance pattern of the condition in 238 family members,  in two or three generations, of 18 probands. The permanent teeth  most frequently missing were upper lateral incisors, followed by  the maxillary third molars and mandibular second premolars. Less  frequently, hypodontia occured unilateral; the left side of the upper  arch was more involved. The absence of a maxillary lateral incisor  was often associated with a small peg shaped contralateral tooth.  Associated tooth number abnormalities were recorded. For many  clinical phenotypes, pedigrees and segregation analysis was suffi cent  to demonstrate genetic heterogeneity. In ten families the inheritance  pattern of the hypodontia confirms the autosomal dominant transmission with reduced penetrance and variable expressivity. Five  families showed an autosomal recesive manner of inheritance. Three  sporadic cases occured.

We present the unusual observation of an  iniencephaly case detected by ultrasound in the second trimester  of pregnancy in a 25 years old caucasian female. There was nos  consanguinity between her and her husband. Pregnancy was  terminated. The patient became pregnant soon after and miscarried  an anencephalic fÅtus at twelve weeks. Interestingly, among the  three live born boys of the patient, the oldest was referred at seven  years for shortness of the neck. Skeletal survey disclosed several  vertebral bodies fusions establishing the diagnosis of Klippel  Feil syndrome. Concurrence of these three malformations in the  same sibship is compatible with variable expression of a recessive  condition.",2003
Two sibs with sensorineural deafness and  apparently mild variant of Roberts syndrome,P146.,"Barisic , I. Petkovic, I. Sansovic","Childrens University Hospital Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia","Roberts syndrome (RS) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by symmetric limb defects, craniofacial abnormalities  including cleft lip/palate, somatic and developmental delay, and  a variety of other less common abnormalities. Limb defects vary  from the complete tetraphocomelia to mild growth deficiency. There are very few reports on mild clinical presentation, but even mild  cases exhibit at least minor limb involvement. Chromosomes of  RS patients often show characteristic cytogenetic phenomenon  called RS effect, premature centromere separation (PCS) or  heterochromatin repulsion, consisting of puffing or splitting apart of  the constutive heterochromatin around the centromeres, and splaying  of the acrocentrics and distal Yq. Here we present the results of  the cytogenetic and clinical investigation in two sibs, brother and  sister, with typical RS phenomenon in their cells, the brother having  additionally 47, XYY karyotype. The clinical presentation in both sibs  is highly atypical. Although they both have prenatal and postnatal  growth retardation, microcephaly, and mild developmental delay,  no limb involvement, no dysmorphic features, and no abnormalities  described in RS patients are observed, including hypoplastic nasal  alae and hemangiomata considered to be specifically associated  with mild cases of RS. On the other hand, they have a severe  sensorineural hearing impairment which has not been described  in RS patients. Cytogenetic analysis from both healthy parents  revealed normal karyotype with no evidence of PCS. We conclude  that our patients present either an unusual mild form of RS or a new  syndrome with RS effect consisting of severe sensorineural deafness,  growth retardation and mild developmental delay.",2003

He had serious bacterial infections and  inflammatory bowel disease. Analysis of the NEMO gene revealed  a nucleotide change in the consensus sequence of the splicing  donor site of exon 6 (gtGAG/gtGAA) which has not previously been  described in EDA ID. NEMO protein analysis in fibroblasts from an  affected male fetus showed a faint band corresponding to the 48 kD  normal NEMO protein. A 32kD protein revealed by NEMO antibody  which may represent the truncated version of the NEMO protein  was also observed. Analysis of IkBÎ± degradation showed that this  was strongly impaired in fibroblasts carrying the mutation. Three  female carriers were healthy, and had only subtle teeth anomalies.  One carrier had a completely skewed X inactivation with the normal  X as the active X chromosome, whereas the other two carriers had  a random X inactivation. This indicates that this mutation is not  deleterious enough to cause lethality in cells with an active mutant X  chromosome. The diagnosis in this family could easily be overlooked,  since one male only lived long enough to manifest tooth anomalies.  This family may represent a new phenotype within the EDA ID  disorders.",2003

Exclusion of candidate genes in a family affected  with arterial tortuosity syndrome,P150.,"Colombi1, R. Gardella1, N. Zoppi1, D. Assanelli2, L. Muiesan2, S.  Barlati1",1Dept,"Biomedical Sciences and Biotechnology, University of Brescia,  Brescia, Italy, 2Dept. Medical and Surgical Sciences, University of  Brescia, Brescia, Italy.   Arterial Tortuosity Syndrome (ATS) is a rare hereditary disorder  characterised by tortuosity and elongation of the major arteries, often  associated with pulmonary artery stenoses (MIM 208050). Some  patients also show excessively stretchable skin and joint laxity ,  suggestive of a connective tissue disorder such as Ehlers Danlos  syndrome (EDS). In the majority of the ATS families described, the  analysis of the pedigrees has suggested an autosomal recessive  transmission of the disease. We report an inbred Italian family in  which 5 patients show signs of ATS; in particular, a severe pulmonary  valve stenosis has been observed in one patient, while in all the  others arterial tortuosity and elongation of the main arteries were  present. In two of these latter patients, peripheral stenoses of the  main pulmonary artery have also been detected. In the ATS patients  signs typical of EDS were also observed: soft skin with an abundant  subcutaneous tissue and/or ecchymoses, joint laxity, hernias,  disorganisation of the extracellular matrix of fibronectin and of actin  microfilaments in skin fibroblasts. In order to ascertain the possible  involvement of genes responsible of EDS or other connective tissue  disorders, autozygosity analysis was performed for some of these  genes: COL1A1, COL2A1, COL3A1, COL5A1, COL5A2, COL5A3,  COL6A2, ADAMTS 2, ELN, FN1, TNXA, TNXB. The segregation  analysis excluded all these candidate genes from ATS in this family, indicating that ATS is a distinct entity differing from the so far  characterised EDS forms.

Genetic studies  in affected families have enabled identification of novel genes  important for normal brain development. We describe clinical,  neuro physiological and neuro radiological findings in three related  children from a highly consanguineous pedigree who present with a  characteristic phenotype. Subjects and Results:  Three children,(two male, one female),  each born of related, consanguineous parents presented with  congenital microcephaly and severe failure of postnatal brain growth.  Intractable epilepsy started in the neonatal period, characterised  by multiple seizure types. EEG showed high amplitude multi focal  epileptic discharges. Failure of pyscho developmental progress  was evident in each child with axial hypotonia, variable limb tone  and paucity of spontaneous movements. Muscle bulk was normal  with no development of joint contractures. Deep tendon reflexes  were variably present.All 3 children had severe visual impairment  with evidence of optic nerve atrophy, but no other ophthlamic  abnormalities. Ultrasound cerebral scans in the newborn period  showed similar features, confirmed later on MRI brain scans: severely  attenuated corpus callosum, brainstem and cerebellar hypoplasia,  simplified gyral pattern, lateral ventricle dilatation, (particularly  posteriorly), white matter changes consisting of subcortical and  periventricular cystic areas. Investigations included a normal  karyotype with no micro deletion of 17p13.3, normal CK and viral  studies and negative neurometabolic workup. Conclusion: We propose that the phenotype in this family represent  a new, autosomal recessive disorder of brain development.  Autozygosity mapping is planned which may facilitate identification of  the causative gene.",2003

Carriers of the mutation tended to be shorter than non carriers ( 0.91  vs â0.40, p=0.09), had a significant lower head circumference ( 1.00  vs +0.46, p=0.001) and a significant higher serum IGF I (0.50 vs  â0.29, p=0.04) compared to non carriers.

"," Adams Oliver syndrome (AOS) is defined by the combination of  limb abnormalities and scalp defects, often accompanied by skull  ossification defects. In this study, clinical analysis of 24 patients  belonging to 9 different families have been performed. This  revealed that in our patients, scalp abnormalities were most often  found, followed by limb and skull defects. The most common limb  abnormalities appeared to be brachydactyly, syndactyly of toes 2 and  3 and hypoplastic toenails. Additional features observed were cutis  marmorata telangiectatica congenita, cryptorchidism and cardiac  abnormalities. In an attempt to identify the disease causing mutations in our  families, we selected two genes, ALX4 and MSX2, which were  considered serious candidates based on their known function in skull  and limb development. These genes were then evaluated using a  combination of linkage analysis and mutation analysis. The linkage  analysis with intragenic and flanking markers allowed us to exclude  the involvement of ALX4 and MSX2 in a number of families. Mutation  analysis of both genes in the remaining families, performed by direct  sequencing of all coding regions, identified several polymorphisms,  but no disease causing mutations. We can therefore conclude that  the AOS in our set of patients is not caused by mutations in ALX4 Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology96 97 or",2003

Thoracic scoliosis requiring surgical correction  was described in one patient. Cervical spine anomalies are reported  only in two patients in the past, one of which had âmildâ dyplasia and  another was found to have âdysplasticâ cervical vertebrae. However ,  the spectrum of cervical spine anomalies and its clinical signifi cance  in patients with Dubowitz syndrome remains unclear. We report two pediatric patients with Dubowitz syndrome and  severe malformation of the cervical spine. Both patients had severe  dysplasia of the C1 vertebra with subluxation of C1, narrowing of  the spinal canal and bony impingement on the spinal cord. One of  patients presented with congenital torticollis, which led to discovery  of the cervical anomaly, while the cervical spine abnormality was  found in the another patient incidentally. Long term clinical follow up  is needed to determine clinical significance and outcome in these  patients. Congenital malformations of cervical spine might be more  common in this rare syndromic condition than originally thought and  clinical screening for vertebral anomalies is warranted.",2003

Trzeciak1","1University of Medical Sciences, Poznan, Poland, 2Hospital of Plastic  Surgery, Polanica Zdroj, Poland","Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS), the most common type of  mandibulofacial dysostosis, is an autosomal dominant disorder of  craniofacial development. While 40% of TCS cases demonstrated  previous family history, the 60% possibly arise from de novo   mutations of the  TCOF1  gene. This gene encodes a low complexity,  serine/alanine rich 1411 aminoacid protein, named treacle. Clinical  features included malar hypoplasia, micrognathia, coloboma of lower  eyelids, macrostomia, auricular defects and cleft palate. To date, 105  mutations of the TCOF1 gene have been described. The structure of the TCOF1  gene was investigated in 20 patients with  clinical symptoms of TCS and their 30 relatives. The DNA fragments  were amplified by PCR and were subjected to multitemperature  single stranded conformation polymorphism (MSSCP) analysis,  followed by real time PCR analysis and direct sequencing. In one  patient sequence analysis of the amplified exon 4 revealed on one  of the alleles an 18bp deletion (376delAAGGTGAGTGGGACTGCC).  Computer analysis of the 18bp deletion demonstrated that the novel  de novo mutation generated alternative splicing site and stop codon  resulting in premature termination of translation and truncation of  protein product from 1411 to 133 aminoacids. Amplification using  LightCycler system showed that the allele harbouring the 18bp  deletion revealed the second peak of melting temperature different  from that of the normal allele. We concluded that the TCS syndrome of our patient was probably  due to the haploinsufficiency of treacle. Real time PCR analysis might  provide a rapid screening assay for this mutation and might be easily  adapted to screen for other deletions in the TCOF1  gene.",2003

Both patients suffered from  severe mental retardation, borderline microcephaly, progressive  diffuse cerebellar atrophy, hypotonia, cerebellar tremors with reduced  spontaneous motility and hyporeflexia, retinitis pigmentosa, severe  post valvular aortic stenosis with very thin aortic arch, secondary  hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy, vescico ureteral reflux with  atonic bladder. The EMG was compatible either with first motoneuron  disease or peripheral neuropathy. The brain stem evoked potentials  showed unstable and delayed responses compatible with brain  stem abnormality. Swallowing function was lost by the end of the  first year. Dysmorphism consisted of deep set eyes with absence of  orbital fat, prominent forehead and abnormal fat distribution on the  cheeks but also on the hands, feet and mons pubis. Both girls died  of heart failure. The muscular biopsy was suspected for fat storage.  Cockayne sundrome, SCA2, SCA7 (including the form with extreme  repeat expansion), several disorders of fat metabolism (peroxisomal,  cholesterol precursors and  esthers, bile acids including cholestanol,  mitochondrial fatty acids, sphingolipids), CDG syndromes and  lysosomal disorders were excluded. Chromosomes and FISH at  22q11 locus were normal in blood and skin fibroblasts. Routine  analysis of point mutations and deletions in mtDNA was normal.  Two sibs and both parents are healthy. DNA analysis of SCA2 with  extreme repeat expansion is pending. Although the brain anomalies  are suggestive of a progressive pontocerebellar hypoplasia, the  association with eye abnormalities, dysmorphic features and a rare  congenital vascular abnormality rather suggest a separate syndrome.",2003

One of these BACs, RP11 32D17, produced a FISH signal  on both chromosomes 1q and 4p, while BACs with more telomeric  1q inserts were translocated to 4p. We then showed that the  translocation disrupts a 9 kb BamH1 digestion fragment subcloned  from RP11 32D17 and used as a FISH probe. This segment is  located within the ASPM gene, which was recently shown to bear  point mutations in patients with MCPH5 linked autosomal recessive  microcephaly.

A dense  correspondence of thousands of points on each of the faces is  computed and their co ordinates are subject to a principal component analysis (PCA). This reduces the number of variables from tens  of thousands to just 44 PCA modes, giving a compact model that  is computationally amenable to further analysis. A linear morph  between the average face surfaces of each subgroup gives a  dramatic 3D visualisation of dominant shape differences including  many identified previously: broad and square face shape; heavy  brow; close deep set eyes; and major nose and upper lip differences.

Developmental delay was evident since the  first months of life. At 2 years he developed generalized tonic clonic  seizures. Because of short stature, low growth velocity and delayed  bone age, at 4 years he underwent growth hormone (GH) evaluation.  Peak GH after two provocative tests revealed a partial GH deficiency.  Clinical observation at 7 years disclosed a facial appearance  resembling Seckel syndrome, with microcephaly, prominent eyes  and beaked nose. Brain MRI showed left temporal mesial sclerosis.

We report on a woman who presented with a clinical PWS  phenotype, but following molecular testing was diagnosed with  atypical AS. Microsatellite analysis in the proband showed biparental  inheritance of markers located within and outside of the AS/PWS  critical region. The combination of an abnormal methylation pattern  and biparental inheritance indicated that the cause of AS in the  proband was due to an imprinting mutation carried on her maternal  chromosome. Haplotype analysis showed that the proband and her Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology102 103 unaffected brother had inherited the same maternal chromosome,  suggesting that the imprinting mutation had arisen de novo  or that  the probandâs mother was a gonadal mosaic. A faint maternal band  on the probandâs blot was suggestive of mosaicism. Further analysis  showed that the child of the proband had also inherited the mutation  carrying grand maternal chromosome. The normal phenotype and  methylation of the child provides evidence that the proband was  a mosaic. This case report has identified another AS patient with  the PWS phenotype, has described the first case of a live born  unaffected offspring of an AS patient and has provided evidence  that these mild AS phenotypes are the product of de novo  imprinting  mutations resulting in cellular mosaicism.",2003

Methylation analysis for SNRPN exon 1 region performed by  Southern blot, and methylation specific PCR, showed a pattern  consistent with recurrence of PWS, but the FISH probe required  previously to demonstrate deletion in LT was no longer commercially  available. Confirmation of recurrence came from microsatellite  marker PAR SN, which maps 5 kb distal to SNRPN and lies inside  the deletion. This demonstrated 2 normal alleles in peripheral blood  DNA in both parents, but only a maternal allele in the CVS sample,  identical with LT. The couple chose termination of pregnancy.

A tiling microarray was constructed using sequenced golden path  clones from chromosome 22. DNA from patients with known 22q11  deletions confirmed by FISH analysis was labeled with Cy3 and  hybridized to Cy 5 labeled control DNA, either from a lymphoblastoid  cell line or from a pooled panel of DNA samples extracted from whole  blood. The labeled DNA was then co hybridized to the chromosome  22 tile path array. Ratio of intensities of test and control DNA was  calculated. We found that 22q11 deletions were readily detectable by this  method. Not all clones within the deleted region gave the expected 1: 2 hybridization ratio and it is likely that this is due to the high repeat  content of the region. Hybridizations to the control lymphoblastoid cell  line also showed an apparent duplication in the region flanking the  telomeric end of the deletion, at the immunoglobulin lambda variable  (IGLV) locus, that was not evident on repeat hybridization to the  pooled DNA samples. This âduplicationâ is likely to be due to deletion  at the IGLV locus in the B cell line used for control DNA.

Many (~40%) familial BWS cases have germline CDKN1C  mutations. However, most BWS cases are sporadic and UPD or  putative imprinting errors predominate in this group. Sporadic cases  with putative imprinting defects may be subdivided into (a) those  with H19 hypermethylation and silencing, and LOI of IGF2 in whom  it is postulated that there is a defect in a distal 11p15.5 imprinting  control element (designated BWSIC1) and (b) those with loss of  methylation at KvDMR1, LOI of LIT1 and variable LOI of IGF in whom  it is postulated that there is a defect at a more proximal imprinting  control element (BWSIC2).

Physically, WBS phenotypes include a dysmorphic  face, congenital heart disease (typically SVAS), growth retardation,  hyperacusis, premature ageing, and infantile hypercalcaemia. Up  to 25 genes have been identified within the critical region, however,  only hemizygosity for elastin is associated with a phenotype  (SVAS). Therefore, alone or in combination, some of the remaining  deleted genes appear to be responsible for the other features of  WBS. Generally, relations between genotype and phenotype in  WBS are studied at the group level with rather gross measures of  behavioural outcome, yet, much is to be gained by more in depth  cognitive studies. We have performed detailed cognitive analyses  on a number of WBS individuals to identify those which show higher  or lower functioning. One higher functioning patient (WBS HF)  has been genotyped using somatic cell hybrids and compared at  both molecular and cognitive levels with patients exhibiting classic  phenotypes or SVAS, to correlate genotype with phenotype. The  results show that despite above average scores for the syndrome,  WBS HF had the typical uneven profile of WBS and a characteristic  WBS chromosomal deletion. In contrast, the SVAS patients, with a  smaller deletion, displayed a normal profile suggesting that genes at  the telomeric end of the WBS deletion are important in causing the  WBS cognitive profile.",2003

We aimed to  characterize the syndrome in the UK population, define the mutation  spectrum, and assess the feasibility of a mutation screening strategy  for affected families. We identified 12 patients with TRMA: a prevalence of 1 per 5 million.  Sensorineural deafness presented at a median age of 7 months.  Non autoimmune, insulin deficient diabetes mellitus presented with  a median age of onset of 2 years, with a variable anaemia. Other  abnormalities included optic atrophy in 4 patients. Treatment with  thiamine reduced insulin requirements in 7 patients, but the effect  reduced over time. We identified mutations in the SLC19A2 gene in all patients: 3  nonsense, and one insertion mutation in the UK cohort and a novel  missense mutation in a non UK TRMA patient. No phenotype/ genotype relationships were observed, but the same mutation  appeared in 3 of the 6 UK families suggesting a founder effect and a  common ancestor. Childhood onset diabetes mellitus, deafness and a  variable anaemia are the best available diagnostic criteria for TRMA,  the differential diagnosis of which includes other inherited diabetes  syndromes. Screening of the SLC19A2 gene identified mutations in  all patients confirming the symptomatic diagnosis.",2003
Genetic variation of methylen tetrahydrofolate  reductase and methionine synthetase reductase genes in  Iranian patients with coronary artery disease,P219.,"Ghaedi , A. Aleyasin","National Research Center for Genetic Engineering and  Biotechnology, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran",Several studies showed that elevated plasma homocysteine is a  risk factor for coronary artery disease. Two common mutations in  the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene C677T  and A1298C are reported to be associated with decreased enzyme  activity in which homozygotes mutated genotypes accumulate  significant levels of non methylated folate derivatives. This study was  to analyze the frequency of these mutations in 100 patients with CAD  compared to the 100 normal control. The preliminary study shows the  higher prevalence of the mutation in the CAD patients compare to  the normal control in Iranian patients. Final statistical analysis in the  time of conference will show the prevalence and significance of these  mutations in studied cases compared to the normal control in Iranian  cases.,2003

Chromosomal abnormalities are the important cause of mental  retardation. In order to study the frequency of chromosomal  abnormalities and to determine the types of chromosomal  abnormalities that play a major role in the causation of mental  retardation, we recruited 427 moderate to severe mentally retarded  students (253 males and 174 females) from school for the mentally  retarded under parental consent during the period from November  1999 to December 2002. In our study, all metaphase chromosome  preparations were obtained from peripheral blood cultures and GTG  banded chromosomes were examined at a 500 to 550 band level. Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology108 109 The results revealed chromosomal abnormalities accounted for 23.89  % in the recruited students (102 cases, 44 males and 58 females).  Obviously, the number of 75 cases of Trisomy 21 (17.56 %, 33  males and 42 females) is a major contributor of mental retardation.  Three cases associated with sex chromosome abnormalities are  numerical (0.70 %, two 47, XXY and one 47, XXX), which may not  directly cause mental retardation. Among 24 cases of autosomal  abnormalities (5.62 %, 9 males and 15 females), involving deletion,  markers and translocations, 2 cases with cryptic rearrangements  are inherited from maternal balanced reciprocal translocations. In  conclusion, the total frequency of cytogenetic anomalies in afflicted  students is high. Still, conventional cytogenetic analyses remain the  simple, inexpensive and effective way of investigation in mentally  retarded patients.",2003

Material and methods : The children were admitted to the  Department of Pediatric Neurology of the Clinical Hospital Al.  Obregia, Bucharest for evaluation of a delayed psychomotor  development. They were included in a large study, part of a national  research program, which investigate the cytogenetic causes of MR  in children. First case, a six months old boy, showed: dysmorphic  features, hypotonia, sever psychomotor retardation. Cerebral MRI  revealed complex brain malformation, including agenesis of corpus  callosum, large ventricles. The second case, an eight year old girl,  showed: dysmorphic features, sever MR, hyperkinesias with self  injurious behaviors. The children were investigated cytogenetically by  karyotype with GTG banding. Results : In the first case, the cytogenetic investigation revealed  a deletion of the long arm of chromosome 1 at band q42. By our  knowledge this is the fifth case of del(1)(q42 qter) reported by now.  In the second case, the karyotype showed a partial trisomy 18pter  18q21. Conclusions : The chromosomal abnormalities are one of the most  important causes of MR.

Approach to rare chromosomal disorders under  the prism of minor dysmorphic features,P222.,"Sukarova Angelovska , M. Kocova, M. Krstevska Konstantinova,  G. Ilieva, V. Anastasovska","Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Minor dysmorphic features are defined as unusual morphogenetic  patterns that do not have medical importance for the individual, but  may be of great importance for syndrome recognition. Chromosomal abnormalities (numerical or structural) cause abnormal  morphogenesis of many organs and systems, as well as distinct  patterns of dysmorphic features. Such minor defects are present  to a variable degree in all chromosomal abnormalities. Some of  them, such as Down syndrome, are easily recognized, but in rare  chromosomal rearrangements it is difficult establish the diagnosis  only by dysmorphic signs. Children with different chromosomal rearrangements (except Down  and Turner syndrome) have been evaluated for the presence of minor  anomalies. Anomalies were divided into groups, according to the  location (face, ears, hair, neck, limbs, body, and skin). Most of them  were on the face (epicanthic folds, abnormal slanting paplpebral  fissures, micrognathia, facial asymetry), and hands (brachydactily ,  clinodactily, abnormal dermatoglyphs, etc.). The incidence of each  single minor malformation will be given. The number of these  anomalies per individual case will be correlated with the severity  of chromosomal change (deletion, duplication, translocation) and  particular chromosomes that are involved. Also, a correlation of the minor anomalies with the major anomalies (cardiopathies, brain  anomalies) will be made. Minor dysmorphic features, although not important for the individualâs  health, have to be recognized because of the possibility of an  underlying chromosomal or genetic disorder. Presence of three or  more of those signs isolated or together with major birth defects, can  raise the question of necessity of chromosomal analysis.",2003

One year of referrals for undiagnosed  developmental delay to South West Thames Department of Clinical  Genetics was analysed to establish the overall diagnosis rate and  observe the types of diagnoses that are being made. In addition the  data has been examined to ascertain any variables in the history or  examination that may predict the department findind an underlying  aetiology. The investigations undertaken have also been scrutinised  to see which are giving a high diagnostic yield. The overall rate for establishibg a firm diagnosis was 29% with an  additional 12% of patients having tentative or partial diagnoses being  made. It is not suprising that a genetics department is not diagnosing  Downs syndrome, but perhaps unexpected that there is only one  case of a microdeletion syndrome in the list of patient diagnoses. Analysis of features evident from initial history of examination  that predict an aetiology being established show the presence of  dysmorphic features and a milder level of delay to be the only factors  with positive predictive value. The presence of autistic features,  positive neurology (inc. microcephaly, macrocephaly, epilepsy) other  system anomalies (eg cardiac etc)were all found not to have any  predictive value in whether or not a firm diagnosis would be made.

","Rett Syndrome (RTT) is a severe neurological disorder affecting  exclusively females. Its prevalence is about 1 in 15,000 live borns  and it accounts for approximately 10% of severe mental retardation  in women. The clinical course of the disease is typical and consists  of a normal neonatal period followed by an arrest of the development  between 6 and 18 months of age. The patients show a number of  clinical signs indicative of a neurodevelopmental defect : arrest of  brain development, regression of acquisitions, and behavioural  troubles (stereotypic hand movement, autism). Mutations in the MeCP2 gene were identified in 70 80% of Rett  syndrome cases. The MeCP2 gene encodes a methyl CpG  binding protein that is expressed ubiquitously and acts as a global  transcriptional repressor through its interaction with mSin3A. Defects  in MECP2 function are thus expected to lead to the abnormal  transcription of a number of currently unidentified genes. To test this  hypothesis, we have performed global expression analysis using  cDNA microarrays. We have compared the expression level of 12.000  non redondant cDNAs and EST in five RTT lymphoblastoid cell  lines (mutations R168X, R255X, R270X, R294X and 608insA) and  two clonal cell lines expressing only the MeCP2 transcripts with the  R106W and R194X mutations. Several genes show a significantly  different expression level in RTT samples when compared to wild  type lymphoblastoid cell lines. These results are being confirmed by  Northern Blot analysis and we expect to identify a subset of genes  that are (directly or indirectly) regulated by the MeCP2 protein.",2003

In the three children under 3,  there was a striking and consistent broadness of the head and upper  face. The pattern of craniofacial dimensions was fairly consistent over  time, suggesting that the face in Rett syndrome follows the expected  sequence of age related changes.

Mutation  detection was achieved in 79% of classical and 25% of non classical  RTT patients, by conventional techniques. A novel mutation detection approach, called Multiplex Ligation  Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), was able to reveal a genomic  deletion not identified by direct sequencing of MECP2 coding, and  flanking intronic regions, in a 15 years old Italian girl with classical  RTT.In the patient and both parents, long distance PCR coupled with  long read direct sequencing of the entire MECP2 coding region, did  not reveal any mutation of the MECP2 gene, but identified in the  mother an heterozygous C >A transversion at 375 (1125), in exon 3.  An homozigous wild sequence is present in the father. RTT patient  shows only maternal allele with C >A substitution: we hypothesised  lack of entire exons in the RTT girl. MLPA technique (MRC Holland) is useful to reveal alterations of  genomic DNA escaping detection by conventional diagnostic tools.  This quantitative multiplex PCR approach was useful to determine the  relative copy number of each MECP2 gene exons. Deletion of exons  3 and 4 was confirmed in patient. This is the first demonstration of a deletion of entire exons of MECP2  gene; such large deletion escaped direct sequencing.

Recently, the identification of the Preserved Speech  Variant (PSV), where autistic behavior is usual, stressed the  phenotypic overlap between these two conditions. In 1999 it was  shown that about 80% of RTT cases have a de novo  mutation in  the transcriptional silencer MECP2  gene, classifying RTT as a  monogenic X L dominant disorder. Subsequently, we and others  provided evidence that this model was too simple and not sufficient  to explain why germline MECP2  mutations may result in X L mental  retardation in males while they may be silent in carrier females. On  the other hand, we and others have provided evidence that 15q11  q13 maternally inherited duplications are found in autistic children,  suggesting that an abnormal dosage of gene(s) within this region  might be responsible for A. Now we show that a proportion of RTT  patients are carriers of both a MECP2  mutation and a 15q11 q13  duplication and that other RTT patients are carriers of a MECP2   mutation and a 15q11 q13 duplication. Therefore, we hypothesize  a complex model in which a MECP2  mutation is necessary but not  sufficient to cause the RTT phenotype in females, based on the  status of a second gene which, at least in a proportion of cases, may  be abnormal dosage of one or more 15q11 q13 gene.

We report a mentally handicapped 4 year old boy and his unaffected  carrier mother. The propositus was born at term after a pregnancy  marked by diminished fetal movements and growth retardation.  Birth weight and head circumference were below, and length was at  the 10th centile. The baby was placid and showed axial hypotonia.  Milestones were delayed: sitting at 10 months, standing with help at  15 months, first words at 20 months. Independent walking has never  been achieved. Facial phenotype showed low set anteverted ears  and hair âcowlickâ. At 46 months, the child could no longer crawl nor stand. Seizures  with tonic limb movements, eye revulsion and loss of contact  were observed. Neurological examination revealed microcephaly,  stereotypic hand and hand to mouth movements, intention tremor,  head nodding, intermittent convergent strabismus, multidirectional  nystagmus, bruxism, absent speech, spasticity of inferior limbs with  hyperreflexia and bilateral Babinski sign. The patient and his unaffected heterozygous mother have a 44  bp truncating deletion in MECP2  (c1158del44 or 386fs388X). The  mutation arose on the grandpaternal allele.

The spreading of X inactivation in X;Y  translocations,P240.,"J. Sharp , P. Jacobs","Wessex Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom","We have studied 25 individuals with segments of either Yp or  Yq translocated onto the X. In each case we mapped X and Y  breakpoints, determined X inactivation ratios, performed expression  studies of translocated Y genes by allele specific RT PCR, and  attempted phenotype genotype correlations. Of 11 Y genes studied  only SMCY  was silenced by the spread of X inactivation. Consistent  with previous evidence suggesting that LINE elements promote  the spread of X inactivation, sequence analysis showed a marked  accumulation of LINEs within SMCY  relative to SMCX , in contrast to  other X Y homologues in which LINE content was relatively low. We  also observed that TMSB4Y  was expressed at approximately 10%  of the level of TMSB4X . This suggests decay of the Y homologue,  providing evidence that TMSB4Y /TMSB4X  is in the process of  evolving from an X Y gene pair escaping X inactivation to an X linked  gene subject to X inactivation. There was no apparent relationship between X inactivation ratios and phenotype in the five Yp translocations studied with hermaphroditism  or hypospadias. However, Y breakpoints in three were located only  30 70kb proximal to SRY. Although the translocated portion of Yp was  much larger in the two other cases, RT PCR showed that expression  of ZFY (located 170kb proximal to SRY) was disrupted in both  individuals. We hypothesise the presence of cryptic rearrangements  of Yp11.31 in these two cases, and suggest that incomplete  masculinisation in cases of X;Y translocation might be a result of  disruption of normal SRY expression by position effect, rather than X  inactivation.",2003

Using anti GABA antibodies, we show that  ARX is predominantly expressed in GABAergic neurons in the cortex,  suggesting that mutations in ARX alter their differentiation and/or  migration and thus potentially causing the seizure disorders observed  in humans. We also performed ARX wild type and mutant over  expression experiments in COS7 and PC12 cells, and found that the  different ARX mutations tested, including a poly alanine expansion,  do not modify the morphology of the cells even after nerve growth  factor treatment.

Our proband is a 15 years old female, third child of a normal couple.  There are no similar cases in the family. Pregnancy and birth:  uneventful. Postnatal development: delayed, with delayed and  abnormal tooth eruption. Measurements: short  limbed dwarfism (Ht  =  11.26 SD, Wt =  5.71 SD, OFC =  4.58 SD). Physical examination:  normal face, marked scoliosis, short limbs with prominent joints,  hyperextensible fingers and short nails. Radiographs: marked  scoliosis, short ribs, metaphyseal flaring, flattened irregular  epiphyses, short femoral neck with flat femoral head. Psychologic  examination: moderate mental retardation. Karyotype: normal.  Positive diagnosis of Metatropic dysplasia was based on the  typical clinical and radiological features. Differential diagnosis with  other bone dysplasias will be presented. The case presents with  the following particularities: abnormal and delayed tooth eruption,  abnormal proximal femoral extremity, short nails, moderate mental  retardation and delayed diagnosis. In conclusion, we present this case to illustrate a rare bone dysplasia,  to present some particularities and to discuss the importance of early  diagnosis.",2003
Long term follow up in a patient with metatropic  dysplasia,P254.,"Genevieve , M. Le Merrer, A. Munnich, P. Maroteaux, V. Cormier  Daire","DÃ©partment de GÃ©nÃ©tique, Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris,  France","Metatropic dysplasia (MD) is a rare chondrodysplasia characterised  clinically by short limbs with limitation and enlargement of joints and  usually severe kyphoscoliosis. X rays manifestations include severe  platyspondyly, severe metaphyseal enlargement and shortening of  long bones. The term âmetatroposâ means changing patterns in greek  and emphasises the evolutive changes in the body proportions of  patients with MD. The classification proposed by Beck et al, based on  the radiological anomalies, distinguish three different types: a lethal  autosomal recessive form, an autosomal recessive non lethal form  and a non lethal autosomal dominant form with less severe X rays  manifestations and better clinical outcome. Here, we report the clinical and radiological follow up of one of the  sporadic original cases described by Maroteaux et al, from birth to 30  years of age. At birth, X rays anomalies were consistent with the non  lethal autosomal recessive severe form but later on, X rays changes  were more consistent with the less severe autosomal dominant  form. A review of the literature showed the same overlap between  the different forms in a girl having a severe form of MD whereas  her father had a mild form of MD. We suggest therefore that the  distinction in three different types, especially in isolated cases, may  be questionable. Additional reports of long term follow up will help to better delineate the natural history of MD.",2003

Examination of FBN1 genotypes in families showed that some  individuals who were not mutation carriers had been assigned a  diagnosis of Marfan syndrome on the basis of minor clinical findings.  An international consortium revised the diagnostic criteria in 1996 to  minimise such misdiagnosis (De Paepe et al, Am J Med Genet, 62: 417 426). Since 1995 the Prince Charles Hospital in Brisbane has  run a multidisciplinary clinic for Marfan syndrome and all patients  have been assessed using these 1996 criteria. A diagnosis of  Marfan syndrome has been extremely difficult to assign, with only  50% of over 100 index cases fulfilling the criteria, although many  had involvement of a number of systems. We evaluated two large  pedigrees using the 1996 criteria. In each family DNA analysis  (haplotyping plus mutation analysis in family 1 and haplotyping in  family 2) was used to identify mutation carriers. The clinical status  of family members was assessed without knowledge of mutation  status. Several mutation carriers failed to meet the criteria. Our  examination of these families highlighted anomalies and difficulties  in applying the diagnostic criteria. Application of the strict criteria for  Marfan syndrome in the absence of DNA analysis may fail to identify  some individuals who are mutation carriers and who may be at risk of  developing serious complications of Marfan syndrome and of having  affected children.",2003

Because most cases of CS  are sporadic, conventional linkage studies to identify human genes  are not feasible. Using synteny conservation, a systematic review of  mouse mutations with skeletal, tail, or neuromuscular phenotypes  with the goal of identifying potential human candidate genes for CS  was performed. A search of the Mouse Genome Database (MGD) was performed for  âgenes, markers, and phenotypesâ in the categories âneurological and  neuromuscular,â âskeleton,â and âtail and other appendages.â An OMIM  search was performed to determine whether each mouse locus has  a known human homologue, and if so was accorded candidate gene  status. Linkage maps of the chromosomes carrying loci with possibly  relevant phenotypes but without known human homologues were  examined in order to identify documented synteny conservation  between the mouse and human genomes in the region surrounding  such loci. Mouse loci mapping to regions in which synteny is not  well conserved or mapping close to syntenic region endpoints were  excluded. We then used the Genome Database (GDB) world wide  web sites to identify human genes mapping within ~5% of the map  position specified by the synteny map. Searching MGD by phenotypic category yielded 100 mutants, of  which 66 had been mapped, including phenotypes of scoliosis, kinky  or bent tails, other vertebral abnormalities, or disturbances of axial  skeletal development.

","Deletion of 2q37.3, the telomeric region of chromosome 2q, is  associated with an Albright hereditary osteodystrophy like syndrome.  It is characterized by developmental delay, hypotonia, facial  dysmorphism and shortening of the metacarpals and metatarsals.  Additional features may include obesity, short stature, strabismus,  eczema, sparse or coarse hair and autism or other behavioral  disturbances. The deletions have traditionally been studied by  conventional cytogenetics, FISH and microsatellite analysis, but  these methods offer limited resolution. To better define the commonly  deleted region, we have developed new assays for systematic  assessment of gene dosage across the 2q37.3 region by multiplex  amplifiable probe hybridization (MAPH) and quantitative real time  PCR (Q PCR). The MAPH assay covers 20 known genes and 5  microsatellite loci from 2q37, together with 8 control loci, in two  hybridizations. Selected genes were also analyzed by Q PCR. Known  deletion and deletion/duplication patients were used as controls  for verification. Previous microsatellite results were confirmed in all  cases. Furthermore, significant refinement of the proximal breakpoint  was achieved in one deletion patient. We have subsequently used  MAPH to exclude major deletion in another patient with an AHO  like phenotype in whom multiple microsatellites were uninformative.

Analysis of a wider  panel of patients is ongoing to further narrow the commonly deleted  region and to search for microdeletions that might pinpoint the  candidate gene(s) responsible for this phenotype.Cytogenetics120 121",2003
Monosomy 1p36: Report of first two patients from  Saudi Arabia and review of the literature,P271.,"D. A. Al Sayed , A. Iqbal, N. Sakati","King Faisal Specialist Hospital & Research Center, Riyadh, Saudi  Arabia","Monosomy 1p36 is a common relatively newly delineated contiguous  gene deletion syndrome. The syndrome is characterized by  hypotonia, severe developmental delay, growth abnormalities, and  craniofacial dysmorphism. We describe two patients with monosomy  1p36 who were referred to our institute and compare their features  with cases of pure monosomy 1p36 previousy described in the  literature. The first patient was referred to our institute at the age of  11 months with global developmental delay primarily to investigate  for neurometabolic eitiology. The second patient was referred at 4  months of age for patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) ligation. The clinical  features of both patients included postnatal growth delay, motor  delay, hypotonia, mental retardation, microcephaly, large anterior  fontanelle, low set ears, flat nasal bridge, long philtrum, seizures,  and congenital heart defect and the chromosomal breakpoint was at  1p36.2. The above features were fairly consistent with the discription  in the literature, however both patients were seen by multiple  specialites and many unneccessary investigations were done before  reaching the final diagnosis. Furthermore, chromosomal analysis  done for the second patient at an oustside institute was reported to  be normal. In conclusion we hope that our observation of this specifi c  1p36 phenotype in Saudi Arabia should assist in clinical diagnosis  of this chromosomal abberation since the condition is likely to be  underrecognized and commonly missed on routine chromosomal  analysis especially in less experienced laboratories.",2003

However, the resolution of genome wide  screening methods such as chromosome analysis and CGH remains  comparatively low. In order to increase resolution, we developed a modified CGH  protocol using fresh high quality metaphases slides and chemical  labeling and tested the method on 9 previously identified cases with  cryptic chromosome aberrations. Seven of the cases consisted of  subtelomeric rearrangements; 5 unbalanced translocations, one  derivative chromosome and one terminal deletion, and two cases  had interstitial deletions. Thirteen of the fifteen aberrations could be  detected by this modified CGH, including a terminal deletion, size  mapped using BAC and PAC clones to 2.1 Mb. Two subtelomeric  aberrations size mapped to 1 and 1.3 Mb respectively could not be  detected. The subtelomeric regions have been the most difficult to evaluate  using CGH. This modification of CGH thus improved the resolution,  also in the subtelomeric regions and can be used as a screening  method for genome wide chromosome imbalances in individuals with  idiopathic mental retardatio",2003

Subtelome  ric screening offers high sensitivity but is confined to chromosome  ends, while HR CGH enables whole genome screening albeit at  lower sensitivity. In order to suggest a scheme for the most beneficial  use of these techniques for investigation of mentally retarded and  dysmorphic individuals, we performed a prospective study, which  included 100 patients investigated by both subtelomeric FISH and  HR CGH. We present the results of this study, which showed that HR CGH  was superior to subtelomeric FISH in detecting submicroscopic  chromosome aberrations. More aberrations were detected by Cytogenetics120 121 HR CGH and the majority of the aberrations were interstitial. We  concluded that, except for familiar cases, HR CGH should be offered  as a first choice for investigation of mentally retarded and dysmorphic  patients with normal karyotypes and for whom known syndromes are  excluded.

This has proven to be a useful  technique for detecting rearrangements that are not visible on  traditional cytogenetic analysis. Genzyme Genetics has performed  over 2000 subtelomere FISH analyses using the ToTelVysion  multi color FISH probe panel from Vysis, Inc. (Downers Grove,  IL). In our laboratory, approximately 4.4% of specimens have an  abnormal subtelomere FISH result. The clinical implications of these  findings are not always clear; approximately 1.1% of probands have  subtelomere rearrangements that have been inherited from a parent  reported to be phenotypically normal. These rearrangements are  therefore possibly normal variants with no clinical significance. The  remaining 3.3% of specimens have an abnormal subtelomere FISH  result that is assumed to be clinically significant.

More recently, Giglio  et al. identified these inverted repeat sequences as belonging to the  olfactory receptor (OR) genes family.

The subtelomeric 18q deletion syndrome including  SALL3 is the cause of Rasmussen Syndrome,P282.,"Moncla1, c. Missirian2, M. Soulier2, N. Philip1","1HÃ´pital Timone Enfants, Marseille, France, 2Timone Enfants,  Marseille, France","Since the development of effective assay for screening all  subtelomeric regions in mentally retarded patients, we have  developed an alternative strategy. Our hypothesis is that each  pure subtelomeric deletion is associated with one specific clinical  phenotype. Previous data demonstrated that deletion of the distal  bands of some chromosomes has been recognised as the cause of  characteristic clinical syndrome. Examples included Wolf Hirshhorn  syndrome and 4p16.3 deletion, Miller dieker syndrome and  17p13.3 deletion. High resolution analysis have also improved the  identification of subtelomeric chromosomal syndromes and allowed  to clearer definition of clinical phenotype (1p36.3 deletion, 2q37.3  deletion). We have undertaken an extensive review of all distal  chromosomal deletion reported in the literature and in our personal  experience to delineate the associated phenotype spectrum. This  study permit to create a âcatalogueâ of specific phenotype associated  with deletion of virtually all subtelomeric regions. This approach led us to identify on clinical orientation the first cryptic  deletion of the 18q23.3 qter sub band only detectable using a specifi c  18q subtelomeric probe by FISH. The male patient exhibited three  main manifestations of the 18q  syndrome including the characteristic  facial dysmorphism, hearing loss with external auditory canal atresia and vertical talus. Interestingly, this clinical association was also  described by Rasmussen in 1979 as a distinct syndromic entity with a  probable autosomal dominant inheritance. The localisation of SALL3 in this region, its expression in limb buds,  otic vesicle during human embryonnic development suggested that  the haploinsufficiency for this gene might be responsible of both  18qter deletion and Rasmussen syndrome.",2003

We describe cytogenetic, molecular cytogenetic and clinical data of  a constitutional de novo derived apparently balanced CCR which  involves multiple translocations of five chromosomes, 1, 2, 11, 13  and 18 with six breakpoints altogether. It was identified in a newborn  male followed up until the age of two years who presented with  mental retardation, short statute due to limbs rhizomelia, dysmorphic  features, congenital heart disease and cryptorhid testes. Routine  cytogenetics, FISH analysis with whole chromosome paints probes  of chromosomes 1, 2, 11, 13 and 18, multicolor FISH and multicolor  banding studies specified the following derivative chromosomes:  der(1) t(1;13)(pter>q31::q?31>qter), der(2)t(2;11)(qter>p16::q24>qter), der(11)t(11;18)(pter>q13::q12.1>qter), der(13)t(2;13)(pter>p16::q?31>pter), der(18)t(1;11;18)(qter>q31::q13>q24::q12.1>pter).

Clinical features of this chromosomopathy include  a distinctive dysmorphic appearence, developmental delay, growth  retardation, and in some cases, abnormalities of extremities, renal,  cardiac and ocular anomalies. Here we report on the boy with intrauterine growth retardation,  psycho motor retardation, dysmorphic facial features, toe anomalies,  right choanal hypoplasia, coloboma, micropenis and other genital  anomalies, bilateral renal hypoplasia and initial chronic renal failure. The chromosome analysis of the proband showed a male karyotype  with the derivative chromosome 13 : 46,XY,der(13). Both parents  have normal karyotypes. Fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) using whole chromosome  painting probes (Chromoprobe Multiprobe OctoChrome System,  Cytocell) and subtelomeric DNA probes (Chromoprobe T, Cytocell)  identified the additional material on the long arm of derivative  chromosome 13 as to be derived from the distal part of the long  arm of chromosome 10.

A new case of partial trisomy 16q,P291.,"Petkovic , I. BariÅ¡ic, L. Morozin","University Childrenâs Hospital Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia","Trisomy 16q is a rare condition in livborne infants. Some 28  cases have been reported and most cases are due to unbalanced  translocation. Clinical presentation is not well defined because it is  usually associated with loss or gain of an other chromosome involved  in the rearrangement, while duplications are quite rare. In this report we present the results of clinical and cytogenetic  investigation in 10   years old girl. Clinical examination showed  dysmorphic traits including hypoplastic supraorbital ridges,  epicantus, dysplastic, low set ears, full cheeks, thin lips, micrognatia.  Her somatic and intelectual development were within normal  range, although she experianced learning difficulties, mostly due  to behavioural problems, aggressiveness and disobedience.  Cytogenetic analysis was performed on peripheral blood culture of  the patient and her parents. Both parents presented with normal  karyotype, while cytogenetic analysis in the proband identified  an extra GTG positive band in the long arm of chromosome 16. FISH with chromosome 16 painting probe stained the aberrant  chromosome completely. Analysis thus suggested the duplication of  the long arm of chromosome 16 most probably involving 16q13  >q22  region. It has been proposed that the duplication of the distal long arm  segment may cause typical features of trisomy 16q, including short  survival. On the other hand, the comparison of our patient to other  reported cases revealed that trisomy for the proximal segment of  the long arm of chromosome 16 may be associated with mild clinical  presentation and behavioural problems as a major manifestation.

Identification and molecular characterization  of a de novo balanced translocation associated with  polymicrogyria.,P292.,"Cantagrel1, C. Missirian2,1, C. Cardoso1, N. Philip2,1, A. Moncla2,1,  L. Villard1","1Inserm U491, Marseille, France, 2Dpt. of Medical Genetics, Timone  Childrenâs Hospital, Marseille, France.   ","Polymicrogyria is a malformation of the human cerebral cortex which  is characterized by an abnormal organization of neurons within  cortical cell layers leading to an excessive number of small gyri.  This anomaly belongs to the group of cortical dysplasias which are  responsible for a significant number of developmental disabilies often  accompanied by epilepsy. We present clinical, cytogenetic and molecular data for a 33 weeks  old female fetus. This fetus is the product of a pregnancy terminated  following identification of severe brain malformations and the  presence of a chromosomal rearrangement. The fetus presented  with a polymicrogyric cortex (predominantly in the posterior areas),  heterotopic nodules throughout the white matter and hydrocephaly .  Bilateral ventricular dilatation and syndactyly were also present. The  brain malformations, strongly suggestive of a neuronal migration  defect, were found to be associated with a de novo balanced  translocation t(2;7) (q36;p22). We hypothesize that one of the translocation breakpoints disrupts  a gene causing the observed neuronal migration defect. In order to  clone the translocation breakpoints, we performed fluorescent in situ  hybridation (FISH) experiments using bacterial artificial chromosomes  (BAC) clones as a probe. Once cloned, the breakpoint region will  be analyzed to determine if a gene is interrupted by one of the  translocation breakpoints. We believe that the identification of such a  gene will improve our understanding of the mechanisms responsible  for the organization of the normal human cerebral cortex.",2003

The results allowed to exclude that the  enlargement on the suspect chromosome was due to a centromere  or p arm  polymorphism, an enhanced NOR region or Yq12 derived  additional material. As M FISH was unable to resolve the nature of  the rearrangement, the case was studied by glass needle based  microdissection and reverse painting. As a result, the region p22.2  pter on both homologous chromosomes 6 was painted with the  microdissection derived probe. The presence of a partial trisomy 6p  was proven by multicolor banding, too.

Bioinformatic analysis showed two candidate genes that are  likely involved in the rearrangement: SEC15B  for chromosome  2 breakpoint and TEM6  for chromosome 7 breakpoint. TEM6   shows significant sequence identities to tensin 1, a focal adhesion  phosphoprotein, expressed in many different tissues during  embryogenesis. Interestingly, tensin 1 knock out mice show a  progressive kidney degeneration. Experiments at molecular level are  in progress to better elucidate the role of SEC15B  and TEM6  in the  pathogenesis of phenotype in the patient.",2003

A de novo structural aberration of the  long arm of a chromosome 3 which proximally contained additional  material of unknown origin was diagnosed. Fluorescence in situ hybridizations (FISH) were performed with  a whole chromosome painting probe (wcp 3, commercial probe)  and with arm specific probes (pcp 3p, pcp 3q; NIH, Bethesda). A  heterologous insertion was excluded and the additional material  demonstrated to originate from 3q. In order to further characterize the  duplicated interstitial region, hybridizations with a number of yeast  artificial chromosome (YAC) probes (CEPH library; MPI, Berlin) were  performed. The breakpoints of the duplication were narrowed down to  the chromosomal regions 3q12~q13 and 3q21~q22, respectively. The  karyotype of the patient could thus be delineated: 46,XY,der(3).ish  dup(3)(q12~13q21~q22) (wcp3+,pcp3q+,744e02+,939d05+,949c10+ +,967f11++,967h01+).

Homologies of human chromosome 9p  subtelomere,P310.,"Kasai , M. A. Ferguson Smith","Department of Clinical Veterinary Medicine, University of Cambridge,  Cambridge, United Kingdom","Chromosome rearrangements are caused by mechanisms such  as inversions, translocations, duplifications, fusions, fissions and  insertions. These changes are involved not only in human diseases  but also in karyotype evolution. Some of these rearrangements have  occurred at telomeric regions and led to new telomeres or loose  telomeres through evolution. As a result, the genome structures at  telomeres have been changed due to the rearrangements. Telomeres  are at the end of chromosomes and are essential to prevent fusions  between chromosomes and keep chromosome structure stable.  Subtelomeres, adjacent to telomeres, are known to have some  relation with diseases such as a mental retardation. Normally  subtelomeric probes consisting of single copy DNAs are used to  identify specific telomeres. Some of subtelomeric markers, however,  are not specific and show homologies between subtelomeres of  different chromosomes. One BAC clone studied here shows its FISH  signals at human chromosome 9p subtelomere, 9 pericentromeres  and 2q13. As human chromosome 9 pericentromeres and 2q13  derived from subtelomeric regions, these homologies might have  resulted from chromosome rearrangements through evolution. In  this study, a cDNA which has homologous sequence in the BAC  clone has been identified. Homologies in the human genome can  be analyzed based on the database, but the original locus is not  certain. In order to investigate the origin of the homologies, the cDNA   was examined in primates by FISH and the signal was identified.  Comparative mapping at subtelomeres will help us to understand the  process of chromosome rearrangements.",2003
The INSL3  LGR8 /GREAT  ligand receptor pair in  human cryptorchidism,P311.,"Ferlin , L. Bartoloni, G. Rizzo, C. Vinanzi, A. Bettella, C. Foresta","University of Padova, Padova, Italy","Introduction.  Testicular descent is a complex multistep embryonic  process requiring the interaction between anatomical and hormonal  factors. Failure in any of these steps results in cryptorchidism, the  most frequent congenital anomaly of the urogenital tract in human  males. Evidence for a genetic cause for cryptorchidism is numerous  and supported by animal models. In particular INSL3  and LGR8 / GREAT  proteins seem to act as ligand and receptor, respectively, and  to have a role in gubernaculum development involved in testicular  descent. Methods . In a cohort of 87 ex cryptorchid patients and 50  controls, we looked for mutations in INSL3  and LGR8 /GREAT  genes  by sequencing. Patients were classified on the basis of seminal,  hormonal and testicular cytological analyses. Results . We found 3  mutations in the INSL3  gene in four patients and one LGR8 /GREAT   mutation in four patients (8/87, 9.2%). The eight patients show  different phenotypes, ranging from normozoospermia to complete  azoospermia, and from bilateral cryptorchidism to retractile testes.  Furthermore, the endocrine function of the testis appears normal  in all subjects. Mutations were maternally inherited. Discussion .  The findings of our study demonstrate that INSL3  LGR8 /GREAT   mutations are a frequent cause of human cryptorchidism, and are  maternally inherited. The only clinical consequence of alterations of  the INSL3  LGR8 /GREAT  system seems to be failure of the testis to  normally descend in the scrotum during embryonic development,  without affecting the spermatogenic and endocrine components of  the testis itself. Further studies would clarify the molecular events  involved in INSL3 LGR8/GREAT interaction as well as possible  interaction with other factors implicated in testicular descent.Cytogenetics128 129",2003

Hughes","University of Cambridge, Paediatric department, Cambridge, United  Kingdom","Androgen insensitivity syndrome (AIS) is caused by defects in the  androgen receptor (AR). The complete form (CAIS) is manifested  by a normal female phenotype. The AR gene comprises exons 4 8  coding for ligand binding domain (LBD), exon 1 for transactivation  and exons 2 3 for DNA binding. We studied 120 patients with CAIS. The majority of these patients  presented with inguinal hernia (60%), 11 presented with primary  amenorrhea; 14 were related to positive family history, and 3 were  diagnosed antenatally. 20 had an hCG stimulation test; median  testosterone rise was 10.8 nmol/L. Genetic screening was done in 91 patients; 80% had mutations  in the AR gene. The spontaneous mutation rate was 10%. The  majority were missense mutations; 9 had nonsense mutations; 8  had deletions (one complete gene deletion), one duplication and one  insertion. Most of missense mutations were in the LBD, and 67% of  nonsense mutations were seen in exon 1. We conclude that inguinal hernia is the commonest presentation of  AIS in children; a karyotype is not currently routine for this surgical  problem. We recommend an hCG test in support of the diagnosis,  and to exclude an androgen biosynthetic defect. Exons 4, 5, 7 are  preferential sites for missense mutations. The minority of CAIS  patients in whom no demonstrable gene mutation is found may have  a defect in RNA processing or in AR expression.",2003

The correlation between genotype  (SRY +/ ), respectively breakpoint in Yp, and phenotype is still  unclear. Aim: to analyse genotype â phenotype correlation in our patients. Patients: 3 patients (46,XX males): 2 phenotypically normal males  [14 ys (A) and 15.2 ys (B)] with small intrascrotal testes; 1 boy  [C],(2.5ys), with Prader IV external male genitalia. Methods: clinical examination; endocrine testing (T, DHT, FSH, LH,  17OHP, DHEA, AD, ACTH, hCG stimulation in all patients, GnRH  stimulation in the pubertal patients); pelvic and testicular ultrasound;  genetic testing (karyotype analysis, X Y FISH and Yq11 multiplex  PCR) after informed consent in all patients; gonadal biopsy in patient  C. Results: Endocrine status was normal in all 3 patients except low  GnRH response in patients A and B. In patient B puberty was  delayed. Pelvic ultrasound revealed normal internal male genitalia in  all patients; the testicular biopsy, performed only in patient C, showed  germinal and Sertoli cell hypoplasia. Genetic studies confirmed the  46,XX karyotype. FISH analysis for Y fragments on Xp was positive  in 2 patients and negative in patient C. The Y positive patients were  also positive for the SRY locus and negative for the complete Y long  arm (Yq11). Conclusions: Our observations in this small number of cases  suggest that Y specific material on the X chromosome results in a  more masculinized phenotype. In the intersex patient, incomplete  masculinisation without SRY suggests a mutation of one or more  downstream non Y testis â determining genes.",2003
Analysis of the SRY gene in 40 Turner syndrome  patients from the Macedonian population,P314.,"Papazovska , S. Koceva, M. Kocova","Pediatric clinic, Skopje, The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia","Turner syndrome is characterized by short stature, gonadal  dysgenesis, variety of somatic features and malformations of internal  organs. Half of the patients have a 45,X karyotype while others have  structurally abnormal sex chromosomes or mosaicsm with other cell  lines including 45,X/46,XY. Patients with Y chromosomal material are  susceptible to developing gonadoblastoma or dysgerminoma later in  life. The SRY gene on Yp has a major role in sexual differentiation,  being the primary testicular determinant. Detection of SRY gene  in Turner syndrome patients with or without sex chromosome  mosaicism has important clinical and therapeutical implications. We performed a genetic study in 40 Turner syndrome patients. The  investigation consisted of two phases: cytogenetics and PCR for the  SRY gene using two primer sets. Cytogenetics identified a 45,X karyotype in 50%, isochromosomes in  25%, proximal long or short arm deletions and markers in 7.5% and  45,X/46,XY in 5% of patients. SRY gene was detected in blood leucocytes of 2 patients with 45,X/ 46,XY karyotype. All other patients were SRY negative including one  ovary extirpated due to endometrial malignancy. We showed low incidence of SRY positive results in Turner syndrome  patients 5%. Other studies using more sensitive techniques have  detected higher percent of SRY positive patients. Due to increased risk of gonadoblastoma and necessity of timely  referral for gonadectomy, analysis of SRY should be offered to all  Turner syndrome patients regardless of karyotype.",2003

Rearrangements involving Chromosome 1 and  Male Infertility,P317.,Crocker,"Churchill Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom","A survey of chromosome rearrangements identified in the Oxford  region through male infertility showed a surprising bias towards  those involving chromosome 1. Total referrals were 1086: 947 normal  male karyotype, 108 Klinefelter and mosaic Klinefelter, 17 other sex  chromosome abnormalities, and 14 autosomal rearrangements. Of  these 14 rearrangements, eight involved chromosome 1. Six of the  seven reciprocal translocations involved chromosome 1 (breakpoints  p21.1, p13, p10, q12, q21.1, q24.1). There was also a pericentric  inversion of chromosome 1 (p36.1q21.3) and a partial duplication of  1q (q12q21.3). There appeared to be no specific breakpoint region  within the 1 and thus a single gene effect seems unlikely. These  highly significant findings add to the previously reported association  between pericentric inversions of chromosome 1 and male infertility .  The previously reported pericentric inversions associated with meiotic  arrest showed partial or complete asynapsis within the inversion.  It is hypothesised that even in normal individuals the large size of  the chromosome 1 bivalent creates physical stresses when pairing  occurs and the presence of a large heterochromatic block within it  further destabilises the pairing. This may be tolerated when there  are no other factors involved, but a structural change involving  chromosome 1 adds to the difficulties of pairing and thus there is a  tendency for asynapsis to occur in or around the rearrangement. The  asynaptic regions may either disrupt pairing of other autosomes or  the formation of the sex vesicle and thus cause meiotic arrest.",2003

To determine association with azoospermia and  chromosome anomaly, we assayed the chromosomal condition of  azoospermic men and in normospermic men as controls. Materials & Methods : We studied 45 azoospermic men who had  no spermatozoa in their ejaculated semen samples and 40 men who  had semen samples with normal semen parameters by WHO 1999  criteria. Peripheral blood lymphocytes were collected and cultured  in Hamâs F10 supplemented with 10% HSA with PHA for 60 72 hrs.  Chromosomal spreads were obtained by standard methods. The  karyotype was arranged and analysed using CytoVision Ultra ver.4.0  from Applied Imaging. Results:  Of the 45 patients, 22 were azoospermic and 23 had severe  oligospermia <5x106/ml, mean + SD 4.3 + 1.2 x 106/ml. G banding did not reveal any structural abnormalities in either the case or  control groups. In the case group, 10 samples analysed as Klienfelter  syndrome (47,XXY, n=6, and mosaic 47,XXY/46,XY, n=4). There  were no numerical anomalies in the control group, who had a mean +  SD pserm count of 65 + 12 x 106/ml. Conclusion : Since chromosomal aberrations are encountered more  frequently in azoospermic and severely oligospermic infertile men,  cytogenetic analysis of the male prior to ICSI is recommended.",2003

Significant increase in the  XX and XY disomy incidences were observed in paternal origin KS  group. These differences were due to an increased frequency of  sex chromosome disomies in one of the father (33 years old) who  had a karyotype 46,X,r(Y)/45,X.

Results:  We paid special attention to prior reproductive history. The  number of previous abortions varied from 2 to 13 abortions (mean 2  abortions per couple). Using standard cytogenetic techniques (GTG  banding, C banding) 19 (17.27%) cases of chromosome anomalies  were identified. These included: 4 cases with balanced reciprocal  translocations [t(2;6), t(2;11), t(4;12), t(6;7)]; 5 cases with pericentric  inversions [inv(9), inv(15)]; 4 cases with duplications [1(dup) and  16(dup)]; 1 case with insertion ins(3); 2 cases with deletions del(Y q);  mosaic forms of gonosomal aneuploidies in 3 cases.

An autosomal recessive form of male infertility:  mutation of mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma  (POLG),P322.,"L. Touraine , I. Aknin Seifer, A. Combes, J. L. Laurent, B. Lauras,  R. Levy","CHU de Saint Etienne, Saint Etienne, France","Cytogenetics130 131 The gene encoding the mitochondrial DNA polymerase Î³ (POLG)  is localized in 15q24 15q26. The N terminal part of the polymerase  includes a stretch of glutamines encoded by a CAG repeat of variable  length. The most frequent allele consists of 10 repeats. Rovio et al  studied the variation of this CAG repeat in infertile males ( Nat Genet .  2001, 29: 261 2). The presence of 2 alleles with a number of repeats  different from 10 was found only in some infertile males with either  asthenozoospermia or oligozoospermia. We studied 177 infertile males and 28 normospermic controls.  All control men have at least one allele with the 10 CAG repeat  (10/10 or 10/x). Conversely, 2.8% of the infertile men (5 out of  177) have 2 alleles with a number of CAG repeats different from  10. Oligozoospermia and asthenozoospermia were present in  these 5 patients. They represented 5.3% of our patients with  oligozoospermia. In addition, the presence of only one allele with  10 repeats (10/x) was more frequent among our infertile male  population: 25 % versus 14 % in our fertile population. Our results are the first to confirm the data from Rovio et al. We  conclude that, in the absence of any detectable cause, POLG  mutation might contribute to 5% of oligospermic patients. It is  noteworthy that this condition should be inherited as an autosomal  recessive trait. Further studies are also in progress to understand the  role of POLG polyglutamine variation in male infertility.",2003

Intellectual performance often is normal. Approximately half of the  affecteds show a 45,X karyotype, while the other half of the patients  has been described to show a multiplicity of different chromosomal  aberrations. We report a 15 year old girl with proportionate short stature,  pubertal arrest, primary amenorrhea. She is the first child of a  young healthy non consanguineous couple. Pregnancy and delivery  were uneventful, and she was born at term. Fifteen years old she  presented elevated FSH and LH levels, bilateral polycystic gonads  and a normal intelligence. G banded chromosome analysis (450  bands) showed a complex chromosome abnormality, karyotype  45,X[46%]/46,X,+mar[44%]/46,XX[6%]/47,XXX[4%]. Aiming to clarify  the origin of marker, X  or Y chromosomal, we performed FISH  studies. Results demonstrated that the marker is a very small ring X  chromosome (DXZ1+) lacking the gene for the X inactivation specifi c  transcript (XIST ) This may indicate that genes on the marker, if  present, cannot be inactivated. The 47,XXX cells showed a small  DXZ1 area on one X chromosome (normal polymorphism) and  an unusually large DXZ1 area on the two other X chromosomes,  suggesting the possibility of isodisomy. We speculated the origins of the complex mosaicism. The 46,XX cells  may possibly represent the zygote and the ring(X) may have arisen at  an early postzygotic stage. Independent of that event, another 46,XX  cell may have undergone a chromosomal nondisjunction leading to  the 45,X and 47,XXX cells.",2003

The breakpoints  of the inverted Y chromosomes were established with conventional  R, Q banding techniques and FISH procedure using specific probes  for SRY and Y centromere loci. When possible molecular biology with  markers of SRY and AZF loci was realised. Inv(Y) is usually considered as a familial variant without effect on the  phenotype but this has to be checked. New means like molecular  biology or molecular cytogenetic are now available to confirm the  breakpoints position on the inv(Y). We want to point out that is is  necessary to precise those positions in order to better explain the  different phenotypes associated with inv(Y).

We  present the results of genetic screening of men with non obstructive  azoospermia, and severe oligoasthenoteratozoospermia (OAT)  patients. Material and methods: We evaluated 436 oligozoospermic and 383  azoospermic men between years 1995 2003. All patients underwent  evaluation, consisting of a complete history, physical examination,  semen analysis, hormone testing, urinalysis and genetic testing.  Each man had standard karyotype analysis of peripheral leukocytes.  All men with chromosomal abnormality were referred for genetic  counseling. Results: Out of 436 men with oligozoospermia, only 4 (0,9%)  patients had virtual azoospermia (spermatozoa detected in the pellet  after centrifugation at 1800g for 10min) in their ejaculate; others had  a mean sperm count of 3,22 million/mL Â± 0,91 (0,1 â 10,8 million/ mL).

A male patient with azoospermia and sterility, with de novo  translocation ivolving the long arms of chromosomes Y and 9.  We performed cytogenetic analysis using conventional bending  techniques, and found balanced reciprocal translocation. Karyotype is  46, X, t (Y ; 9) (q 11. 2 ; q 34). Using PCR method, we amplified 18 main fragments of AZF lokus,  including DAZ, Kal Y, SMCY genes and RBMI, DFFRY, DBY. Analysis  of PCR products (on agarose gel with high resolution) showed that  our patient has no delation in any of tested region. So, our hypothesis  is that position effect has a main role in sterility of this case. We also present two infertil male patients with azoospermia. The  first case is with rare paracentric inversion of X chromosome,  karyotype 46, XY, inv X (q 13 ; q 25). And the second case is with  Y/Y translocation; karyotype 46, X, t (Y;Y) (p 11 ; q 11) [(Ypter   Yp11  :: Yq11   Yqter )].Breaking points indicate that delation of DAZ gene,  placed on Yq11, is the main reason of azoospermia.

Methods : We analysed 23 exons from the CFTR gene in 19  azoospermic patients (16 with CBAVD, 2 with CUAVD and 1 with  CBASV). 225 neonatal blood samples with raised IRT were also  studied for 12 CFTR exons, which include 90% of the mutations  causing cystic fibrosis in our population. The screening methods were  PAGE, DGGE and direct sequencing. Results : F508del was the most frequent mutation in both cases, but  the IVS8 5T variant is the second in the azoospermic patients but not  in IRT raised samples. There exist differences too when we extend  the haplotype and analyse the (TG)m variant: (TG)12 is the most  frequent in CBAVD phenotypes and (TG)11 in CUAVD and neonatal  samples with elevated IRT. Another important difference is the  linkage desequilibrium found between the 5T 11TG haplotype and the  875+40 A G polymorphism in IRT elevated samples. Conclusions : The penetrance of the IVS8 5T variant could be  affected not only by the (TG)m but another polymorphisms such as  875+40 A G, raising the IRT values at birth, or it is also possible that  this haplotype is linked to another undetected mutation.",2003
Prognostic Value Of Y Chromosome Microdeletions  For Sperm Retrieval,P329.,"Peterlin1, T. Kunej1, D. Hristovski1, S. Dzeroski2","1University Medical Center Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia, 2IJS,  Ljubljana, Slovenia","Male infertility affects about 10% of the adult population.  Considerable technical advances in the assisted reproductive  techniques (ART), intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) and  testicular extraction (TESE) in particular, revolutionized the treatment  of male infertility. Recently, Y chromosome microdeletions proved to  be an important etiologic factor in male infertility. Although molecular  mechanisms have not been elucidated yet, several attempts have  been made to find whether the Y microdeletion pattern may predict  the success of TESE, and consequently, the infertility treatment.  Therefore, we analyzed a database (YCMdb) of 512 infertile men with  Y chromosome microdeletions. The aim was to find new associations  between genetic markers, AZF regions and genes, and retrieval of  testicular sperm at TESE. The YCMdb was constructed extracting  data from papers, indexed by the Pubmed bibliographic database  (1994 2002). Of the 512 patients included in the YCMdb, the data on  testicular sperm retrieval was available for 331 patients: in 207 sperm  was found present (176 OAT and 26 AZO patients) and in 124 no  sperm was found. We identified three regions (AZFa, AZFb and the  region AZFa b), one gene (RBMY) and 11 STS markers (sY84, sY86,  sY87, sY89, sY113, sY117, sY124, sY128, sY134, sY139, sY143),  which were significantly (pÅ0.001) associated with sperm retrieval.  In the identified loci sperm was retrieved in x y%. We conclude that  specific deletions may be associated with the success of sperm  retrieval, however, larger datasets have to be analyzed to firmly  estimate the prognostic value of the Y deletion analysis.",2003

Fluorescence in situ hybridization with Y specific probes showed an  isodicentric Y chromosome with the breakpoint on the short arm of  the Y chromosome. An isodicentric Y chromosome is mostly found in combination with a  45,X cell line and causes intersex in approximately 30% of the cases  (Hsu, 1994). In our case, this karyotype explained the sonographic  findings but could not give more reassurance about the gender of  the fetus (Tuck Muller et al, 1995).

"Characterisation of HSFY, a novel AZFb candidate  gene on the Y chromosome, with a possible role in  human spermatogenesis",P331.,"Salata , A. Tessari, M. Slongo, A. Ferlin, A. Garolla, C. Foresta","University of Padova, Centre for Male Gamete Cryopreservation,  Padova, Italy","Introduction . Microdeletions of Yq are the most common mutations  in infertile males, involving one or more âazoospermia factorsâ  (AZFa, b and c). We recently assembled a complete map of AZFb Cytogenetics132 133 determining its structure and gene content. Deletion analysis in  infertile men suggested a possible role for a novel gene, HSFY. It  contains an heat shock factor type DNA binding domain related  to HSF2 on chromosome 6, and it is predicted to encode two  transcripts. In this study we report preliminary results of genomic  organization and expression analysis for HSFY. Methods . Genomic  structure has been determined by Blast alignment with AZFb clones.  Expression analyses were performed with primers specific for both  transcripts in different tissues, spermatozoa, andSertoli cells by PCR,  RT PCR, and Northern blotting. Results . Transcript 1 (long, 1424 bp)  was present in many tissues whereas transcript 2 (short, 1058 bp)  amplified only in testis. A third transcript of 1500 1600 bp (transcript  3) was found only in the testis, confirmed also by sequencing.  Northern analysis for this novel transcript confirmed a fragment of  1.5 1.6 kb expressed only in testis. Transcript 1 is expressed in  spermatozoa but not in Sertoli cells, while transcript 2 and 3 are not  expressed in these cells, suggesting that they are expressed in the  first phases of spermatogenesis. Discussion . HSFY seems to be  differently expressed during spermatogenesis and it may represent  an AZFb candidate gene. Further studies are in progress to analyse  its function during male germ cell development.",2003
Elucidation of murine Theg  gene role in  spermatogenesis,P332.,"U. Mannan , K. Nayernia, W. Engel","Institute of Human Genetics, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany","Stage specific interactions between Sertoli cells and germ cells are  central in the regulation of spermatogenesis, but their molecular  mechanisms are still poorly understood. In the present study, a  differentially expressed gene, named Theg , expressed specifically in  spermatids, is characterised. Its expression is up regulated by some  unknown factor/s from Sertoli cells. The ORF of Theg  encodes for a  42.7 kDa putative nuclear protein. To elucidate the function of Theg  protein and its role in spermatogenesis, we decided to disrupt the  Theg  gene homologous recombination in mouse. Theg was identified  as a novel protein therefore for functional analysis of Theg proteinâs  domain structure, two different knock out approach were undertaken.  In first knock out mice the C terminal of Theg protein (which included  exon 3 8) was deleted. Both male and female mice heterozygous for  Theg  deletion appeared normal and fertile. Homozygous male and  female mice also exhibited normal phenotype and Theg /  male mice  were fertile. Thus suggesting that C terminal of Theg does not play  any important role for a successful progression of spermatogenesis. In the second knock out mice, we intended to delete the N  terminal domain of Theg protein by homologous recombination,  which involved deletion of exons 1 4 of Theg . Both heterozygous  and homozygous male mice were fertile. Further phenotypic and  physiological analyses to identify any subtle abnormalities are  awaited. However from our results from both knock out mouse model  systems, we can conclude that Theg is a non essential protein for  spermatogenesis and perhaps its function is compensated by some  other redundant protein/",2003

Foresta","University of Padova, Centre for Male Gamete Cryopreservation,  Padova, Italy","Introduction.  Children born after intracytoplasmic sperm injection  (ICSI) performed for male factor infertility seem at increased risk  of congenital malformations and chromosome aberrations. These  anomalies seem to be related to the underlying spermatogenic  damage of the father, that frequently is caused by genetic alterations.  Methods. We studied 750 severely oligozoospermic men candidates  for ICSI. Genetic tests included: 1. analysis of peripheral blood  karyotype; 2. analysis of the Y chromosome long arm for detection of  microdeletions in the azoospermia factors; 3. analysis of mutations  in the cystic fibrosis gene; 4. analysis of mutations in the androgen  receptor gene; 5. analysis of sperm chromosome aneuploidies.  Results.  A total of 104 genetic abnormalities were diagnosed,  corresponding to a frequency of 13.9%. Chromosomal aberrations  were present in 5.6% and they were in most cases alterations of the  sex chromosomes. Y chromosome long arm microdeletions were  detected in 6.0% and most frequently included AZFc. Mutations  in the cystic fibrosis gene were diagnosed in 1.2%, and mutations  in the androgen receptor gene in 1.1%. Sperm sex chromosome  aneuploidies were increased in men with karyotype anomalies and  Y chromosome microdeletions, and also in subjects without genetic  abnormalities. Discussion.  Genetic alterations represent a major  cause of severe spermatogenic impairment leading to male infertility .  The risk of transmission of chromosomal and genetic diseases  by ICSI is therefore very high. Genetic tests and counselling are  highly recommended in oligozoospermic men candidates for in vitro  fertilisation techniques, to avoid transmission, persistence, or even an  increase of genetic defects in future generations.",2003

Structural autosomal rearrangements:  intrachromosomal interactions affect spectrum of several  defects,P338.,W. Lurie,"University of Maryland, Baltimore, MD, United States","The detailed analysis of already known phenotypic information  about the patients with structural autosomal imbalance allows to  demonstrate that interactions between several genes within the same  autosome may significantly affect the phenotype. Preaxial defects (absent or hypoplastic thumbs or preaxial  polydactyly) are relatively common in patients with 4q trisomy,  involving 4q31q32. These defects have been described in more than  a dozen of patients, both with âpureâ trisomy 4q and in association  with imbalance for some other chromosomes. In patients with more  distal 4q duplications these defects have not been reported. Most  likely, segment 4q31q32 contains one or several genes which, when  triplicated, affect development of preaxial structures. Among several hundreds patients with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome,  caused by âsimpleâ 4p deletions, ectrodactyly was described only once (Bamshad et al., 1998). Association of del 4p and dup 4q (usually due to parental inversion)  has been described in at least 12 patients. No significant limb defects  were found in 7 of them who had duplications of 4q33 qter (or more  distal 4q). At the same time 3 out of 5 with duplication of more  proximal segments had ectrodactyly or âbilateral underdevelopmentâ  of upper limbs (Kobori et al., 1993; Petek et al., 2000; Lemos et al.,  2001). Hemizygous absence of distal 4p not only increases frequency  of limbs defects in patients with dup 4q31q32, but also shifts the  mode of action from the affection of preaxial structures to ectrodactyly  or more severe limb underdevelopment.",2003

Templado1","1Universidad AutÃ³noma de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, 2FundaciÃ³n  Puigvert, Barcelona, Spain","Meiotic studies have been carried out in testicular biopsies from  two infertile men with obstructive azoospermia by multiplex  FISH (M FISH). Testicular biopsies were processed using the  technique of Evans et al. (1964). The M FISH procedure followed  the manufacturerâs instructions (SpectraVysion; Vysis). For each  cell, both inverted DAPI counterstain image and M FISH image  were analysed. In the two cases studied, prophase I figures were  apparently normal, with a sex vesicle and normal autosomal pairing.  Of a total of 101 metaphases originally captured under phase  contrast microscopy, 76 were analysable after M FISH. Among  66 metaphase I cells found, 19.70% were abnormal (84.62% with  numerical abnormalities, and 15.38% with structural aberrations).  We also detected the presence of univalents for chromosome pairs  18 (1/66), 21 (4/66) and XY (11/66). Out of ten metaphase II cells  observed, eight were normal and two were aneuploid. The M FISH  image allows us to identify each chromosome. However, due to the  poor meiotic figures quality obtained by M FISH, the inverse DAPI  image is necessary to study chromosome morphology. Meiotic  studies in spermatocytes by M FISH will contribute to understanding  the paternal origin of chromosome abnormalities and to detecting  meiotic anomalies limited to germ cells.

The only indication for chromosome analysis was a planned  ICSI; internal and external genitals, ovaries and hormone status were  normal. Conventional cytogenetic analysis showed a rearrangement  between chromosomes #3, #4, #7, #9, and #17 whereas karyotype  analysis of the parents showed no cytogenetic abnormalities. Application of 24 color FISH indicated the following aberrations:  del(3), der(4)t(17;4;7), der(7)t(3;7), der(9)t(4;9), der(17)t(9;17). To  concretize from which chromosomal arm the translocated material  was derived, arm specific probes were used where necessary and  revealed that the derivative chromosome 3 had no simple deletion  but contained a subtle translocation of material of chromosome 4.  In the next step, multicolor banding (MCB) was applied to further  characterize the exact breakpoints and to define the orientation of  the involved chromosomal material. By this detailed analysis, the  karyotype could be established as follows: .ish 46,XX,der(3)t(3;4)(3pter  >3q22::4q34or35  >4qter),  der(4)t(17;4;7)(17pter  >17p12or13::4p14  >4q34or35:: 7p12or13  >7pter), der(7)t(3;7)(3qter  >3q22::7p12or13  >7qter),  der(9)t(4;9)(4pter  >4p14::9q13  >9pter), der(17)t(9;17)(9qter  >9q13: :17p12or13  >17qter) The rearrangement consisted of altogether 6 breaks and seemed  to be balanced on molecular cytogenetic level. Although the  MCB technique allows to determine exactly the breakpoints,  submicroscopic deletions or duplications close to the breakpoints  cannot be excluded. There are only very few cases reported  with such a complex chromosomal rearrangement involving 5  chromosomes without clinical signs. As such cases are detected  only by chance the frequency of them in the population still remains  unknown.",2003

According to database search (NCBI) 123kb of b35B4 are present  in at least 5 copies in 1q21, leading to a strong FISH signal there. In  1p36.1 59kb of b35B4 with ~95% sequence homology are present  twice in tandem order. Additionally, 21.5 kb with ~90 homology  to b35B4 are located once in 1p12. Human chromosome 1 was  studied in comparison to its homologues in Hylobates lar (HLA),  Gorilla gorilla (GGO), Pan troglodytes (PTR) and Pongo pygmaeus  (PPY). The results clearly indicated, that there was an up to present  unrecognized pericentric inversion in the evolution between apes and  HSA #1. Moreover, a duplication of the sequences homologous to  human 1p36.1 could be detected in PTR. Finally, in HLA there is also  a homologous region to HSA 1p36.1 and the region homologous to  HSA 1q21/1p12 is split onto two different chromosomes.

Mouse oocytes  were recovered from superovulated hybrid females. Oocytes were  activated by intracytoplasmic injection of human spermatozoa. These  oocytes developed normally in vivo  to the first mitosis and were  fixed for analysis. In total 277 oocytes were analysed. The overall  frequency of chromosomal abnormality was 22.02%.

The frequency  of chromosome aberrations in our results is not different from the  frequency of chromosome aberrations in mouse oocytes activated  by ethanol and unfertilized human oocytes undergoing IVF.

The use of whole  genome amplification (WGA) and comparative genomic hybridisation  (CGH) to investigate the full chromosome complement of a small  number of human embryos has been reported. We have used WGA  and CGH to identify genomic imbalance in individual blastomeres  from human embryos and correlated the results with FISH analysis of  sister blastomeres using appropriate probe combinations Thirty two embryos were analysed using WGA and CGH; 16 (50%)  had a normal diploid karyotype, 14 (44%) were abnormal, with a  chromosome imbalance in one or more cells and 2 (6%) had a  chaotic chromosome complement. In 18 embryos, results were  compared with those obtained after FISH on sister blastomeres.  In 8 embryos (4 normal and 4 abnormal by CGH), FISH analysis  was consistent with CGH results, in 4 embryos FISH results were  inconclusive and in 5, FISH was unsuccessful. In only one embryo  were the results between the two techniques discrepant; the embryo  appeared trisomy 16 by FISH but normal by CGH. No embryos with  full aneuploidies, indicating meiotic error, were found. We conclude that abnormality rates in human embryos may be lower  than previous estimates; it remains possible that errors in FISH or  CGH may be inflating these estimates. However, our results show  that chromosomally abnormal embryos are likely to be the result of  cultural artefact or inadequate cell cycle surveillance, rather than  meiotic error.",2003

The strong association between Down syndrome  (DS) and celiac disease (CD) has been documented earlier. Many  studies originating from different centers have reported an increased  prevalence of CD in DS ranging from 4 to 17% . Studies from the  United States have yielded different results, ranging from 4.8% to  10.3%. This study was performed to be the first prevalence study in  Turkish DS population. Material and Methods . The patients were currently followed in our  department. A total number of 100 patients, older than 2 years age  were screened using antiendomysium antibodies (EMA Ig A) and  quantitative IgA. Routine physical examination and anthropometric  studies were done. Result.  Only one patient (1%) was serologically positive for EMA IgA.  The patient was a 10 years old boy with anorexia. The family refused  intestinal biopsy. Abdominal distention was present in 13 (13%)  patients, while anorexia in 9 (9%), vomitting in 7 (7%) and alopecia in  2 (2%) patients. Discussion. The result of this serological study, yielding 1% EMA  positivity is the lowest yet determined among DS patients. Although  not biopsy proven to be CD, recent data on the association between  DS and CD show that most patients are determined among EMA  positive patients. Despite the lack of normal population figures we  might have a lower incidence of CD among our DS population.  However, we believe that asymptommatic screening and repeated  screening od symptommatic patients should be considered. The most  appropriate test is yet to be determined while EMA antibodies are  probably the most convincing.",2003

There are controversial views regarding the  phenotype of ATM heterozygous carriers, whose frequency in the  population is questionable and suspected to be quite high (~1:100).  Cellular studies claimed that heterozygous ATM carriers, display an  increased sensitivity to ionization radiation and exhibit multitudinous  modifications in gene expression compared to normal controls.  As gene expression appears to be highly associated with DNA  replication timing, a parameter implicated recently with predisposition  to cancer, we tested, in primary cell cultures of ATM heterozygous  carriers, replication patterns of three genes, HER2 , RB1, and  SNRPN . Using the fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  replication assay, we showed that all the three tested genes changed  markedly their replication mode in cell samples of heterozygous  ATM carriers. HER2 and RB1, which normally reveal synchrony  in replication of allelic counterparts (as expected from biallelically  expressed genes) when present in cells heterozygous for ATM  display an asynchronous (allele specific) mode of allelic replication.  Also the imprinted SNRPN gene, which normally exhibits an allele  specific replication mode, (characterizing monoallelically expressed  genes), changes in heterozygous ATM cells its inherent replication  mode and manifests loss of asynchrony in allelic replication.

Since FA is a rare genetic disease, the Registry is  expected to benefit patients, improving the knowledge of this illness  from the diagnostic, clinical, therapeutical and epidemiological  viewpoint, and also supporting the laboratory and clinical research on  FA aetiology, pathophysiology and therapy. Moreover, the Department  of Genetics provides laboratory diagnosis through cytogenetic  and biochemical tests and collects blood and tissue samples from  diagnosed patients, their parents and siblings for genetic tests and  research. The Italian Association of FA Families (AIRFA) supports the Registry  and the research on this pathology. In these years, thanks to the families and the physicians collaborating  all over Italy, we enrolled 118 patients, aged from 0 to 39 y, 61  males and 57 females; 65 are alive; 49 underwent bone marrow  transplantation; 100 showed congenital malformations; 9 developed  neoplasia.

Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with  an extensive genetic and clinical heterogeneity. The lymphocytes  and fibroblasts of FA patients show increased sensitivity to  alkylating agents such as mitomycin C (MMC), generating increased  chromosome breakage. In this study we have investigated 20  patients referred for FA both clinically and cytogenetically. Mitomycin  C with 3 different Concentrations (20,30,40 ng/ml) have been applied to the  lymphocytes of the patients and their normal sex matched  controls.Our clinical and cytogenetic findings will be presented and  compared with other similar studies.",2003
A new strategy in Fanconi Anemia diagnosis and  characterization.,P359.,"Calzone1, M. Criscuolo2, A. Romano1, A. Savoia3, A. Zatterale1, F.

Death often occurs for the complications of bone marrow failure.  Diagnosis is based on hypersensitivity of FA chromosomes to DEB.  Molecular diagnosis is time consuming on unselected patients due to  genetic heterogeneity. Five of the seven known FA proteins (FANC  A,C,E,F,G) bind together in a complex that functions upstream of a  sixth protein, FANC D2, which is activated by monoubiquitination. This recent finding has lead to the development of a new diagnostic  tool based on the analysis of the FA proteins by means of  immunochemical techniques. This procedure is a precious support to cytogenetic diagnosis for  border line cases. Moreover, subtyping is mandatory for some clinical  decisions, prenatal and preimplantation diagnosis and gene therapy . We performed protein study using highly specific antibodies against  FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2 in 10 FA patients diagnosed by  DEB test, 3 transplanted patients, and 10 controls. In 9 patients the  FANCA protein was not detectable allowing us to classify them as  A group. In the remaining patient, FANCA, FANCG, and FANCD2  were expressed, suggesting that another gene, BRCA2 or one not  cloned yet, is responsible for FA in this patient. As expected, the 3  transplanted patients and the controls showed normal protein pattern. The FA protein study seems suitable as a screening test, reserving  the more expensive and time consuming complementation study to  patients belonging to very rare groups.

This study was to verify the occurrence of  an in vivo  prooxidant state in FA patients compared to their parents  and to healthy donors, by measuring the oxidative DNA damage 8  hydroxy 2â deoxyguanosine (8 OHdG). A total of 69 FA patients from  11 clinical centres, located in Italy and Turkey, were recruited; 21 of  them were transplanted. Moreover, 77 FA heterozygotes (parents)  and 100 unrelated controls (46 pediatric and 54 adult) were enrolled.  Confirmatory FA diagnosis by diepoxybutane (DEB) test and clinical Cytogenetics138 139 overview were homogeneously carried out. The levels of 8 OHdG were significantly increased in untransplanted  FA patients (4.50 Â± 2.84 Î¼mol 8 OHdG/mol dG) vs. their parents  and controls (2.88 Â± 1.23 and 2.55 Â± 1.24 Î¼mol 8 OHdG/mol dG,  respectively); p< 0.01. The levels of 8 OHdG in transplanted patients  (3.62 Â± 2.45 Î¼mol 8 OHdG/mol dG) were not significantly different  from 8 OHdG levels in untransplanted FA patients. Moreover, a  significant excess of 8 OHdG levels was observed in female vs. male  FA patients (p = 0.037). The results showed that a significant excess in oxidative DNA  damage is maintained in FA patients after BMT, consistent with  the recognized excess cancer risk in transplanted FA patients, and  suggesting that reactive oxygen species are generated in FA patients  outside hematopoietic tissues. The excess of 8 OHdG levels in  female vs. male FA patients may be related to the roles for androgens  in modulating oxidative stress.

"Individual sensitivity to micronuclei induced by  styrene 7,8 oxide in vitro: role of epoxide hydrolase and  glutathione S transferase genotypes",P361.,"Laffon1,2, B. PÃ©rez CadahÃ­a1,2, E.

Styrene is a monomer of great commercial interest; its polymers  and copolymers are used in a wide range of applications. In  humans, styrene metabolism involves oxidation by cytochrome P450  monooxygenases to styrene 7,8 oxide (SO), an epoxide thought to  be responsible for the genotoxic effects of styrene exposure. SO is  detoxified by hydrolysis catalyzed by epoxide hydrolase (EH) or, to a  minor extent, by conjugation mediated by glutathione S tranferases  (GSTs). The objective of this study was to investigate if genetic  polymorphisms of EH (codons 113 and 139), GSTP1  (codons 105  and 114), GSTM1  and GSTT1  modulate SO induced micronuclei  (MN) in humans. We studied lymphocyte cultures from 30 healthy  donors treated with 50 and 200 mM SO. When EH genotypes were  classified into low, medium and high with respect to the expected EH  activity an increase was observed in induced MN frequency in EH low  activity donors, consistent with the detoxifying activity of this enzyme.  In addition, increases in MN frequencies for GSTP1  *A/*B and *A/*C  genotypes were detected with regard to the wild type homozygous  *A/*A genotype. As for GSTM1  and GSTT1  genotypes, no clear  results were obtained, probably due to the minor role that glutathione  conjugation plays in styrene metabolism. This in vitro study suggest  that polymorphisms in EH and, to a lesser extent, in GSTP1 , may  affect MN induction by SO.",2003

Comparing these  data with previous observations of children from the same region  (1988 1995) it has been determined that the frequency of unstable  chromosome aberrations remained relatively constant, but the  frequency of stable chromosome injuries showed accumulation with  time. The mean group rate of dicentrics and centric rings found under  conventional staining analysis formed only 17 % of the total complete  and incomplete translocations revealed by FISH. So, in spite of  the long term radiation exposure, nearly 83% of cells with unstable  aberrations had been eliminated. The frequency of stable cytogenetic  markers determined by FISH analysis differed significantly from the  age standard, confirming the predominance of a radiation origin of  chromosome mutagenesis in the observed children. We suppose that  the increased level of chromosome aberrations in the exposed group  can be induced not only by irradiation but by the modified action of some unknown environmental mutagens. The results obtained  confirmed the negative influence of the regional environment upon  the observed persons. Irrespective of the cause of the induced  genotoxicity they must be regarded as a high risk group.",2003

A significant difficulty in the study  of ES cells, and in realizing their long term potential as sources of  normal differentiated cell types for use in transplantation therapies,  is their tendency to undergo spontaneous differentiation. Following  prolonged culture, we found that some human ES lines appear easier  than others to maintain in an undifferentiated state and we have been  able to culture sub lines in the absence of feeder cells, or conditioned  medium from such feeders. We found that the lines better adapted Cytogenetics140 141 to culture had acquired karyotypic changes, but were surprised  to see that a primary change in the two unrelated and different  sex cell lines, H7 and H14, involved effective gain of long arm  chromosome 17 in both cases, one due to trisomy and the other to  a der(6)t(6;17)(q27;q1). Furthermore, secondary changes in one cell  line involved additional copies of chromosomes 1 and 12 including  the appearance of an i(12p) in some sub lines. These changes are characteristic of human embryonal cell  carcinomas, gain of 17q being well documented in neuroblastoma,  and i(12p) in testicular germ cell tumour. It seems likely that these  chromosomes carry genes that play a key role in proliferation and  differentiation.

However, approximately  20% of the pregnancies resulted in miscarriages, showing often  chromosomal abnormalities, most commonly a trisomy. A significantly higher frequency of sperm aneuploidy in subfertile men  suggest that the patient is at an elevated risk of producing offspring  with numerical chromosomal abnormalities. The purpose of our  study was to assess the relation between the rate of some specifi c  chromosome abnormalities in sperm in the male partner of couples  with recurrent pregnancy loss in an assisted reproduction program. Material and methods: In this prospective study, 14500 spermatozoa  out of 29 sperm samples of the male partners of couples undergoing  IVF with two or more first trimester spontaneous abortions were  analysed. As an internal control we analysed 5000 sperms from  10 patients with normozoospermia undergoing successful IVF  cycles with at least two deliveries and no abortions. Diploidy and  aneuploidy rates were assessed for chromosomes 13, 16 and 21 in  decondensed sperm nuclei using three colour FISH. Results and discussion: Chromosomal abnormalities (nullisomy,  disomy and diploidy) in sperm samples of men from recurrent  abortion couples were not significantly increased compared to that  from our internal controls (3,24% vs. 2,78%). In this study we did not observe the clear correlation between the  frequency of chromosomal aneuploidy of chromosomes 13, 16 and  21 and the diploidy rate in sperm and the fertilization and/or abortion  rates. This rate of chromosomal abnormalities do not appear to  compromise the reproduction outcome.",2003
Intercellular distribution of chromatid exchanges  caused by different types of chemical mutagens in  human lymphocytes culture,P367.,"Kosyakova , A. Chebotarev","Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation","We present an analysis of quantitative laws governing the  intercellular distribution of chromatid exchanges. Chemical mutagens  with one (mitomycin C) or two (trenimon) active centers were used.  Human lymphocytes (G1 stage) were treated with 6 doses of  mitomycin C and 4 doses of trenimon at 72 h for 1 hour. To analyze  aberrations in first mitosis after mutagen treatment cultures were  harvested at 96 h. The frequency of all chromosome aberrations  was scored and the intercellular distribution of chromatid exchanges  was studied. Three distribution types (Poisson, geometric and  negative binomial) were applied to the data. The results obtained for  mitomycin C and trenimon both appeared to be in a good agreement  with the geometric and negative binomial distributions. According to  the mass service theory, a geometric distribution can be interpreted  as a composition of a Poisson distribution of primary requirements  (origin of lesions) with an exponential distribution of the time of  servicing the primary requirements (repairing of primary lesions).  And a negative binomial distribution appears to be a composition  of Poisson and Erlang distributions. The intercellular distribution of exchange aberrations appears not to depend on the number of  active centers of the mutagen. However, it differs from the Poisson  distribution observed after exposure to radiation. Nevertheless,  comparison of quantitative laws for chromosome mutations caused  by different types of mutagenic agents can be useful in investigating  and analyzing the process of formation of chromosome aberrations.",2003

The role of FEN1 in fragile X (CGG)n triplet repeat  expansion,P377.,"C. Hirst , K. Jennert, J. Bone, P. Kansagra","Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom","Expansion of a (CGG)n triplet array within the promoter of the  human FMR1 gene results in a length gene silencing, loss of the  encoded FMRP protein and subsequent clinical features of the  fragile X syndrome. Expansion prone (CGG)n arrays integrated into  S.cerevisiae  chromosomes exhibit length and orientation instability.  These become further destabilised, with a 10 fold increase in the  frequency of expansion, in rad27Î  cells, suggesting that the encoded  FEN1 protein may lie in the expansion pathway. To examine this  further, we have now examined the ability of the human FEN1  protein to function in yeast cells and studied its effect upon stability  of (CGG)n arrays. Complementation of the rad27Î  mutation with  human FEN1 gene suppresses expansion, restoring array stability  to wild type levels. Using FEN1 point mutants, we show that this  ability is upon the nuclease activity of the FEN1 protein. In addition,  elevated expression of the related yeast endonuclease gene, EXO1,  which plays a role in mismatch repair pathways, also suppresses  expansion. These results suggest that expansions of (CGG)n arrays  can arise in cells deficient in nuclease activities directed toward  branched DNA structures such as those which arise in replication  and DNA repair. To analyse the function of FEN1 in human cells,  ribozymes directed towards human FEN1 mRNA have been  developed and are being examined for their effects upon stability of  various expanded triplet arrays. The implications for human triplet  expansion diseases will be discussed",2003
Fragile X syndrome: an expansion / contraction  mosaic,P378.,"P. Cregeen1, G. Norbury1, P. Logan2, L. Jenkins1","1Great Ormond Street Hospital for Children, London, United Kingdom,  2Northern Ireland Genetics Service, Belfast City Hospital, Belfast,  United Kingdom","Fragile X syndrome is the most common form of inherited mental  retardation and is almost exclusively due to an expanded CGG  repeat in the first exon of the FMR1 gene. We describe the daughter  of a female premutation carrier who, on PCR, showed two CGG  repeat alleles within the normal range (28 and 31 repeats) but had  10% fragile sites on cytogenetic analysis. Southern blot analysis  identified a methylated full mutation expansion. Haplotype analysis  indicated that the daughter had inherited the full mutation expansion  and the 31 repeat allele from her mother. This suggested that the  expansion occurred pre fertilisation with a subsequent somatic  event early in development reducing the number of repeats on a  proportion of the daughterâs X chromosomes carrying the expansion.  Haplotype analysis also confirms that a grandson has inherited the  contracted allele from his mother which upon sequencing was shown  to comprise (CGG)8AGG(CGG)22. The repeat length is within the  normal size range and the deletion/contraction does not affect the  5â or 3â flanking regions of the repeat. This configuration is likely to be associated with stable transmissions and provides no evidence  for the grandson being affected with fragile X syndrome. This case  reaffirms that individuals with a family history of fragile X syndrome  should be investigated for the possibility of mosaicism.",2003

Since the discovery of the FMR1   gene responsible for the fragile X syndrome, molecular diagnosis of  fragile X is widely used, specially Southern blot analysis was found  to be of great use in determining the mosaic pattern in the number of  CGG repeats as well as methylation of CpG island. The mechanism  leading to mosaicism of the CGG repeat is still elusive. We report  three brothers with mosaic pattern of CGG repeats. In the first patient  we report a mosaic pattern of normal, premutation and full mutation  alleles. In other two we identified mosaic pattern of premutation and  full mutation alleles. The mother of these patients was found to carry  a premutation allele. We have done FMRP studies in these patients  using antibody test. In the patient with mosaicism for the normal allele  we observed expression of FMRP in 12 % of lymphocytes; in other  two patients it was 5% and 1%. Clinically the patient with mosaicism  for the normal allele was normal with borderline MR. Therefore the  expression of FMRP in 12% of cells may be a necessary threshold for  normal development.",2003
Preimplantation Diagnosis for Sonic Hedgehog  Mutation Causing Familial Holoprosencephaly,P380.,"Verlinsky , S. Rechitsky, C. Masciangelo, R. Morris, A.

Familial cases of HPE show clear autosomal dominant  inheritance and a great intrafamilial clinical variability, which makes  preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) an attractive option for the  at risk couples. PGD was performed for a couple with two children  with HPE, both carrying SHH mutation due to GAG>TAG sequence  change, resulting in premature termination of the protein at position  256 (Glu256âstop). PGD cycles were performed using a standard  IVF protocol coupled with micromanipulation procedures, involving  blastomere biopsy from the eightï¿½cell embryos. Single blastomeres  were tested by multiplex nested PCR analysis, which included  simultaneous specific mutation and the microsatellite linked DNA  maker D7s550 testing. As SHH mutation was not found in either  parent, a single sperm testing was performed, allowing identification  of gonadal mosaicism for the mutation. Seventeen embryos from two  PGD cycles have been tested, resulting in preselection and transfer  of 3 mutation free embryos, which yielded a singleton unaffected  ongoing pregnancy, confirmed to be mutation free by amniocentesis.  This is the first PGD for SHH mutation, which may have practical  implications for primary prevention of congenital disorders.",2003

Parental samples and the CF child  were screened for CFTR mutations (prior to prenatal diagnosis)  by heteroduplex analysis on PAGE (for the presence of F508del),  agarose gel electrophoresis and restriction enzyme digestion for  haplotype analysis. Samples negative for F508del were analysed  by DGGE of PCR amplified exons 1 24. Prenatal diagnosis was  performed on 49 families, all having at least one CF child. Some of  these families applied for prenatal diagnosis several times, so the  total number of prenatal analysis performed was 64.

In an attempt to evaluate the  pregnancy outcome of the marker chromosomes, we retrospectively  reviewed the clinical and cytogenetic data of the prenatally diagnosed  SMCs. A total of 37 cases with marker chromosomes were identified  from approximately 29,000 cases referred for prenatal cytogenetic  diagnosis. Among the 37 cases, twelve SMCs were originated from  non acrocentric chromosomes including chromosomes 4,5,7,8,16,18  and 19. Two cases had one acrocentric and one non acrocentric  SMCs. The majority (23 cases or 62%)were originated from  acrocentric chromosomes with 11 of them from chromosome 15.  None of the 11 SMCs from chromosome 15 contained the Prader  Willi/Angelman Syndrome critical region, and uniparental disomy  was ruled out in 5/5 cases tested. Four pregnancies were terminated  with normal or unknown phenotype and three cases were lost to  follow up. Clinical follow up were obtained in the remaining cases  ranged from birth to 20 months of age. Among the cases followed  up, a total of 3 cases (two non acrocentric SMCs and one case  with both a chromosome 17 and an acrocentric markers)resulted in  abnormal phenotypes. Fetal abnormalities were detected by prenatal  ultrasound examination in two of the three cases. In summary, our results are consistent with the previous reports indicating an overall  lower risk for acrocentric SMCs and higher risk for non acrocentric  SMCs. In addition, our study shows that ultrasound examination is  helpful in detecting some of the abnormalities associated with SMCs.",2003

The material for this study came from analysis of data from  multiple sources on births and terminations of pregnancy after  prenatal diagnosis of congenital anomalies in 279,917 consecutive  pregnancies of known outcome. The study period was divided into 3  parts 1979 1988, 1989 1993 and 1994 2000. Between 1979 and 1988 and 1993 and 1999 prenatal detection of  congenital anomalies increased from 11.7% to 25.5% and to 32.8%.  Termination of pregnancy (TOP) increased in the same proportions  during the 3 time periods. However the increase of TOP was much  higher for chromosomal anomalies than for non chromosomal  congenital anomalies : 21.7, 43.9 and 66.0 vs 4.8, 7.3, and 11.2  respectively. The birth prevalence of Down syndrome fell by 80%  from 1979 88 to 1994 2000. Sensitivity of prenatal detection of  congenital anomalies and TOPs were lower for isolated cases (only  one malformation present in the fetus) than for multiple malformations  in the same fetus. Sensitivity varied with the type of malformations  : it was high for neural tube defect (79.7%) and urinary anomalies  (54.8%) and low for congenital heart defects (25.3%) and for oral  clefts (27.6%) In conclusion the introduction of routine prenatal diagnosis has  resulted in a significant fall in the birth prevalence of congenital  anomalies.

Free fetal DNA in maternal  plasma and serum has been shown to be useful for fetal gender  determination, and seems to offer a new possibility to perform non  invasive prenatal genetic diagnosis. A possible application is fetal  sex determination for couples at risk of X linked diseases. The aim of  our study was to control the reliabilty and reproducibility of the real  time PCR amlification of the SRY region. Methods:  Maternal serum  before amniocentesis, and amnionic fluid samples were obtained  from 30 pregnant women during the 10th to 15th weeks of gestation.  Real time PCR analysis of the SRY region was performed in order  to determine fetal sex. Routine karyotyping of cultured amnionic  cells was also performed on the samples. Results:  We found male  fetuses in 14 of 30 pregnancies by cytogenetic analysis. Real time  PCR of maternal plasma has been positive for the SRY region in the  same patients. No false positive or false negative cases were found.  Conclusion:  Here we present our preliminary results with the real  time PCR method in the determination of fetal sex using maternal  plasma. The real time PCR detection of fetal DNA in maternal plasma  seems to be an easy non invasive method to determine the fetal sex  at this gestational age.

Follow up analysis of other fetal tissues  confirmed the mosaicism and also disclosed a normal cell line. It  is likely that the marker reflects a mutation event that resulted in  trisomy rescue early in embryonic development. Had the trisomy 21  cell line not been found at amniocentesis, a low risk of an abnormal  phenotype (approximately 5%) would have been assigned. We  suggest that the risk associated with minute non euchromatic marker  chromosomes should be revised to account for the possibility of  mosaicism with potentially aneuploid populations and/or uniparental  disomy. The finding of any marker chromosome should prompt a thorough investigation for aneuploid cell lines. In the case of small  markers with no euchromatin the given risk of adverse phenotypic  effects should not be associated with the marker per se but with the  possible presence of a cryptic aneuploid cell line.",2003

A primagravida woman presented for amniocentesis at 17 weeks  gestation due to an elevated risk of Down syndrome of 1:102 on  serum screening. 2/40 amniotic fluid cells were trisomic for chromosome 2 while 38/40  revealed a normal male karyotype. 1 trisomic cell was detected in  each of 2 independent cultures, representing level III mosaicism. A male infant was delivered by caesarian section at 40 weeks  gestation. The birth weight was 3900g. Apart from a very small  patch of skin with white hair on the left temple the child appeared  normal. Samples of blood, placenta and placental membranes  were forwarded for cytogenetic analysis. 60, 40 and 44 cells were  examined from each sample respectively and no evidence of the  trisomic cell line was found. Subsequent assessment at 16 weeks indicated normal development  with age appropriate tone and reflexes. There are few reported cases of prenatally detected trisomy 2  mosaicism and therefore there is little information to help in the  counseling of such cases. Of the 3 previously reported cases of low  level trisomy 2 mosaicism, 2 resulted in still births while 1 resulted in  the birth of a normal child. Low level trisomy 2 mosaicism, found at amniocentesis, may be  associated with a normal outcome.",2003
STR germline mutations rate is not increased in  spontaneously aborted human embryos,P397.,"V. Nikitina , S. A. Nazarenko","Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation","Comparative study of the STR mutation rate in families with early  embryonic losses and in healthy families was carried out. DNA was  extracted from fetus sack tissues (abortuses) and peripheral blood  (liveborn individuals). We used polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  following PCR amplification of 14 tetranucleotide loci for 8 different  human autosomes (D2S1242, D9S768, D11S1983, D11S1304,  D16S2624, D16S685, D17S1113, D19S601, D19S394, D20S161,  D20S168, D21S11, D21S1435 and D21S1413) in 100 families with  karyotypically normal spontaneous abortuses and 70 families with  healthy children (control group). No evidence of deviation from Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium was observed for all loci studied. Using of many  highly polymorphic DNA markers allows to exclude the cases of  non paternity and children in care with great accuracy. Combination  of probability of paternity/maternity more than 99,999% with  single STR mismatches interpreted as an indication of a germline  mutation. Overall 4019 events of allelic transmission from the  parents to offspring were investigated. Average rate of STR germline  mutations was 4,9 x 10 3 per locus/gamete/generation in families  with miscarriages and 5,2 x 10 3 per locus/gamete/generation in  families with normal reproduction, without significant differences of  mutation rates between samplings (Ï2 = 0,04; P = 0,85). This result  is contradicts the report of Spandidos et al. (1998) about increased  germline mutation rate in spontaneous abortions. Thus, STR  mutations in gametes of parents with early embryonic losses and  STR mutations in gametes of parents with healthy children appear  with the same rate, and are transmitted to the next generation without  considerable influence on prenatal ontogenesis.",2003

Karyotypes by  standard cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniotic fluid cells were  compared to the FISH results. Out of 157 cases, the hybridization  reaction was informative in 135 (unsuccess in the beginning was  explainable by methodological failure). In the 135 samples, one  trisomy 21 and one monosomy X were detected and confirmed by  karyotyping. There were no false positive or false negative result.  Two cases of chromosomal rearrengement, not detectable by FISH,  were found by karyotyping. Maternal blood cell contamination,  even in macroscopically clear amniotic fluid, was found in seven  cases what could be clarified by the analysis of cultured cells. Our  conclusion is that rapid FISH analysis in interphase cells is an  accurate and sensitive method for prenatal screening of the most  common aneuploidies. However, special attention should be taken to exclude maternal cell  contamination. Before interphase FISH might be considered as a  screening approach alone, further studies are needed to analyse the  cost benefit relation and the validity of the results.",2003

Our current cohort consists of 279  probands (including 133 trios with both parents) and 241 ethnically  matched controls collected from Kent and Canterbury Hospital. We  are expanding our sample by collection elsewhere. EAAT1 (Glast) and EAAT2 (Glt 1) are two of the five high affinity  sodium dependant excitatory amino acid transporters responsible for  glutamate removal from the synapse and prevention of excitotoxic  levels in the extracellular space. Studies have suggested that these  transporters may contribute to epileptogenesis: elevated levels of  plasma glutamate in children with absence seizures and homozygous  mice deficient in EAAT2 exhibiting lethal spontaneous seizures. In this study we examined the association of variants of EAAT1  and 2 with susceptibility to IGE, using case control comparison. A  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) present in intron 7 of EAAT2  showed significant association (p=0.011).

While the clinical  consequences of UPD of chromosomes 15 are well established  (Prader Willi or Angelman syndrome), the association of UPDs  of chromosomes 6, 7 and 14 and a clinical picture is obvious but  needs further genotype phenotype correlation analysis. Acrocentric  chromosomes involved in Robertsonian translocations (RT) are Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics148 149 particularly prone to be affected by malsegregation events possibly  resulting in UPD. While UPDs of chromosomes 13, 21, and 22 have  no clinical consequences and therefore have no diagnostic impact,  prenatal testing for UPDs 14 or 15 is demanded more and more  often. Based on own data from molecular testing in 30 prenatal R T  cases and on findings published in the literature, we delineated a risk  of 0.3% for a UPD with clinical consequences for prenatally detected  carriers of a non homologous RT. Prenatal UPD testing is not  associated with any additional risk for the pregnancy once invasive  prenatal testing has been carried out. It can easily be performed  on cytogenetic cell cultures and is therefore recommended to the  parents. However, the possibly conflicting consequences in case  of a prenatal UPD identification should be discussed in advance.

","We present here a case of a 31 year old woman affected with  Alport syndrome (ATS), who asked for prenatal diagnosis. She  had microhematuria, without proteinuria, since age 13. Her blood  pressure and renal function was normal. Her father was transplanted  at the age of 52 years. Linkage with COL4A5 markers showed  that the male fetus received the grandfatherâs haplotype. On the  hypothesis of an X linked transmission, this finding predicted an  affected fetus. The mother gave birth to a male baby who at 9  months showed microhematuria. The hypothesis of an autosomal  dominant form of ATS was also indicated. After birth of the baby,  direct mutation analysis of COL4A4 resulted in the identification of a  mutation (p.G957R), that was present in the proband, her father and  the newborn baby. Extension of segregation analysis to a paternal  uncle with microhematuria and slightly impaired renal function by  the age of 59 and to a paternal healthy aunt demonstrated that the  mutation was present in the first and absent in the latter. These  results demonstrated that an autosomal dominant instead of an X  linked form of ATS segregates in this family .Our results confirm that  autosomal dominant forms of ATS are less rare than thought and that  prenatal diagnosis in ATS by linkage is unadvisable, because large  clinical and genetic heterogeneity makes inheritance unpredictable  in small families. This conclusion is critical because about 20 50% Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics150 151 of interviewed people found abortion acceptable in cases of an ATS  affected fetus.",2003

Odendaal1","1Tygerberg Hospital, Tygerberg, South Africa, 2Department of  Genetics, Stellenbosch, South Africa","Introduction Abruptio placentae, the premature separation of the placenta from  the uterine wall, is a devastating pregnancy complication resulting  in severe maternal and fetal morbidity or mortality. Maternal  hyperhomocysteinaemia (modulated by folate status, vitamin B6 and  B12 concentrations and genetic mutations) is a risk factor for abruptio  placentae. Hyperhomocysteinaemia is also associated with the  hypertensive pregnancy condition pre eclampsia. The purpose of this  study was to investigate homocysteine levels, genetic polymorphisms  in the methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene and  haematological parameters in 100 consecutive patients with abruptio  placentae and to correlate this with clinical outcome. Methods 100 consecutive patients with abruptio placentae and 100 matched  controls were recruited after delivery. Fasting homocysteine, genetic  status of the C677T and A1298C polymorphisms in the MTHFR gene  and full blood count at delivery were determined. Results 30% of patients with abruptio had raised homocysteine levels (above  11mmol/l) versus 11% of the control group (OR 2.36, 95% CI 1.05  5.35). The mean homocysteine level in the abruptio group (8.6mmol/l)  was significantly higher than the control group (4.8mmol/l), p<0.001.  The mean homocysteine level was significantly higher in study  patients where the pregnancy was complicated by pre eclampsia  as well (9.6mmol/l vs 6.3mmol/l; p<0.001). The maternal and fetal  allele frequency (respectively) of the mutant T allele of the C677T  polymorphism was not different between study and control groups  (0.11 and 0.17 vs. 0.08 and 018). Conclusion Abruptio placentae is only associated with hyperhomocysteinaemia  when there is concurrent pre eclampsia and is not associated with  known variations in the MTHFR gene.",2003

Methods  A genetic computer exam was designed by Clinical  Geneticists (CGs) and Educational Specialists consisting of 215  questions divided over 194 case histories and divided into three  categories: a) necessary, b) desirable and c) useful for the daily  practice. By assigning one point for each correct answer a genetic  exam score was calculated, expressed in the percentage correctly  answered questions. Three sub scores were created for the above  mentioned categories (a c). After a validation study among 11 Non  Medical students, 11 nearly graduated MDs, and 10 CGs, showing  ascending scores as expected from these groups, this exam was  completed by a study sample of 291 nearly graduated MDs from 7  different Medical Schools.

Molecular genetics provides diagnostic tests for familial cases of  dementias with autosomal dominant inheritance and predictive  genetic tests for risk factors. Genetic testing might allow more  accurate diagnostic procedures and provide the opportunity to  develop adequate plans for later life and, eventually, to take  advantage of innovative therapeutic interventions. However, providing  genetic diagnoses to a healthy individual who could be at risk for  dementia raises ethical concerns. In our study, we have been looking for the presence of potential  predictors of test intentions, in order to establish a more accurate  approach and future guidelines for genetic counselling in dementias. Our sample includes 134 subjects (57% women) recruited in families  with 2 or more demented patients; their mean age is 47.5 Â± 11.1  years and mean education is 11.3 Â± 4.2 years. Seventy five percent  are married and 84% employed; 72% have children and 87% are a  first degree relative. The assessment deals with the following domain  areas: psychological, social, socio demographic, pathological,  dementia attitudes, beliefs and experiences.

Not every nurse  needs to be an expert in genetics, but independently of the specialty ,  this professional have a role in delivering genetic health care and  managing genetic information. The purpose of this study was to  evaluate, by a questionnaire, beliefs about genetics, nursing and  the actual curriculum in a group of undergraduate nursing students  (66), the Maternal Child Nursing Departmentâs professors (13), and  their interplay with the opinions of the Genetics professors (9). Data  analyses involved quantitative and qualitative methods. In the student  group, 88% answered that genetics is important, because it has  application in the nurseâs quotidian, in the comprehension of the basic  mechanisms of inheritance, diagnosis, planning, developing, and  implementing an individualized plan of care for people with genetic  disease. Six percent have abstained, because they have no idea  about the correlation between genetics and nursing. In general, the  students (83%) expressed the necessity of changes relating to the  course content and its length of time, including the new and exciting  instructional modalities to assist in teaching constantly changing  genetics content. This study reinforces the needs to extend this work  to other nursing school, and we are performing an on going national  research project to assess the type and amount of genetics content in  the graduate nursing programs in our country.",2003
The interactional framing of moral dimensions in  genetic counselling discourse,P432.,"Sarangi1, K. Bennert1, L. Howell1, A. Clarke2","1Health Communication Research Centre, Cardiff University, United  Kingdom, 2Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College  of Medicine, United Kingdom","Interactions between healthcare professionals and patients have  been characterised within sociolinguistic and communication  research as a tension between the medical and the social. According  to the stronger version, the voice of medicine inhabited by the  medical experts is juxtaposed to the voice of the lifeworld inhabited  by the patients. The weaker version holds that the medical and  lifeworld voices are dispersed among the healthcare `expertsâ and the  `layâ patients for their preferred social agendas. In the context of genetic counselling for predictive testing, it is  suggested that the two concepts â `medicalâ and `socialâ â need  to be reassessed along the moral dimensions (to include is/ought  formulations, attributions of responsibility/blame, maintenance  of professional neutrality etc). The different components such as  laboratory test results, clinical symptoms, family inheritance which  make up oneâs current genetic status assume moral significance with  regard to consequences for other family members including the yet Genetic Counselling and Genetic Education154 155 unborn, lifestyle choices and so on. Conflicting demands may thus  arise from the imperatives of patient autonomy and confidentiality  and the wishes and rights (âto know or not to knowâ) of other family  members. Using the methodology of interactional and thematic  mapping of 50 audio recorded and transcribed genetic counselling  sessions (part of a larger Wellcome Trust funded project), we present  findings across different genetic conditions. Our analysis focuses  on how various participants (counsellor, nurse, client and family  members) selectively orient towards individual and/or family concerns  while foregrounding issues of responsibilities, motives and rights (not)  to know vis Ã  vis disclosure of genetic information.",2003
Strategies of risk relativisation in counselling for  predictive genetic testing,P433.,"Sarangi1, K. Bennert1, L. Howell1, A. Clarke2","1Health Communication Research Centre, Cardiff University, United  Kingdom, 2Institute of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College  of Medicine, United Kingdom","The activity of risk communication in healthcare settings is contingent  upon the associated notions of uncertainty, normality and decision  making. Focusing on genetic counselling for predictive testing, we  point out that because there is `medicalâ uncertainty surrounding such  testing, the discourse of risk assessment concerning an unwanted  event is articulated in terms of likelihood (in probabilistic language)  and relative aversiveness (in subjective, emotive language) of  the different possible test results. Based on transcribed audio  recorded clinic data from counselling for HD, HNPCC and FBC  (part of a larger Wellcome Trust funded project), a distinction is  made between the risk of the genetic disorder manifesting and the  risk of problems that might arise from undergoing genetic tests. In  a given counselling session, both types of risk â the strictly genetic  risk of disease, and the more contextual risk of âknowingâ â become  conflated, and in fact the risk of disease is understood in the light  of the other, external risk factors. We suggest the analytic notion  of relativisation to capture this dynamics and identify six discourse  strategies (abstraction, reformulation, externalisation, localisation,  temporalisation, agentivisation). Although it is not possible to  determine the exact valency of these discourse strategies and  plot them into a continuum, we argue that they are selectively and  cumulatively drawn upon by both counsellors and clients to escalate  or de escalate the risks under discussion. These manoeuvres serve  to manage the pragmatically informed decision making process,  while simultaneously attending to the relevant epistemological levels  of uncertainty.",2003

Rating scales and open ended questions to explain their rating were  used. The response rate was 60% for GPs, 58% for midwives and 33%  for nurses. The acceptability ratings for predictive testing for HBC  and HD in adults and for HD in adolescents were predominantly  favourable. However, predictive testing for HD in a child at the  parentsâ request was also judged favourably by about half the  respondents. Predictive testing for HBC in an adult was rated as more acceptable  than testing for HD, mainly because prevention and treatment are  unavailable for HD. The GPsâ ratings for testing for HBC were less  favourable than the nursesâ and midwivesâ ratings. Prophylactic  mastectomy was considered as a controversial risk reducing option  by half the respondents. Favourable ratings for testing an adolescent were mostly explained  by respect for personal autonomy. More negative opinions about  predictive testing for HD in a child at the parentsâ request were  motivated by the childâs right not to know, and by psychological and  medical arguments.

The impact of Presymptomatic Testing for  Huntingtonâs Disease on marital relationships and  partners.,P443.,"M. Bruce , S. A. Simpson, J. Semper","Grampian University HospitalsTrust, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","Huntingtonâs Disease (HD) is an adult onset autosomal dominant  neurodegenerative disorder usually developing between the ages  of 30 and 50. Three classic clinical features are associated with HD:  movement disorder, personality changes and cognitive impairment.  One distressing factor is that it strikes in the prime of life, when social  responsibilities and personal and financial possibilities are greatest.  Individuals have often married and had children before they had any  knowledge of the family history of HD or their own risk. Individuals with HD exhibit a high degree of personality and  behavioural changes. The spouse has to cope with their deteriorating  partnerâs physical needs and disabilities and also with slowly losing  a companion and life long partner. Intimacy, friendship and decision  making deteriorate to the point when many spouses feel that the individual they are caring for is no longer the person they married. Accurate presymptomatic testing has been available since 1993,  but studies tend to focus on the person at risk, rather than their  partner. The partner is sharing the life of the person at risk, and  must be empowered during the decision making process and given  care and support after the result is given. We have investigated  effects of having kept secret a family history of HD, and the effects  of presymptomatic testing for HD on the marriages and intimate  relationships of 39 couples. Good communication with the person at  risk and the clinicians dealing with them are essential regardless of  whether the people are given favourable or unfavourable results.",2003

Clinical features include movement disorder, personality changes  and cognitive impairment. Deterioration progresses until excessive  weight loss and uncoordinated swallow with risk of aspiration occurs.  Feeding using percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) has  been suggested as a means of providing additional calories.PEG  feeding raises a number of ethical issues because it is a form of  artificial feeding, and it does not remove the risk of aspiration. It will  not cure HD, but it may sustain life. There has been little debate  about withholding or withdrawal of such feeding which some view  as treatment and others as basic care, yet the dilemma occurs  frequently as the HD patient deteriorates. We surveyed the views of  HD patients, relatives, carers and healthcare professionals regarding  a patientâs right to choice with regard to PEG feeding in the end stage  of HD. The minority of doctors encouraged patients to discuss issues  of end life care and very few doctors sought their patientâs opinion  regarding PEG feeding early in the natural history of HD despite  93% of respondents stating that the patient should be allowed to  make the decision.

"Learning from history   The geneticist Hans  Nachtsheim, human experimentation in the National  Socialism, and functional genomics",P447.,von Schwerin,"Zentrum fÃ¼r Human  und Gesundheitswissenschaften der Berliner  Hochschulmedizin, Berlin, Germany","The historical study I present deals with (human) genetics in  Germany and asks how normal science can be become criminal.  It is commonly believed that only âpseudo scienceâ is compatible  with moral offence. This argument derives to some extent from the  perception of science under National Socialism. Back then, German  geneticists and medical geneticists participated deliberately in forced  sterilisation, racial politics and criminal human experimentation.  After the war this was seen as due to ideological deformation of  ânormalâ science. An equation of ânormalâ and morally âgoodâ science  was thereby emphatically implied. But besides Nazis, anti Semites  or racists, apolitical or even liberal thinking scientists practising  ânormalâ science were actively involved in criminal action. Therefore,  it is an urgent task to differentiate and understand the processes  leading to transgression of moral boundaries. The case of Hans  Nachtsheim (1890 1979), for example, is alarming. Nachtsheim was  an internationally well regarded integrative figure of post war German  human genetics. Though he was always opposed to anti Semitism  and racial politics, for many years nobody knew that he had used  children from a sanatorium for dangerous experiments in 1943.  Clearly, the participation of scientists in the holocaust makes their  crimes incomparable. But worse, even skilfully performed and freely  practised (experimental) science has its own dangerous tendencies.  In this aspect, Nachtsheimâs case is relevant to research in functional  genomics today. His example shows why we should be aware that the dramatically  increasing need for clinical data essential to functional genomics  might lead scientists to transgress moral boundaries.",2003

Fathers more frequently  had problems with understanding and accepting the facts, and they  were more radical in decisions to send child to an institution rather  than raise the child in the family. Younger and childless couples more  frequently decided to send child in some institution, than those with  one or more older children.

This thematic priority comprises two areas: Advanced genomics and its applications for health, where the  emphasis will be on multidisciplinary research to generate new  technologies and new knowledge in fundamental genomics of all  organisms to underpin applications to human health; Combating major diseases, emphasising research aimed at bringing  basic knowledge through to the application stage, to enable  consistent and coordinated progress at the European level in  medicine and improve the quality of life. Europe has outstanding research capacities in human genetics but is  not able to perform as well as some of its international competitors.  This is due to structural and organisational differences between  national research systems and a general lack of coherence among  national and European efforts. The European Commissionâs (EC)  policy initiative to realise a European Research Area (ERA) is aimed  at addressing such structural problems in European research. Under  the Fifth Framework Programme (1998 2002), the EC is funding Genetic Services, Genetic Screening, and Public Policy158 159 projects that address the need for better cooperation and coordination  between population genetics programmes (e.g. GenomEUtwin,  Cogene, Biobanks for Health). In the Sixth Framework Programme,  the EC aims to strengthen Europeâs competitive position in human  genetics and to encourage the spreading of research excellence and  progress towards the ERA policy objectives. In this presentation,  current and future aspects of EC support for human genetics will be  reviewed. Ref: Framework Programme 6 website www.cordis.lu/fp6",2003
Living with BRCA1/BRCA2 test results: Womenâs  post test experiences,P451.,"Nippert , B. Teige, J.

Little is known  about womenâs post test experiences. Methods:  At the Department  of Human Genetics, UKM, Germany, women at increased risk are  offered BRCA1/BRCA2 testing. Pre  and post test counseling is  mandatory. Out of 50 women who underwent testing the last 2 years  and who have obtained test results at least 6 months ago were  asked to participate in a follow up interview. 46 women agreed to  participate. A standardized questionnaire addressing questions such  as: communicating risks to family members; conflicts with family  members because of test results; positive and negative experiences;  decision regret; availability of preventive surveillance; etc. was  administered by telephone interview. Results:  58.7% report that  their main reason to undergo testing was to know more about their  personal risk; 60.1% wanted their children to have certainty about a  hereditary risk; 23.9% wanted to know their risk in order to optimize  personal future plans. 23.9% reported that they only underwent  testing because other family members asked them; 52.2% wanted to  optimize prevention. More than 98% consulted with family members  and all informed, albeit, selectively other family members about  the result. 13% expressed decision regret and 87% would undergo  testing again, 60.9% would recommend the test to other women  at increased risk. Discussion:  Few women who undergo predictive  BRCA1/BRCA2 testing after a pre  and post test counseling protocol  express decision regret after a â¥ 6 month period.",2003

Preconceptional  carrier screening allows couples at risk to arrive at informed  reproductive decisions. In this project desirability and feasibility of a  combined offer of preconceptional CF and HbP carrier screening are  studied. The following research questions will be addressed: 1) Will  it be possible to develop a valid instrument to support invitees for  preconceptional carrier screening in deciding which disorder could  be screened for in their particular case (only CF, only HbPs, both or  none)? 2) How will people in the Dutch multi ethnic society react to a  combined offer of preconceptional CF and HbP carrier screening,  making use of the above instrument ? Methods: After pre testing, 150 people are asked to read educational  material and arrive at a decision by following our decision support  material. Then they are interviewed about the origin of their ancestors  to see whether their decision through our instrument was correct.  The validated instrument will be used during a screening study, in  which people aged 20 35 years will receive the educational material  and decision instrument from either their general practitioner or the  Municipal Health Services. Those who come forward for testing will  complete questionnaires before and after testing and at six months  follow up. Questionnaires will focus on determinants of participation,  reproductive intentions and unwanted side effects.Results: First results will be available at the conference.",2003

"," In thirteen large kinships with autosomal dominant arrhythmogenic  right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) from Newfoundland,  segregation of the condition is linked to a highly conserved founder  haplotype at 3p25. Clinical diagnosis is often difficult, but research  is gradually defining the natural history and genetic epidemiology of  the condition. 50% of males at high genetic risk have sustained a  fatal cardiac event by age 40 years, compared with 5% of high risk  females. The risk of sudden death can be managed by implantable  cardiac defibrillator. Haplotype information from research studies within families allows  more accurate definition of those at high genetic risk, and can be  used to direct diagnostic and treatment procedures. This use of  research information for clinical management presents a number of  ethical challenges related to patientsâ/research participantsâ rights to  know or not know their genetic status, and the researchersâ/cliniciansâ   duties of care to individuals at risk. Should different standards  of disclosure, confidentiality, and duty of care apply because the  information and samples originally collected through research now  have clinical application? How should we respond when an affected parent with a defibrillator,  declines to burden his sons with knowledge of their genetic risk?  Conversely, where does the researcherâs duty lie when children  decline to hear their genetic information, and pursue careers that may  consequently put the public at risk?

One possible target group are couples planning a pregnancy  (preconceptional screening), providing a maximum number of  reproductive options and a minimum time constraints. Aim: To identify obstacles to the implementation of a national  preconceptional CF carrier screening programme, to find out how  potential providers and the target population think the screening  should be implemented, and to determine whether potential providers  think they are able to provide the screening programme. Methods: A survey was conducted among 200 general practitioners  (GPs), 134 Municipal Health Service (MHS) workers and 303 recently  married couples. Results: In general, potential providers and the target population had  a positive attitude towards CF carrier screening. Preferred methods of  informing the target population were: using leaflets (77% of GPs, 89%  of MHS workers), during a GP consultation for those people seeking  advice before pregnancy (62% of GPs and the target population), and  sending a personal invitation to people of reproductive age (53% of  the target population). Potential providers believed that they would  be able to provide the screening programme. Important perceived  obstacles were the absence of a preconceptional care setting, high  workload, and lack of financial resources. Conclusion: Different intervention strategies will be necessary to  overcome the obstacles in the implementation. The positive attitude  towards preconceptional CF carrier screening in combination with the  willingness of the potential providers to participate in the screening  programme, will make it easier to overcome the obstacles.",2003

Access to health care for ethnic minorities in the multi ethnic  populations of Northern Europe is unsatisfactory. Awareness is  often insufficient among the the population and in the first line of  local health systems. It is essential to develop effective channels of  communication, and careful consideration of culture based elements  is necessary to improve effectiveness and usefulness information in  multi ethnic societies. Haemoglobin disorders, which are common in  ethnic minority groups but are rare in the autochthonous population  of Northern Europe are largely neglected and need special attention.  Based on existing experience in several countries, we have studied  the effect of information and communication on the management and  prevention of haemoglobin disorders. We report the present situation,  existing tools, and proposed actions agreed during a recent meeting  of a North European Working Party on Haemoglobin Disorders.  At present there is wide variation in the quality and accessibility  of information, âstate of the artâ patient care, carrier detection and  prevention in non endemic countries .

Testing for genetic  disorders is usually carried out in molecular genetic diagnostic  laboratories. However, as commercial kits become available,  molecular genetic testing for more common inherited disorders such  as cystic fibrosis is increasingly being carried out in general pathology  laboratories and commercial centers.  External quality assessment (EQA) schemes (or proficiency testing)  for cystic fibrosis have been organized over the past six years  with 135 to 206 participating diagnostic laboratories. A significant  improvement of the quality of genotyping results was obtained during  subsequent QA schemes, coming from 65% of laboratories without  errors in 1996 up to a more or less constant level of approximately  90% since 1999. During these years new commercial kits and  methodology became available and were being applied in many  diagnostic laboratories. However, the use of a commercial kit alone  does not ensure high accuracy of mutation analysis: results of the  EQA schemes demonstrated that laboratories which implement a  new commercial kit or methodology for mutation analysis of CF (e.g.  OLA, INNO Lipa, Elucigene, DHPLC) made more mistakes during the  implementation period. Nevertheless, these methods were already  being used for mutation detection in their routine laboratory. External quality assessment schemes and the use of reference  materials or certified test samples are possible routes to help the  laboratories to improve their quality. Laboratories should be aware of  the importance to implement quality assurance systems that include  validation of the used procedures.",2003

The Multiplex Ligation  dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) is a new technique allowing  relative quantification of up to 40 different nucleic acid sequences in  a single reaction (Ref 1). We evaluated MLPA for potential use in the  diagnostic setting. We used commercially available (Trisomy, HNPCC, and BRCA1)  and prototype (CMT, VHL, MEN1 and SMA) kits manufactured by  MRC Holland following the protocol supplied. Analysis was carried  out using an ABI 3100 with Genotyper results exported to an Excel  spreadsheet. Over 400 assays were performed. Assay time was Genetic Services, Genetic Screening, and Public Policy160 161 under 24 hours, with less than 2 hours hand on time, including data  analysis. For each locus, peak heights of the test and control samples were  compared using the dosage quotient method of Yau et al. Over 90%  of samples gave reproducible results, although dilute or low quality  DNA samples gave poor results. The results obtained in normal and  mutation controls were consistent with other techniques, and single  exon deletions were confirmed by PCR. In conclusion, we have found that MLPA compares favourably with  other available techniques based on cost, time, sensitivity and  reproducibility. We propose that it represents a realistic option for  gene dosage analysis in the diagnostic laboratory. 1) Schouten et al., 2002 Nucleic Acids Research 30 e57 2) Yau et al., 1996 Journal of Medical Genetics 33 p550 558",2003

"Social, Ethical and Legal Aspects of Storage of  Dried Blood Spots",P465.,"Kharaboyan , D. M. Avard","University of Montreal, Montreal, PQ, Canada","Blood spots collected from newborns during the first few days of  birth, are tested for a number of treatable diseases and then stored  to ensure proper follow up. Although dried blood spots (DBS) are  mainly used for diagnosis and prevention, they also served for  quality assurance of screening programs and for the development  of improved assays. When stored, DBS make up an extensive  genetic database as well as an easily accessible resource for  researchers. Indeed, requests for DBS have accrued as scientists,  law enforcement agencies, persons wishing to establish paternity and  others have realized that blood spots are a valuable source of genetic  information. With the availability of such a vast amount of genetic  information, certain questions arise as to the social, ethical and  legal questions pertaining to the storage and secondary use of DBS.  Fallen into the wrong hands, identifiable blood samples can threaten  the privacy of the child or of the childâs family. To ensure that good  intentions do not lead to undesired adverse consequences, model  consent forms and educational materials, addressing length and  purpose of storage and access to and destruction of stored samples  are required. Policies are also needed to regulate the utilisation of bloodspots for research use, for law enforcement, in government  DNA databases, and even by health insurance companies. Our  poster presentation will provide a comparative review of international,  national and regional official statements that address these issues  and present possible recommendations for data storage and research  use.",2003

South asian women were less likely to act in line  with their attitudes towards screening than were white women (64%  vs 78%, chi square =10.4, p=0.001), with 55% of south asian women  with positive attitudes towards having the test not having it compared  with just 27% of white women (Difference 28%, 95% CI diff 15,41). Conclusion: There is no evidence that the choice to forego DS  screening in south asian women reflects less positive attitudes  towards undergoing the test. Rather the results suggest that lower  uptake reflects lower rates of informed choice in women from south  asian. Rates of informed choice could be increased by first increasing  knowledge and second helping those with positive attitudes towards  the test",2003

Age, blood  pressure, and body weight are known determinants of left ventricular  mass. We estimated the strength of the genetic component, i.e. the  heritability of left ventricular mass and related echocardiographic  parameters by analysing sibling correlation and by variance  component analysis (using the program SOLAR). The study population consisted of 218 normotensive individuals with  LVH and their siblings. We found a substantial heritability of LV mass  (h2 = 0.33, p=0.0002) and LV internal systolic diameter (LVISD)  (h2 = 0.50, p<0.0001), which represents a measure of cardiac  contractility. Whereas part of the heritability of LV mass is due to  genes influencing body weight and blood pressure, LVISD seems  to be more uninfluenced by these parameters. The relatively high  heritability renders a search for genes involved in the determination  of left ventricular mass and contractility (as measured by LVISD)  promising. Knowledge of genes underlying these traits would be of  great interest, since it could eventually lead to better preventive and  therapeutical management of cardiovascular disease.Genetic Services, Genetic Screening, and Public Policy162 163",2003

LVH in essential hypertension (EH)  is a complex phenotype that results from a combination of genetic,  physiologic, and environmental factors. In patients with hypertrophic  cardiomyopathy (HCM) the phenotypic expression of LVH is variable,  indicating a potential role of modifying genes. The case/control study was designed to assess the contribution  of two polymorphisms of the renin angiotensin system: A2350G  in exon 17 of the angiotensin converting enzyme gene (ACE) and  A1166C in 3âUTR of the angiotensin II type 1 receptor gene (AGTR1)  to the development of LVH in samples of Russian patients with  EH (n=91) and HCM (n=29). Left ventricular mass (LVM) and LVM  index were determined by echocardiography. It has been found that  EH patients with LVH differ from patients without LVH by allele and  genotype distribution for both investigated SNPs. LVM was increased  with the number of G alleles of the A2350G polymorphism of ACE  (225,81Â±84,43; 276,10Â±88,98; 315,56Â±136,06 g in EH patients with  AA, AG, and GG genotype, respectively; P=0,023) and with the C  allele number of A1166C of AGTR1 (243,97Â±88,82; 300,11Â±116,14;  305,14Â±99,87 in subjects with AA, AC, and CC genotype,  respectively; P=0,038). The same pattern was observed for LVM  index for both polymorphisms in EH patients. For HCM patients,  association either with ACE or AGTR1 SNPs was not detected. These  data indicate that the variants of ACE and AGTR1 genes contribute to  the development of LVH in patients with EH.",2003

II) Non affected members (11).  Probable diagnosis: catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular  tachycardia (CPVT): familiar disorder due to calcium channel  mutation, involving the ryanodine type 2 receptor (chromosome  1, hRyR2).

","Long  QT Syndrome (LQTs)  is a cardiovascular disorder  characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on ECG and  presence of syncope, seizures, and sudden death. Five genes have  been implicated in Romano Ward Syndrome (RWS), the autosomal  dominant form of LQTs: KvLQT1 (11p15.5), HERG (7q35 36), SCN5A  (3p21 24), KCNE1 and KCNE2 (both at locus 21q22). Mutations  in KvLQT1 and KCNE1 also cause the Jervell and Lang Nielsen  Syndrome (JLNS), a form of LQTs associated with deafness,  inherited in an autosomal recessive form. We used mutational analyses to screen LQTs patients from 35  families for mutations in the KvLQT1 , HERG and KCNE1 , genes  encoding cardiac ion channel subunits. In 27 unrelated LQTs patients,  single strand conformation polymorphism (SSCP) analyses identified  aberrant conformers. DNA sequence analyses of these aberrant  conformers determined three missense mutations of KvLQT1 gene,  localized in the transmembrane domains S6 (G325R , G350A),or in  pore region (T309I) and one missense mutation R534C, localized in  S4 region of HERG channel. Two of them (G350A and T309I)were  novel. We also identified four different single nucleotide polymorphisms Genetic Services, Genetic Screening, and Public Policy162 163 (SNPs) in KvLQT1 and two SNPs in HERG among the patients and  wild type controls.

"," The KCNE genes  encode a family of small type I transmembrane  proteins with one membrane spanning segment whose role in  potassium channel regulation is emerging. Although they themselves  do not form functional ion channels, they associate with a variety  of voltage gated K+ channels and exert control over gating kinetics,  voltage dependence, drug sensitivity and conductance. The  importance of the KCNEs is reflected by the mutations within these  proteins that are linked to human genetic disease steming from  defective repolarization of cardiac (hereditary Long  QT syndrome),  sporadic and drug induced Long  QT syndrome. The first member  of the family, KCNE1  encodes the minK protein and associates with  another Long QT syndrome linked protein, KvLQT1, to produce the  slowly activating delayed rectifier K+ current, Iks.  Here we describe using of novel SSCP  analysis adapted to the  modern capillary electrophoresis  (CE) system, which takes  advantage of laser induced fluorescence detection. SSCP system  based on either slab gel electrophoresis or capillary electrophoresis  have been developed. Firstly, we optimized conditions for SSCP of  KCNE1 gene by the slab gel electrophoresis and then by the CE in  standard ABI 310 genetic analyser. Our first results show important advantages compared to slab gel  system: higher analysis speed, lower reagent consumption and  maximization of detection efficiency.

PATIENTS AND METHOD: To obtain molecular data, genomic DNA  from 51 patients and asymptomatic at risk members belongs to 20  affected families and 28 normal control were amplified in the involved  region by polymerase chain reaction. The CAG repeat numbers  varied from 40 to 74 (median: 52.6) in HD patients and asymptomatic  carriers, while individuals of the normal control group had 7 34 CAG  repeat numbers (median: 17.9). In our study age of onset varied  from 17 to 56. We observed a significant increase of repeat size  for paternal transmission of the disease and greater instability for  paternally transmitted CAG repeats in the HD size range There were  large CAG repeats (74 copies) in paternally transmitted HD case with  early onset (age 17).CONCLUSION: Data generated from this study  may have significant implications for the etiology, knowledge of the  incidence, diagnosis, prognosis, genetic counseling and treatment of  HD Iranian patients.

The quantitative methods most commonly used for this purpose,  namely Southern blotting, quantitative PCR and Fluorescent in  situ Hybridisation (FISH), are either technically demanding, time  consuming or not always applicable. Although relatively slow and  expensive, due to its reliability FISH is usually the preferred method.  We have previously described a method for the detection of deletions  and duplications, applied to the analysis of Duchenne muscular  dystrophy patients. Multiplex Amplifiable Probe Hybridisation (MAPH)  scans all 79 exons of the DMD gene in two parallel reactions  using capillary electrophoresis. Here we present an adaptation of  this method for determining carrier status. Based on the mutation  detected in the index case a series of probes are chosen within  and outside the deleted/duplicated region, as well as several from  unlinked loci. Following the MAPH hybridisation and PCR the  amplification products are separated on Agilentâs Lab on a chip,  which processes and analyses 12 samples in 30 minutes. As several  independent probes are used, the method is not only fast but also  reliable. To date we have unambiguously confirmed the status of  15 DMD carriers. We are currently testing the method in diseases  where FISH is the diagnostic method of choice, including the Wolf  Hirschhorn, Sotos and Weaver syndromes.

Decisions are discussed by the steering  commitee, including the WU co ordinators and reference experts.  Laboratories participate anonymously, identified by a code number. The main activities of the Project are external quality control trials on : 1) cytogenetics (prenatal, postnatal including oncological) 2) molecular genetics (cystic fibrosis, beta thalassemia, X fragile  syndrome, APC gene). Two external quality control trials were performed during the two  years on cytogenetics and molecular genetics, respectively. In this second year a higher number of laboratories were enrolled (74  laboratories vs 68) and the percentage of response increased by 5%  (from 88.23% in the first year to 93.24% in the second). In this report, we take into account: a) a comparison between the  results obtained by laboratories which participated both in the fi rst  and in the second trial; b) results obtained by laboratories which  were enrolled during the second year of the Project. In particular , the  same level of performance was mantained in postnatal cytogenetics  diagnosis, cystic fibrosis and APC gene tests; whereas a significant  improvement was observed for beta thalassemia.

Outsourcing DNA Purification to Streamline  Genetic Analyses.,P485.,"M. Holder1, R. Peck1, M. Collier1, T. Gill2","1Whatman International, Ely, United Kingdom, 2Whatman  International, Maidstone, United Kingdom","Sample collection and purification is the first and often most important  part of any genetic analysis. Without high purity and high quality  DNA, downstream applications can be easily compromised and  valuable samples and resources can be wasted. Blood quality can vary widely dependent on method of collection,  storage conditions, blood age and anti coagulant used. As such,  many automated and kit based products for the purification of DNA  from blood can often have difficulty in achieving reliable, high yielding  and high purity DNA from the wide range of samples encountered.  Manual methods are therefore the only choice for many sample types  to achieve the required quality and recovery rates necessary for  specific applications and long term DNA banking.

Mutations in the heavy subunit,  rBAT, coded by SLC3A1 gene, cause type I cystinuria while mutations  in the light subunit bo,+AT, coded by SLC7A9 gene, mostly cause  non type I cystinuria. Up to now mutations have been found in 87% of  the non type I chromosomes, in 76% of the type I chromosomes and  in 72% of the untyped chromosomes studied but there still are 23% of  unexplained alleles. The existance of another gene or modifier genes  for cystinuria could explain these alleles. In this sense two members  of LSHAT, asc 1 and LAT 2 could be good candidates: 1) Asc 1 gene  (SLC7A10) localizes at chromosome 19q13.1, near SLC7A9 in the  critical region for non typeI cystinuria and shows high homology  with SLC7A9. 2) LAT 2 (SLC7A8) is involved in trans epithelial  flux of cysteine and could modulate cystine reabsorption, is highly  expressed in the epithelial cells of the proximal convulted tubule of  the nephron, the region responsible of cystine reabsortion. We have  found nucleotid changes in SLC7A8 and SLC7A10, in 39 Spanish  patients in which none or one mutation had been found in SLC7A9  and SLC3A1, that could play a role in the cystinuric phenotype.Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Biochemical Genetics168 169",2003

We have  diagnosed twenty one patients with this disorder at our institue over  the last 15yrs. Nine patients have lost follow up and mostly were  before the introduction of enzyme replacement therapy (ERT. The  diagnosis was confirmed by measurment of glucocerebrosidase in  leucocytes. One patient had bone marrow transplantation and is  doing well. Eleven patients were started on ERT. Among this group  one died at a different institute of unclear cause. Two have lost  follow up. Currently 8 patients are on replacement therapy with the  recombinant enzyme Imiglucerase, and have regular follow up at our  institue. The symptoms and signs of the disease in all patients started  in infancy with hepatosplenomegally as the main manifestation. The  full clinical presentation of these patients and response to therapy will  be discussed.

","Case reports:  The index patient was a monozygotic female twin (20  years old) with a medical history of collateral ureteroceles that were  surgically corrected at the age of 3 years. At the age of 17 years  the patient developed increasing proteinuria of more than 2g/24 h  with slightly diminished creatinine clearance of 77,2 ml/min/1,73  mÂ² and serum creatinine levels of 1,09 mg/dl. Angiokeratoma were  evident. There were no other symptoms of Fabry disease. Because  of proteinuria a kidney biopsy was done, from which the diagnosis of  Fabry disease was made. The molecular gene analysis confirmed the  diagnosis. The clinical presentation of the second female twin included only  proteinuria of 230 mg/24h with a creatinine clearance of 101 ml/min/ 1,73 mÂ² and serum creatinine of 0,84 mg/dl. She had angiokeratoma  and recurrent burning pain in the fingertips. In the molecular gene  analysis the same mutation as in the first twin was detected.

Phenylketonuria mutations at the phenylalanine  hydroxylase gene in population of Moldova.,P509.,"P. Gavriliuc , S. A. Groppa","Research Institute of Mother & Child Health Care, Chisinau, Republic  of Moldova","Introduction. Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an autosomal recessive  disease that results from a reduction in phenylalanine hydroxylase  (PAH) activity. The PAH gene has been cloned and mapped to  chromosome 12q22 24.1 and it spans approximately 90kb. The cDNA  is 2.5kb long and contains 13 exons that vary in length from 150 to  350bp. Methods.  In this study we examined 48 Moldavian families with  classical PKU. Genomic DNA from patients and parents was  extracted from whole blood using standard procedures. PCR amplification was performed for various exons of the PAH gene  as described previously. A diagnostic test for the presence of  PAH mutations was performed by digesting the PCR amplified  DNA with restriction enzymes StyI, DdeI, MspI, AvaI, HinfI and  RsaI. The fragments were separated by 7.5% polyacrylamide gel  electrophoresis and stained by ethidium bromide. Results. A total of 100 mutant PKU alleles were analysed for 8  prevalent Caucasian mutations in the PAH gene. The most common  molecular defect was R408W (51%), with a very high degree of  homozygosity (34.2%). The P281L mutation accounted 6 per cent of  all mutant alleles, R158Q and R252W for 3% each. Rarer mutations  included IVS10nt546, R261Q and IVS12nt1, at 2% each. The I65T  mutation, that has been predominantly described for moderate PKU,  was not detected in our population. Conclusion.  Mutation analysis  in the population of Moldova identifies 71% of PKU alleles, and is  suitable for carrier detection and direct prenatal diagnosis.",2003

It is characterized by  hyperphenylalaninemia leading to impaired cognitive development  and function. Characterization of the molecular basis of PKU in Latvia has been  accomplished through analysis of 96 unrelated chromosomes from  50 Latvian PKU patients. PAH gene mutations have been analyzed  through a two step approach. First, PAH exons 5, 7, 11 and 12 were  tested for the R158Q, R252W, R261Q, G272X, IVS10nt 11g>a and  R408W mutations by PCR followed where necessary by digestion  with the appropriate diagnostic enzyme. Subsequently âbroad rangeâ   denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis analysis of the 13 PAH gene  exons was used to study uncharacterized PKU chromosomes. A  mutation detection rate of 98% was achieved. 12 different mutations  were found, with the most frequent mutation, R408W, accounting for  76 % of Latvian PKU alleles. Six mutations (R408W, E280K, R158Q,  A104D, R261Q and P281L) represent 92 % of PKU chromosomes. 28 (58 %) of 48 completely characterized PKU patients are  homozygous for R408W, the remaining 20 patients are compound  heterozygotes. This is consistent with the fact that most Latvian  PKU patients have the classical form of the disease. These results  show a high degree of homogeneity in the molecular basis of PKU  in Latvia. PAH VNTR and STR alleles have also been identified and  minihaplotype associations with PKU mutations were determined.",2003

Three  patients (including two siblings) were diagnosed with PKU based  on the presence of highly elevated levels of phenylalanine in the  urine and blood samples (by HPLC analysis). All the 13 exons of  the PAH gene were PCR amplified by using primers listed in http: //www.geneticahumana.lt/MOLGENT_pages/PAH protocols.htm.  DNA sequencing was carried out for both strands of the 13 exons for  all three patients. We report here two novel mutations that result in  PKU.

"," Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI, MIM 222700) is an autosomal  recessive defect of cationic amino acid (CAA) transport at the  basolateral membrane of epithelial cells in the intestine and kidney ,  caused by mutations of the SLC7A7  gene. CAA transport is mediated  by y+L system which is represented by a heterodimer consisting of 4F2hc and SLC7A7. This activity is also exerted by also another  heterodimeric complex composed by 4F2hc and SLC7A6. The co  expression of 4F2hc with SLC7A7 or SLC7A6 induces the system  y+L activity. Two basic molecular aspects of LPI are still unclear: the  extreme variability of the LPI phenotype along with a multisystem  involvement, and the possible capacity of SLC7A6 to compensate  for CAA transport when SLC7A7 is defective. By direct sequencing  of SLC7A7  gene (all exons and exon flanking intronic sequences),  we identified 17 causative mutations in LPI patients, originating from  Italy, Tunisia, Greek, Algeria, Pakistan and Japan. We expressed  nine of these mutations in X. laevis  oocytes and mammalian cells and  we explored the role of a possible interaction between SLC7A7 and  SLC7A6. We found that all mutations abolish arginine transport as  compared with the âwild typeâ control except for the F152L mutation  that reduces arginine transport by about 50%. In addition, we  identified a mutation, E36del, with a dominant negative effect.

","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal  recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21  hydroxylase ( CYP21 ) gene. For the identification of the CYP21   gene deletion, it is necessary to digest genomic DNA with  Taq I  endonuclease followed by Southern analysis using radio labeled  probe to examine the existence of the 3.2/3.7 kb fragment. This  procedure is time consuming and involves the use of radioisotopes.  Here, we present a direct PCR based amplification procedure for  direct analysis of deletion in the CYP21  gene using a locus specific  sense primer located in the tenascin  B (TNXB ) gene deleting 120  bp in tenascin  A (TNXA ) and an antisense primer located at the 5â  terminus of the CYP21P and CYP21  genes. Since a primer is lacking  in the TNXA  gene for the amplification of the CYP21P  gene, a 6.2 kb  fragment of the CYP21  gene including the neighboring TNXB  gene  was derived. The PCR product was then directly subjected to Taq  I digestion and analysis on agarose gel. Our result indicates that  the PCR amplification is specific for the CYP21  gene and the PCR  product generated is used not only for the identification of the CYP21   gene but also for the examination of the deletion status of CYP21  gene.",2003

By performing deletion and mutation analyses of the MEFV  promoter together with electrophoretic mobility shift assays, we  have demonstrated that TNFalpha induced expression of MEFV  is dependent on both NFkB p65 and C/EBPbeta. These two  transcription factors, however, act differently on the TNFalpha  dependent transcription of MEFV: C/EBPbeta represents the key  regulatory factor that is required to confer cell responsiveness to  TNF alpha, whereas NFkB p65 increases this response by means  of a cooperative interaction with C/EBPbeta, thereby providing an  unusual example of a cross talk between C/EBP and NFkB pathways  in TNF alpha signaling.",2003

In cells transfected with pyrin, we  found that all the mutated pyrin GFP proteins localised exclusively  in the cytoplasm, with a pattern similar to the one observed with  the wild type pyrin GFP. In cells co expressing ASC and pyrin GFP,  the green fluorescence due to pyrin GFP and the red fluorescence  corresponding to ASC were concentrated in specks, whatever the  pyrin GFP construct (wild type or mutated forms). These results  suggest that these MEFV mutations do not affect the subcellular  localisation of pyrin.

Screening for mutations of all MEFV coding exons and intronic  boundaries by DGGE revealed a mutation spectrum significantly  different from that reported in Armenia. The frequency of non  identified (NI) MEFV alleles is much higher among patients from  Karabakh than among those from Armenia (26% vs 7%, P=5.10 5).  As no particular MEFV haplotype was over represented among the  NI alleles, we excluded the existence of a unique and rare MEFV  mutation resulting from a founder effect that could have escaped  our mutation screening procedure. The spectrum of identified  mutations among Karabakhtsis and Armenian patients is also  different: the M694V and R761H mutations were more frequent  among Karabakhtsis patients (P=0.01 and 0.04, respectively) and,  conversely, the V726A mutation represented only 5% of identified  alleles among Karabakhtsis patients, whereas it accounted for  26% of characterized FMF alleles in Armenian patients (P=0.0003);  the M680I mutation was found at a similar frequency in the two  populations.

Molecular investigation of the  Cypriot population reveals that about 1:8 is a carrier of one of four  mutations, E148Q being the most frequent (1:12). Among 136 Cypriot  MEFV chromosomes analysed, the results are: V726A 27.2%; F479L  21.3%; M694V 21.3%; E148Q 5.9%; M694I 2.2%; R761H 3.7%;  M680I 1.5%; unknown 18.4%.

Despite the  high frequuency of E148Q, only 8 of 78 patients carried it, supporting  its mild nature. In a number of Hellenic samples from Greece tested,  the F479L mutation was not present, whereas in a cohort of patients  with childhood onset of FMF, F479L was found in only one patient in  heterozygosity.

Molecular genetic diagnosis of Familial  Mediterranean Fever by PCR and reverse hybridization,P522.,"KriegshÃ¤user1, A. WeinhÃ¤usel2, O. A. Haas2, F. Kury1, C.  Oberkanins1","1ViennaLab Labordiagnostika GmbH, Vienna, Austria, 2Childrenâs  Cancer Research Institute (CCRI), St","Anna Childrenâs Hospital,  Vienna, Austria.   Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive  inherited inflammatory disorder that is characterized by recurrent,  short, self limiting bouts of fever, accompanied by pain in the  abdomen, chest or joints, and sometimes associated with erysipelas  like erythema. The most severe complication is progressive  amyloidosis, ultimately leading to renal failure. FMF predominantly  affects Turks, Arabs, Armenians and Sephardic Jews (carrier rates up  to 1:5), but has been observed in lower frequencies throughout the  Mediterranean area. It is caused by mutations within the marenostrin/ pyrin gene (MEFV) on chromosome 16p13.3, which differently affect  the severity of the disease phenotype and the risk to develop renal  amyloidosis. Owing to the rather nonspecific clinical symptoms,  molecular genetic analysis significantly improves early and correct  diagnosis of FMF, and allows to commence lifelong prophylactic  treatment of affected individuals with colchicine. We have developed a reverse hybridization assay (FMF StripAssay)  for the rapid and simultaneous detection of the following 12 MEFV  mutations: E148Q, P369S, F479L, M680I (G/C), M680I (G/A),  I692del, M694V, M694I, K695R, V726A, A744S, R761H. The test is  based on multiplex DNA amplification of exons 2, 3, 5 and 10, and  hybridization to a teststrip presenting a parallel array of allele specifi c  oligonucleotide probes for each mutation. The entire procedure from  blood sampling to the identification of mutations requires less than  6 hours, and hybridization/detection may be carried out manually or  essentially automated using existing instrumentation (e.g. TECAN  profiBlot). The test is simple and convenient, requires very small  amounts of samples, and can easily be modified to include additional  mutations. (oberkanins@viennalab.co.at)",2003

In 1997, the gene MEFV  responsible for FMF was identified. The  gene product consists of 781 amino acids encoded by 10 exons.  The specific protein function remains unclear but its expression in  polynuclear leukocytes suggests an essential role in inflammation  processes.

In the mild adult form, characterized  by myalgy and episodes of rhabdomyolysis, residual FAO flux and  CPT2 enzyme activity measured in patient fibroblasts are significantly  higher than in the severe neonatal form of CPT2 deficiency. Our  objective was therefore to test whether fibrates, which possibly  stimulate Ã oxidation, could have beneficial effects on FAO in CPT2  deficient fibroblasts. Bezafibrate, fenofibrate, ciprofibrate, or gemfibrozil were added for 3  days in the culture medium of mild type CPT2 deficient fibroblasts, at  concentration ranging from 50 to 800 Î¼M, and 3H Palmitate (3H Pal)  oxidation was measured according to standard methods.

Although many lysosomal disorders are corrected  by enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) that provides 1 5% of  normal cellular activity, the reversal of pathology in skeletal muscle  in murine Pompe disease requires much higher GAA activity, as  shown by somatic induction of transgenic GAA expression in GAA  /  mice. Furthermore, skeletal muscle is not easily accessed by the  exogenous enzyme. We have demonstrated in a study with rhGAA  (20mg/kg/weekly for up to 5 months) in tolerant GAA /  mice that  skeletal muscle cells take up little enzyme compared to liver and  heart. Glycogen reduction was less than 50%, and some fibers  showed little or no glycogen clearance. A 100mg/kg dose of rhGAA  resulted in higher activity and up to ~75% glycogen clearance.  The enzyme reduced heart muscle glycogen to undetectable  levels at either dose. Skeletal muscle fibers with glycogen showed  immunoreactivity for LAMP 1/LAMP 2, indicating that undigested  glycogen remained in proliferating lysosomes. Differential transport  of enzyme into lysosomes may explain the strikingly uneven pattern  of glycogen removal. In the murine model, glycogen clearance  was more pronounced in type 1 muscle fibers, and histochemical  analysis suggested an increased mannose 6 phosphate receptor  immunoreactivity in these fibers.

"," BACKGROUND:  Fabry disease is an X linked metabolic  disorder caused by deficiency of a galactosidase A. This leads  to accumulation of globotriaosylceramide in different organs (e.g.  kidney, gastrointestinal tract, heart and nervous system). Enzyme  replacement therapy (ERT) has been available since 2001, and  positive clinical effects have been reported. However, there are no  published data on the effects of ERT on health related quality of life  (HRQOL). METHODS:  HRQOL was therefore assessed in 145 male and  female patients (mean age, 38 years) with Fabry disease treated with  agalsidase alfa and enrolled in FOS   the Fabry Outcome Survey.  HRQOL was measured using the validated EQ 5D questionnaire. RESULTS:  Before treatment, patients with disease manifestations in  the following organ systems had a significant reduction in HRQOL:  kidney (p<0.008), musculo skeletal system (p<0.02), gastrointestinal  tract (p<0.001) and nervous system (p<0.001). EQ 5D scores were  significantly (p<0.001) improved after ERT. In addition, there were  significant improvements in 8 of 11 subscales of the Brief Pain  Inventory after ERT. We also investigated the influence of ERT on  HRQOL based on quality adjusted life years (QALYs). After ERT for a  mean of 10 (range, 3 21) months with agalsidase alfa, 191.4 QALYs  were generated. HRQOL at baseline was the only factor correlating  with increased QALYs after treatment. This is not surprising, as it is  easier to improve HRQOL in patients with lower EQ 5D scores at  baseline than in those with higher scores. CONCLUSION:  In conclusion, ERT with agalsidase alfa significantly  improves HRQOL in patients with Fabry disease.",2003
Desmin supplementation as a possible gene  therapy in epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS),P531.,"DâAlessandro , P. H. Ogden, R. M. Porter, S. M. Morley, B. Lane","University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom","Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS) is an autosomal dominant skin  disorder, characterised by blister formation on mild trauma. According  to the severity of the phenotype, EBS can be classified as Dowling  Meara, Kobner or Weber Cockayne. All three forms are caused  by mutations in either keratin K5 or K14 and the severity of the  phenotype can often be correlated to the position of the mutation. The  keratin networks of EBS cells tend to collapse and aggregate under  various stress conditions, and this is the probable underlying cause of  the observed skin fragility. Five keratinocyte cell lines, expressing EBS associated keratin  mutations of differing severity, were subjected to a range of physical stresses. Monitoring their early stress responses to osmotic shock,  we found a direct correlation between the severity of the keratin  mutation carried and the speed of JNK (a stress activated protein  kinase) activation. Considering that EBS cells are only disrupted when they are  subjected to some sort of trauma, we hypothesised that a small  amount of structural reinforcement of their network could allow them  to behave as normal. We therefore transfected all EBS cell lines  with human desmin, a muscle specific type III intermediate filament  protein, and subjected them to stress assays. Our results suggest  that desmin is indeed capable of giving structural reinforcement to the  EBS cells, which, once transfected, appear to be more resistant to  stresses such as osmotic shock, cell stretching, wound healing and  heat shock, than the untrasfected cells. These observations may have value in designing therapeutic  strategies for EBS.",2003

Accumulations in the vascular  endothelium of the kidney, heart, and brain lead to many of the  clinical manifestations of disease. A phase 3 double blind, placebo  controlled clinical trial with recombinant human alpha galactosidase  (r haGAL, Fabrazyme, Genzyme) in 58 patients with FD showed  safe and effective clearance of GL 3 from the endothelial cells  of the kidney, heart, and skin. All 58 patients entered and have  subsequently been treated with r haGAL during an ongoing open  label extension study for up to an additional 24 months. The mean  estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR) and serum creatinine for  the study population were normal at baseline. After 20 weeks in the  pivotal trial, placebo patients had a mean change in GFR of 0 and  r haGAL patients had a mean decrease of 3.7. There was no change  in serum creatinine. Once these patients entered the extension Therapy for Genetic Disorders176 177 trial, both GFR and serum creatinine values remained stable after  24 additional months of r haGAL therapy. The median urinary  protein/creatinine ratio has remained stable after 24 months into the  extension study, indicating stabilization of proteinuria (n=30). A subset  of 10 patients had low GFR values at the start of treatment. After  24 to 30 months of therapy, 8 of these 10 patients exhibited either  stabilization (no change) or improvement in renal function based on  GFR values. These results suggest that early treatment with r haGAL  may slow the progression or prevent renal disease in FD.",2003
Targeted gene repair of hprt mutations by 45 base  single stranded oligonucleotides,P534.,"Kenner , A. Kneisel, J. Klingler, B. Bartelt, G. Speit, W. Vogel, D.  Kaufmann","University Ulm, Ulm   Donau, Germany","Targeted repair of a single base in a gene of an eucaryotic cell by  specific oligonucleotides is currently a controversial technique. Here,  we introduce the repair of point mutations in the hypoxanthine  guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (HPRT) gene as an additional  model system to test targeted gene repair. In human,  Hprt  mutations  cause Lesch Nyhan syndrome. Using hamster V79 cells, we  generated three cell lines with one hprt point mutation each.  These cell lines were treated with specific single stranded 45 base  phosphothioate modified oligonucleotides and selected by HAT  medium. The surviving clones were investigated for the repair of the   respective  hprt mutation. Treatment with the oligonucleotides was  successful in repairing all three hprt mutations ( hprt cDNA position  74, CâT; position 151, CâT; position 400, GâA). The repair rate  was very low but reproducible. We suggest that this system allows  to investigate targeted gene repair in dependence of the target  sequence and the oligonucleotides used.",2003
Use of chimeraplasts on cells from Gaucher  disease patients,P535.,"DÃ­az Font1, B. Cormand1, A. Chabas2, D. Grinberg1, L. Vilageliu1","1Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, 2Institut de Bioquimica  Clinica, Barcelona, Spain","Current gene therapy approaches for the treatment of genetic  diseases are based on the addition of an intact copy of a gene to  restore the function that is lacking as a consequence of a mutated  gene. However, several drawbacks arose when clinical trials begun. To overcome some of these limitations, novel strategies have recently  emerged. One of them is chimeraplasty, a new methodology that  uses chimeric RNA/DNA oligonucleotides (chimeraplasts), designed  to contain the normal sequence of the region to be corrected. Once  inside the nucleus, the chimeraplast pairs with homologous genomic  DNA and generates a mismatch which is supposed to be corrected  by the DNA repair mechanisms of the cell. This strategy has been  applied to correct different genetic defects and some very promising  results were reported. We have tried to use a chimeraplast to repair Gaucher disease  mutations in cultured fibroblasts from Gaucher disease patients.  First of all, we showed that the chimeraplasts reached the fibroblast  nucleus. We then assayed the level of in vitro correction by a  mammalian cell free extract using E. coli cells. The system consisted  on the correction of a mutant antibiotic resistance gene in a bacterial  plasmid with a chimeraplast. The correction frequency was much  lower than previously described. Furthermore, preliminary results on  fibroblasts from the patients were negative. Recently, a strong criticism has been raised against this technique  and many of the first successful results are now questioned. Our  negative results support this criticism.",2003
Fabry Disease: Enzyme Replacement Therapy  (ERT) Improves Gastrointestinal Symptoms,P536.,"Banikazemi , R. J.

These symptoms result from lysosomal globotriaosylceramide (GL 3) deposition in vascular endothelial and perithelial cells, small  unmyelinated neurons, and perineurial cells of the gastrointestinal  system (Seth et al, Am. J. Gastrol. 1981). Conventional treatment  including Lomotil provides limited benefit. Clinical trials of Î± Gal A replacement in Fabry disease (1mg/kg  q2wk) have shown clearance of the accumulated GL 3 from plasma,  kidney, liver, heart, and skin ( Eng et al, Am. J. Hum. Genet. 2001;  N. Eng.l J. Med. 2001 ). In four classically affected males (aged 20  40 years) with severe gastrointestinal symptoms participating in the  Fabrazyme Phase I/II or III trials and extension studies (Genzyme  Corporation), ERT (1mg/kg q2wk) markedly improved or reversed  the gastrointestinal symptoms. Prior to ERT, these patients had  abdominal pain and severe diarrhea with 7  10 bowel movements  (BM) 2 5 times/wk to 6 9 BM/day. Vomiting, food intolerance, and  poor weight gain were associated symptoms. After 6 months of ERT,  all four patients reported âno or only occasionalâ abdominal pain or  diarrhea, discontinued Lomotil, and gained 3 8 kg. Quality of life and  food tolerance were markedly improved. Thus, ERT with Fabrazyme  markedly improves gastrointestinal symptoms and quality of life in  patients suffering from the gastrointestinal manifestations of Fabry  disease.",2003
Ribozyme Gene Therapy Approaches for Keratin  Disorders,P537.,"Terron Kwiatkowski , W. H. I. McLean","University of Dundee, Dundee, United Kingdom","There are now 18 keratin genes known to be involved in dominantly  inherited epithelial disorders. Due to the dominant negative effect of  the mutant keratins, conventional gene replacement therapy is not  appropriate. Ribozymes are small catalytic RNA molecules that can be designed  to cleave mRNA molecules at specific sites. Among the several  potential ribozyme sites in K14 mRNA, five were selected based  on the best RNA folding predictions. Ribozymes were protected  from in vivo RNAse degradation by addition of hairpin sequences  derived from U1 snRNA, and constructed as mini genes driven  by the U1 snRNA promoter. Three ribozymes were capable to  cleave K14 mRNA in vitro, and two of them shown rapid cleavage  following transfection into cultured keratinocytes. These experiments  demonstrate the capability of ribozymes to specifically degrade  abundant mRNA species such as keratins, paving the way for gene  therapy approaches were all endogenous keratin might be ablated  and replaced by a modified âribozyme immuneâ keratin gene. Ribozymes might also be designed to specifically target the mutant  mRNA in cases where the mutation creates a suitable cleavage  site. By modification of the ribozyme conserved catalytic subunit, we  were able to develop a novel ribozyme that specifically cleaves K14  R125C, the most common mutation in DM EBS severe form. This  is an interesting approach for keratin diseases and other dominant  negative disorders in which increasing expression of the wild type/ mutant allele could be sufficient to correct the phenotype. Currently, we are developing transgenic models in order to assess  ribozyme therapy efficacy and safety in vivo.",2003
How many loci for the His475Tyr polymorphism of  the glutamate carboxypeptidase II gene?,P538.,"Scala , M. P. Sperandeo, A. Rinaldi, M. Sellitto, G. Andria, G.

Three different studies evaluated the role of the His475Tyr  (C1561T) polymorphism of the GCPII gene in the determination  of plasma folate or total homocysteine levels in relation to human  diseases by using two different sets of primers. Another polymorphic  sequence, a (TAT)2/3 repeat, was also identified in intron 13. Using the GCPII cDNA sequence (FGCP, GenBank accession no.

The molecular mechanisms of interferon signalling  in lymphoid cells under the action of ionizing irradiation,P539.,V. Mihailik,"Taras Shevchenko Kyiv University, Kiev, Ukraine","Interferons are the family of multifunctional cytokines that are  encoded by intronless genes and play key roles in cell metabolism.  The activity of interferons is based on the expression of interferon  inducible protective genes (e.g. encoding 2â,5â oligoadenylate  synthetase, double stranded RNA activated protein kinase, etc.).  Uncovering the pathways that mediate interferon inducible gene  expression under ithe nfluence of various factors has become very  urgent in recent years. We report a study of interferon signalling  under the action of ionizing irradiation which is known to cause  breakdown of gene expression and originate heritable diseases. The key interferon induced enzymes were studied in two  experimental models: in vitro  (in human lymphoblastoid Namalwa  cells) and in vivo  (in animal lymphoid cells, isolated from spleen  and thymus). The activities of 2â,5â oligoadenylate synthetase and  dsRNA dependent protein kinase were shown to increase in both  cell systems after irradiation at 0.5 Gy dose. The in vitro  treatment of  cells with different interferon inducers (e.g. poly(I)Ãpoly(C), tilorone,  cycloferone) caused an intensification of the radiation induced  amplification of the activity of both enzymes in irradiated cells. The post radiation increase of 2â,5â oligoadenylate synthetase and  dsRNA dependent protein kinase activity suggests an enhancement  of the expression of interferon dependent proteins. As the interferon  inducers amplify the activity of the investigated enzymes, it makes  possible to predict the stimulation of interferon gene expression under  the action of irradiation. The investigation of interferon signalling in conditions of radiative  influence will provide a useful tool to further understanding the  molecular mechanisms of the development of radiation induced  genetic pathologies.",2003

A mouse model incriminates  a vasopressor effect mediated by the serotonin 5 HT2B receptor,  but this receptor has also been shown in other models to mediate  pulmonary arterial vasodilation via nitric oxide production. Methods and Results   We analyzed the 5 HT2B gene in 5 patients  with appetite suppressant drug associated PPH. We found a  mutation causing premature truncation of the protein product in one.  The mutation was not found in 80 control subjects and no 5 HT2B  mutation was found in 18 PPH patients not associated with appetite  suppressant drug intake. Functional analysis of the transfected  receptor expressed either transiently in COS cells or stably in CHO  cells demonstrated that the mutated receptor fails to activate the  second messenger inositol phosphates cascade and subsequent  intracellular calcium release, in spite of normal expression at the cell  membrane. The mutated receptor has no constitutive activity, and  produces no dominant negative effect on the wild type receptor. Conclusion   The 5 HT2B mutation found in a fenfluramine  associated PPH patient results in loss of receptor function, consistent  with haploinsufficiency of a nitric oxide dependent vasodilator or  antiproliferative effect.",2003

In this study we investigated  the effect of MP on DNA methylation and micronucleus formation in  habitual users. Buccal and peripheral blood DNA from 80 subjects  (40MP users, 20 smokers and 20 nonusers/nonsmokers) were  isolated and digested with Msp1 (methylation insensitive) and  Hpa II (methylation sensitive). The software programme used to  interpreted the results reported the data as pixels (pc). Average HpaII  fragmentation was 0.34pc in MP users, 0.26pc in smokers and 0.22  pc in non users/non smokers. The MspI fragmentation averaged  0.59pc in users, 0.40pc in smokers and 0.34pc in non users/non  smokers in peripheral blood DNA. MspI digestion was different in all three groups. While MspI  fragmentation was 0.70pc in users, it was 0.55pc in nonsmokers/ nonusers and 0.63pc in smokers. HpaII fragmentation was 0.32pc in  users, and 0.27pc in both smokers and nonsmokers/nonusers. This  result indicates that MP causes more hypomethylation (on epithelial  DNA) comapred to levels in smokers and non smokers. Mean MN cell percentage was 1.93 Â±1.24 in MP users, 0.95Â±0.85  in nonsmokers/nonusers, 1.82Â±0.98 in smokers. Average MN is  significantly higher in smokeless tobacco users and smokers than  nonsmokers/nonusers (p<0.05). There was no statistical difference  between smokers and MN users (p>0.05). In conclusion, our study suggests that Maras Powder causes DNA  hypomethylation and increases micronucleus formation.",2003

","In eukaryotes, the safe transport of copper ions, which are  essential for the activities of several crucial enzymes, is realized  by coordinated interaction of cell  and tissue specific autonomous  metabolic copper systems (MCSs). Inherited and ecologic related  disorders of copper balance cause a number of neurodegenerative  diseases such as Menkesâ, Wilsonâs, Alzheimerâs, Parkinsonâs, prion  diseases etc. Many features of function of the brain MCS as well as  the structure and subcellular localization of its components remain  unknown. We investigated the expression of two copper transporting P  type ATPases (ATP7B and ATP7A) and ceruloplasmin (CP), the  main intercellular copper transporter, in cerebral cortex, neuroglia,  cerebellum, pituitary gland and choroid plexus. Using specific  antibodies, the immunoreactive polypeptides of these proteins should  be detectable in the cellular secretory pathway membranes by  Western blot analysis. ATP7A was found in the plasma membranes  from cerebral cortex, neuroglia, cerebellum, pituitary gland but not  choroid plexus. ATP7B is expressed only on the plasma membranes  from choroid plexus and pituitary gland. The glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchored form of CP was  localized to the plasma membranes of all brain regions, except  choroid plexus. The expression of GPI CP was verified by RT PCR  analysis. The transcripts of soluble CP were revealed in RNA isolated  from all brain branches. GPI CP mRNA was not only found in choroid  plexus.

","Comparative sequence analysis is a simple way to analyse the  vast amount of data obtained by the Genome Project of different  organisms. This analysis allows us to identify conserved genomic  elements playing a functional role in fundamental biological process,  including the control of gene expression. The RET proto oncogene is  characterized by a complex pattern of post transcriptional regulation,  such as alternative splicing and differential polyadenylation. In  order to clarify this control mechanism, we compared the human  RET 3âUTR (4kb) with the RET sequences of 13 vertebrate species  (chimpazee, baboon, swine, cow, cat, dog, mouse, rat, chicken,  frog, zebrafish, pufferfish and torafugu), We found a high degree of  conservation in the last alternative spliced exons as well as in the  donor and acceptor splice sites (>80%). When restricted to mammals,  our analysis showed conserved sequences also in non coding  regions, suggesting the existence of further regulatory elements.  One of these is 91 bp long and is localized in the intronic region  immediately upstream the last polyadenylation signal. This sequence  contains an AUUUA motif, which is known to destabilize mammalian  mRNA. We constructed a hybrid reporter gene, characterized by  this RET conserved fragment cloned downstream the luciferase  sequence. After transfection in SK N BE, a neuroblastoma cell line,  we observed a significative decrease of luciferase activity in the  hybrid construct compared to the control vector, suggestive of change  in gene expression. Additional characterization of this and other RET  conserved sequences, which may play an important role in mRNA  stability and alternative splicing, is currently under investigations.",2003

Most of these  polymorphisms are assumed to influence the transcription activity  of the gene. Haplotype structure of these sites, however, has not  yet been investigated. In order to identify specific effects of certain  haplotypes on psychiatric phenotypes, several direct haplotype  detection systems have been worked out in our laboratory.

The haplotype  of various SNPs is examined by bidirectional allele specific  amplification, and alternatively by RFLP applying several restriction  endonucleases simultaneously. Additionally, it is also important to carefully design the genotyping  methods when analyzing a highly polymorphic region, because the  SNPs in close proximity can disturb each otherâs reliable genotyping.

To identify other genes involved in human congenital disorders  characterised by defect of intestinal innervation, we have focused on  HOX11L1 regulation.HOX11L1 promoter presents three GC rich regions and lacks  conventional TATA and CCAAT boxes. After determining, by 5â  RACE, the transcriptional initiation site at 338 nucleotides upstream  the ATG start codon (+1), we cloned 2 kb of the 5â flanking region  fused to the luciferase gene and performed transient tranfection  assays in different cell lines. By deletion analysis, we identified a  minimal sequence ( 524/ 338) sufficient to the constitutive expression  of the gene in all the studied cells. This region contains putative  binding sites to Sp1 ( 411/ 398) and AP1 (  361/ 350). Moreover,  we associated an enhancer activity of the HOX11L1 promoter  in neuroblastoma cells to the region between  1711 and  1396,  characterised by consensus sequences for different transcription  factors. A further deletion analysis of this specific region identified  a Sp1 site as responsible for the enhancer activity. To confirm  the role of the above factors in the minimal sequence and in the  distal region, we performed transient transfections with promoter  reporter constructs carrying mutations abolishing the binding of the  specific factors.

We have additionally  identified two novel intronic editing sites (F and G) in the stem of the  predicted stem loop. We examined the distribution of editing isoforms  in brain regions from control individuals and observed significant  differences in editing frequencies between GU2 spliced, GU3 spliced  and unspliced RNA. Splicing at GU1 removes all editing sites. In  order to investigate the relationship between RNA editing, secondary  structure and splicing, we transfected HTR2C minigene constructs  in different cell lines using A/G mutations to model A/I editing. These  experiments have shown that editing at most sites favours splicing  at GU2 over GU1, and that these effects appear to be unrelated to  secondary structure. When combined, these editing mutations often  greatly enhance splicing at GU2 at the expense of GU1, particularly Gene Structure and Function180 181 with constructs to model the common editing isoforms seen in the  brain.

The  results of 5â directed primer extension reaction confirmed that the  5â end of exon I represents the 5â end of the transcribed region of the MOB  gene. The presence of a promoter region just upstream of the  5â end of exon I was revealed by computer analysis.

Stevanovic","Institute of Molecular Genetic and Genetic Engineering, Belgrade,  Yugoslavia","The SOX  genes comprise a family of genes related to the mammalian  sex determining gene SRY which play important roles during animal  development. SOX proteins display properties of both transcription  factors and architectural components of chromatin. The SOX14  gene is a member of the B subfamily of SOX  genes  that has been mapped to human chromosome 3q22 23. Expression  analysis of SOX14  gene has shown that this gene is active in  developing brain, spinal cord of chick and mouse, as well as in the  human HepG2 hepatocellular carcinoma cell line. Although many SOX  genes have been characterized in detail, little  is known about the transcriptional regulation of the SOX  genes  themselves. Computer analysis of 5 kb of the SOX14  5â flanking  region showed that it lacks a TATA box, but it contains a typical  CCAAT box located 586 bp upstream of the ATG codon. Sequence  analysis using MatInspector program revealed potential cis acting  elements for multiple transcription regulators including Sp1, NF1,  ZBP89, Myf5, TBX5 etc. A 1.3 kb fragment of the SOX14  5â noncoding sequence showed  promoter activity in a CAT reporter gene assay in transiently  transfected HepG2 cells. In order to analyse proteins which bind to the SOX14  promoter we  have analysed a 688 bp DNA fragment of the 5â SOX14  region using  gel shift assays with HepG2 nuclear extracts. These experiments  revealed 14 complexes within this region with highly specific DNA  binding properties.",2003
Determining the role of transcription factor BTEB3  in the control of smooth muscle specific gene expression  in vivo,P552.,"Keramatipour , P. D. Ellis, A. A. Grace, J. C. Metcalf, P. R. Kemp","University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Control of gene expression in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs)  is important in development and disease. During normal development  smooth muscle Î± actin (SM Î± actin) is expressed prior to SM22Î±  with smooth muscle myosin heavy chain (SM MHC) expressed last.  Dedifferentiation of these cells is a major pathological change seen in  a number of conditions including atherosclerosis and restenosis after  angioplasty. Recent evidence has implicated the KrÃ¼ppel like family  of transcription factors (KLF family) in the control of SM specifi c gene  expression. BTEB3, a KLF identified in our laboratory, is widely expressed in both  adult and embryonic mouse tissues. Our studies have implicated  BTEB3 as a selective regulator of the smooth muscle specific gene,  SM22Î±, in VSMCs but not of either SM MHC or SM Î± actin. To investigate the role of BTEB3 further we use two different methods  to modify its expression in mice, standard knock out and siRNA  transgenic mice. To make siRNA transgenic mice first two siRNA  vectors were developed and showed that they knock down > 85% of  BTEB3 expression in vitro. The siRNA construct was used to make  transgenic mice and phenotype was analysed at different embryonic  stages.

Whether in  preimplantation  or prefertilization diagnosis, prenatal diagnosis,  cancer genetics, tumor biology and so on, pure samples are  indispensable. The LMPC technology (this stands for laser microdissection and  pressure catapulting) allows microdissection of single cells, cell  clusters, chromosomes etc. and their transfer directly into or onto  a collection device. These collected cells or chromosomes can  be investigated as singles or pooled for molecular or proteomic  analyses. Any kind of tissue from various sources (also archival histological  samples) and even subcellular structures can be captured using this  laser method. Even living cells can be collected in this way and processed further .  This new approach can be used to establish a homogeneous  cell population out of a heterogeneous cell population (e.g. after  transfection experiments). It is possible to obtain 100% homologous  cell populations for expression studies. In addition this protocol  serves as a basis to develop the procedure to isolate homologous  living cells from biopsies for real in vivo studies. The key technology of LMPC can also be used for facilitating in vitro  fertilization and polar body biopsy. A special software program (Metafer P from MetaSystems) combined  with LMPC allows the automated detection and collection of rare  events on the object slide (e.g. cells or metaphases) and saves a  lot of time in finding e.g. FISH labelled cells or fetal cells in maternal  blood.",2003

High intron identity around  the 52 constitutive and four alternatively skipped NF1 exons is  restricted to the close vicinity of the exons.

The investigation of CFTR, PER3 , CARS  and SYT7   supported the high intron identity around alternatively included exons.  In CFTR  the mean intron identities around the eight skipped exons  do not differ considerably from those around the constitutive exons.  In addition, in NF1 and CFTR , we detected three highly conserved  small intronic elements, but we found no correlation of the conserved  regions to several intronic elements known to be involved in the  regulation of splicing. In the investigated genes, the difference in  intron conservation could point to a difference between the regulation  of alternative exon inclusion and the regulation of alternative exon  skipping and constitutive exon splicing.

The causative gene has recently been identified on  chromosome 18. The predicted protein product of the DMC transcript  appears novel with no known homology to any known protein family . Electron microscopy of skin in DMC reveals dilated rough  endoplasmic reticulum and enlarged and aberrant vacuoles, leading  to the hypothesis that the progressive clinical features of DMC result  from abnormal handling of an unidentified compound. To commence investigation of the function of the DMC gene we  have performed RT PCR using RNA extracted from a broad range  of tissues and shown the DMC transcript to be widely expressed in  contrast to the apparent bone and brain specific clinical phenotype.  We next performed subcellular localisation of the DMC gene product  (Dymeclin) using a myc tagged DMC construct transfected into Hela  cells. Dymeclin appears to localise to the endoplasmic reticulum.  Bioinformatic analysis of the predicted protein suggest the presence  of myristoylation and dileucine motifs known to be involved in sorting  and targeting of proteins. Taken together these findings suggest  that the DMC protein is involved in the trafficking of intracellular  compounds. Furthermore, in a collaborative study, 6 of 7 mutant alleles predict  premature truncation and consequent loss of function. Studies to  identify Dymeclin interacting proteins are now underway.",2003

Gene expression analysis using Pyrosequencingâ¢  technology,P561.,"SÃ¶derbÃ¤ck , A. Alderborn, M. Krabbe","Pyrosequencing AB, Uppsala, Sweden","The Pyrosequencing technology is based on sequencing by  synthesis, where the sequential DNA polymerase incorporation of  nucleotide tri phosphates is detected by the release of pyrophosphate  (PPi) in a real time enzyme cascade detection system. The amount  of PPi released is directly related to the number of DNA molecules  present in the reaction. Therefore, quantitative data is obtained,  as previously has been shown in allele frequency determination  analyses and for quantification of HIV molecules. We investigated the Pyrosequencing technology for quantification  of specific nucleic acids, such as cDNA. Oligonucleotides were  made with DNA sequences identical to the target sequences except  for a few bases that functioned as references in the quantification.  As the PCR primer binding sites were the same for target and  reference, the two templates were competitively amplified in a  single tube. After PCR amplification including a known amount of  reference oligonucleotides, the target and reference sequences were  simultaneously analysed in a Pyrosequencing reaction. The peak  heights specific for the target and for the reference were compared,  and the difference reflected the pre PCR amount of target molecules.  Initial experiments indicate that small differences in cDNA expression  levels (two  to fivefold) can be accurately detected. The method  generates sequence data acting as an internal specificity control of  the polymerase priming, and several of the peaks can be used for  the quantification analysis. A main advantage is that the analysis  is performed on a Pyrosequencing instrument possible to use in a  multitude of applications for genetic analyses.",2003
Detection of Tsga10 transcripts in mouse and rat  testis,P562.,"Behnam , M. H. Modarressi, S. Povey, J. Wolfe","The Galton Laboratory, Dept. Biology, UCL, London, United  Kingdom.   ","Spermatogenesis converts a stem cell population of spermatogonia  into a highly differentiated population of sperm in the testis. In  the course of this pathway cells pass from a maintenance state  through mitotic divisions, meiosis and finally terminal differentiation.  Surprisingly little information is available about any of the genes  which have a role in this pathway. We have previously shown by  Differential Display (DD) RT PCR that a novel gene, TSGA10 is  expressed in human testis but not in a variety of non spermatogenic  tissues. Hence, TSGA10 is a testis specific gene, which maps to  2q11.2. In this project we have used RT PCR and in situ  hybrization  to investigate the expression of Tsga10 in adult rat and mouse testis  and in mice embryos. RT PCR shows that Tsga10 is expressed Gene Structure and Function182 183 in rat testis once spermatocytes have progressed to the late  pachytene stage.

Also it shows that Tsga10 has possibly  an alternative splicing in mice testes and embryos but not in mice  brain. In situ  experiments were used to locate Tsga10 expression  in cryostat section of mature mouse testis. Tsga10 transcripts show  a pronounced expression from secondary spermatogonia to later  spermatogenic cells including those closer to the lumen of the  seminiferous tubules.

Here we further explore the relationship between co expression and  chromosomal co localization in the human genome, by analyzing  the expression status of the genes along the best annotated  chromosomes 20, 21 and 22. Methods: Gene expression levels were estimated according to  their publicly available ESTs and gene differential expressions  were assessed using a previously published statistical test. Gene  sequences for chromosomes 20, 21 and 22 were taken from the  Ensembl annotation. Results: We identified clusters of genes specifically expressed  in similar tissues along chromosomes 20, 21 and 22. These co  expression clusters occurred more frequently than expected by  chance and may thus be biologically significant. Conclusion: The expression of colocalized genes might be due  to higher chromatin structures influencing the gene availability for  transcription.",2003
Gene expression in a partial trisomy 16 animal  model of Down syndrome,P564.,"Lyle , C. Gehrig, C. Hendrichsen, S. Deutsch, S. E. Antonarakis","University of Geneva Medical School, Geneva, Switzerland","Down syndrome (DS), caused by trisomy for chromosome 21 (T21),  is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation. In addition  to the mental retardation and facial characteristics, there are many  other phenotypes, including congenital heart disease, early onset  Alzheimerâs disease and an increased risk of leukemia. The presence  of an extra copy of certain but not all of the approximately 225  HC21 genes are predicted to contribute to aspects of the complex  DS phenotype. It is often assumed that all genes from the extra  chromsome 21 will be expressed at a level 1.5x relative to diploids.  However, since regulation of gene expression is complex, involving  regulatory loops, many genes may not conform to this prediction.  Identifying which genes are overexpressed, and to what levels, is  obviously important to understand genotype phenotype correlations  in DS. The development of microarray technology has allowed the  simultaneous examination of expression levels of many genes to be  compared across tissues. However, there are certain limitations to  microarray experiments: sensitivity and dynamic range of detection,  large RNA quantities required. We have used a high throughput real  time quantitative PCR (qPCR) assay to examine the expression level  of 115 genes (including 82 HC21 orthologues) in the Ts65Dn mouse  model of DS. Tissues examined so far include brain, heart, liver and  muscle. The qPCR assay has enabled us to detect genes which are  overexpressed, and those which are not, in Ts65Dn thus helping to  identify those genes contributing to the DS phenotypes.",2003

Wijmenga","Department of Biomedical Genetics, University Medical Center,  Utrecht, The Netherlands","Identification of genes involved in diseases with complex genetic  backgrounds remains challenging. Most recent genome wide screens  have failed to identify genes, due to the significant amount of genes  within susceptibility loci. In order to bring down the number of genes of interest within these loci  we have developed a method, capable of combining genetic linkage  analysis and microarray gene expression profiling. By converting the  genetic map in use with genetic linkage analysis to a physical one and Genomics and Bioinformatics184 185 by physically mapping the cDNAs or oligonucleotides in use on the  microarrays, we were able to overlay genetic linkage graphs with gene  expression profiles. A Java based computer program was developed, that acts as a  central repository for the combined analysis of genetic linkage and  gene expression data. It includes a viewer, capable of showing  karyobands, genes, markers, linkage graphs, gene expression levels,  SNPs and additional annotation data simultaneously. Additionally  data management and filtering functionality was implemented and the  databases Ensembl, LocusLink, Gene Ontology and Unigene were  integrated. We tested the programâs functionality in celiac disease, a multifactorial  gluten sensitive enteropathy, with the combined analysis of a genome  wide screen in 82 Dutch families with affected siblings and microarray  gene expression profiles of 18118 cDNAs in 29 biopsy experiments.",2003
"IsocodeÂ® ID, an Archiving Device Designed for the  Storage of cDNA Libraries.",P573.,"O. Parker , T. Owen, D. English, L. Dowland, D. Pawlak","Schleicher & Schuell BioScience, Inc. , Keene, NH, United States.   ","Genetic studies often utilize cDNA libraries to search for âgenes  of interestâ. Library storage can be very expensive and laborious.  We present an alternaitve to freezer storage of clones by using  IsoCode ID archiving matrix. IsoCodeÂ® ID is based upon the well  established IsoCode technology that protects DNA contained in  biological samples from degradation and microbial contamination.  When a sample is applied to IsoCode, the chemistry lyses the cells,  dissociates proteins from nucleic acids and destroys nucleolytic  enzymes. DNA, suitable for PCR amplification, transformation and  genetic typing, is eluted from the matrix in water by a simple heat  step. IsoCode ID incorporates a color indicator into the IsoCode  chemistry that clearly distinguishes where the sample was placed.  We show that a variety of vectors and cDNA clones can be safely  stored at room temperature and subsequently recovered from  IsoCode ID. Recovery of clones utilized electroporation procedures  to transform E.coli  HB101 cells. In addition, cDNA clones recovered  from the matrix were amenable to PCR amplification; the amplicons  generated were consistent with control amplicons for each clone  tested. We show that the DNA of a 650 base pair sequence isolated  from a cDNA clone is unchanged while stored on IsoCode ID at room  temperature. IsoCode ID was shown to be compatible with several  types of DNA polymerases including Taq, TaqGoldâ¢, FastStart Taq,  PfuTurboÂ® and YieldAceâ¢. In conclusion, IsoCode ID serves as an  excellent matrix for room temperature storage and retrieval of cDNA   clones from libraries typically stored at â80Â°C as glycerol stocks.",2003
Generation of new genes in the human trypsinogen  family,P574.,"FÃ©rec , J. Chen","INSERM 0115, UniversitÃ© de Bretagne Occidentale, Etablissement  FranÃ§ais du Sang Bretagne, Brest, France","A primary driving force in genome evolution is duplication. Provided  that one copy of a gene remains functional, the second copy  is redundant and thus is free to accumulate mutations without  deleterious effects on an organismâs phenotype. This plays an  important role in the generation of novel genes. The human trypsinogen family was inadvertently sequenced due to  its intercalation within the T cell receptor (TCR) beta locus, which was  among the earliest targets of the human genome project (Rowen et  al. Science 1996). Nine trypsinogen genes are separated physically  into two groups. Group I (T4~T8) is located towards the 3â end of the  TCR beta locus and consists of five tandem 10kb repeats in 70kb  between V beta 4S1 and D beta 1. A sixth member (T9) has been  translocated from chromosome 7q35 to chromosome 9p13. Group II  (T1~T3) is located towards the 5â end of the TCR beta locus. Among  these genes, T4, T8, and T9 have been assigned to the three well  characterised forms of trypsinogen (cationic, anionic, and meso   trypsinogens). The other genes represent relic genes, pseudogenes  or expressed pseudogenes. Having integrated the current available genomic, transcriptomic and  proteomic data, we provided evidence that T1 is a likely novel gene  generated from the highly diverged group II trypsinogen genes, and  T9 is gradually losing its function as a trypsinogen but is gaining a  novel function in the form of a chimaeric protein.",2003

The technology is based on an  immobilized switchable positive charge, which switches to neutral  at pH > 8.0. The switchable positive charge can be derivatised on  almost any surface, creating the opportunity for a vast number of  purification formats. This method utilising derivatised magnetic beads  for plasmid purification is reliable, efficient and easy to use.

The array matrix comprises 96 individual arrays  arranged in an 8 by 12 matrix that matches the well spacing of a  standard microtiter plate. Each individual array in the matrix holds  ~ 1,500 different oligonucleotide probes. The probes are attached  to 3 micron beads, which are assembled into wells at the end of an  optical fiber bundle to make an array. Since there are many more  wells than probe sequences, multiple copies of each bead are  present in the array. This built in redundancy improves robustness  and measurement precision.

Non synonymous SNPs (nsSNPs) are those that cause amino acid sequence changes. They are  therefore more likely to affect protein function and to be related to  disease. A large scale systematic study of the effects of nsSNPs on  protein structure and disease relationship will help derive predictive  rules to identify deleterious amino acid variants and thus aid in the  assessment of disease susceptibility. In this study, human protein variants present in the Swiss Prot  database were classified into two datasets: disease related and  non disease related. Automatic modelling using the Swiss Model  server was performed if suitable structural templates (> 70% identity  to the sequence) could be identified from the Protein Data Bank.  In total, 3500 models (2800 disease related and 700 non disease  related), each containing one nsSNP, were created. Preliminary  analysis regarding to the distribution of secondary structure, residue  accessibility and size showed that accessibility and the secondary  structure of the mutation site have a better discriminative power than  change in residue type and size. In particular, it was found that about  36% of the disease related nsSNPs are located in regions with low  accessibility, while only 19% of non disease related nsSNPs are in  these areas.

In order to identify the spectrum and the distribution  of the mutations in the LDLR gene in the Greek population we  investigated 132 FH patients of greek origin. The patients all fulfilled  the clinical criteria for FH and were recruited from the Hippocratio  hospital. We used a mutation screening assay based on the highly  sensitive denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) technique  combined with DNA sequence analysis. In total, mutations regarded  as cause of the disease were identified in 44 patients (33%)  representing 13 different mutations. We did not identify any patients  with the common mutation (apo B 3500) causing familial ligand  defective apoB 100. The most frequent mutation according to our  results was found to be Africaner 2 ( 1285 G>A) on exon 9 of the  LDLR gene. We further identified 9 point mutations which were not  considered to affect the function of the gene, and thus were regarded  as polymorphic changes. Future studies should aim at identifying the  importance of these mutations in offering differentiated treatment in  patients with FH and unravelling the involvement of other genes in  this disease, hence to provide a more differentiated prognostic and  therapeutic evaluation in FH.",2003

Heterozygous  and homozygous mice are viable and do not show an overt clinical  phenotype.P/Q type Ca2+ channels are expressed at presynaptic active zones of  central synapses and the peripheral neuromuscular junction (NMJ),  and mediate neurotransmitter release. Earlier studies revealed  synaptic defects at diaphragm NMJs of the natural Cav2.1 mouse  mutant Tottering.

Several new mutations were identified in our set of patients with  most mutations being inactivating private mutations. The fact that  in several patients which were negative in a previous SSCP based  screening now a mutation was identified, illustrates the importance  of the choice for a more sensitive detection technique in diagnostic  settings. At present the few mutation negative patients are analyzed with  intragenic EXT1 and EXT2 markers and FISH to screen for deletions  within these genes.

Apart from three missense mutations in FGB, all  mutations described so far are null mutations, predicted to cause  total lack of the corresponding fibrinogen chain. During the course  of a prenatal diagnosis for a Palestinian family with two affected  daughters, we identified a novel nonsense mutation in the FGB gene,  W467X (exon 8) which was predicted to lead to the production of a  truncated protein missing only 25 amino acids from the C terminus.

Expression of the W467X mutant FGB cDNA  in combination with wild type FGA and FGG cDNAs showed that the  W467X mutant protein was stably expressed.

Sertedaki","Athens University Medical School, Aghia Sophia Childrenâs Hospital,  Athens, Greece","Prop1 gene defects constitute the most frequent cause of genetically  determined MPHD. Prop1 gene mutations lead to deficient synthesis  of GH, Prl, TSH and gonadotrophins in variable severity and timing of  onset. Molecular genetic analysis was carried out by PCR and direct  sequencing in 48 Greek patients exhibiting deficiency of at least two  pituitary hormones. Prop1 gene mutations were detected in 17 patients  (35%). Observed genotypes: seven GA296del (homozygotes), five  A150del (homozygotes), one R73C (homozygote), two GA296del/ A149del (compound heterozygotes), one GA296del/R73H (compound  heterozygote) and one GA296del/Q83X (compound heterozygote). Hence, in our population, the mutation GA296del was detected in  14/34 chromosomes and the A150del in 12/34 chromosomes. The  mutation Q83X is a novel mutation and it is a C to T transition at  nucleotide 247 resulting in a premature stop (CAG to TAG). The  resulting protein is truncated with only 82 out of 226 aminoacids of  the normal peptide. The Q83X mutation was found in an 11 weeks  old infant, examined for prolonged jaundice caused by low TSH  hypothyroidism. In conclusion, the distribution of mutations in our group is analogous  to those observed in other populations, while Q83X has only been  detected in a Greek patient. Etiologic classification of pituitary  insufficiency not only leads to proper management of the pathologic  condition but also to the appropriate genetic counseling and  management of prospective pregnancies.Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders192 193",2003
Consequences of a Guanine insertion in myosin  binding protein C gene: Two aberrant mRNA species and  downregulation of both normal transcripts and protein in  a patient suffering from hypertrophic cardiomyopathy,P608.,"Waldmueller , H. P. Vosberg","Max Planck Institute, Bad Nauheim, Germany","Insertion of one G in exon 25 of the cardiac myosin binding protein C  gene (MyBP C; MYBPC3) was previously shown to be associated  with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (family EA; Moolman et al., 2000).  The insertion produces a cryptic splice donor site (SDS) causing loss  of 40 bp in mRNA (exon 25) and a premature stop codon in exon 26.  We have investigated consequences of this mutation by Real Time  Quantitative RT PCR of RNA from cardiac tissue of an EA patient,  and by analysing mRNA from HeLa cells transfected with minigenes  comprising exon 25 (+/  G insertion) plus adjacent exons and introns.  In cardiac tissue we identified one normal and two aberrant mRNA  species, one with loss of 40 bp in exon 25, and one with an intact  exon 25, but an unspliced intron 25 in addition. Two closely spaced  SDSâs (40 bp) may have mutually been inhibitory. Bimodal distribution  of mutated transcripts was reproduced in transfected HeLa cells.  The competition hypothesis was substantiated by elimination of the  native SDS in the minigene resulting in the disappearance of intron  25 sequences in mRNA. Quantification of mRNA in patient tissue showed a reduction of  wildtype mRNA to ~50% of control. A similarly reduced value  was found for MyBP C protein. About 10% of the total mRNA  were aberrant, with internally deleted and incompletely spliced  mRNA being roughly equal. Since truncated MyBP C protein was  undetectable in affected tissue, prevention of aberrant mRNA  translation and/or degradation of protein might together result in  haploinsufficiency as basic mode of disease.",2003

The two disease causing  genes SLC3A1  and SLC7A9  encode the renal transport system  rBAT/b0,+AT. While point mutations in the two genes are well  known to cause cystinuria, only few studies aimed to identify gross  alterations. Therefore we developed real time PCR assays using  TaqManTM technology and screened our cohort of 49 cystinurics  for copy number deviations in the SLC3A1  gene. RT PCR and  DNA sequencing were used to confirm and characterize the  rearrangements. In seven patients we could detect the same large duplication of more  than 30 kb in the SLC3A1  gene spanning from introns 4 to 9. We analyzed this mutation in detail and identified the transition of  the tandem duplication from intron 9 to intron 4. The duplication was  accompanied by a small inversion of 25 bp and a 2 bp deletion in  intron 9. Alu sequences were localized near the duplicated region  but are not directly involved in the rearrangement. We presume that  the inversion event in intron 9 provokes a chromatin structure that  stimulates the duplication. This mechanism is probably supported by  the Alu elements within the affected genomic regions. This study is the first report on a duplication in SLC3A1  and  demonstrates the utility of real time PCR in screening for mutations  causing cystinuria.",2003

This  autosomal dominant form of MED is characterised by normal stature,  joint pain and stiffness and early onset osteoarthritis. Following a  targeted mutation screen of MATN3  in sixty unrelated individuals with  MED we now report the identification of four novel mutations (A219D,  I192N, T120M and E134K), one previously published mutation  (R121W) and one non synonymous polymorphism (E252K). All the mutations are located within the Î² sheets of the A domain  of martilin 3, suggesting that they have a deleterious effect on the  folding and/or function of this domain. Preliminary expression studies  established that these mutations prevented the secretion of matrilin 3  A domain in vitro . Interestingly, the non synonymous polymorphism,  which is located in the Î± helical region of the A domain and may  therefore a less deleterious effect on itâs structure, does not affect the  secretion of matrilin 3 A domain in vitro . EM analysis of chondrocytes from a patient with the R121W mutation  showed the accumulation of granular material within the rER  in  vivo, thereby confirming that the misfolding of the A domain results  in the retention of full length matrilin 3. These findings suggest that  MED resulting from MATN3  mutations may share common disease  mechanisms with MED resulting from COMP  mutations such as the  retention of misfolded mutant protein. In summary identification of additional MATN3  mutations and a  study of their structural and functional consequences will help our  understanding of the molecular cell pathology of MED and provide  the rationale for targeted therapy.",2003

The spliceosome (a  multi protein complex) is responsible for the production of mature  mRNA molecule. The assembly of this complex relies on the  presence of a âcoreâ of cis acting sequences together with additional  cis acting elements, localised either in the coding sequence or  introns, which may enhance or antagonise splicing. Such complexity ,  allows fine tuning of the splicing process, but carries a high risk  of derangement following even minor mutations. In fact 15% of  genetic diseases concern dysfunction in pre mRNA splicing causing  the distinction between polymorphisms and splicing pathogenetic  mutations to become an increasing challenge. We focus upon genetic diseases arising from unusual splicing  defects, uncovering novel pathways of RNA processing in a variety  of genes. In the ATM gene we have identified a novel type of cis  acting sequence, essential for correct intron removal. The importance  of exonic sequences in the regulation of splicing is highlighted by  our studies on CFTR exon 9 and exon 12 and in NF1 exon 37. We  show that missense, nonsense and even silent variations (this last  frequently discarded as not pathogenetic in genomic screening) may  cause splicing defects. In addition we show U1snRNP pre mRNA interactions to be key  factors involved in both the ATM element dysfunction and the NF1  gene exon 3 skipping. Both polymorphims abolish a U1 snRNP pre  mRNA complex. A modified U1snRNP is capable of restoring correct  splicing of both pre mRNAs. providing a promising future prospect for  the development of novel therapeutic strategies.Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders194 195",2003

A mutational spectrum, comprising one large deletion and 29 point  mutations (11 nonsense, 8 insertion/deletion, 8 splicing, and 2  missense mutations), has been so far determined. All causative  mutations are located in the fibrinogen genes coding for fibrinogen  Aalpha , Bbeta , and gamma chains. In this work, analysis of  the fibrinogen cluster in two unrelated afibrinogenemic probands  identified two novel mutations (table). The 15 kb deletion removes the last two exons of the Aalpha  chain gene and almost the entire Aalpha Bbeta intergenic region.  Sequencing of the deletion breakpoints showed the presence of  direct and inverted repeats that could mediate an âillegitimateâ  recombination. This represents the second large deletion identified  in the fibrinogen cluster that, if present in the heterozygous state in  compound heterozygous afibrinogenemic patients, could escape  mutational screening performed by standard PCR.

These technological  improvements have made possible the frequent use of DNA  diagnostic tests in clinical practice but have also made the distinction  between neutral polymorphisms and pathogenic mutations an  increasing challenge. This challenge is illustrated by mutations that cause abnormalities  of premRNA splicing. The effect of a given nucleotide variation on  splicing can be predicted from genomic DNA sequence analysis  only if mutations alter highly conserved canonical splicing signals.  However it is extremely difficult to predict the effects of changes in  intronic and exonic sequences not obviously involved in the splicing  process. We present here an efficient and simple test that has proved a  valuable tool for the identification of those mutations that cause  splicing defects. The assay uses genomic DNA making it feasible  to carry this out in the molecular diagnostic laboratory as part of the  analysis of the DNA sample provided by the referring clinicians. Using this system two mutations in the Nf1 gene were analysed. Firstly a nonsense mutation in exon 37 and secondly an intronic  mutation downstream of exon 3. Both of these were found to  dramatically affect splicing. The intronic mutation was then rescued  by co transfection in this assay of a U1 snRNP complimentary to the  mutation. Further intronic mutations in the CFTR gene were analysed  at positions +8 to +11 of exon 9, these variations affected splicing by  altering a TIA binding site.",2003

Non isotopic single stranded  conformation analysis (SSCA) after amplification of each exon with  boundary intronic sequences by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR)  was used for all 51 exons of COL4A5 and 47 exons of COL4A4  gene. While no mutation was identified in COL4A5 gene in all 34  patients COL4A4 mutation screening disclosed eleven common  polymorphisms that are shared in part with other populations and  six novel mutations: G774R (GGT>CGT), G789G (GGA>GGT),  2860+2T>G, R908W (CGG>GGG), D1049H (GAC>CAC)+del 5 bp,  3506 8T>G and 4081 8G>C comprising three missense mutations,  one frameshift and two potentially splice site mutations.

This disorder has substantial clinical  heterogeneity, and additional abnormalities such as cardiac defects,  cleft palate, extradural cysts, and various ophthalmologic problems  were also observed in some families with this syndrome.

Automated sequence analysis of FOXC2 gene in this family revealed  nt1005delG mutation, which results in immediate truncation of the  protein without any extra amino acids. The presence of DM and/or  renal problems is not a classical feature of LD. We believe that  the manifestation of these symptoms might be associated with the  novel nt1005delG mutation.

HFI is a recessively transmitted disease caused by  deficiency of aldolase B in the liver, intestine and kidney. Several  mutations in the aldolase B gene were shown to be responsible  for this enzyme defect. We present aldolase B mutation analysis  in three HFI families from Central Anatolia. We ascertained these  families through an affected adult male referred to our department  for genetic counseling. Despite absence of consanguinity, pedigree  analysis revealed the presence of affected persons in the family  of the probandâs partner. Since one of the affected persons in the  latter family was the offspring of a non consanguineous marriage,  pedigree analysis suggested the presence of a third family also  having individuals with aldolase B gene mutations. In the first step  of the genetic study, aldolase B mutations were investigated in three  affected and three unaffected individuals from two families. A174D  was found to be segregating in one family and A149P in the other.  Further analysis confirmed the genotypes of individuals and the  presence of an additional unrelated family having individuals with  the A174D mutation. Since the families investigated in this study are Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders196 197 unrelated, in other words, each mutated allele was inherited from  different ancestors for each family, it may be suggested that aldolase  B gene mutations have a high frequency at least for the Central  Anatolian Region.",2003

Molecular mechanisms  of this disease are point mutations, with more than 80% private,  requiring screening of the 12 exons for molecular diagnostic. Up to  now, only three deletions were described. We studied a Vietnamese family whose son was affected by a severe  form of PKD. DHPLC, sequencing and restriction assays of parents  and the affected child showed a unique point mutation in exon 7  (N316K) which was homozygous in our proband, heterozygous in his  father, and absent in the mother. No filiation error was found leading to the hypothesis that child had  inherited N316K from his father and a deletion including PKLR  exon 7 from his mother. To demonstrate this hypothesis, we set up  quantitative real time PCR test with Sybrgreen, normalized using  another gene, which confirmed the presence of a deletion of PKLR  including exon 7 in the child, the mother and throughout the pedigree. Almost all methods used in laboratories for mutation detection are  based upon PCR, and are unable to diagnose deletions. In our family ,  evidence for a deletion as the second molecular event was found  just because the deletion involved the exon bearing the fatherâs  mutation. This observation highlights the underestimation of deletions  in molecular pathology and the need for strategies such as real time  quantitative PCR with Sybrgreen to detect such events.

"Different variations to fluorescent ARMS assays  for achondroplasia, familial dysautonomia and spinal  muscular atrophy",P626.,"A. Barber1, J. K. Campbell1, S. McCall2, S. C. Yau1, S. Abbs1","1Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom, 2St Georgeâs Hospital,  London, United Kingdom","Amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS) is a simple, quick  assay that can be applied to several diagnostic applications. We  demonstrate three variations of this assay, utilizing fluorescent  detection for maximum versatility. Detection on a capillary fluorescent  analyser allows detection of fragments that differ in size by as little as  1bp. Therefore wild type and mutant alleles are distinguished by size  differences created by the addition of a small number of nucleotides  to the end of one of the allele specific primers. The first assay involves standard ARMS primers to detect the FGFR3  achondroplasia mutations, 1138G>A and 1138G>C. DNA is amplified  using three forward primers with their 3â nucleotides specific for either  the wild type (G) or the mutant (A or C) nucleotides in a single tube  with one common fluorescently labeled reverse primer. The second assay is used for carrier or diagnostic testing for  familial dysautonomia, a condition only observed in the Ashkenazi  Jewish population and caused by two mutations in the IKBAP  gene (R696P and IVS20+6T>C). For this assay the allele specific  primers incorporate locked nucleic acids (LNATM), a DNA analog with improved hybridization characteristics, at the allele specific sites,  which facilitated the optimization of this assay. In the final assay we have further demonstrated the versatility of  the ARMS approach by developing a quantitative assay for testing  carriers of spinal muscular atrophy. Two multiplex ARMS specifically  amplify exons 7 and 8 of the SMN1 or SMN2 gene along with a  control locus (MPZ) used for quantification.",2003

","Achondroplasia, the most common form of skeletal dysplasia in man,  is inherited autosomal dominant and causes severe dwarfism. More  than 90 % of patients with achondroplasia have a G to A transition  or G to C transversion at position 1138 of the fibroblast growth factor  receptor ( FGFR3 ) gene resulting in substitution of arginine for glycine  at position 380 (G380R) of the FGFR3 protein. In this study, 16 unrelated Turkish patients with achondroplasia were  evaluated for the G to A and G to C mutations at position 1138 of the  fibroblast growth factor receptor ( FGFR3 ) gene. Fifteen out of 16  patients studied carried the G to A mutation heterozygously. None of  the patients had the G to C mutation at the same position. In conclusion, the vast majority of Turkish achondroplasia patients  have the same frequent mutation that was defined in patients with  achondroplasia from other countries. Our results also support the  argument that the G380R mutation of FGFR3  is the most common  mutation causing achondroplasia in different populations.",2003

The disease is caused by mutations in the  C1NH  gene which encodes C1 inhibitor protein. Mutations in C1NH   can lead either to deficient serum level of C1 inhibitor (C1NH) (type I  HAE) or non functional C1NH protein (type II HAE). We screened the C1NH  gene using the High Performance Liquid  Chromatography (DHPLC) analysis in 12 Italian families with multiple  affected individuals. Anomalous DHPLC fragments were sequenced  and confirmed by segregation and enzyme restriction analysis. All  examined patients were characterized genotypically. We identified  four novel mutations (c.1214T>C, c.delG1412, c365C>A, c.1376T>C)  including missense, nonsense, and splicing types respectively in  exons 3, 7, and 8, and confirmed previously described mutations.

TRPS I is due to several  mutations that span through the TRPS 1 gene while TRPS type III  is due to the specific class of mutation within exon 6 of the gene. In  the present study we analyzed the TRPS1 gene in a Mexican patient Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders198 199 with severe form of TRPS that resembles type III. Molecular studies  included PCR and DNA sequence analysis of the entire coding  regions of the gene.

Approximately 96% of patients are  homozygous for this expansion mutation with 4% being compound  heterozygotes for the repeat expansion and a point mutation. The proband is a 21 year old male with ataxia, scoliosis and pes  cavus from early childhood, as well as coincidental Marfanoid  features. DNA analysis confirmed a diagnosis of Friedreich Ataxia  due to an apparently homozygous expansion mutation. However,  testing of his mother demonstrated an allele within the normal size  range with no evidence for an expansion mutation by long range  PCR, triplet primed PCR or Southern blotting. We hypothesized that  she may be a carrier of a deletion mutation. Heterozygosity for microsatellite markers flanking the frataxin gene  in both mother and son excluded the possibility of a large deletion. A  fluorescent dosage PCR method was developed to compare the ratio  of PCR products generated using primers flanking the GAA repeat to  a control amplicon. Comparison of peak areas by the dosage quotient  (DQ) method showed mean DQs of 0.53 and 0.48 for the mother and  heterozygous expansion carrier compared to homozygous normal  controls (n=9 replicates). This result suggests that the mother is  heterozygous for a frataxin deletion. To date, there are no published  reports of frataxin deletions. The mother has a personal and possible  family history of a predominantly sensory axonal neuropathy. Family  studies are in progress to explore the possibility that this deletion may  have pathogenic consequences.",2003

Andermann1","1Montreal Neurological Hospital and Institute, McGill University,  Montreal, PQ, Canada, 2Centre Hospitalier de lâUniversitÃ© de  MontrÃ©al, Montreal, PQ, Canada","OBJECTIVE: To report a patient with late onset, slowly progressive  spastic paraplegia, in a Friedreich ataxia (FA) family with 2 affected Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders198 199 siblings and marked intra familial phenotypic variability. BACKGROUND: FA is an autosomal recessive disease with onset  before age 25. Most patients are homozygous for the GAA repeat  in the FRDA  gene, while 4% have an expansion on one allele and  a point mutation on the other. Point mutations (particularly D122Y  and G130V) give rise to atypical FA phenotype with slow disease  progression, minimal or no ataxia, and gait spasticity (Durr et al,  1999). CLINICAL FINDINGS: A 43 year old FA patient (P1) developed  progressive spasticity, bilateral lower limb weakness and mild  ataxia at age 25 and was wheelchair bound at age 40. His sister  was diagnosed with FA at age 29, exhibiting ataxia, bilateral lower  limb weakness and dysarthria. His brother (P3) with FA developed  progressive ataxia and leg weakness in infancy, and died at age 31.  Autopsy revealed slight atrophy of the cerebellum at the level of the  vermis and atrophy of the dorsal roots. RESULTS: P1 had expansions in both FRDA  alleles, each with 750  GAA repeats. P2 had 850 and 450 repeats, while P3 had 1050 and  790 repeats. CONCLUSIONS: Marked intra familial phenotypic variability exists  in this family despite average size GAA expansions, demonstrating  the importance of modifying genes. Our proband is unusual in having  atypical FA with spastic paraplegia with equal GAA expansions in  both alleles and without point mutations D122Y or G130V.",2003

No other associated  anomalies such as decreased vision, strabismus, color blindness,  ocular albinism or congenital stationary night blindness was present.  Chromosomal analysis was done in two affecteds, which showed no  anomaly.

The risk factors for the disease include low birth weight,  low gestational age and supplemental oxygen therapy (hyperoxia  increases production of free radicals, which can accelerate  vasoproliferation). Another factor stimulating free radicals production  is hyperhomocysteinemia. Until now no correlation between ROP and Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders200 201 hyperhomocysteinemia has been demonstrated. Aim of the study:  To evaluate the role of the common C677T methyl enetetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) polymorphism, leading  to mild hyperhomocysteinemia, as a potential genetic risk factor for  the occurrence of ROP. Methods: DNA of 40 prematures with ROP (birth weight 520  1500g, gestational age 23 31 weeks) and of 40 prematures without  ROP (birth weight 700 1470g, gestational age 24 32 weeks) was  genotyped by means of polymerase chain reaction â restriction  fragments length polymorphism technique and the prevalence of  677TT genotype in both groups were compared.

ABCA4 encodes a photoreceptor  specific ATP binding cassette transporter, responsible for distinct  but related inherited retinal disorders, Stargardt disease, fundus  flavimaculatus, cone rod dystrophy, retinitis pigmentosa and age  related macular degeneration. A model of correlation between  genotype and phenotype was proposed based on the severity  of the mutation. According to this model, homozogosity for null  mutations might be responsible for RP phenotype, a null mutation  in combination with a moderately severe mutation could produce  CRD, a null mutation with a mild mutation or two moderately severe  missense mutations would cause STGD, and one mutant allele alone  could predispose to AMD.

","Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy (FSHD) locus at 4q35 is  closely linked to D4F104S1 (p13E 11), a probe that recognizes the  pathognomonic FSHD deletion involving the subtelomeric D4Z4  tandem repeat array. Extended deletions that include both the  more proximal D4F104S1 region and the D4Z4 repeat are difficult  to interpret in the diagnostic setting. A novel method has been  developed to devise a means to determine the true frequency of  proximally extended deletions in FSHD individuals. Three families  selected for this study were originally identified during routine  analysis on the basis that the affected individuals in each family had  failed to exhibit a small (<38kb) EcoRI fragment. High molecular  weight DNA from these families was analysed with both conventional  and pulsed field gel electrophoresis using DNA markers p13E 11,  9B6A, B31, 4qA and 4qB. Large genomic deletions were identified  involving both D4Z4 and D4F104S1. The precise number of D4Z4  repeat units borne by the p13E11 deletion allele was established  by the use of an additional restriction enzyme (MseI) digest. All  three cases carry different sizes of deletion proximal to the D4Z4  repeat units. Using telomeric probe 4qA, a method was developed  which identifies large genomic deletions involving both D4Z4 and  D4F104S1 using conventional gel electrophoresis. Proximally  extended deletions can be found in patients with a normal spectrum  of the disease, thus ruling out the possibility of a contiguous gene  syndrome.

FSHD is caused by contraction of the polymorphic D4Z4  repeat array in the subtelomere of chromosome 4q. Recently, two  allelic variations were identified, 4qA and 4qB, that differ by few  insertions and deletions distal to D4Z4. Both variations are almost  equally common in the population, but FSHD alleles are exclusively  of the 4qA type. Since both variations are equally susceptible to  rearrangements in the control population, the exclusive linkage  of FSHD with 4qA chromosome ends may best be explained by a  functional difference between both chromosome ends. However,  the studies in anonymized control individuals could not distinguish  between contractions and expansions and could not formally rule  out that short D4Z4 repeat arrays on 4qB chromosomes are non  pathogenic. We have now identified 2 independent FSHD kindreds in which each  proband carries in addition to the familial pathogenic D4Z4 repeat  array on chromosome 4qA, a FSHD sized D4Z4 repeat array on  a 4qB chromosome. Further analyses of these 4qB chromosomes  reveal normal segregation in healthy carriers. These results confirm  a functional difference between 4qA and 4qB chromosomes in  which 4qA chromosomes carry in addition to a contraction of D4Z4  characteristics necessary for the development of FSHD. Alternatively,  4qB chromosomes carry additional elements preventing FSHD  pathogenesis.

Two major types have been  distinguished: demyelinating and axonal CMT. Only 3 loci account for  axonal ARCMT on chromosomes 1q21, 8q13 and 19q13. Recently,  mutations in the LMNA (1q21) and GDAP1 (8q13) genes have been  identified. We selected 60 consanguineous families with axonal ARCMTand  perform a GenScann for 15 microsatellites markers covering the 3  loci. Sequencing of the LMNA and GDAP1 genes was performed in  all the families with putative linkage to 1q21 and 8q13 loci. In families  with putative linkage to 1q21, the R298X mutation in the LMNA  gene was predominant (74%), highly suggesting a founder effect in  North Africa. Indeed, a common haplotypes with flanking markers  segregated in these families. Among the families with putative linkage  to 8q13, the S194X mutation was found in all Moroccan families  (8/8) in the GDAP1 gene. These results, together with the finding  of common haplotypes with 8q13 markers, also highly suggest a  founder effect of this mutation in Morocco. In addition, we identified  a new mutation (R318G) in a compound heterozygote (S194X /  R318G) of Moroccan origin. The R298X and S194X mutations found in the LMNA and GDAP1  genes, respectively, are probably the result of founder effects in North  Africans. Given their high frequency in this population, it is therefore  worth searching these mutations in families with positive linkage to  the corresponding regions.",2003

The phenotype is more severe and manifests  earlier than the classical CMT1 form. To date, seven loci have  been shown to be associated with CMT4 and five genes have been  identified. Twenty three early onset CMT4 cases with mean NCV of 13.7 m/s  were screened by SSCP and subsequent sequencing analyses for  the mutations in EGR2 and PRX genes.  A novel recessive R1070X  mutation in the PRX gene was identified in one patient. No mutations  were detected in the EGR2  gene. Two patients were further analyzed  for NDRG1  gene mutations since they were of Gypsy origin and  R148X mutation was identified in one of them. The patients tested  negative for EGR2  and PRX mutations are still being screened for the  mutations in the MTMR2  and GDAP1  genes. The R1070X mutation in the PRX gene hypothetically creates a  premature translational stop codon at 28 amino acids upstream  of the acidic domain of the L periaxin. Immunofluorescence and  Western blot analyses of a sural nerve biopsy of the patient detected  production of a truncated protein. This novel mutation provides evidence for the suggested role of  the acidic domain of the protein in the stabilization of the myelin  sheath. Absence of the acidic domain may block interaction of  the protein with downstream proteins that are required to transmit  the extracellular signals to the nucleus.

","Charcot Marie Tooth 1 (CMT1) polyneuropathy is a demyelinating Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders208 209 peripheral neuropathy characterized by symmetrically slowed motor  nerve conduction velocities (NCV, <38m/s) and onion bulb formation.  CMT1 presents in the second or third decade and is associated with  distal muscle weakness and atrophy and absent stretch reflexes.  Different subtypes of CMT1 can be delineated by genetic analysis.  CMT1A is due to several molecular defects at the PMP22  locus.  Dejerine Sottas (DS) is a more severe early onset demyelinating  neurophathy. Several genes have been implicated in the etiology  of DS, including PMP22 . Most CMT1A patients have duplication of  PMP22  while most DS patients show point mutations in PMP22 .  We used FISH and DNA sequence analysis of the PMP22 gene in  a family of 4 members with CMT1A (3 males and one female) and 1  with DS. Onset of CMT1A was in the second and third decade with  slow progression of symptoms. The DS patient was affected at age 3  with a more severe phenotype. CMT1A patients presented upper limb  NCV of < 30 Â± 2.1 (SEM) while the DS subject showed a upper limb  NCV of < 15 m/s. In all cases there was duplication of the PMP22   region and a normal sequence of the PMP22  gene. We concluded  that the presence of two copies of the PMP22  gene gives rise to the  spectrum of CMT1A and DS in this family.

CMT is a  heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by chronic peripheral  motor and sensory neuropathy. The mode of inheritance can be  autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked. Autosomal  dominant CMT type 1A results from duplication of a 1.5 Mb segment  on the short arm of chromosome 17 (17p11.2 12), or other mutations  in peripheral myelin protein 22 gene ( PMP22 ). We have collected 88  DNA samples from 28 unrelated CMT families with different modes  of inheritance. In this study we screened the 17p11.2 12 region for  duplications in 6 unrelated families from Ukraine with autosomal  dominant CMT using two (CA)n repeat markers localised in the  duplicated region: D17S921  and D17S1358 .

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an  autosomal dominantly inherited disorder characterized by recurrent  painless episodes of focal neuropathy often precipitated by minor  trauma. Electrophysiological studies demonstrate an underlying  generalized neuropathy with moderate slowing of conduction  velocities, predominant over entrapment sites and prolonged  distal latencies. Sural nerve biopsies show segmental de  and  remyelination with focally thickened myelin sheaths, called tomacula.  HNPP is genetically homogeneous, usually caused by the functional  loss of one allele of the Peripheral Myelin Protein 22 (PMP22) gene:  this loss results from a 1.5 Mb deletion on chromosome 17p11.2 p12,  region where the PMP22 gene is located. Also point mutations in  PMP22 gene are responsible for HNPP phenotype. These mutations  usually result from frame shift or nonsense mutations causing a  premature translational stop codon or from abnormal splicing. Here  we present a case of a man referred to our laboratory with hereditary  neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies. Molecular analysis by  using microsatellite markers excluded the deletion of 1.5 Mb on  chromosome 17.

Autosomal  recessive CMT is genetically heterogeneous with one locus mapped  to chromosome 11p15 ( CMT4B2 ). The histopathological hallmarks  of CMT4B2 are focal outfoldings of myelin in nerve biopsies.  Homozygosity mapping, in a Turkish inbred family with four children  affected by CMT characterised by focally folded myelin, provided  linkage to the CMT4B2  locus. We identified a large, novel gene,  named SET binding factor 2 ( SBF2 ), that lies within this interval and  is expressed in various tissues, including spinal cord and peripheral  nerve. SBF2  is a member of the pseudo phosphatase family of  myotubularins and was an obvious candidate for CMT4B2  by virtue of  its striking homology to myotubularin related protein 2 ( MTMR2 ), that  causes another form of autosomal recessive CMT with outfoldings  of the myelin sheaths in peripheral nerve biopsies. Molecular study  of the SBF2  gene in the CMT family demonstrated the presence of a  homozygous inframe deletion of exons 11 and 12 in all four affected  individuals. On the protein level, this mutation is predicted to disrupt  an N terminal domain that is conserved in SBF2 and its orthologues  across species. Myotubularin related proteins have been suggested  to work in phosphoinositide mediated signalling events that may  also convey control of myelination. Localisation of SBF2  within the  candidate interval, cosegregation with the disease, expression in the  peripheral nervous system, and resemblance of the histopathological  phenotype to that related to mutation in its paralogue  MTMR2   indicate that this gene is the CMT4B2  gene.",2003

","Hearing loss is a common form of sensory impairment, affecting  millions of individuals worldwide. Deafness can be due to genetic Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders212 213 or environmental causes or a combination of them. Approximately  1 out of 1000 infants is affected by either severe or profound  deafness at birth and during early childhood, i.e. in the prelingual  period. About 60% of these cases are considered to have genetic  bases, with deafness mostly occurring as a non syndromic defect.  Non syndromic hearing loss is characterised by extensive genetic  heterogeneity. More than 70 loci have been mapped and 29 genes  identified so far. We have performed genetic linkage studies in a  three generation Italian family segregating an autosomal dominant  form of non syndromic hearing impairment (NSHI). Onset of hearing  impairment (HI) in all affected subjects occurred in the second  decade of life with subsequent gradual progression from moderate  to profound loss. HI was bilateral and symmetrical, involving all  frequencies. After excluding known DFNA loci using markers, listed  on the Hereditary Hearing Loss Homepage (URL: http://dnalab  www.uia.ac.be/dnalab/hhh), a genome wide scan was conducted with  358 highly informative microsatellite markers using the ABI PRISMâ¢  Linkage Mapping Set (PE Applied Biosistem,USA). Significant linkage  (Zmax= 4.21; q=0) was obtained with chromosome 2p12 markers.  The results were confirmed by multipoint analysis (Zmax=4.51),  using the location score method. Haplotype analysis defined a 9.6  cM disease gene interval on chromosome 2 without overlap with the  other identified loci. Fine mapping and identification of candidate  genes are in progress.

","Pendred Syndrome (PS) is an autosomal recessive disease  characterized by congenital sensorineural hearing loss combined  with goitre. The hearing loss is associated with temporal bone  abnormalities that range from dilated vestibular aqueduct (DVA) to  Mondini dysplasia. The thyroid dysfunction due to iodine deficient  cellular transport can be revealed by the perchlorate test. Variable  phenotypes have been recognized in PS patients even in the same Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders214 215 family and inconstant results have been obtained with the perchlorate  test. Recently mutations in the PDS gene ( SLC26A4 ) have been  observed in PS and in non syndromic deafness patients (DFNB4).  In order to improve PS diagnosis, we develop the molecular analysis  of PDS. We studied 31 patients from 24 PS families. Patients were  17 children and 14 adults. Hearing loss, temporal bone and thyroid  status were recorded in patients. The entire PDS coding sequence  was studied by a DGGE/sequencing method. We identified mutations  in 20/24 PS families. Two mutated alleles were present in 15 families.  The most common mutations were Y530H, G209V, T416P, L445W,  1614+1G/A, V138F, 1001+1G/A, and L597S. Four novel mutations  were observed : S133X, S137P, S552I and 2089+1G/A. S552I was  present in a multiplex family and segregate with the disease. In the  four families without a PDS mutation, neither mutations in the non  coding sequences of PDS nor the involvement of another gene  can be excluded.

In  several DFNA12 families mutations in TECTA , the gene encoding  alpha tectorin, were shown to cause hearing impairment (HI) with  different phenotypes depending on the location of the DNA change. Here we report a Turkish family displaying inherited autosomal  dominant HI. Linkage analysis revealed significant cosegregation of  the disease with markers on chromosome 11q23.3  q24. This region  contains the  TECTA  gene, which was subsequently sequenced. A  nucleotide change in exon 13, 4526T>C, was detected leading to  a substitution from cysteine to glycine at codon 1509 of the TECTA  protein. This cysteine is located in the vWFD4 domain, which  is thought to be involved in disulfide bonds and protein protein  interactions. It is notable that the phenotype in this family correlates with other  families that also display mutations within the vWFD domains. In  all families these mutations result in HI involving high frequencies  (2000 8000 Hz). In contrast, mutations which do not affect the vWFD  domains seem to provoke mid frequency sensorineural HI (500 2000  Hz). The identification of an additional family displaying a mutation in the  vWFD domain of alpha tectorin underlines the phenotype genotype  correlation based on different mutations in TECTA .",2003

Five out of these mutations were novel: H100L,  A40G, W133X and C174R were recessive while the D179N mutation  showed a dominant segregation. Since other connexin genes have  been involved in nonsyndromic deafness, we investigated the  GJB6  gene, encoding Cx30, that is tightly linked to  GJB2  at 13q12.  A recent report has identified a large deletion, including exon 1 of  GJB6 , del(GJB6 D13S1830), that is the cause of deafness in patients  carrying one recessive mutation in the GJB2  gene in trans . We  have found two compound heterozygotes both carrying del(GJB6  D13S1830) in association with the 35delG and the 167delT GJB2   mutations, respectively.",2003

A mild hypertrophy was only found  in the mother. The mtDNA of the patient was fully sequenced and  showed (besides A2706G, T14766C, T1W6086C non pathological  mutations) a novel G1644A transition affecting the tRNAVal . This  mutation seems to be pathological because: a) the G at 1644 position  is a conserved base which is also maintained in those tRNAVal where  the base sequence of the region greatly varies; b) the G Ã½ A mutation  at 1644 np of the tRNAVal is located in the unique tRNAVal , two  bases 5â apart from G1642A transition, described as causative of  MELAS syndrome1; c) the mutation, as indicated both by sequencing  and agarose gel electrophoresis of the mismatched amplified mtDNA  fragment digested with MbOI, is heteroplasmic.

(ii) There is a close correlation between the load of heteroplasmic  variants between mother and placenta (R2 = 0.94, n=19) (iii) Paternal mtDNA contributes <0.001% These data are consistent with animal studies and suggest that CVS  should reflect the load of mutant mtDNA.

Leighâs disease due to a mtDNA mutation at bp T9176C. We  gave a 5% recurrence risk as mutant mtDNA was 0% in motherâs  blood but detected in 2/20 oocytes. Results: No mutant mtDNA was detectable in either CVS and both  pregnancies were normal. Discussion . The level of heteroplasmic mtDNA variants is usually  similar in mother and placenta. Paternal mtDNA is not commonly  detectable in placenta. CVS was the option favoured by 2 women in whom the recurrence  risk approached the risk of the procedure (~1%). CVS may be  useful in low risk pregnancies in which the likelihood of obtaining  intermediate levels of mutant mtDNA is low, facilitated by PGD and/or  preconception oocyte sampling.",2003

Among 24 individuals with  seizures in two generations, the predominant features were onset  of seizures within the first two years of life, occasionally followed by  remission, with frequent recurrence in later childhood or adulthood.  Genome wide linkage analysis gave a LOD score of 3.1 at 19q13  (no other genomic regions showing a LOD score of >1.5), although  possible phenocopies were detected. This is the third familial epilepsy  to map to this region of the genome. Candidate genes have been  sequenced; so far a mutation has not been found. The phenotype  within the family is highly variable. 2/19 confirmed haplotype carriers  experienced infantile seizures only (resolving by 2y, similar to benign  familial infantile convulsions, BFIC); 12/19 had onset in infancy with  persistence to later childhood; 3/19 had later seizures without a  history in infancy; 2/19 remained asymptomatic to adulthood. Where  available, most individuals have had normal electroencephalograms,  but several (5/14) have shown mild non specific instability. Affected  subjects tend to have slightly lower IQs than unaffected siblings.  This pattern of seizures within a large family is likely to represent a  previously undescribed inherited seizure disorder, which we have  termed âfamilial infantile convulsions plusâ, FIC+.

"," Objective: The purpose of our study was to determine the prevalence  of cognitive impairment in children exposed to AEDs in utero and to  explore its association with the dysmorphic features seen. Methods: In a retrospective study of 218 mothers recruited from  regional epilepsy clinics in Manchester and Liverpool, we assessed  375 children exposed to different AEDs. Structured interviews, clinical  examination and psychometric tests(WISC) were used to assess  exposure, dysmorphic features and IQ (intelligence quotient).Blind  assessment of photographs was used to categorise children as  mildly, moderately and severely affected based on dysmorphic  features. Results: The mean full scale IQ in children exposed to VPA(87.2,CI  81.9 to92.5) was lower than that in the NE group(89.5, CI 85.5 to  93.4) and other monotherapy groups(CBZ,91.1, CI 86.4 TO 95.8;PHT,  97.6,CI 90.3 to 105.0).The mean verbal IQ(VIQ) was significantly  lower in the VPA group(83.61, CI 78.2 to 89.0) compared to NE(90.9,  CI 87.2 to 94.6) and other monotherapy groups(CBZ,94.08,CI 89.6 to  98.5; PHT, 98.48, CI 90.6  106.3). Dysmorphic features were more commonly seen in children exposed  to VPA, with 44% having moderate to severe dysmorphic features in contrast to those exposed to CBZ(9.2%) and the NE(2.2%). 55% of  those with moderate to severe features had a very low IQ(<79). There  was a significant correlation between VIQ and dysmorphic features in  the VPA group(Spearmanâs rho 0.436).

Although it is easy to foresee the potential impact of PGD  on our life in the near future, many factors still hinder its clinical  application in many countries. It is estimated that only several  hundreds babies have been born so far following this diagnostic  approach in no more than 50 centers worldwide. During 2001 2002 we have invested considerable effort in order to  incorporate this technology in our center as a clinical service. W e  have performed PGD in 32 couples with the following indications.  In 21 couples there were abnormal genetic traits: 10 with X linked  diseases, 5 couples were with chromosomal mosaicism and 6  couples with balanced reciprocal translocations. The rest of the  patients were diagnosed due to the following indications: 3 for  recurrent pregnancy losses, 4 due to recurrent implantation failures  and 4 due to previous non disjunction. 59 embryos (2.1Â±1.2 per embryo transfer) were replaced and 11  implanted (18.6%). Seven (21.8%) pregnancies were established,  out of which 4 resulted in delivery of 7 healthy babies and one is  an ongoing twin pregnancy. The pregnancy losses were related to  patients with normal genetic traits. In conclusion, our preliminary results demonstrate that PGD is a  reliable technique for prevention of genetic diseases. We hope that in  the near future the crude method of terminating affected pregnancies  will be replaced by pre selection of normal embryos for replacement  by PGD.Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders218 219",2003

Most of them have been identified in a study recently  conducted by us in a cohort of 90 ARPKD patients. A mutation  detection rate of 61% was yielded by SSCP and subsequent  sequencing. Mutations were found to be scattered throughout the  geneâs 67 exons without evidence of clustering at specific sites  which makes analysis extremely cumbersome. About 45% of the  changes were predicted to truncate the encoded protein, polyductin.  All missense mutations were non conservative with the affected  amino acid residues found to be conserved in the murine orthologue.  Preliminary genotype phenotype correlations could be established for  the type of mutation rather than for the site of the individual mutation.  All patients carrying two truncating mutations displayed a severe  phenotype with perinatal or neonatal demise. We now report improvement of PKHD1 mutation screening by  denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) using  the Wave Fragment Analysis System (Transgenomics). PKHD1  mutation analysis by DHPLC has been demonstrated to be an  efficient and effective means to establish the molecular cause of  ARPKD.

The service is aimed at detecting mutations not  covered by routine CF mutation testing in diagnostic laboratories.  Mutation scanning throughout this period has been by combined  SSCP/heteroduplex analysis. In order to reduce costs and give  shorter and predictable turn round times for the service, testing is  stepwise. Level 1 comprises screening of exons 3, 4, 7, 10, 11, 12,  13, 19, 20 & 21. Level 2 comprises screening of exons 2, 5, 9, 14a,  14b, 16, 17a, 17b, 18 & 23. The remaining 7 coding exons are only  screened on special request.

CF is characterized by obstruction pulmonary disease, pancreatic  insufficiency , and increase in sweat chloride concentration. The  incidence of cystic fibrosis and the frequency of disease causing  mutations vary among different ethnic groups and geographical  regions around the world. Identification of the disease causing mutations enables carrier  screening in the general population.

In an additional 22 smaller ADCA families, we searched for the  identical haplotype of the disease gene region. Four families partly  showed this identical SCA23 haplotype. This result suggests that the  disease causing mutation in these four families arose from the same  founder, and secondly, it has led to a refined <10 cM interval between  the markers D20S889 and D20S95.

Consequences of polyglutamine and polyalanine  expansions in the context of the protein Ataxin7,P736.,"Latouche1, P. Fragner1, K. El Hachimi2, A. Sittler1, A. Brice1, G.

Polyglutamine diseases are neurodegenerative disorders  characterized by the presence of neuronal intranuclear inclusions  (NIIs) due to the inherent ability of proteins containing large  polyglutamine stretches to aggregate. However, whether these  inclusions, the monomeric protein, or the aggregation process itself  are responsible for the toxicity is a matter of debate. Interestingly ,  there is some evidence that stretches of polyalanine, similarly to  stretches of polyglutamine, can aggregate. To determine the role of the nature of the repeated amino acid versus  the protein context and the role of aggregation in the pathological  process, we produced SCA7 cellular models with polyalanine  (Ataxin7 90A) instead of polyglutamine expansions and compared  them with corresponding models with polyglutamine expansions  (Ataxin7 100Q). Ataxin7 90A and Ataxin7 100Q were transiently expressed in HEK  293 cells and in primary cultures of rat embryonic mesencephalic  neurons. In both cases (Ataxin7 90A and Ataxin7 100Q), the  formation of nuclear and perinuclear aggregates was observed. In  addition, the presence of molecular chaperones and components of  the Ubiquitin Proteasome system in these aggregates points to an  abnormal folding of the expanded proteins. However, the aggregates  formed by Ataxin7 90A, as visualized using optic microscopy, are  morphologically distinct from the Ataxin7 100Q NIIs. Furthermore,  at the ultrastructural level, amorphous deposits of Ataxin7 90A but  no fibrillar inclusions as observed with Ataxin7 100Q were detected.  Finally, preliminary results indicate that Ataxin7 90A is more toxic  than Ataxin7 100Q in primary cultures of mesencephalic neurons.",2003

We have previously described a large  Portuguese family presenting slowly progressive ataxia associated  with hemiplegic migraine in whom the disease causing mutation was  an R583Q mutation located on the 4th segment of protein domain II.  We have now ascertained another family presenting a similar clinical pattern precipitated by physical effort, hemiplegic migraine and  coma, in which ataxia and aura symptoms began simultaneously and  during childhood. We have (1) assessed CAG repeat size, and (2)  screened our family for mutations in the CACNA1A  gene.

Rossi,"Istituto Clinico S Ambrogio, Milano, Italy","The PON1 genotypes Q192R and Met54Leu show a strong  relationship to coronary artery disease (Serrato and Marian, 1995;  Garin et al.1997; Brophy et al. 2001). A linkage disequilibrium is  present between the mutation giving rise to leu54 and arg191 and  this, in turns, leads to susceptibility to cardiovascular and coronary  artery disease. More, the  108C/T polymorphism is responsible itself  of the 20% of the observed variability in PON1 expression levels. W e  here report an association study in a southern italy population of 70  subjects who underwent coronary atherectomy and 70 control. We  detected a LD between leu54 and arg191 (P=0.0003); also leu54 was  in LD with the â108C polymorhism (P=0.0001) but, susrprisingly, the  serum levels either of cHDL and the paraoxanase were in line with  the control population. To explain this discrepancy we carried out a  sequencing analysis of the PON1 gene: one additional gene variation  leading a lys to asn substitution in position 786 (C786G) was found.  This mutation was present in the 8% of the controls and in the 80% of  the patients. In vitro studies showed a 30% increased mRNA stability  in cells transfected by C786G construct and 35% increased levels of  transcription in PON1 wt and PON1 carrying the C786G constructs  done by Real Time PCR (p<0.0001). In conclusion we characterised  a novel mutation localised in the coding sequence leading to a  increase of PON1 gene expression by increasing the transcription  efficiency conferring to the carriers a protection effect to carotid  arthery disease.",2003

","Linkage to chromosome 6p has been established for several  inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. The extent and structure  of linkage disequilibrium (LD) in the region is unclear. The human  genome has been suggested to be organized into haplotype blocks,  characterized by high internal levels of LD between SNPs, separated  by recombination hot spots. Such a structuring would have signifi cant  impact on association mapping strategies. We investigated the distribution of haplotype blocks in a 20 Mb region  using 920 SNPs, followed by a more detailed investigation of 3.53 Mb  covering the MHC, using 294 SNPs. Samples from four Caucasian  populations, comprising between 45 and 550 individuals each, and  one African American population (45 individuals) were studied.  Clustering of Lewontinâs Dâ and correlation between LD and physical  distance between SNPs were implemented. In contrast to previous assumptions, our data suggest that the  genome is not uniformly structured into haplotype blocks and that  recombination hot spots are only present in parts of the genomic  regions of interest. High LD levels and clear haplotype block  structures were found to intermingle with areas of low or medium  LD, both inside and outside the MHC. All Caucasian populations  show the same pattern and characteristics of LD structure. The  African Americans, despite exhibiting a similar distribution of LD  over the region, are nevertheless characterized by a higher degree  of haplotype diversity. These findings are likely to have a strong  impact upon the future design of systematic association studies of  chromosome 6p linked human diseases.",2003

This region is covered Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism222 223 entirely by 1 fully sequenced RPCI 11 BAC clone and contains at  least 6 candidate genes. Mutational analysis carried out on the coding regions of the candidate  genes did not identify any disease associated mutations. A recent collaboration with the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in  Cambridge UK, has enabled us to sequence the entire non repetitive  portion of the ~65kb region in four TOC family members (an affected  and unaffected member from each of the UK and US families). This  analysis identified 58 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in  one or both of these families, 52 of which proved to be previously  undescribed. Further fine mapping of the TOC disease locus by  haplotype analysis of 23/58 SNPs has allowed the reduction of  the minimal region to 42.5kb.

Long Range PCR amplicons were designed and  amplified in 70 affected individuals from 70 PKD families. Nested  PCR was performed with oligos designed for exons 11 to 34. The  PCR products were digested with T7 Endonuclease I and run on a  12% Polyacrylamide gel. The gel was stained with the Silver Staining  method for greater resolution of the DNA fragments. Concurrently, we tested exons from the same 70 samples using  Single Strand Confomation Analysis (SSCA) with radioactive oligos,  and direct sequencing. We present data on the optimisation of the EMC method, optimal  PCR fragment length, and its accuracy and cost effectiveness when  compared to SSCA and direct sequencing. For example, in exon  17, all methods were equally effective at identifying single base  substitutions (7412C>T, P2471L and 7441C>T, L2481C/T) when  present in a heterozygous state.

Blood samples were taken from  60 patients with CF (32 middle CF, 28 severe CF) and 164 control  subjects. The frequency of Val/Val genotype of CYP1A1 gene was significantly  higher in patients with severe CF (0.07 ) compared to control (0.00)  and middle CF (0.00) patients (p<0.01). The frequency of Ile/Val genotype was higher in middle CF patients (0.160 versus 0.06  in control ) (OR= 2.82) and in severe CF patients (0.11). These  appears to be high association between severity of CF phenotype  and the mutation of CYP1A1 gene which increase enzyme activity  (OR=27.64).

Genotype distributions for 39 assays (9.5%)  deviated from HWE (P< 0.05), which is approximately two times  more than would be expected by chance. Some of the possible  reasons for this deviation were explored: assays for five SNPs proved  non specific and genotyping errors were identified in 23 SNPs.

"," Jeune asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (JATD; MIM number 208500)  is an autosomal recessive multisystem developmental disorder.  JATD is characterised by abnormal skeletal development, with typical  radiographic findings that include a long, narrow âbell shapedâ thorax  with short, abnormal ribs, metaphyseal irregularities, abnormal pelvis  and short long bones (involving predominately ulnae, radii, fibulae  and tibiae). Renal, hepatic, pancreatic and retinal abnormalities  are common features of JATD and polydactyly of both hands and/ or feet has been reported. JATD demonstrates wide phenotypic  variability and cases have been classified into lethal, severe, mild  and latent forms. Most cases are severely affected and die from  asphyxia caused by a small thorax and hypoplastic lungs, in the  perinatal period. We have performed a genome wide linkage search  using autozygosity mapping in a cohort of four consanguineous  families with JATD, three of which originate from Pakistan and one  from southern Italy. We localised a novel JATD locus ( JATD ) to  chromosome 15q13, with a maximum cumulative two point LOD  score at D15S1031 ( Zmax = 3.12 at Î¸ = 0.00). Investigation of a further four European kindreds, with no known parental consanguinity,  revealed evidence of an ancestral haplotype. Both severe and  mild forms of JATD mapped to 15q13, suggesting that phenotypic  variation in JATD reflects allelic heterogeneity and not locus  heterogeneity. However, preliminary work on further JATD families  (both consanguineous and non consanguineous) suggest that not  all of them are linked to chromosome 15q13, indicating that JATD is  likely to be genetically heterogeneous.",2003

The mapping of novel  BBS loci will enable molecular genetic testing to be offered to large  kindreds. This is particularly important for British families, as the  phenotypic spectrum for BBS appears to be broad and could create  problems in genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis in the absence  of a reliable diagnostic test.",2003

According to literature, the  prevalence of this polymorphism in Europe is 30 60% among patients  with Essential hypertension. European studies suggest 15 40%  prevalence of this polymorphism in healthy population. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of  angiotensionogen polymorphism M235T in patients with essential  hypertension and in healthy population from the Republic of Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism226 227 Macedonia, to determine whether there is a statistically significant  difference and to give some clinical aspects. The study was designed as a retrospective prospective case  control study. We analyzed 40 patients and 40 healthy individuals.  We postulated strict inclusion criteria for patients regarding to strict  diagnosis of essential hypertension, family history of essential  hypertension, the level of blood pressure or previous therapy. The  polymorphism was identified with PCR RFLP method, using specific  primers followed by digestion with Tth 111 I restriction enzyme. We found 55% prevalence of M235T in patients with essential  Hypertension and 32,5% in the control group. There was a significant  difference in M235T prevalence in both groups (p<0.04), and  a positive association was observed between angiotensinogen  polymorfism M235T and essential hypertension. This results  suggest the role of angiotensionogen polymorphism M235T in  ethiopatogenesis of essential hypertension in patients from the  Republic of Macedonia.

VUR can cause  kidney damage and is the most common cause of end stage  renal failure and severe hypertension in children. It is caused by  a shortening of the segment of the ureter, which runs through the  submucosal layer of the bladder wall. VUR occurs frequently in  families, suggesting that it is inherited, but the mode of inheritance  is still unknown. We have collected 480 DNAâs from 97 families with  more than one child affected with primary VUR. We are using this  resource to assess candidate VUR susceptibility genes selected  based on literature reviews. The uroplakins (UPK) are integral membrane proteins that physically  strengthen the bladder wall. Based on knockout studies in mice,  Hu et al., 2000 suggested UPK3 as a candidate for primary VUR.  Three of the 4 uroplakin genes have been investigated. Other genes  investigated were GFRA1, the GDNF alpha receptor essential for  neuronal survival and renal morphogenesis; KAL 1, mutated in  patients with Kallman syndrome, which is associated with VUR and  BMP4 or bone morphogenetic protein 4 which co ordinates ureteric  growth with other secreted factors. We have excluded UPK3 and  a region on chromosome 10q (25.3) as major candidates. We are  currently screening more promising candidates for pathological  mutations.",2003
Absence of mutations in genes AGTR2 and UPK3  in patients with vesico ureteric reflux,P759.,"Zagradisnik , K. Bracic, A. Gregoric, N. Kokalj Vokac","Teaching Hospital Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia",Primary vesico ureteric reflux is a common anomaly of the  urogenital tract in children. It has a strong association with urinary  tract infections and permanent kidney damage. The reflux is in  most patients of genetic origin but so far only mutated PAX2  gene  has been found to cause the vesico ureteric reflux in a rare renal  coloboma syndrome. Several genetic loci were linked to vesico  ureteric reflux but candidate genes have not been identified as yet.  Knock out mice for genes AGTR2  (encoding angiotensin II type 2  receptor) and UPK3  (encoding uroplakin type 3) are prone to develop  different anomalies of the kidney and ureter including vesico ureteric  reflux. Therefore it appears plausible to assume a role for these  genes in the the development of vesico ureteric reflux. The aim of  this study was to screen the coding regions of the AGTR2  and UPK3   genes for potential mutations in patients with primary congenital  vesico ureteric reflux. In 82 patients with primary congenital reflux genomic DNA was  extracted from whole blood samples. The coding regions of AGTR2   and UPK3  were screened for mutations with heteroduplex analysis and subsequent sequencing. In the coding region of AGTR2  (exon 3) no mutations or single  nucleotide polymorphisms were detected and in 6 exons of UPK3   only silent single nucleotide polymorphisms or polymorphisms in flanking  intronic sequences were found. These results indicate that mutations in AGTR2  and UPK3  are not  the cause of the disease in our patients with vesico ureteric refl ux.,2003
Construction of a linkage disequilibrium map in a  schizophrenia locus on 15q15 with microsatellite markers,P760.,"B. Ekici1, G. Stober2, H. Beckmann2, A.

","We earlier reported significant evidence for linkage on chromosome  15q15 in periodic catatonia (PECA), a sub phenotype of  schizophrenic psychoses. Recently we were able replicate this  initial finding in a second independent set of families. Linkage and  haplotype analysis in a set of exceptionally large multiplex families  each showing linkage to this locus revealed an 11 cM critical region.  In order to aid the positional cloning effort, we set out to construct a  linkage disequilibrium (LD) map of this region using 57 microsatellite  markers. We genotyped these markers in 189 individuals from 44 families,  27 trios and 17 extended families with PECA. Next we determined  phase using Simwalk2 and extracted the non transmitted haplotypes.  We assessed LD using the HaploXT algorithm as implemented in  the GOLD software package (Abecasis and Cookson, 2000). We  detected significant LD (Dâ>0.3; p>0.05) for a broad range of inter  marker distances up to 630kb. Three marker pairs showed Dâ>0.5  and strongest LD (Dâ=0.65) was seen for one marker pair 87kb apart.  Though LD tented to decline with inter marker distance no clear  correlation could be observed. Using haplotypes with a frequency  of p>0.15 only, a block like pattern of LD over longer distances  interrupted by short stretches without any detectable LD was  discernable. Although this pattern resembles those generally seen  for regions with high density SNP genotyping, resolution of LD block  structure was imprecise. More dense typing of markers including  SNPs is therefore necessary to be useful for disease oriented LD  studies.",2003
The androgen receptor CAG repeat and the risk of  Alzheimerâs disease in men,P761.,"T. Butler , D. G. Lehmann, E. Hogervorst, D. R. Warden, J.  Ragoussis, A. D. Smith","Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford, Oxford,  United Kingdom","In elderly men, low serum testosterone has been associated with  poor cognitive performance and with Alzheimerâs disease (AD).  Testosterone exerts various neuroprotective actions, all via the  androgen receptor (AR). AR isoforms are the main, perhaps sole  receptors for testosterone. The AR is expressed at high density in the  human brain, eg in the hippocampus. The glutamine (CAG) repeat  polymorphism has been associated with transcriptional activity of the  AR and with several brain disorders. In a Caucasian cohort from the Oxford region of 101 men with  sporadic, âdefiniteâ or âprobableâ AD (mean onset age: 71 years) and  140 elderly male controls (mean age: 76 years), we divided the data  into short (20 CAG repeats) and long AR alleles. Short alleles were  associated with AD: odds ratio = 2.5 (95% CI: 1.2 5.0), adjusted for  age and carrier status of the genes, APOE (4 and BCHE K). This  association was particularly strong in early onset cases (< 65 years). In a subset of 79 cases and 128 controls, both short AR alleles and  low serum levels of total testosterone were associated with AD, with  odds ratios > 2 (p < 0.05) in each case. The odds ratio of AD for men  with short alleles and lower tertile testosterone versus those with long  AR alleles and upper tertile testosterone was 4.2 (1.4 â 13) These results suggest that short AR alleles are associated with  increased risk of AD in men and that low serum testosterone may  interact with short alleles in that association.Linkage Mapping and Polymorphism226 227",2003

The complete etiology  of TS is not well understood, but evidence for genetic transmission  comes from family and twin studies. A complex mode of inheritance  has been suggested, likely involving contributions of different  effect size from several genes. In such complex disorders the co  occurrence of chromosomal aberrations with the phenotype often  proves helpful in identifying etiologically significant genes. We have identified two unrelated families wherein balanced t(6;8)  chromosomal translocations occur in individuals diagnosed with  TS. In one of these families, there appears to be co transmission  of the translocation with learning and behavioral problems, the  translocation in the case in the other family appears to occur de  novo . The breakpoint on chromosome 8 is common to both families,  and takes place in the same q13 band suggesting that a gene or  genes in this region may contribute to the TS phenotype. In support  of this hypothesis are the previously published reports of linkage to  chromosome 8 in families with TS affected individuals, as well as  cytogenetic reports that described chromosomal anomalies involving  8q in patients with TS. We have undertaken positional cloning of the chromosome 8  breakpoint region, and have identified YAC and BAC clones that  span the breakpoint, further reducing the region of interest to 120  Kb.

In TB patients a trend to significant deviation of 469+14 G/C and  C274T genotypes from that expected under Hardy Weinberg  equilibrium was shown (p=0.099 and p=0.048, respectively),  indirectly suggesting an association of the variants with the disease.  A comparison of distributions of genotypes and frequencies of alleles  between the TB patients and controls did not confirm this assumption.  A comparison of distributions of genotypes and allele frequencies  in salmonellosis patients and controls did not reveal a difference  for NRAMP1  polymorphisms, whereas there was a significant  discrepancy in the distribution of genotypes of the IL12B   polymorphism A1188C (table, p=0.034). Overall, the data obtained suggest an absence of association  between the commom polymorphisms in NRAMP1  and TB or  salmonellosis.

The cause of this disease is unclear.  One genetic factor predisposing to sCJD is known being a common  polymorphism in the coding region of the PRNP gene at the codon  129 (M129V). However, the major predisposing factor(s) for sCJD  are still unknown. Genotyping the genomic DNA of 584 sCJD cases  and 749 healthy controls by means of MALDI TOF MS (MassArray,  Sequenom, San Diego), we observed significant association between  sCJD and the allele frequency of the PRNP SNP 129[A/G] confirming  the predisposing role of methionine and homozygosity at codon  129 in the CJD cases. Furthermore, we detected a highly significant  association between the SNP PRNP_117 and sCJD which might act  as an additional risk factor to the SNP PRNP_129. Currently we are genotyping a set of another 10 SNPs in the PRNP   locus. Analysing these polymorphic positions in the PRNP locus will  be useful to evaluate published data on some of these positions  which were derived from much smaller cohorts and produced  conflicting data. The role of the PRNP polymorphisms in sCJD aside  from the codon 129 polymorphism will be much clearer defined. In  addition, we are studying 2 SNPs within the PrP like protein gene  (PRND) as well as 10 polymorphisms in three further genes which  are known to be differentially expressed during prion infection or to  interact with prion proteins.

Real time PCR technology using SYBR Green I dye:  A method for the relative quantification of mitochondrial  gene expression in AlzheimerÂ´s disease,P777.,"RodrÃ­guez Santiago , V. Nunes","Medical and Molecular Genetics Centre IRO, LâHospitalet de  Llobregat, Barcelona, Spain","Reverse transcription followed by real time PCR using the SYBR  Green I dye is a powerful tool for the detection and quantification  of mRNA. The sequence independent detection of DNA with SYBR  Green I means that it can be used to quantify the amplification  of any cDNA using gene specific primers. Generally, two quantification strategies can be performed: An absolute and a  relative quantification. The relative quantification is based on the  expression ratio of a target gene versus a reference gene and is  adequate for most purposes to investigate physiological changes in  gene expression levels. In this work we used a relative quantification  strategy to determine the relative expression of four mitochondrial  genes (cytochrome b, 12S, ND4 and COX II) and one reference gene  (cyclophilin gene) in blood and in three brain areas (cerebellum,  hippocampus and frontal cortex) from two groups of controls and  Alzheimerâs disease patients. We used the model developed by Dr.  Pfafflâs group to manage our data, this model allows comparisons  between groups for the reference gene and for the target genes and  tests the group differences for significance with a randomisation  test. The expression of the target genes are normalised by the non  regulated reference gene expression. The relative expression ratio  is calculated from the real time PCR efficiencies and the crossing  point deviation of an unknown sample versus a control. This rapid  and flexible real time PCR method is suited for researchers wishing  to quantify mRNAs from many different genes because it does not  require investment in gene specific hybridisation probes.",2003

Stratification for joint affection resulted  in positive association for five intragenic SNPs and the microsatellite  D3S1551. We now analysed these markers in a cohort of 210 Falk  Rubinstein trios with psoriasis and could not confirm this association  as only one SNP (EC2) gave marginally significant evidence for  association (p=0.0478). One haplotype (B1551S4/ B1551S3/ EC2)  also showed weak association (p=0.0321). As this psoriasis study  group contains only few patients with arthritis, we conclude that this  gene is not involved in skin type of psoriasis, at least in our sample. Recently we started a new study on psoriasis arthritis aiming at  recruiting 300 psoriasis patients with joint inflammation, both in  case control and trio designs. So far, we were able to analyse the Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance230 231 5 SNPs in the SLC12A8 gene for the first 140 patients and 228  healthy controls.

We will now attempt to confirm  this finding in the larger cohort. In summary, this report is the first to  confirm association to SLC12A8.

There was no family history of HSCR or carcinoma. Sequencing  of the RET proto oncogene revealed a C620R mutation in all the  affected children. This mutation is predominantly associated with  Multiple Endocrine Neoplasia 2A (MEN2A), though HSCR is found at  low penetrance in these families. The childrenâs mother was referred for endocrinological investigation,  and is now being treated for Medullary Thyroid Carcinoma (MTC). Subsequent analysis confirmed that she carries the mutation.  The oldest child is approaching the age at which prophylactic  thyroidectomy is advised, and members of the more extended family  are undergoing predictive testing. MEN2A is a dominantly inherited cancer syndrome pre  disposing gene carriers to medullary thyroid carcinoma (MTC),  phaeochromocytoma and hyperparathyroidism. MTC is an aggressive  tumour which metastasises early and has a poor prognosis. Up to  50% of MTC cases present with cervical lymph node metastases.  MEN2A gene carriers develop MTC in teenage life. Identification of  gene carriers, screening and prophylactic thyroidectomy are therefore  an important part of management of this condition. Early diagnosis of MEN2A is vital. HSCR is common, affecting 1 in  5000 live births. We therefore discuss whether ALL cases of HSCR,  whether sporadic or familial should routinely be offered molecular  analysis for all 3 Cysteine replacement mutations known to be  associated with both diseases, in order to identify those families with  potential future problems.",2003

","This report summarizes our data concerning involvement of some  genes participating in Phase 1 and Phase 2 of detoxification systems  in the origin, progression and treatment efficiency of such common  multifactorial diseases as endometriosis, bronchial asthma, alcoholic  cirrhosis, habitual miscarriages, gestosis, lung cancer, chronic  bronchitis etc. A special theoretical and practical value of these  studies is the identification of highly nonrandom associations of  particular functionally inferior alleles of the genes belonging to the  glutathione S  transferase family ( GSTM1  (0), GSTT1  (0), GSTPi  ( s)  as well as N acetyl transferase NAT 2  (s) with these diseases. Thus  molecular testing of these alleles might be recommended as a feasible  predictive test for evaluation of personal predisposition, for estimation  of ultimate prognosis and for the treatment strategy in at least some  of these diseases. About 5 7% of all population in the North West  of Russia possess the most unfavorable combinations of GST  genotypes ( GSTM1 0/0; GSTT1 0/0, GSTPi  s/s). Early identification of  these individuals by means of genetic screening supplemented with  subsequent adequate social and medical care should be considered  as a feasible social program for efficient prevention of these  diseases at the national level. Based on these data as well as on the  polymorphism studies and common mutation identification of other  genes, the idea of a Genetic Form for pregnant women is suggested  and briefly discussed . Implementation of new sophisticated and highly  productive molecular techniques suitable for widespread population  gene polymorphism screening becomes highly advisable.",2003
No evidence for a role of C7orf10 in the aetiology of  Silver Russell syndrome,P789.,"Eggermann1, E. Meyer1, M. Dobos2, G. Schwanitz3, H.

About7â10% of  SRS patients show maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome  7. Additionally, five SRS patients have been described carrying  rearrangements in 7p. Therefore, a central role of chromosome 7in  the etiology of SRS can be delineated. Recently, Nakabayashi and  coworkers (Genomics 20002, 79:186 196) have shown in two of  these patients that the breakpoints on 7p14 were localised within the  same gene, C7orf10.We therefore screened our SRS patients (n=45)  for mutations of the coding region as well as for rearrangements of  C7orf10: By SSCP, we detected two abnormal patterns in exons 8  and 15 of the C7orf10 coding sequence. In case of exon 8, a G>A  transition at cDNA position 652 was detected, representing a silent  mutation (L243L). In the first SSCP fragment of exon 15, we detected  a C>G transversion at cDNA position 1217, corresponding to the  published SNP rs1053953. Both variants were detected in similar  frequencies in SRS patients and controls. Using a Real Time PCR  approach based on TaqMan technology, we excluded duplications  or deletions of exon 14 of the C7orf10 gene. In total, our results do  not indicate a relevant role of C7orf10 in the aetiology of SRS. With  C7orf10, a strong SRS candidate has been excluded; however,  further studies on (imprinted) genes on chromosome 7 are needed to  elucidate the contribution of this chromosome to the SRS phenotype.",2003

To identify genes involved in AVSD we have  analyzed the heart gene expression profile in fetuses affected by  Down syndrome, with or without AVSD. Fetal hearts were obtained from therapeutic abortions less than  8 hours after death assessment. Half of the heart, representative  of all four chambers, was used to extract total RNA to be used in  the microarray experiments while the other half was fixed, paraffin  embedded and used to confirm and characterize the heart disease.  Ten heart samples, derived from male fetuses at 21 weeks of  gestation, were selected: 3 were from Down fetuses with AVSD, 3  were from Down fetuses without AVSD and 4 were from non Down  fetuses, without heart disease, to be used as controls. The Affymetrix  oligoâmicroarrays technique was used; the data obtained by the  hybridization of the microarrays were analyzed with the D Chip and  the GeneSpring software. It was found that 74 chromosome 21  genes, out of 134 analyzed, were expressed in fetal hearts. Thirty  genes, out of these 74, were upregulated in fetuses affected by Down  syndrome. Twenty two genes resulted to be differentially expressed,  with a fold change greater than 1.5, in the comparison between Down  fetuses with or without AVSD.

","Preeclampsia is a pregnancy specific syndrome that usually  occurs after 20 weeks of gestation, with vasoconstriction and  hypercoagulability as major physiopathological events. It is  considered a multifactorial disease, with both genetic and acquired  factors playing a role. Several studies indicate an association  between thrombophilic gene variants and severe preeclampsia. In  the present investigation we have evaluated the frequency of several  thrombophilic gene variants in subjects with mild preeclampsia. The  frequency of FV Leiden, PT G20210A, MTHFR C677T and PAI 1  4G/5G gene variants was evaluated. We compared 52 women with  preeclampsia to 80 women with normal pregnancy. None of the  preeclamptic women suffered of the severe form of preeclampsia. Results . The FV Leiden, PT G20210A and MTHFR C677T gene  variants were not associated to preeclampsia. In the case of the   675 4G/5G polymorphism of the PAI 1 gene, the genotype 4G/4G  was more prevalent in the preeclamptic group, while the 5G/5G was  more prevalent in the control group (Ï2 test for trend, P = 0.0141).

All three Paraoxonase genes (PON1, PON2 and PON3)  map to chromosome 7q21 22. Functional polymorphisms of PON1 and PON2 genes, which modify  enzyme activity, could be a marker for atherosclerosis. In some Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance234 235 populations PON1 variants have been associated with higher LDL  or Triglyceride levels. Recently, Paraoxonase 3 has been reported  to be closely associated with HDL and to have the same protective  functions. Methods: A cohort of 181 healthy Scottish individuals with lipid profile data  (adjusted for age, sex, BMI and smoking, drinking habits) was  recruited to determine the effects of different PON genotypes on  lipid profile; two common polymorphisms in PON1 [Gln (Q)/Arg (R)]  at codon 192 and [Met (M)/Leu (L)] at codon 55; two in the PON2  gene at codon 311 [Cys (C)/Ser (S)] and codon 148 [Ala (A)/Gly (G)];  and two Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms [rs2074353 (PON3 1) &  rs1053275 (PON3 3)] (both âAâ to âGâ) in PON3 gene.

In addition, a nationwide population study will be  established with the purpose of observing disease incidences and  structural patterns of rearrangements. Material:  All individuals with a balanced chromosomal rearrangement  in Denmark.  Methods: The clinical data are obtained by questionnaires, registers  and medical files. Children and individuals with mental retardation are  excluded from the questionnaire study. The questionnaires contain  questions about all kinds of late onset disorders: cardiovascular ,  cancer, endocrinology, fertility, etc. Results:  to date: Of 185 questionnaires sent out to carriers with  balanced reciprocal translocation, 152 wanted to participate  (compliance 82 %). 1) A number of cases were associated with common diseases like  myopia, allergy, asthma, arthritis, hypertension etc. 2) We observed  carriers suffering from diseases with breakpoints in chromosomal  regions known to harbour loci for the corresponding diseases. 3) In  some families we observed co segregation between the translocation  and the clinical phenotype. 4) Among the carriers we observed  clinical entities with unknown genetic aetiology and this might provide  the first hint for the localisation of a candidate locus.

In two independent studies a  QTL for bone mineral density (BMD) has also been reported at this  chromosomal position. We therefore investigated whether the LRP5  gene contributes to the variability in these bone traits by analysing  SNPs in the general population.

Association between polymorphism of microsomal  epoxide hydrolase and development of preeclampsia,P798.,"S. Demin1,2, O. V. Malysheva1, E. V. Mozgovaya1, T. E.  Ivashchenko1, V. S. Baranov1","1Ottâs Institute of Obstetrics & Gynecology, St. Petersburg, Russian  Federation, 2State University, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation.  "," Preeclampsia is a frequently occurring complication of pregnancy . A  great number of polymorphisms are associated with this syndrome.  Genetic predisposition to preeclampsia is widely connected with the  detoxification system. Lipid peroxides damage endothelium, thus  increasing blood pressure. Microsomal epoxide hydrolase is one  of the enzymes that inactivates negative effects of these agents.  Polymorphisms of the microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene ( EPHX )  correlate with enzyme activity: Tyr113His (exon 3) and His139Arg  (exon 4) alleles are responsible for low or high activity, respectively. The genotypes of 121 women with a history of preeclampsia and of  77 healthy female controls were studied by a PCR RFLP assay. A statistically significant increase in frequency (28%) of the low  activity allele (His113 in exon 3) in the preeclamptic patients as  compared to controls (13%, OR 2.5, 95% CI 1.4 4.5) has been  noted. No difference between both groups was found for His139Arg  polymorphism. CONCLUSION: The presence of His113 allele of EPHX gene (3  exon), which could influence metabolic activation of endogenous or  exogenous toxic compounds, might be considered as a risk factor for  development of preeclampsia.",2003

A large number of risk factors such  as hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, diabetes, and smoking have  been identified in patients with atherosclerosis. Several biochemical,  pathologic and functional studies suggest that a lectin like receptor  for oxidized low density lipoprotein (ox DL), termed LOX 1, may  be involved in atherogenesis. LOX 1 is a type II membrane protein  belonging to the C type lectin family. A recent linkage study performed  in a mouse model, identified LOX 1 as candidate susceptibility gene  for human atherosclerosis. In order to investigate the role of LOX  1 in human atherosclerosis susceptibility, we screened a group of  192 Italian individuals with angiographic CAD phenotype and 52  Italian controls without any angiographically demonstrable coronary  disease. We characterized ten  different SNPs at the LOX 1 locus.  We observed that SNP5 (C>T) is significantly associated with CAD  (X2 = 10.307; 2 df; p=0.006; Mantel Haenszel test: p=0.0023).

Mutations  at positions 702, 908 and 1007 have been identified as important,  with up to one third of North European CD patients being reported  as having at least 1 copy of these common Nod2 mutations  (Cuthbert et al, 2002).

We have  studied the frequency of these mutations in 500 Scottish patients  with inflammatory bowel disease and 250 healthy controls and  have found no significant association between these mutations and  susceptibility to Crohnâs disease. Preliminary data on 96 Irish CD  patients closely mirror these results, and we hypothesise that these  Celtic populations may share a common ancestry and determinants  of disease susceptibility, either within the Nod2 gene or distinct to  this.

Medicine and Pathology, CSS Mendel Inst., La Sapienza  University, Rome, Italy.  "," Crohnâs disease (CD) and Ulcerative colitis (UC), the main types of  IBD, have a genetic predisposition. A strong body of evidence shows  that CARD15 gene is associated with susceptibility to CD. Aim: We  used the pyrosequencing approach to detect the single mutations  of the 3 more common gene variants: 3020insC, Arg702Trp, and  Gly908Arg. Methods:  Reactions were performed with mixing and  contained gel pad (sepharose beads) bound single stranded DNA  with annealed sequencing primer in addition as enzyme: DNA  polymerase (exonuclease deficient), apyrase, luciferase, ATP  sulfurylase; and as substrate, adenosine 5â phosphosulfate, and  luciferin. Reactions consisted of stepwise elongation of the primer  strand by one or more nucleotides upon sequential addition of  the individual deoxynucleoside triphosphates [dTTP, dGTP, dCTP,  or dATPaS (deoxyadenosine a thiotri phosphate)] followed by  degradation of excess nucleoside triphosphates after each elongation  step by apyrase. The approach links a DNA synthesis by sequencing  to an enzyme cascade generating light whenever pyrophosphate  is released during template mediated primer elongation. Results:   A total number of 114 IBD families (with two or more affected  individuals) were investigated: 46 CD (141 affected members), 50 UC  (163 affected members) and 18 Mixed families (61 affected members  with CD or UC). The alleles frequency (%) of mutations is showed on  the table ( X2 test). Conclusions : In the Italian population we confirm  the significant association of CARD15 gene mutations and CD.

To evaluate the possible relationship between point mutations  within parkin  gene and ET we carried out a mutational analysis of  the coding region of this  gene in 110 unrelated ET patients. We  set up theoretical conditions for DHPLC mutational analysis of the  12 exons and spilce sites of the parkin  gene. No clear disruptive  mutation (i.e. nonsense or frameshift), nor mutations previously  described in patients with Parkinsonâs disease were identified in our  cohort of ET patients.

Lesions occurs predominantly on the neck and at intertrigineous  areas and first appear after puberty. It has been recently demonstrated (Hu et al, 2000; Sudbrak et  al, 2000) that HHD is caused by mutations in the ATP2C1 gene  encoding an ATP powered Ca2 + pump.68 different ATP2C1  mutations (nonsense, insertion/deletion, splice site) have been  described nowadays and no single mutation appears to be related to  a substantial number of HHD cases in the population. We studied two Italian familial cases of HHD and analysed all  ATP2C1 coding exons by direct sequencing. In the first family we  identified the never previously described nonsense R799X mutation.  In the second family the 807delAC novel variant was present. This  alteration leads to a shift in the reading frame and introduces a  premature termination at codon 818. Our findings confirm the high allelic heterogeneity of ATP2C1 gene  in the Italian population, and support the theory of absence of locus  heterogeneity in HHD. In addition, clinical findings inour cases,  showing an extensive phenotypic intrafamilial variability, further  suggest a role of additional genes, and/or environmental factors, in  modulating the pathology.",2003

Eighty six percent of NS and 67% of ML/LS  patients with PTPN11  mutations were affected by different types  of CHD. Prevalence of CHD was remarkably different between the  two phenotypes. In particular, pulmonary valve stenosis (PVS) was  the predominant CHD among NS patients with mutations, with a  significant hot spot in exon 8, while hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM) was more frequent among ML/LS patients, with hot spots  in exons 7 and 12. Atrial septal defect (ASD) was correlated with  mutations in exon 3, while atrioventricular canal defects and mitral  valve anomalies were detected in different PTPN11  gene domains.  The present study argues for a causal relationship between PTPN11   mutations and a wide spectrum of heart defects. PVS, ASD and HCM  are likely to occur in association with specific exon mutations, with a  different distribution between NS and ML/LS patients.This work was  supported by the Italian Ministry of Health and EducationP821. Case Report: A case of Cardio Facio Cutaneous  Syndrome   I. Bokesoy , R. Akcay, H. G. Karabulut;  Ankara University, School of Medicine, Department of Medical  Genetics, Ankara, Turkey.   Cardio Facio Cutaneous (CFC) syndrome was first descirbed by  Reynolds et al. in 1986. As its name implies it is a multiple congenital  anomalies / mental retardation syndrome. It shows congenital heart  defects with consistent pattern of craniofacial dysmorphisms and  signs of ectodermal involvement. Various types of congenital cardiac  defects have been repeatedly found; atrial septal defects and/or  pulmonic stenosis being the most common. A girl was referred to our department at 18 month of age by her  pediatrician because of multiple anomalies. She had motor and  mental retardation with prominent forehead, shallow orbital ridges,  strabismus, long philtrum, short upturned nose, depressed nasal  bridge, coarse facial features, posteriorly rotated ears, ventricular  septal defect, hyperextensible knees, multiple palmar and plantar  creases, sparse and slow growing hair and hydrocephalus. In  addition she had coarse voice and blue sclerae. Pedigree revealed  that this was a sporadic case. Based on these findings we concluded  that the patient had CFC syndrome. There is no patient in the  literature noted to have ventricular septal defect yet. This patient is  also the first CFC syndrome case with coarse voice and blue sclerae.",2003

As  chemical and molecular chaperones may prevent newly synthesized  proteins from incorrect folding and/or aggregation we studied their effect on activity and protein assembly of selected CBS mutants  (delEx12, I278T, E176K, A114V, G85R). We expressed the CBS mutants in E.coli and CHO cells, measured  the catalytic activity and monitored the degree of assembly by native  western blotting. We examined the effect of CBS ligands i.e., heme precursor hemin  and pyridoxal 5Â´ phosphate precursor pyridoxine, on mutant CBS  assembly and activity. Hemin treatment increased CBS activity of  I278T, delEx12 and A114V mutants; the pyridoxine had the same  effect to the later mutant. To determine the effect of chemical chaperones on CBS mutants,  various chemical chaperons in a broad concentration range were  used. The trimethyl N oxide treatment restored delEx12 and A114V  activity; the betaine had the same effect on the later mutant. To examine the effect of molecular chaperones, we co expressed  in E.coli  CBS mutants with GroES/GroEL chaperones. The  overexpressed chaperones positively affected both the activity and  assembly of A114V, E176K and delEx12 mutants. Our results suggest that some CBS mutants may be stabilized  in native (active) state already by increased ligand concentration  (heme, pyridoxal 5Â´ phosphate). Chemical chaperones (trimethyl  N oxide, betaine) increase activity of several CBS mutants.  Some mutant proteins can be rescued only by co expression  with molecular chaperones. Ligands and chaperones should be  taken into consideration as possible novel treatment modalities for  homocystinuria. This project was supported by grants GACR 305/02/D167, GAUK  12/01.",2003

ARC (arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction, cholestasis)  syndrome (OMIM 208085), also known as Nezelof syndrome is a rare  autosomal recessive metabolic disease. Fewer than 40 cases have  been described in the literature over the last 30 years. The patients  are born with variable degree of arthrogryposis, renal dysfunction,  manifesting usually as proximal tubular insufficiency, and cholestasis.  Liver biopsy displays giant cell hepatitis with lipofuscin deposition  or biliary duct hypoplasia. Some aspects of liver disease are similar  to those found in progressive familial intrahepatic cholestasis  (PFIC) type I and II, in which, as in ARC, serum gamma glutamyl  transpeptidase (GGT) activity is low. We collected the largest series  of DNA from families affected by ARC and investigated whether ARC  is allelic with PFIC I or II by homozygosity mapping. Methods and Results. DNA from patients and their families  were collected with informed consent. Initial linkage studies were  performed in four families using four microsatellite markers that are  within a genetic distance of 1 cM of the ABCB11  and ATP8B1 genes.  Mutations in these genes are associated with low GGT cholestasis.  Linkage to both genes was excluded in these ARC families. We are  now proceeding with a genome wide linkage search to map the ARC  locus. Conclusions. ARC syndrome is not an allelic condition to PFIC I or  II. Further research will help to identify the gene that is mutated in this  devastating disease.Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance242 243",2003

Several acute kidney injury models in Opn knockout mice  have demonstrated short term attenuation of macrophage infiltration,  but the effects of OPN deficiency in chronic renal injury are not  known. Opn /  mice show normal renal development and histology.  The lack of spontaneous deposition of lithogenic substances  in kidneys from these mice suggests that OPN may not have a  significant reno protective role in vivo in the absence of additional  renal insult. Mice with adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (Aprt)  deficiency develop 2,8 dihydroxyadenine (DHA) nephrolithiasis  similar to human patients due to the conversion of adenine to  DHA by xanthine dehydrogenase. We therefore created Aprt/Opn   double knockout mice to delineate the role(s) of OPN in chronic  renal stone disease. Male and female mice at 6 and 12 weeks of  age were characterized by HPLC analysis of urinary purines and  immunohistochemistry for macrophages. Urinary purine levels  showed no significant differences between Aprt /  Opn /  and Aprt  /  Opn+/+ mice. Immunostaining with a biotinylated antibody against  macrophage marker F4/80 also showed no statistically significant  differences between the two genotypes. These studies suggest that  OPN may not play a crucial protective role in chronic renal injury ,  and that the expression of other chemokines may be upregulated to  compensate for OPN deficiency.

Among these, cytochrome  c oxidase deficiency (RC complex IV; COX) is relatively frequent.  RC deficiencies are not only caused by mutations in genes coding  for the structural subunits of the respiratory chain themselves,  but also in genes coding for proteins involved in assembly and  biogenesis of the complexes.

Multiplex  genotyping was used for D6, C19 and C9, and this procedure  enabled simultaneous scoring of two or three polymorphisms in  the same assay. When patient samples with known genotype were  analysed, the Pyrosequencing assays correctly identified 100% of the  alleles.

We investigate the effect of a potent in vitro inhibitor of porcine kidney  and human erythrocytes prolidase, the N benzyloxycarbonyl L proline  (CBZ Pro), on human prolidase, obtained from cultured fibroblasts.  A 91 % inhibition was detected incubating cellular extracts with 1:1  ratio of Gly Pro substrate: CBZ Pro inhibitor (20mM) at pH 7.8. Pulse  experiments performed incubating human fibroblasts with 6 mM CBZ  Pro from 1 min to 1 hour and up to 10 days revealed that the inhibitor  permeated quickly the membrane. After 1 min the intracellular  amount of inhibitor, calculated by capillary electrophoresis, was  282.5Â±15.92 nmol/ mg. The uptake of CBZ Pro tended to saturate  as its concentration increased over 8 mM. Acidic pH of the medium  (pH=6.0) stimulated the uptake of CBZ Pro. Long term incubation  of fibroblasts with CBZ Pro caused mitochondria depolarization  and increased cellular death as reported for long term culture of  fibroblasts obtained from PD patients, which lack prolidase activity .  In conclusion we demonstrated that CBZ Pro is a potent inhibitor of  human fibroblasts prolidase with high permeability to the membrane  and it could potentially be used in vivo to better characterize the  prolidase enzyme and further investigate PD physiopathology.",2003

Underlying  lesions include focal and diffuse forms sharing similar clinical  presentations, but differing in molecular mechanisms. Focal CHI  has been ascribed to loss of heterozygosity for a paternally  inherited mutation in the ATP sensitive potassium channel (KATP)  genes SUR1 or Kir6.2 due to a maternal aneusomy (11p15.1) in  the pancreatic lesion. Indeed, the loss of the maternal chromosome  11p15 in the focal lesion disrupts the balanced expression of  several imprinted tumour suppressor genes mapped to this region.  Diffuse CHI undergoes distinct mechanisms involving autosomal  recessive or dominant inheritance. No more than 50% of diffuse  and approximately 30% of focal CHI have known molecular bases.  Recently, the role of hepatocyte nuclear factor HNF 3Î² (Foxa2)  in glucose sensing and pancreatic Î² cells homeostasis has been  described and the absence of HNF 3Î² has been shown to lead to  altered expression of the KATP channel subunits SUR1 and Kir6.2 in  transgenic mice and insulin secreting cell lines.

Mutation for the  32 base pair deletion in the CCR 5 gene makes its holders nearly  immune to AIDS, since this gene has no receptor for AIDS related  viruses. The mutant allele of CCR 5 is present at high frequency in  the Caucasian population (9 13%), but is absent in the Japanese and  black populations. The aim of this study was to assess the frequency  of the truncated allele of CCR 5 gene in the Kazakh population of  Central Asia, representative of Turkic speaking ethnic groups. A total  of 224 unrelated healthy Kazakh people were studied. A portion of  CCR 5 gene from genomic DNA was amplified by PCR and analyzed  on a 6% polyacrylamide gel. The frequency of the delta CCR 5  allele was 4.91%, significantly lower than reported in the Caucasian  population, but more frequent than in other Turkic speaking ethnic  groups (1 3%) and African, East Asian or Indian populations (0%).  8.04% of Kazakhs had one defective gene, and only 0.89% had both  genes defective. Thus our results indicate that the CCR 5 delta 32  mutation is not only immense in its distribution among the population,  but it also, according OâBrienâs theory, first occurred in northern  Europe and then spread south slowly in the course of migrations.",2003
PDS is a new susceptibility gene to autoimmune  thyroid diseases : association and linkage study,P839.,"Hadj Kacem1, A. Rebai1, N. Kaffel2, S. Masmoudi1, M. Abid2, H.

The PDS gene (7q31), responsible for  Pendred syndrome (congenital sensorineural hearing loss and  goitre), encodes a transmembrane protein known as pendrin.  Pendrin is an apical porter of iodide in the thyroid. To evaluate the  contribution of the PDS gene in susceptibility to AITD, we examined  four microsatellite markers in the chromosomal region. One hundred  ninety five unrelated patients (GD,141; HT, 54), fifteen multiplex  AITD families (104 individuals/46 patients) and 154 normal controls  were genotyped. Analysis of case control data showed a significant  association of D7S496  and D7S2459  with GD (p= 10 3) and HT  (p= 1.07x10 2) respectively. A family based association test (FBAT)  showed significant association and linkage between AITDs and  alleles 121bp of D7S496  and 173bp of D7S501 . Results obtained by  TDT are in good agreement with those obtained by FBAT; linkage and  association of the 121 bp allele of D7S496  with AITD was confirmed  (p=0.0114). Multipoint non parametric linkage analysis using MERLIN  showed intriguing evidence for linkage with marker D7S496  in  families with only GD patients (Z=2.12, LOD=0.81, p=0.02). Single  point and Multipoint parametric LOD score linkage analysis was also  performed. The highest multipoint parametric LOD score was found  for marker D7S496  (LOD=1.23; p=0.0086) in families segregating for  GD under a dominant model. This work suggest that the PDS gene  should be considered a new susceptibility gene to AITDs with varying  contribution in each pathology.",2003

The  Lithuanians and the Latvians are the only Baltic cultures that survived  until today, therefore molecular genetic characterisation of these  populations may help to reconstruct the prehistory and ethnogenesis  of the people in this area. We have analysed mitochondrial DNA and  Y chromosome diversity in six ethnolinguistic groups of Lithuanians.  Analysis of molecular variance shows that all variation in Lithuania is  due to variation within groups, and no variation was detected among  groups neither in mtDNA nor Y chromosome markers. Comparisons  of mtDNA sequences with other European populations have not  revealed significant differences, however, more lineages are shared  with populations of northern Europe. Y chromosome analysis shows  Lithuanian population to be closest to Latvians and Finno Ugric  speaking Estonians, all three populations being indistinguishable  in frequencies of biallelic markers. Interestingly, Lithuanians  have a high frequency (~37%) of TatC allele, which is frequent in  Uralic speakers of northern Eurasia. However, the analysis of Y  chromosome microsatellite markers (DYS19, DYS389, DYS390,  DYS391, DYS392, DYS393, DYS385) on TatC allele background  in Lithuanians and Estonians revealed significant differences, thus  indicating different histories of these populations. Lower gene  diversity and nearly star like median joining network of Lithuanian  TatC chromosomes indicates a recent population bottleneck, however  major Lithuanian haplotypes are rare in Estonians, suggesting that  these populations have different origins or have differentiated before  Indo Europeazation took place in Eastern Baltics.",2003
LD Blocks and SNP based haplotypes in the Fragile  X region,P841.,"Ennis , A. Collins, N. Morton","Human Genetics Division, University of Southampton, Southampton,  United Kingdom","Unstable germline transmission of the FRAXA CGG triplet repeat  at Xq27.3 results in transcriptional silencing of the adjacent FMR1  gene when the repeat tract exceeds 200 units. The resulting Fragile  X phenotype is the most common form of inherited mental retardation  affecting ~1/5500 males. Purity and length of the CGG array influence  stability but other cis acting factors are postulated to exist. Over  the last decade, three microsatellite repeats (DXS548, FRAXAC1  and FRAXAC2), have been commonly applied to characterise the  haplotypic background upon which a FRAXA allele occurs. Although  âhigh riskâ haplotypes have been identified using these markers,  causal determinants of expansion remain elusive. We have typed 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) across  650 kb of the FRAX region on a panel of 797 independent male  chromosomes that span the range of FRAXA repeat sizes. The  resultant haplotypes confirm and extend the information gleaned from  microsatellite haplotypes. A linkage disequilibrium map of the region  was created to identify discrete regions of elevated recombination.  Dendrograms showing the relationships between SNP haplotypes  were established by giving most weight to SNPs which occurred  within the same LD block as the FRAXA mutation and least weight  to SNPs separated from FRAXA by a region of low LD (increased  recombination). Haplotypes within distinct branches of the resultant  dendrograms show high correlation with regard to FRAXA repeat  size, microsatellite marker allele composition and interspersion  pattern. The phylogenetic information is further advanced by primate  haplotypes and provides new clues on the nature and behaviour of  this clinically significant dynamic mutation.",2003

People of Central  Asia are very attractive populations for this investigation, because  they were formed as a result of consolidation of different ethnic  components: Turkic and Iranian speaking. Alu repeats are very  useful markers, because they reflect both maternal and paternal  history of populations; there is no parallel gain of Alu elements at  a particular chromosomal location and thus all chromosomes that  carry a polymorphic Alu insert are identical by descent. We studied  polymorphic Alu  insertions at 5 loci: ACE, TPA25 , PV92 , APOA1 ,  and NBC27  in Kazakhs (n=224), Uzbeks (n=107) and Uigurs (n=69).

In the  present investigation, APOE genotypes and the Glu31Gly presenilin  1 polymorphism of the same three communities, the Awan, Khattar  and Rajpoot, were studied for evidence of predisposition to Alzheimer  disease. The APOe2 allele was absent in all three communities; the  APOEe3 frequency was 91% in the Kathar, 97% in the Rajpoot and  72% in the Awan; and the APOEe4 frequency was 9% in the Kathar,  3% in the Rajpoot and 28% in the Awan, the latter including 4/60  individuals homozygous for e4. By comparison, a very high frequency  (36%) of the Glu31Gly presenilin 1 polymorphism was found only in  the Rajpoot. Further, this polymorphism was restricted to a specific  Rajpoot sub community previously defined by Y haplotype analysis.  As life expectancy increases and age related disorders become  more common, the influence of genetic risk factors will predictably  be reflected in the relative prevalence of Alzheimer disease.

Symptoms  often begin in early adulthood with migraine with aura followed  by cerebral infarcts leading to a stepwise progression of cognitive  decline and finally to dementia. The disease is caused by missense  mutations or small deletions in the Notch3  gene at 19p13 encoding  transmembrane receptor Notch3. In 19 of the 22 Finnish CADASIL  families the disease is caused by R133C mutation. We conducted  a haplotype analysis of these 19 families to determine whether this  overrepresentation of a single mutation is due to a founder effect in  Finnish CADASIL families. Six polymorphic microsatellite markers  around Notch3  locus were selected, D19S885, D19S411, D19S930,  D19S593, D19S410 and D19S215, and marker regions were  amplified by radioactively labelled PCR. The lengths of repetitive  sequences were determined by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis  and autoradiography. In all 19 families we found similar marker  allele construction linked to the R133C mutation, though in some  families marker uninformativity prevented the confirmation of  the mutation linked allele. At least ten families share an identical  haplotype for markers D19S411âD19S593. In sex averaged linkage  map this region is 3.2 KcM long. The shared haplotype is strong  evidence for ancestral mutation in Finnish CADASIL families.

Carrier  frequency analysis for the common mutations confirmed an east to  west gradient for the W151X mutation and a west to east gradient  for the IVS8 1G>C and revealed much higher frequencies for the  common null mutation than expected from the reported prevalence of  SLOS. Using eight cSNPs in the DHCR7 gene haplotypes were constructed  for SLOS chromosomes. All chromosomes carrying the IVS8  1G>C mutation shared the same haplotype. Analysis of flanking  microsatellites together with the frequency distribution in Europe  suggest a founder for the IVS8 1G>C mutation around 2000 years  ago in England or Northern France. The W151X mutation was  present on different related haplotypes and the ancestors of carriers  of all W151X haplotypes could be traced back to the same area  in Poland. Hence the mutation is probably older than the SNPs  used for haplotype construction indicating that W151X may be the  oldest common SLOS mutation in Europeans. The data suggest an  intriguing heterogeneity of the ages and origins of common DHCR7  mutations in Europe.",2003

Both, neutral and functional mutations  are frequent in this gene. We have investigated this gene in 25  unrelated HCM patients from Tomsk (Russia) by SSCP screening  and sequencing. 8.3 kb (about one third of the gene) were analysed.  Three (presumed) functional mutations (one nonsense mutation  and two splicing variants) and 15 polymorphisms were identified.  Three additional polymorphisms were found in one HCM patient  and two asymptomatic probands of different ethnic origin. The SNP  occurence (~1/500 bp) did not differ between exons and introns.  For 13 SNPs the frequencies of the rare alleles were determined  in caucasoid Russians (N=118), in Tuvinians (N=66) and Buriats  (N=59) (mongoloid peoples from Siberia). Six SNPs, among them  three missense SNPs identified in Russians (frequencies up to 10%)  were absent in Tuvinians and Buriats. Comparison with available  online and published data showed that only 8 SNPs from our set of  18 were reported earlier. Three of these were previously qualified as  disease causing mutations. The results show considerable variation  of MYBPC3  in normal populations, as well as distinct ethnic and  geographic distributions of the variants. Thus, the evaluation of  supposed disease related mutations should be based on carefully  selected control samples. It seems that the mutation rate of MYBPC3   is high and mutations even in coding sequences are not under strong  selection pressure. Data on SNPs in this gene bear on gene function  studies as well as on population and evolutionary genetics.Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics248 249",2003

They are inhabited by  242,072 individuals, who live mainly in small rural localities. The  major economic activities are agriculture and farming. The aim of this study was to evaluate consanguinity in the Azorean  population, using marriage records obtained at the National Institute  of Statistics. The data were grouped in 10âyear interval, from 1931 to  2000. In Azores the total number of marriages occurring in this period  was 157,256, of which 954 are consanguineous (0.61%). Within  consanguineous marriages first cousin marriages are much more  frequent (91.7%) than uncle niece/aunt nephew (8.3%). Here, we determined the mean inbreeding coefficient (Î±) of the  population of Azores, Madeira and mainland Portugal, using Wrightâs  formula. To investigate the trend of consanguineous marriages  we plotted Î± over time, observing a similar pattern of decrease for  the three regions. Only during the last decade there was a sharp  decline of Î± in Madeira island to levels below that found in Azores.  Also, both Azores and Madeira islands have higher Î± than mainland.  Presently, we are comparing Î± to the number of inhabitants in  Azorean localities, to investigate whether mate choice restriction is  determined by geographical isolation. This research is a starting point  for further studies regarding the role of consanguinity in the incidence  of hereditary disorders in Azores islands. (pacheco_pc@hotmail.com)",2003
Why was there a peak in the prevalence of Down  syndrome (DS) diagnoses in 1997?,P857.,"K. Morris , D. E. Mutton, E. Alberman","Wolfson Institute of Preventive Medicine, London EC1M 6BQ, United  Kingdom","Trends in the numbers of diagnoses of trisomy 21 have been  monitored using data from the National Down Syndrome Cytogenetic  Register from 1989 2000. The expected number of DS births in  the absence of prenatal diagnoses and selective termination were  calculated and found to be exceptionally high in 1997. These were  expressed as rates/1000 total births in England and Wales, adjusted  for maternal age using indirect standardisation. The standardised rate in 1997 was 7% higher than the average for 1990 2000 (95%CI:  1% 13%). We hypothesised that this could be related to the âpill scareâ in  December 1995, which followed three reports of a twofold increased  risk of venous thromboembolism in users of the third generation  combined oral contraceptives. A subsequent short lived increase of  all pregnancy terminations and births in England and Wales occurred.  However the rise in DS was limited to the last two quarters of 1997,  as much as 18 months later. On the other hand, in women aged  under 35 years, who were more likely to have been affected by the  pill scare, the increase was 11% while in older women it was only 4%. In conclusion, the peak in DS diagnoses in 1997 cannot be explained  by changes in maternal age distribution, the total number of births or  the rate of prenatal diagnoses. A connection with the effects of the pill  scare in 1995 cannot be ruled out, but must remain pure speculation.",2003

Using the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children  (ALSPAC) that can take account of relevant biases and confounding  variables, we show that onset of paternal smoking in the SGP (but  not later) is associated with a shorter gestation of his future sons (but  not daughters). This sex specificity for transgenerational effects was  confirmed in data from the Overkalix community in northern Sweden  using the longevity of cohorts born in 1890, 1905 and 1920. Food  abundance in the paternal grandfatherâs SGP reduced the lifespan  of his grandsons (but not granddaughters), whilst food abundance  in the paternal grandmotherâs SGP reduced the lifespan of her  granddaughters (but not grandsons). Our joint data suggest that the  X and Y chromosome may be mediating these transgenerational  environmental effects, a notion that fits with evolutionary theory and  should be testable.

Linkage disequilibrium mapping: population  differences and positional cloning,P861.,"E. Morton , A. R. Collins","University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom","Localization of genetic determinants of disease (positional cloning)  by linkage has been impressively successful for parametric analysis  of major loci, but nonparametric analysis for oligogenes in complex  inheritance has been less triumphant. Recent years have seen use of  linkage disequilibrium (LD) among single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) to increase resolution of positional cloning. The Malecot  model with association Ï fits pairwise LD better than other metrics  when information weights are used. This has led to maps in LD units  (LDU) that are additive, with 1 LDU corresponding to the distance  in which LD useful for positional cloning is preserved. LD maps  reflect haplotype blocks with uniform LD. Graphical representation  is useful but secondary to map distance. Differences in LD map  length among major ethnic groups and between regions and isolates  have been estimated as a guide to informed choice for positional  cloning. Scaling a cosmopolitan LD map determined for two or more  populations by the Malecot parameters of a local population extracts  95 per cent of the information in a local map at the same resolution.  A general theory for haplotype mapping on either a kb or LDU map  will be presented, with preliminary comparison of errors in positional  cloning when haplotypes of n SNPs are used. LD maps closely  parallel linkage maps, but at much greater resolution. They will be as  useful for positional cloning of oligogenes as linkage maps have been for major loci, and therefore are being integrated with physical and  linkage maps in the same database.",2003

Willis2","1University of East Anglia, Norwich, United Kingdom, 2Norfolk and  Norwich University Hospital, Norwich, United Kingdom","Methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is one of several  enzymes that utilise 5,10 methylene tetrahydrofolate. The activity  of MTHFR is thus a determinant of the pathway down which folate  is directed. Low MTHFR activity such as that associated with the  677T polymorphism reduces the folate available for homocysteine  methylation: accumulated homocysteine may then cause artery  disease. Higher MTHFR activity such as that associated with the  ânormalâ 677C allele may reduce the folate available for other  pathways, in particular thymine synthesis. Impaired thymine  synthesis may result in abnormal DNA synthesis, mutation and  cancer. Numerous small studies have examined the MTHFR 677T  polymorphism in elderly cohorts but have generally failed to reach  statistical significance. We have therefore determined the MTHFR  genotype in 1690 mostly male elderly people and 435 younger  controls. The observed genotypes in the elderly group were CC,  725; CT, 787 and TT, 178. This group is significantly out of Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium. The effect is most marked in the oldest (>85)  men (p<0.01). Comparison with younger controls suggests both  TT and CC homozygotes are missing from this elderly group. We  estimate that more than 2% of the population may fail to reach old  age because of MTHFR genotype. This effect might be prevented by  dietary folate supplementation.",2003

","Diagnosing predisposition to cardiovascular diseases is now an  important tool in realization of different programmes of preventive  medicine. Already associations of many polymorphic alleles with  different diseases have been shown. The most precise associations  have been found for mutations in genes encoding proteins such as  ApoB, ApoE, ApoCIII, LPL, PON 1, MTHFR, MTRR, FV, ACE and  AGT. The method of PCR amplification on a microarray of gel immobilized  primers (microchip), developed in EIMB, has been applied to analysis  of the C677T mutation in the MTHFR gene. The amplification  was carried out simultaneously both in solution covering the  microchip array and inside gel pads. Each gel pad contained the  immobilized forward primers, which were allele specific, while the  fluorescently labeled reverse primers, as well as all components of  the amplification reaction, diffused into the gel pads from the solution.  The effectiveness of amplification was estimated by measuring the  intensity of fluorescent signals from the corresponding gel pads using  a fluorescent microscope with CCD camera. Using this approach, we  could correctly identified homo  and heterozygote genotypes. We consider this approach as a prospective tool for SNP identification  in genomic DNA. We suggest that the use of multiplex allele specific  on chip PCR will result in essential simplification of the analysis of  SNP sets, specific for a disease, allowing the creation of diagnostic  microchips for the detection of predisposition to multifactor diseases,  like cardiovascular pathology.",2003

Most frequent lineages in  Altaic populations were R1a1 (27.1%), N3 (23.0%), and C (12.7%).  Phylogenetic and principal component analyses of haplogroup  frequencies demonstrates that Altaic populations form three  different groups: Eastern Siberian populations, Altaic populations of  Southern Siberia and Caucasoid Altaic populations of Central Asia.  Substantial degree of genetic differentiation within Altaic language  family was demonstrated using both biallelic haplogroup frequency  and molecular variance of microsatellite haplotypes. Between  population genetic differences within Altaic language family account  for 19.4% of total genetic variability for biallelic HGs, and for 18.4% of  variance of microsatellite haplotypes. Hierarchical analysis of genetic  diversity reveals that geographic distances are more important  factor in genetic differentiation of Altaic populations than linguistic  affiliation. Using the molecular variance of microsatellite haplotypes,  coalescent age of ancestral haplotypes for âbinaryâ haplogroups was  estimated. These data show that most of the gene pool of ancestral Altaic population was formed during re colonisation of North Eurasia  after LGM rather than by admixture with pre glacial population. Y  chromosomal data reflect recent language replacement in Yakuts  and Uzbeks. In case of Uzbek population language replacement took  place on the background of partial gene replacement visible at least  in paternal lineages.

The high frequency of  /14/24/ 11/13/13 haplotype in Mocambo and its presence in Rio das RÃ£s can  be explained by interbreeding with European and European derived  people, even though before the foundation of theses communities.  We can conclude: 1) genetic flux among the three population may be  very small or absent and 2) haplotype variability can be explained by  three factors: foundation number, immigration and STR mutational  events.",2003
PON1  gene polymorphisms and diabetic  neuropathy in type 1 diabetes: associations study,P870.,S. Shcherbak,"St. Petersburg State Medical University, St.Petersburg, Russian  Federation.   ","Vascular complications of diabetes are a major cause of morbidity  and mortality, but the mechanisms for their development remain  elusive. The development and progression of diabetic nephropathy,  retinopathy, and neuropathy in type 1 diabetes mellitus are closely  related. Neuropathy usually results from diabetic microvascular injury  involving small blood vessels that supply nerves (vasa nervorum). A  number of facts suggest that diabetic neuropathy may involve genetic  susceptibility. Serum paraoxonase (PON1) is an HDL associated  esterase that hydrolyzes products of lipid peroxidation and prevents  the oxidation of LDL. Oxidized low density lipoproteins (oxLDL)  have been reported to be capable of eliciting neurocytotoxicity.  The PON1  gene has two common coding region polymorphisms  Leu55Met  and Gln192Arg . Both polymorphisms have been identified  as independent risk factors for cardiovascular disease in diabetic  and non diabetic patients. The aim of this study was to examine the  phenotype genotype association between diabetic neuropathy and  the two PON1  gene polymorphisms in subjects with type 1 diabetes.  The study consists of 51 patients with diabetic neuropathy and  150 without diabetic neuropathy matched to the patients by age,  gender, and diabetes duration. These subjects were characterized  for Leu55Met  and Gln192Arg  PON1  polymorphisms employing  standard primers. Distribution of the PON1  genotypes did not differ  between diabetic neuropathy subjects and diabetic patients without  complication : Leu55Met  (chi squared=1.85, p>0.05) and Gln192Arg   (chi squared=1.24, p>0.05).

Spatial mapping of Down syndrome at small area  level in England and Wales,P875.,"Neasham , N. G. Best, T. Kold Jensen, J.

Corrected Down syndrome relative risk estimates  were then mapped across 9508 wards in England and Wales using  Bayesian disease mapping techniques.Results After correction for the effects of potential differential over estimation  of Down syndrome rates (resulting from inclusion of cases that  would normally have aborted spontaneously without detection) the  study found highest Down syndrome risk (compared to the reference  category) among mothers who were (i) most deprived and <=28  years of age and (ii) least deprived and >28 years of age. Bayesian  mapping analyses confirmed these findings and showed improved  model fit with the inclusion of an interaction term between Carstairs  quintile and maternal age compared to models without the interaction  term. Discussion To date no environmental or lifestyle related factor (apart from  maternal age) has been consistently associated with Down syndrome  and studies investigating spatial heterogeneity in Down syndrome  have tended to report negative findings. The present study detected  significant spatial variation of Down syndrome risk associated  predominantly with socioeconomic deprivation and maternal age.  This may point to factor(s) that act directly on the process of meiotic  non disjunction and/or via differential intrauterine survival of fetuses  with Down syndrome.

Polymorphic Alu insertions are interesting DNA markers for  population genetic investigations. The Alu family of SINEs is one of  the most successful mobile genetic elements and they account for  10% of the human genome. We have analyzed three Alu insertions: YaNBC182, YaNBC102,  YaNBC361 in 857 individuals from seven Turkic speaking Eurasian  populations: Tatars, Bashkirs, Cuban Nogays, Kara Nogays, Kumyks,  Karachais, Kazakhs, Uzbeks and Uygurs. These populations live  in the Northern Caucasus, Volga Ural region of Russia and Central  Asia. The frequencies of YaNBC182 varied from 0.463 in Uzbeks to 0.673  in Tatars; YaNBC102 Alu insertion from 0.416 in Cuban Nogays to  0.602 in Bashkirs; YaNBC361 from 0.388 in Kazakhs to 0.590 in  Karachays. Average heterozygosity for all loci ranged from 0.349  in Cuban Nogays to 0.479 in Uzbeks. 7 out of 21 tests for Hardy  Weinberg equilibrium showed a significant departure from equilibrium  (YaNBC182 in Tatars and Cuban Nogays, YaNBC102 in Cuban  Nogays, Kumyks, YaNBC361 in Cuban Nogays, Kara Nogays,  Kazakhs). The genetic diversity coefficient Fst was observed to be  high (from 0.88% to 1.14%). The populations of Central Asia demonstrated some homogeneity  for distributions of Alu insertion. Kazakhs showed similarities to  populations of Central Asia and significant differences from others.  Tatars differed from all analyzed populations except Cuban Nogays. A  possible explanation is the presence of mostly European components  in Tatars and mostly mongoloid components in the gene pool of  Kazakhs.

Why say no? Reasons for non participation in the  North Cumbria Community Genetics Project,P878.,"Haimes, M. Whong Barr","University of Newcastle, Newcastle, United Kingdom","The linkage of population based DNA samples with personal medical  information has gained much attention as a method of examining  the combined effect of genes, environment and lifestyle factors on  common multi factorial diseases. Such biobank collections raise  many issues, including: informed consent, confidentiality, and  governance. In light of these issues, a central question concerns the  public acceptability of biobanks. However, we know little about the  views of people who have been asked to donate to a population  based DNA collection. This paper explores the views of such people by using a local  biobank in the north west of England as a case study. The North  Cumbria Community Genetics Project (NCCGP) collects (i) blood  and tissue samples from the umbilical cord of newborn babies;  (ii) maternal blood samples, and (iii) information about health and  lifestyles. The NCCGP has enjoyed participation rates of over 80% (though  only 60% of those approached complete a health and lifestyle  questionnaire, as well as donating samples). This paper explores  reasons for refusal by using data from interviews with potential  donors (both participants and non participants), as well as  NCCGP team members and community groups who opposed the  establishment of the biobank. It asks to what extent non participation  is attributable to primarily local factors (such the NCCGPâs links to  British Nuclear Fuels) or to other, more widely held, ethical concerns  cited above. The paper will also examine the extent to which non  participation represents a distinct stance to that of participation. Our  research is funded by the Wellcome Trust.",2003

Variation in plasma  Lp(a) levels was inconsistently associated with variation in apoE.  Elevated concentrations of Lp(a) are risk factor for atherosclerotic  disease. Therefore, it is important to understand whether genes  other than apo(a) gene are involved in regulation of plasma Lp(a)  levels. The aim:  of this study was to investigate association, if  any, of apoE alleles and genotypes with plasma Lp(a) levels in  patients with ischemic heart disease (IHD) and healthy controls  in Serbian population. Methods:  Lp(a) values were measured by  imunonephelometry. ApoE genotypes were determinated by PCR and  restriction isotyping, with HhaI  endonuclease.

The levels of angiotensin I converting  enzyme (ACE) in brain influence cognitive processing acquisition  and recall of newly learned tasks in animal. The insertion/deletion  (I/D) polymorphism influence the variation of ACE level in plasma and  brain. In previous studies this polymorphism was associated with AD,  but the results were controversial maybe due to ethnic background.

Methods: The study sample consisted of 160 persons: 30 late  onset AD patients (85.50 Â± 5.47 years old), 30 healthy age matched  non AD controls ( 84.22 Â± 3.99 years old) and 100 healthy young  controls (33.8 Â± 8.9). The diagnosis of AD was made according to  the NINCDS ADRDA criteria. Genotyping for I/D was performed  by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using a modified three primer  method. Results: Frequencies for II, ID and DD ACE genotypes  in AD patients were 21.43 %, 57.14 %, 21.43 % respectively and  I/D allele frequencies were 0.5/0.5. No significant difference in  distribution of ACE genotypes between AD patients and healthy age  matched controls or young controls was found.

Alavantic;  âVincaâ Institute of Nuclear Sciences, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.   Introduction : The enzyme lipoprotein lipase (LPL) has a central  role in lipid metabolism. LPL hydrolyses triglyceride (TG) rich  core of circulating chylomicrons and very low density lipoproteins.  Asn291Ser substitution is located in the N terminal end and may  influence the catalytic activity of LPL. It was recently reported that this  polymorphism was associated with Alzheimer disease, increased risk  of pre eclampsia and ischemic heart disease. The aim : of this study  was to determine genotype and allele frequencies of Asn291Ser  polymorphism in 193 healthy and unrelated subjects from Serbia.  Relationship between this polymorphism and plasma lipid levels  was investigated in our healthy population as a base for future  studies on different groups of patients. Methods : Genomic DNA  was extracted from whole blood by proteinase K/phenol method.  LPL genetic variants were detected by ASA method combined  with semi nested PCR. Results : Frequencies of Asn291Ser and  Asn291Asn genotypes were 1% and 99%, respectively and Ser291/ Asn291 allele frequencies were 0.05/0.95. Variation of lipid levels  among individuals with different LPL genotype were not statistically  significant. We detected a trend of increase in triglyceride levels  and both, systolic and diastolic blood pressure in carriers of the  291Ser allele. Conclusions : Genotype and allele frequencies in our  population are consistent with other Caucasian populations. Data  from our study could be important for further research of pathological  states considering lipid metabolism.",2003
Mitochondrial DNA variability in Bosnians and  Slovenians,P887.,Malyarchuk,"Institute of Biological Problems of the North, Magadan, Russian  Federation","Mitochondrial DNA variability in two Slavonic speaking populations  of the northwestern Balkan peninsula   Bosnians (N = 144) and  Slovenians (N = 104), was studied by hypervariable segments I  and II (HVS I and II) sequencing and restriction fragment length  polymorphism (RFLP) analysis of the mtDNA coding region. The  majority of the mtDNA detected in South Slavonic populations falls into  the common West Eurasian mitochondrial haplogroups (e.g., H, pre V,  J, T, U, K, I, W, and X). About 2% of the Bosnian mtDNAs encompass  East Eurasian and African lineages (e.g., M and L1b, respectively).  The distribution of mtDNA subclusters in Bosnians, Slovenians and  the neighboring European populations reveals that the common  genetic substratum characteristic for Central and Eastern European  populations (such as Germans, Poles, Russians and Finns) penetrates  also South European territories as far as the Western Balkans.  However, the observed differentiation between Bosnian and Slovenian  mtDNAs suggests that at least two different migration waves of the  Slavs may have reached the Balkans in the early Middle Ages.",2003
The Microsatellite Polymorphism of Heme  Oxygenase 1 is Associated with the Inflammatory Level  but not with Restenosis after Coronary In Stenting.,P888.,"Li1, M. Elrayess1, A. Gomma2, J. Palmen1, E.

Humphries1","1Centre for Cardiovascular Genetics, BHF Laboratories, Royal Free &  University College London Medical School, London, United Kingdom,  2National Heart & Lung Institute and Royal Brompton Hospital,  Cardiac Medicine, London, United Kingdom","Background: Vascular  smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) can express   Heme oxygenase (HO), a rate limiting enzyme in the degradation  of heme to bilirubin, ferritin and carbon monoxide (CO). VSCM  derived CO can suppress VSMC proliferation and may serve as  an antiproliferation factor. The promoter region of HO 1 shows a  functional microsatellite polymorphism with different (GT)n repeats;  with shorter alleles associated with higher gene expression and protection from restenosis following in stent treatment in peripheral  arterial disease. The object of this study was to confirm the effect of  this variation on the occurrence of restenosis after in stent treatment  in patients with coronary artery diseases. Methods and Results: 187 patients who underwent successful  coronary stent implantation were studied. The genotype for HO 1  promoter microsatellite polymorphism was determined using PCR  and automated DNA capillary sequencing. Repeat length ranged from  22 42, with (GT)25 and (GT)32 being the two most common alleles.  The allelic repeats were divided into short class(S) with â¤29(GT)n,  the middle class(M) with 30~37 (GT)n and the long class(L) with â¥38  (GT)n according to their distribution and previous studies of promoter  activity. There was no difference in the prevalence of angiographic  restenosis between the genotype groups or between post operation  levels of inflammation markers; although carriers of the S allele  (n=120) had 33.3% lower baseline IL 6 compared with non S carriers  (n=67)(p=0.0008). Conclusion: Our results do not confirm an association between  the HO 1 promoter polymorphism and restenosis following in stent  treatment, however the association with plasma IL 6 levels suggests  that HO 1 S allele might protect from atherosclerotic inflammatory  processes.",2003
Tachyphylaxis to Î²2 agonists in asthmatic patients  is modulated by ADRB2 polymorphisms,P889.,"J. Telleria , J. A. Garrote, E. Arranz, I. Fernandez, M. J. Alonso, A.  Blanco","Universidad de Valladolid, Valladolid, Spain","Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate whether  genetic polymorphisms within ADRB2 gene modulate the outcome  of the individual response to Î²2 agonists and the development of  desensitization in patients with asthma. Methods: Sixty three asthmatic patients were included in the  study. Based on the clinical records, patients were classified into  two groups: patients with tachyphylaxis and good responders to  Î²2 agonists. DNA samples were genotyped for the Arg16Gly and  Glu27Gln alleles of the ADRB2 gene. Results: Arg16 allele was slightly more frequent within the group  with tachyphylaxis (p=0.05), whereas, Gly16 allele carriers were  overrepresented within the group of good responders (p=0.02). On  the other hand, the allelic frequency of Gln27 and the proportion  of Gln27 carriers was higher within the group with tachyphylaxis  (p=0.0015 and p=0.027 respectively) and Glu27 allele carriers were  overrepresented within the group of good responders (p=0.005). The  Arg16 and Gln27 alleles were in linkage disequilibrium. Conclusions: The predisposition to develop tachyphylaxis seems to  be linked to the Arg16 and Gln27 alleles, although the later isoform  plays the main role. The Arg 16 allele is perhaps overrepresented due  to the linkage disequilibrium between both polymorphisms. On the  other hand, the Glu27 allele seems to be a protector factor.",2003

Victorova1","1Institute of biochemistry and genetics, Ufa Scientific Centre, Ufa,  Russian Federation, 2Pulmonology Department, State Hospital No 13,  Ufa, Russian Federation","Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) is a major cause  of morbidity and mortality worldwide. COPD is characterised by a  slowly progressive irreversible airflow obstruction that is due to a  loss of lung elasticity resulting from parenchymal destruction and  peripheral airflow obstruction. The genes that contribute to the  genetic susceptibility to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease  (COPD) remain largely unknown. One possibility to account for a  susceptibility to the effects of environmental pollutants may be the genetic variations in the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes such  as microsomal epoxide hydrolase (mEPHX), cytochrome P450  1A1 (CYP1A1) and glutathione S transferase P1 (GSTP1) These  enzymes plays an important role in metabolising highly reactive  intermediates in the lung.

Allele combination of six genes associates with  atopic asthma developing in patients from Northern  Western Russia,P894.,"Sideleva1,2","1Zoological Institute RAS, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation, 2Ottâs  Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, St.Petersburg, Russian  Federation.  "," Asthma, as many diseases, results from the interaction between  adverse environmental events and constitutional (genetic) resistance  or susceptibility. As with other complex diseases, genes contributing  to asthma may be found either by examining candidate genes or  by genetic linkage. In our study we analysed mutations of CYP1A1  (cytochrome P4501A1), GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1 (glutathion S  transferases M1, T1, P1), NAT2 (N acetyltransferase 2), ACE  (angiotensin converting enzyme) and CFTR (Cystic fibrosis  transmembrane regulator) genes in asthmatic patients and control  individuals from Northern Western Russia. Our data suggests that  GSTM1 and GSTT1 null polymorphism and ânormalâ genotype  GSTP1 A/A are susceptibility factors to atopic asthma among the  Russian population. Furthermore, the importance of allele combination of different genes  was shown by our study to develop atopic asthma. Theoretically, 288  possible genotypes result in allele combination of six investigated  genes. We found 36 genotypes in the control group and 39  genotypes in the group of asthmatics. 21 allele combinations (or  38.9% of all found genotypes) were equal in both groups. The most  common genotype in asthmatic patients has significantly different  frequency from the general population: GSTM1 0/0, GSTT1 0/0,  GSTP1 A/A, ACE D/D, CYP1A1 N/N, CFTR N/N  11.0% vs. 1.3%,  subsequently (OR= 9.53, 95%CI: 2.972 25.128).

The  identification of these susceptibility genes has proved difficult  and progress has been slow. Using positional cloning, we have  identified the gene for protocadherin 1 ( PCDH1 ) as being genetically  associated with asthma and bronchial hyperresponsiveness (BHR;  a cardinal clinical feature of asthma) in a collection of 200 Dutch  asthma families. PCDH1  is located on 5q31 q33, a region that has  been genetically linked to asthma in several different populations.

SNPs in each of the 6  genes were identified by sequencing overlapping PCR fragments  from the exons, promoter, 1st intron and 3â end in a selection of 16  patients from these families. The 200 families (n=1200) were then  screened for the presence or absence of the identified SNPs by  allelic discrimination using TaqmanTM technology. Genetic association  between the individual SNPs, asthma and asthma subphenotypes  was examined using the allelic transmission disequilibrium test which  revealed that 2 SNPs in PCDH1  showed significant associations  (p<0.0005) with BHR. Northern blotting and RT PCR show that  PCDH1  is expressed in lung, as well as in human bronchial epithelial  cells and lung fibroblasts. PCDH1  has not previously been linked  with asthma either at the genetic or biological level. Replication of the  genetic association in other population samples will be necessary .

Baranov1;  1Institute of obstetrics & gynecology, St.Petersburg, Russian  Federation, 2Institute of Pulmonology, St.Petersburg, Russian  Federation.   Atopic bronchial asthma (ABA) is a complex polygenic disorder.  Asthma is characterized by airway inflammation, a critical  component of which is oxidative stress. Oxidative stress, with the  formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), is a key component  of inflammation. The polymorphisms of metabolic genes ( NAT2 ,  GSTM1 , GSTT1 , GSTP1 ) were studied by PCR RFLP in children with  ABA. Significantly higher levels of GSTM1 0/0 (79%) and GSTÐ¢1 0/0  (58%) have been found in ABA children. The frequency of âslowâ  alleles for NAT2  was higher in the patient group (79% versus 66%).  Polymorphism of the GSTP1  gene was not found to be associated  with asthma. Null allele homozygotes for both GST genes ( GST1  0/0  and GSTT1  0/0) occur in 49% of asthmatic patients, whereas these  genotypes comprise only 12% in the controls. The presence of both  GSTM1  and GSTT1  null alleles results in a 7 fold increase of asthma  disease risk (OR 7,15; 95% CI = 2,70 18,98). Moreover combinations  of functionally impaired genotypes of all three GSTs was rarely  encountered in the controls (8%), but it was rather common (35%)  in the patient group. 90% of ABA children with atopic dermatitis had  GSTM1 0/0 genotypes against 57% in the ABA children without this  complication. Genetic tests for GSTM1  and GSTT1  null homozygotes  (GSTM1 0/0; GSTT1 0/0) identification might be useful for identification  of persons at risk of ABA and thus might be of great practical value  for predictive medicine service.",2003

Based on a precise analysis of genomewide scans of  complex diseases, in particular the permanent increasing number  of genomewide scans in asthma with inconsistent chromosomal  findings, we decided not to focus on our four loci with best linkage  results, but to expand the sample size and genotype again the  same microsatellite markers. The total number of 201 identically  pheno  and genotyped families gives us the opportunity to define  sub phenotypes, which seems to be the most promising approach in  diseases with etiological heterogeneity like asthma. Both well known traits like IgE and new defined sub phenotypes of disease severity and etiology showed loci of at least suggestive  linkage (Lander and Kruglyak 1995). This might indicate that  our detailed splitting into subphenotypes allows not only to find  susceptibility loci for asthma, but also to discuss the phenotypic,  pathophysiological impact of the gene that lies underneath.",2003

The causative molecular pathways underlying CD  pathogenesis are poorly understood. To unravel novel aspects of the  specific etiological pathways in CD, expression cDNA microarrays  were used to determine global changes in expression of duodenum  biopsies of CD patients. RNA was extracted from duodenal biopsies of 15 CD patients  showing complete villous atrophy and from 7 normal control biopsies  and then hybridized on to cDNA microarrays containing 19,120  genes. We found 109 genes that show a significant change (p<0.001) in the  level and pattern of expression between CD and non CD patients.  Several of these genes control proliferation and differentiation  pathways of cells in the intestinal crypts, while others regulate the  structure of the villi, which may explain the occurrence of villous  atrophy. Interestingly, a prolyl endpopeptidase, which is related to  gluten metabolism, also shows a significant change in its level of  expression (p<0.005) when CD patients following a gluten free diet  (GFD) were compared to CD patients not on a GFD. Recently, a  bacterial homolog of this endogenous prolyl endopeptidase has been  proposed as treatment for these patients.

To exclude that our  results were due to extended linkage disequilibrium of the HLA locus  finemapping was performed between 6p21 (HLA) and 6q21. A total  of 41 markers on chromosome 6 were analysed, with an intermarker  distance <5 cM in the region of interest. The multipoint maximum lod  score (MMLS) increased from 2.50 to 2.95 and narrowed the linkage  region to a region of 12 cM. Finemapping showed that this region is  independent from HLA. This region contains 97 genes. Microarray  study showed differential expression of 8 genes from this region  when comparing CD patients to normal controls. Our results clearly demonstrate the presence of a second CD locus  on chromosome 6. Interestingly, this region is also implicated in  other autoimmune disease, such as diabetes mellitus type I and  rheumatoid arthritis, indicating the presence of a gene involved in  autoimmune processes.",2003

Wijmenga1","1University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Rijnstate  Ziekenhuis, Arnhem, The Netherlands","Coeliac disease (CD) is a gluten induced enteropathy with a  prevalence of about 1:200 in Western populations. Ingestion of  gluten results in the progressive transformation of the intestinal  mucosa from intra epithelial lymphocytosis to complete villous  atrophy. Major susceptibility genes are the HLA DQA and DQB loci on  chromosome 6p. Recently we identified an additional major risk locus  on chromosome 19. Together these loci contribute no more than 60%  of the total genetic risk, suggesting additional (minor) risk genes. One Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics258 259 of the first steps in tissue remodeling is the binding of gluten peptides  to HLA DQ2 and the subsequent activation of T helper cells leading  to the excretion of interferon gamma (IFNG). This results in tissue  damage and an enhanced immune response. Since not all individuals  carrying DQ2 develop CD we argued that genetic variations in the  IFNG gene could contribute to the disorder. We performed real  time  RT PCR on mucosal biopsies from CD patients and observed an  increase in IFNG expression correlating with a progression in tissue  damage. To determine the genetic contribution of the IFNG gene, a  linkage analysis in 82 affected sib pairs was performed but revealed  no evidence for linkage to this region. Also, TDT of an internal CA  repeat in the IFNG gene in 123 affected parent offspring trios, and  a case control study in 199 CD patients and controls showed no  association. We can conclude from our results that the IFNG gene  shows no linkage or association with CD, and that its upregulation is  merely a consequence of the disease process.",2003
Hereditary Hyperferritinaemia Cataract Syndrome  associated with carrier status for haemochromatosis,P905.,"L. Lachlan1, A. Ismail2, A. Mumford3, J.

(HHCS) Methods: All family members underwent slit lamp examination to  document presence of cataract or lens status. Cataract morphology  was documented where present. Biochemical and genetic tests were  performed. Results: During investigation of a 35 year old female with anaemia  an elevated serum ferritin was noted. Genetic analysis of the HFE  gene revealed her to be a carrier for haemochromatosis. (C282Y  mutation) but after consideration of the dominant family history of  early onset cataracts, a putative diagnosis of HHCS was made. This  was confirmed by the demonstration of a +32 C to G substitution  in the L ferritin gene (L ferritin Baltimore I). Two affected children  had not yet undergone cataract extraction and cataract morphology  was found to be pulverulent or sunflower configuration. Biochemical  testing demonstrated high ferritin levels only in affected individuals. Conclusions: Ferritin levels should be measured in all individuals  with early onset cataracts. An individual with a normal ferritin level  in a known family can be reassured that they will not develop early  onset cataracts. Confusion with haemochromatosis can be avoided  by testing for TIBC and transferrin saturation. The effect of co  inheritance of the C282Y allele with an L ferritin mutation is under  further investigation. P906  Frequency and spectrum of hemochromatosis  mutations in Tunisia   A. Zorai1, C. L.

IRCCS, Milan, Italy.   Hereditary Hemochromatosis (HH) is a disorder of the iron  metabolism inducing iron overload, which usually manifests during  the 3rd decade of life. The gene associated to the disease (HFE)  is located on the short arm of chromosome 6. The majority of the  patients affected with severe pathology are homozygous for the  C282Y mutation. A second (H63D) and a third rare mutation (S65D)  usually produce less severe symptoms in compound heterozygotes  with C282Y. The average allele frequencies of the two common  mutations are 4% (C282Y) and 18% (H63D) in north Europeans in  a decreasing gradient from northern to southern Europe. The allele  frequencies measured in Italy are 1.65% and 13.3% respectively. In northern Africa, only the H63D mutation was detected with  an allele frequency of 13.2% in a mixed Moroccan and Algerian  populations living in France. Similarly no C282Y mutations were found in Ethiopian, Algerian and Senegalese. The occurrence of the  C282Y and H63D mutations in Tunisia was unknown. We report the  screening of 194 chromosomes from 97 randomly collected cord  blood samples. The mutations were analyzed by PCR followed by  DNA sequencing. The mild H63D and the severe C282Y mutations  were found in 17.5% and 0.5% of alleles respectively. Risk for  homozygosity for the severe C282Y mutation is present in the  Tunisian population at a low theoretical incidence. However, due to  the relatively high rate of consanguinity in the country, liver pathology  due to HH cannot be discounted.",2003

Reverse hybridization assay for multiple mutations  associated with hereditary iron overload,P908.,"Oberkanins , A. Moritz, G. KriegshÃ¤user, F. Kury","ViennaLab Labordiagnostika GmbH, Vienna, Austria","Inherited iron overload is a heterogenous disorder, including  âclassicalâ autosomal recessive hereditary haemochromatosis (HH),  as well as juvenile and autosomal dominant forms of the disease. The  most prevalent variant among Caucasians is autosomal recessive  HH due to mutations in the HFE and transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2)  genes. More recently, mutations in the ferroportin (FPN1/SLC11A3/ IREG1) gene were found to be associated with autosomal dominant  iron overload. In most cases therapeutic phlebotomy provides an  effective and inexpensive lifelong treatment. DNA testing is now  routinely used to support the diagnosis in patients with abnormal iron  parameters, for the presymptomatic identification of individuals at  risk, and its potential for population screening programs is currently  under discussion. We have developed a reverse hybridization assay  (Haemochromatosis StripAssay) for the rapid and simultaneous  detection of 18 known mutations in the HFE (V53M, V59M, H63D,  H63H, S65C, Q127H, P160delC, E168Q, E168X, W169X, C282Y,  Q283P), TFR2 (E60X, M172K, Y250X, AVAQ594 597del) and  FPN1 (N144H, V162del) genes. The test is based on multiplex DNA  amplification and hybridization to a teststrip presenting a parallel  array of allele specific oligonucleotide probes for each mutation.  The entire procedure from blood sampling to the identification of  mutations requires less than 6 hours, and hybridization/detection Genetic Epidemiology and Population Genetics260 261 may be carried out manually or essentially automated using existing  instrumentation (e.g. TECAN profiBlot). The test is simple and  convenient, requires very small amounts of samples, and can easily  be modified to include additional mutations. (oberkanins@viennalab.co.at)",2003
Genetic analysis of genes involved in  mitochondrial iron homeostasis and Fe S clusters  biogenesis in Caenorhabditis elegans,P909.,"Gonzalez Cabo1, R. Vazquez Manrique1, H. A. Baylis2, F. Palau1","1Instituto de Biomedicina, CSIC, Valencia, Spain, 2Department of  Zoology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Friedreich ataxia and X linked sideroblastic anaemia and ataxia are  caused by mutations in FRDA  and ABC7  genes, respectively. In both  disorders iron is accumulated in the mitochondrial matrix of patientsâ   cells. Mutants of orthologue yeast genes, YFH1  and ATM1 , accumulate  iron in mitochondria. Recent data suggest that both yeast proteins,  Yfh1p and Atm1p, participate in the biogenesis of iron sulphur clusters  (ISCs). We are addressing the analysis of both iron homeostasis and  ISC metabolism in mitochondria by genetic studies in C. elegans.  The C. elegans  frataxin homologue gene, F59G1.7 ( frh 1) spans 730  bp within an operon of eight genes. It is constituted by three exons  and encodes a 136 amino acid protein. To elucidate the expression  pattern of the nematode  frataxin we generated transgenic lines by  injecting different frh 1/gfp gene constructs differing in the size of the  5â fragments of genomic DNA. frh 1 is expressed in specific head  neurons, muscles, pharynx and intestine. Transient knock down  experiments by RNAi produce a specific phenotype in worms of the F1  generation. The worms are: thin and short, egl (egg laying defective),  have slow and arrhythmic pharynx pumping, and a decrease in the  rhythm of defecation. We have also demonstrated that Y74C10AM.1 is  the nematode orthologue of ABC7  and ATM 1  genes. The gene spans  13.4 kb and has 8 exons encoding a protein of 703 amino acids. This  gene belongs to a two gene operon on chromosome I. Preliminary  analysis suggests expression in pharynx. RNAi experiments show slow  growth and high reduction of the defection rhythm.",2003

The CRMGEN project,  funded by the European Commissionâs Measurement and Testing  program (Contract G6RD CT 2001 00581), aims to develop the  methodology to produce CRMs for any given molecular genetic test. The usual formats for positive controls for genetic testing, cell lines or  genomic DNA, are expensive to produce and will not be suitable for  all applications (e.g. multiplex tests). We are therefore investigating  whether PCR products can be used for this purpose. Using long range PCR, prototype RMs were developed for the  common mutations involved in hereditary haemochromatosis (H63D  & C282Y). The first round of prototype RMs have been tested by  project partners. Based on feedback from this first trial, the RMs were  re optimised and a second round of prototype RMs produced for  testing. Using similar methodology, prototype RMs have been developed for  three beta globin mutations, IVS1 nt110 (G>A), codon 39 (C>T), and  the sickle cell mutation HbS codon 6 (A>T).

From a population based  cohort of 7893 people aged 55 years and over, we genotyped 2260  randomly selected subjects for the HFE mutations. We compared the  frequencies of joint pain, chondrocalcinosis at X ray, and clinically  verified Heberdenâs nodes in carriers with non carriers of the HFE  H63D and C282Y mutations adjusting for age and gender using  regression analyses. Overall, the frequency of joint pain at hands was 2.1 times (95%CI  1.0 4.3; P=0.05) increased and pain at multiple joints (polyarticular)  was 1.6 (1.0 2.6; P=0.05) times increased in H63D homzygotes.

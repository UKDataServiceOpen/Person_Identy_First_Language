 How next generation sequencing changes the practice of medicine,PL1.1,H. Brunner,"Deptartment of Human Genetics, Radbound University Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Now that massively parallel (or next generation; NGS) sequencing has  become a reality, it is time to ask the question whether this technology will change the way we practice medicine in the clinic. While true costs that include personnel, bioinformatics support and equipment will be considerably higher, we may expect that the costs for sequencing 50  150 genes should not exceed 1000 Euro. This will allow the creation of diagnostic panels of for many clinical situations (muscular dystrophy; neurodegenerative disorders; blindness, deafness, cardiomyopathy; long QT syndrome; Noonan and related conditions etc). This will largely replace the testing of single genes, or of several genes in succession as is now customary. The projected cost of consumables for sequencing all 21000 human genes (the exome) using the SOLID platform is 2000 Euros. This could be used to test for instance to detect de novo changes in mental retardation patients. We may predict the  following:â¢ Diagnostic testing of genes will move to the front end of the diagnostic process in many clinical situations. When a patient is seen in the outpatient clinic, an exome may already be done.â¢ Clinical geneticists should themselves aim to be involved in the diagnostic process from the start. This argues for multidisciplinary diagnostic clinicsâ¢ Clinical diagnostic skills (in dysmorphology, or other) will become less important and understanding genes and their functions in terms of the human organism becomes a critical skill.â¢ Numerous patients will be diagnosed with unique (new) genetic conditions. This calls for geneticists to participate and perhaps organize specialist clinics for (very) rare diseases. Geneticists should  develop skills that allow them to feel comfortable in their role as the ultimate expert on a subset of these very rare conditions.â¢ Clinical geneticists should consider setting up services for the public that deal with incidental and minor findings on exome analysis. This may well be in the shape of e consults rather than of formal outpatient clinics.â¢ The counseling element of clinical genetics (what am I to do with my life given my genetic profile and risks) remains essentially unchanged.",2011

However, systematic data regarding late onset disorders are lacking.A cohort (N,41) of unselected carriers, that were detected prenatally in the period 1970 2008, was identified in the Danish Cytogenetic Central Register. Using information from national medical registries, we compared morbidity in the cohort to that of a 5:1 matched control group (N,205). Carriers were offered clinical re examination, analysis  with Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Array, and breakpoint mapping with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) Mate pair Analysis.We observed no serious congenital malformations in the cohort. However, the risk of neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders, including mental retardation, learning disabilities, attention and/or behavioral disorders, autism spectrum disorders, and mood disorders, was significantly elevated (19.5% vs. 8.3% among the controls, p,0.04). Analysis for copy number variants >100 kb did not provide prognostic information about late onset disorders. So far Mate  pair sequencing indicate that many affected carriers have complex rearrangements and/or rearrangements that truncate brain expressed genes, including genes known to be involved in neurodevelopmental disorders.Our study demonstrated that prenatally detected de novo  balanced chromosomal rearrangements have high risk of late onset neurodevelopmental and/or psychiatric disorders but are not associated with congenital malformations. The breakpoint mapping, which will be completed in March 2011, will reveal whether NGS can improve the counseling dilemma associated with prenatally detected apparently balanced de novo  chromosomal rearrangements.",2011
 Development and validation of non invasive prenatal diagnostic test for trisomy 21,PL2.2,"E. A. Papageorgiou1, A. Karagrigoriou2, E. Tsaliki1, V. Velissariou3, N. P. Carter4,  P. C.

Extensive investigation of epigenetic differences between the mother and the fetus has led to the identification of Differentially Methylated Regions  (DMRs) which have the potential to be used in the development of NIPD test for Trisomy 21 (Papageorgiou et al., AJP, 2009).In this study, we have been using a subset of our previously identified DMRs to develop a non invasive prenatal diagnostic test for Trisomy 21 using the Methylated DNA Immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) methodology in combination with Real time qPCR. The statistical significance of the 12 selected DMRs was evaluated using the Mann Witney U test and selection of the best DMRs was followed.We hereby present a strategy to achieve non invasive fetal  chromosome dosage assessment through the analysis of fetal specific DMRs. We achieved non invasive prenatal detection of Trisomy 21 by determining the methylation ratio of normal and Trisomy 21 cases for each tested fetal specific DMR present in maternal peripheral blood, followed by further statistical analysis. The application of the above fetal specific methylation ratio approach provided with 100% accuracy the correct diagnosis of 66 normal and 34 Trisomy 21 pregnancies.We present in this study the successful development and validation of a low cost, fast, sensitive and universal, non invasive prenatal diagnostic test for Trisomy 21 which can be potentially implemented in diagnostic laboratories.",2011

It  is likely that the majority of the phenotypes are related to alterations of gene expression. In this study, we investigated the perturbations of gene expression in fibroblasts derived from a pair of monozygotic twins discordant for T21. The use of these samples eliminates the bias  of genome variability and most of transcriptome differences observed are likely to be related to the supernumerary chromosome 21.The transcriptome was studied by mRNA Seq; more than 200 million 100bp paired end reads were generated and mapped using MAQ and GEM (Ribeca et al, unpublished). The expression level of 15â000 protein coding genes was compared between the discordant twins. On average, we found that 4% of the genes are differentially expressed. Surprisingly, for most of the chromosomes, we identified large chromosomal regions that are either up  or downregulated in the  trisomic twin. This raised the hypothesis that differential expression may be organized in domains throughout the genome. The same domains of gene expression dysregulation have also been found when we compared the transcriptomes of induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells derived from the same twins fibroblasts, indicating that iPS cells retain a specific memory of their origin. Control comparisons of fibroblasts between normal monozygotic twins showed some transcriptional differences likely due to the contribution of stochastic, technical and environmental factors.Our study reveals a unique finding in genome regulation of T21 nuclei and may be important for the molecular pathogenesis of whole and partial chromosome aneuploidies.",2011

X linked intellectual disability (XLID) is a clinically and genetically  heterogeneous condition. It accounts for 10% of all forms of intellectual disability. To date, mutations in >90 genes have been implicated in this disorder, yet in the majority of families, the underlying molecular cause is still unknown. We performed Next Generation Sequencing (NGS)  for mutation detection in >240 XLID families that had been recruited by the European MRX Consortium and associated groups. In total, we detected potentially XLID causing mutations in up to 45% of our cohort. Only 28% of the families carried mutations in the >90 established XLID genes, which may be due to the fact that prior to NGS, many of the families had undergone pre screening for mutations in known XLID genes. Unique truncating and/or novel perfectly co segregating, functionally plausible missense mutations with high pathogenicity scores were detected in 20 genes that had not been implicated in XLID  before. Numerous of these novel genes play a role in the regulation of transcription, while others are involved in ubiquitin mediated protein degradation or in synaptic function, and many interact with ID genes that are already known. To our knowledge, this is the largest study ever into the molecular causes of XLID and the first one employing NGS to elucidate monogenic disorders in a systematic manner. It illustrates that in spite of a previous, Sanger sequencing based âdrain the pondâ screening effort (Tarpey et al, Nature Genetics, 2009), the pond of unknown XLID genes is not empty yet.Supported by BMBF, Max Planck Society, EU.",2011

Congenital Short Bowel Syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by substantial shortening of the small intestine and by intestinal malrotation. Until recently, nothing was known about the genetic cause. Homozygosity mapping was performed using 610K SNP arrays of Illumina on five patients of four different families,  including one consanguineous family with two affected siblings and one unaffected child. We found an overlapping homozygous region in four of the five patients. In this region a homozygous deletion concerning one exon of a gene encoding a tight junction protein, was detected in one of the patients. Furthermore, a homozygous deletion in the first intron was detected in the affected siblings of the consanguineous family, this deletion co segregates with the disease phenotype in this family. Sequencing of the gene in three other patients resulted in the identification of additional mutations:  one patient proved to have a heterozygous frameshift mutation and a heterozygous splice site mutation, whereas two other patients were Plenary Lectures 7 homozygous for a nonsense mutation and a missense mutation,  respectively. The gene is expressed in the intestine of human embryos throughout development. The missense mutation abrogated the normal localization of the encoded protein at the cell membrane. Knock down experiments in zebrafish resulted in general developmental defects,  including shortening of the intestine and absence of goblet cells, which are characteristic for the mid intestine. Therefore, loss of function of the identified gene leads to Congenital Short Bowel Syndrome, likely by interfering with tight junction formation, with intestinal development and with gut length determination.",2011

Kevin  Park, Liverpool, United Kingdom. Carbamazepine (CBZ) is the most commonly prescribed anti epileptic  drug. However its use can cause various forms of subcutaneous adverse reactions ranging from maculopapular exanthema (MPE) to Stevens Johnson syndrome (SJS), a life threatening skin reaction. A strong correlation has been demonstrated between CBZ induced  SJS and HLA B*1502  in Asian populations however as HLA B*1502  is largely absent in European populations, the test is not applicable in Europeans.We investigated whether genetic variants, particularly within the HLA locus, play a role in susceptibility to CBZ induced adverse reactions. We performed a genome wide association study of 22 participants with CBZ induced hypersensitivity syndrome (HSS), 43 participants with CBZ induced MPE and 3958 population controls, all of European descent. We replicated the study with an independent set of participants  (n,145) with CBZ induced MPE and SJS.HLA A*3101 strongly associated with both HSS (3.5x10 8) and MPE (1.1x10 6) in two independent association studies. Follow up genotyping of HLA A*3101 in additional cases and controls confirmed HLA A*3101 as a risk factor for HSS (OR 12.4; 95% CI 1.3 to 120.4), MPE (OR 8.3; 95% CI 3.6 to 19.4), and SJS (OR 25.9; 95% CI 4.9 to 116.2).We report for the first time in participants of European ancestry, a strong association between HLA A*3101 and CBZ induced hypersensitivity. This finding has immediate clinical relevance in the care of epilepsy patients. The presence of HLA A*3101 increases the probability of developing hypersensitivity from 5% to 26%, while its absence reduces the risk to 3.8%. This work provides the foundation for genetic testing  of HLA A*3101 for all prospective CBZ users.",2011
 t he personal genomes of individuals with extreme phenotypes: c ardiac repolarization & sudden cardiac death,PL3.1,A. Chakravarti,"McKusick   Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University  School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States","Although the genome (actually, two genomes) of specific individuals  are now being sequenced there is great uncertainty regarding what phenotypic predictions we can make from the sequence itself. Accurate phenotypic predictions may be impossible unless we are more educated about the genetic architecture of human disease  and the contributions of epigenetic and environmental effects. One exception to this expectation is perhaps phenotypic prediction in individuals with a rare susceptibility allele or an excess of common susceptibility variants.Sudden cardiac death, arising from dysregulated cardiac repolarization, is a hallmark of the long QT syndrome and extreme elevations of the QT interval. A variety of human genetic studies by many investigators, including us, have identified over 30 genes contributing to inter individual variation in the QT interval. We will summarize the current  genetic and genomic knowledge in this area, and the study of families and population cohorts, to evaluate whether phenotypic prediction of sudden cardiac death is possible at least for a defined segment of the population.",2011

McCarthy1,2","1Oxford Centre for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Metabolism (OCDEM),  Churchill Hospital, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2Wellcome Trust Centre for Human  Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom","Until recently, progress in identification of the genetic variants influencing predisposition to common forms of diabetes and obesity has been slow. However, advances have transformed the situation, with researchers now able to undertake well powered surveys of genetic variation across the genome. For T2D, genome wide association studies have extended the number of loci harbouring common variants implicated in diabetes susceptibility beyond 40. Most of these seem to impact on beta cell function and there is evidence that cell cycle regulation pathways are overrepresented. However, even in combination, these variants account for only around 10% of the genetic predisposition to T2D.Genetic diagnostics plays an increasingly important role in the diagnosis of relatively rare monogenic forms of diabetes and obesity and provides a molecular basis for accurate prognostication and  therapeutic optimisation. In contrast, the modest effect of the common variants thus far implicated in common forms of diabetes and obesity has precluded similar clinical applications. Indeed, the principal translational justification for genetic discovery efforts lies in explaining the mysteries of disease pathogenesis: there have been numerous advances in this respect, though much more remains to be done.The large proportion of heritability and familiality not explained by the GWA approach (which has surveyed only common SNP based variation) raises questions about the basis of the âmissingâ genetic variance. The contribution to disease risk of low frequency and rare variants is being enumerated through large scale next generation sequencing studies. Discovery of low frequency penetrant alleles influencing T2D risk (and/or risk of obesity and other metabolic and  cardiovascular traits) will not only provide important insights into disease pathogenesis, but also powerful reagents to support functional and physiological studies.8 Plenary Lectures 8",2011

 c ontrolling gene expression by the regulation of chromatin compaction in the nucleus,S01.1,W. Bickmore,"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","It is widely appreciated that histone modifications correlate to gene  expression states and can, in some cases, directly impact on gene expression and repression. But, our understanding of chromatin states beyond the level of the nucleosome itself is rudimentary and so there has been little exploration of how these levels of chromatin structure  might contribute to the regulation of gene expression.Important and well studied regulators of gene expression during development are the polycomb repressive complexes (PRCs). These complexes have also been implicated in human cancers and their histone modifying activities have been studied extensively. However, we show that polycomb repressive complexes act at the level of chromatin compaction in the nucleus and we go on to demonstrate that the ability of the PRC1 complex to compact chromatin, and to repress gene expression is not dependent on its histone ubiquitination activity.",2011

The results of these studies support the chromosome territory  interchromatin compartment (CT IC) model of nuclear architecture (5): CTs are built up from a network of interconnected chromatin domains with a DNA content in the order of 1 Mb (~1Mb CDs) . Their structure has not yet been resolved, but we argue that these domains are built up from a series of more or less compacted chromatin loop domains with a DNA content in the order of 100 kb (~100 kb CDs). Moreover, several ~1Mb CDs may form larger chromatin clusters. The IC forms a 3D network of channels and larger, DNA free IC lacunas (width > 400 nm). It starts at the nuclear pores and pervades the nuclear interior  expanding both between CTs and within CTs. Accordingly, CTs may be compared with sponges built up from 3D interconnected chromatin domains and the pervading IC channels. A layer of decondensed chromatin, termed the perichromatin region (PR), covers the more compact interior of ~1 Mb CDs and constitutes the nuclear compartment for transcription and DNA replication (1, 3).(1) Markaki, Y., et al.

Several pluripotent stem cell types have been derived from the first part. Embryonic stem (ES) cells, derived from preimplantation embryos, comprise at least two  populations of cells with divergent states of pluripotency. In addition, epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), derived from postimplantantion embryos, also do not comprise a uniform cellular population, as weâve shown the presence of at least two EpiSC types: one resembling epiblast tissue of early and the other of late pregastrulation embryos.A current aim in cell and developmental biology is to program cells at will. The first step in converting a given cell into another cell is through achievement of a pluripotent stem cell state that resembles that of ES cells. To date, somatic cells need to be pushed to a pluripotent  state by the introduction of exogenous factors, mostly transcription factors. Reprogramming of mouse and human somatic cells into pluripotent stem cells, designated as induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, was first described in 2006 using fibroblasts as the somatic cell source and initially requiring introduction of the virally expressed transcription factor quartet of Oct4, Sox2, c Myc, and Klf4. As we have recently shown, induced EpiSCs (iEpiSCs) can be obtained by directly reprogramming somatic cells with the quartet under EpiSC culture conditions. We previously reported that Oct4 alone is sufficient  to directly reprogram adult mouse and human fetal neural stem cells (NSCs) into iPS cells, thus highlighting the crucial role played by Oct4 in the process of reprogramming.In contrast to the recent reprogramming of somatic cells, induction of  pluripotency in primordial germ cells (PGCs) was accomplished 20 years ago by the mere modulation of the culture conditions. Recently, we converted adult germline stem cells (GSCs) into germline derived pluripotent stem (gPS) cells. GSCs are unipotent cells of the testis that are capable of not only self renewing, but also giving rise to sperm. Like ES cells, GSCs exhibit significant levels of Oct4 and Klf4, but low endogenous expression Sox2 and c Myc. To better understand the reprogramming process, we sought to identify factors that mediate reprogramming at higher efficiency. We established an assay based on Oct4 reactivation to screen nuclear fractions from extracts of  pluripotent cells. BAF chromatin remodeling complexes containing the Brg1 protein have been shown to be not only essential for early  embryonic development, but also, as we have previously shown, paramount in enhancing the efficiency of reprogramming somatic cells to pluripotency mediated by the quartett. As knockdown of Brg1 leads to differentiation of ES cells, we investigated the early effect of Brg1 knockdown by assessing the impact of RNA interference on the expression levels of key pluripotency factors. We show that Brg1 10 Concurrent Symposia 10 knockdown leads to an immediate alteration in Oct4, Sox2, and Nanog   expression. More specifically, Sox2 expression is downregulated,  while Nanog  expression is upregulated. Oct4 expression is  immediately upregulated, perhaps triggering ES cell differentiation.  Our data suggest that Brg1 plays an important role in regulating Oct4  expression, which is instrumental in maintaining cells in a pluripotent state.",2011

 Joubert s yndrome: impaired cilia and s hh dependent cerebellar development,S04.1,N. Spassky,Inst,"Nat. de la SantÃ© et de la Recherche MÃ©d. U1024, Inst. de Biol. de lâEcole Norm. Sup. (IBENS), Paris, France. Joubert Syndrome (JS) is a multisystemic disorder characterized by a  complex cerebellum/brainstem malformation where the most striking feature is a severe cerebellar vermis defect ranging from hypoplasia to complete aplasia. JS belong to a group of rare genetically heterogeneous diseases recently reclassified as ciliopathies, where  causative genes encode ciliary or basal body proteins and the function and/or the structure of cilia, sensory organelles, are abnormal. One of the most intriguing JS genes is CEP290 as it has the widest phenotypic spectrum ranging from isolated blindness to in utero lethal Meckel GrÃ¼ber syndrome and mutations of this gene are responsible for 50% of JS with renal and ocular involvement (CORS). It is totally unknown how CEP290 and ciliary loss of function impair human cerebellar growth giving rise to the drastic vermis malformation characteristic of JS. Here we show that Shh dependent growth of human cerebellum,  supported by the granule cells progenitors (CGP) proliferation, starts around 15 gw, that GCP possess a primary cilium and that CEP290 is localized at its base. We find that GCP proliferation and response to SHH is severely impaired in JS cases bearing mutations in genes including CEP290 or MKS3, as well as in a Jeune syndrome ciliopathy case and a Thanatophoric dysplasia case, a putative ciliopathy. Finally, we show that in JS cases, GCP proliferation and response to SHH are impaired not only in the vermis but also, and to the same extent, in the hemispheres. These results add a feature to the already described JS defects and rule out impaired GCP expansion as the origin of vermis hypo/aplasia. Our results show that Shh dependent GCP proliferation and consecutive cerebellar growth starts around 15 gw in the human cerebellum and is impaired in JS whole cerebellum. They also suggest  that this could be a common feature to several ciliopathies.",2011
 c iliary control of feeding behavior and body weight,S04.2,"N. F. Berbari, R. C. Pasek, E. B. Malarkey, R. A. Kesterson, T. R. Nagy, B. K.  Yoder","University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL, United States","Primary cilia have essential functions in regulating signaling pathways  during mammalian development. In adults, cilia are also important as evidenced by the spectrum of phenotypes observed in mouse models and human patients with ciliary defects (ciliopathies); however, their roles in tissue physiology are poorly understood and the mechanisms  underlying most ciliopathies remain enigmatic. We are addressing this issue using conditional tissue specific cilia mouse mutants and show that disruption of cilia in the hypothalamus results in hyperphagia and obesity. A similar obesity phenotype was reported in mouse models of Bardet Biedl Syndrome (BBS). BBS mutants have defects in receptor transport into the cilium and are thought to be unable to sense the anorexigenic peptide leptin. Here we assess the leptin signaling axis in cilia mutants and demonstrate they are sensitive to leptin prior to becoming obese, are leptin insensitive when obese, and then regain  leptin sensitivity after caloric restriction to bring mutants back to wild type body weight. Thus leptin resistance is a secondary consequence of the obesity and not causal indicating that pathways other than the leptin melanocortin axis are involved. Data indicate that one of these pathways could be the melanin concentrating hormone (MCH) axis. Previous data indicate that MCH receptor localizes in the cilium of control but not of BBS mutants. Further, we show that MCH binds MCHR1 in the cilium and that in the absence of the cilium, the MCH signaling pathway is altered. Pharmacological and genetic studies are being conducted to assess whether defects in MCH signaling are directly associated with the obesity phenotype in cilia mutants. This work will provide novel insights into how dysfunction of the cilium contributes to the onset of obesity and more generally the importance  of the cilium in regulating normal neuronal activity and energy balance.Concurrent Symposia 11",2011
 Joubert syndrome,S04.3,J. Gleeson,"Howard Hughes Medical Institute, University of California, San Diego, CA, United States","Joubert syndrome is characterized by congenital ataxia, oculomotor  apraxia and metal retardation and the pathognomonic Molar Tooth Sign on brain MRI (MTI). Joubert syndrome and related disorders (JSRD) refers to a multiorgan class of conditions displaying the MTI as well as frequent retinal blindness, nephronophthisis, hepatic fibrosis  and polydactytly. JS and more broadly JSRD are caused by mutations in at least 10 different genes that are unified by the finding that the encoded proteins localize at or near the cellular primary cilium. Up until recently, neurons were not generally regarded to have primary cilia, but with better cilia visualization tools we now know that the most or all neurons in the developing and adult brain display primary cilia. Furthermore, mutations in these genes frequently result in altered structure of the primary cilium. Two competing models have emerged to explain the genotype phenotype correlations: 1] These genes  determine the structure of the primary cilium, alterations of which result in disease. 2] These genes modulate the efficiency of signaling of the many pathways linked to the primary cilium including Platelet derived growth factor, Sonic hedgehog and Wnt signaling.The genes mutated in Joubert syndrome suggest that altered structure and/or function of the primary cilium underlie this complex phenotype, but many important questions remain: 1] What can the genes identified to date tell us about the basis of this class of disease? 2] What type of genetic modifiers can explain the widely variable expressivity in this disease? 3] What types of treatment options will emerge from the molecular characterization of this disease?",2011

Odom1,2",1Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Inst,", Li Ka Shing Centre,  Regulatory Systems Biology Lab., Cambridge, United Kingdom, 2University of  Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom. My laboratory investigates the complex relationships among tissue  specific transcription, genetic sequence, and evolution using high throughput methodologies. We have demonstrated the remarkable divergence in tissue specific transcriptional regulation that has occurred among mammals. We found that a set of liver specific  transcription factors whose function, amino acid sequence, and targeted binding motif are highly conserved throughout mammals changes both their potentially targeted genes and also their precise binding locations globally. An outstanding mechanistic question arose from the discovery of the rapid divergence of transcription factor binding: what directs these transcription factor binding changes? Is it genetic sequence, epigenetic state, organismal development, or some combination of these?We showed that an aneuploid mouse line carrying a human chromosome  could isolate genetic sequence as an independent variable in directing transcriptional regulation. Remarkably, mouse encoded transcription factors bound the human chromosome in mouse liver almost precisely as do human genome encoded transcription factors in human liver. We found that the mouse nucleus could also accurately re create the epigenetic landscape and even mRNA regulation across the entirely of this human chromosome. Thus, it is almost entirely genetic sequence variation that is responsible for interspecies differences in transcriptional regulation.I will be discussing other current projects, including the evolution and conservation of CTCF binding events across multiple mammalian orders, and the manner that RNA polymerase III maintains its conserved transcriptome in the face of rapid remodeling of its transcribed tRNAs.",2011

We have initiated strategies to target macrophages with siRNA to suppress expression of genes that promote adipose dysfunction and metabolic disease. We have silenced TNF Î± as well as other genes that promote inflammation using siRNA encapsulated within hollow shells of Î², 1 3 D glucan prepared from yeast cell walls (denoted GeRPs, for Glucan encapsulated RNAi particles). Both oral and intraperitoneal administration routes have been tested in mice with GeRPs loaded with siRNA anchored between  cationic (polyethyleneimine) and anionic (tRNA and siRNA) layers that also contain an amphipathic peptide. We have now developed simplified versions of these formulations with fewer components in order to enhance reproducibility of manufacture, promote siRNA release from GeRPs after phagocytosis and increase gene silencing potency.

 Roles of c hromatin ubiquitylation in DNA Double s trand Break Repair and t umor s uppression,S07.3,R. A. Greenberg,"School of Medicine, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States","Germline mutations to the Breast Cancer Early Onset 1 gene (BRCA1)  confer a strong predisposition to breast and ovarian epithelial cancers. BRCA1 maintains genomic integrity by activating cell cycle checkpoints and error free mechanisms of DNA double strand break (DSB) repair. Cancer causing mutations disrupt these activities  primarily by impairing BRCA1 recognition and retention at DSBs. We have discovered that BRCA1 is targeted to DSBs via an interaction with the ubiquitin interacting protein, RAP80 (Sobhian et al. Science   2007). RAP80 provides a DNA damage recognition element by specifically binding lysine 63 linked ubiquitinated (K63 Ub) structures on  chromatin adjacent to DSBs for a complex consisting of BRCA1 and  several other proteins (Shao et al. Genes & Development  2009; Shao  et al. PNAS 2009). These results imply that ubiquitin recognition is required for genome integrity and suppression of malignancy. Related  to this hypothesis, new insights into the roles of this complex in DNA repair and tumor suppression will be presented. Recent findings from my laboratory have revealed that DSB associated ubiquitin also enables communication between DNA damage responses and transcriptional processes that occur on chromatin in cis to the site of damage (Shanbhag et al.

Several surveillance mechanisms have evolved which prevent the accumulation of non functional mitochondria and ensure cellular integrity. Whereas irreversibly damaged mitochondria can be selectively removed by  autophagy, various intraorganellar proteases degrade non native mitochondrial proteins and limit mitochondrial damage. These include hexameric m AAA proteases, ATP dependent proteases in the inner membrane of mitochondria, mutations of which are associated with hereditary spastic paraplegia and spinocerebellar ataxia (SCA28). m AAA proteases are part of large supercomplexes with prohibitin scaffolds in the inner membrane. Recent experiments link the function of this protein complex to mitochondrial fusion and the processing of the dynamin like GTPase OPA1, which is emerging as a central  mechanism to monitor mitochondrial integrity. A dysfunction of mitochondria as well as the loss of prohibitins or m AAA proteases induces the proteolytic breakdown of OPA1 isoforms by the OMA1 peptidase triggering mitochondrial fragmentation. Recent experiments on the role of this mitochondrial quality control mechanism for neuronal survival will be discussed.",2011
 i nsights into human neurodegenerative disease from Drosophila genetics,S08.2,N. Bonini,"306 Leidy Laboratories, Department of Biology, University of Pennsylvania,  Philadelphia, PA, United States","The causes of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are poorly  understood, although TDP 43 has been suggested to play a critical role. We found that ataxin 2, a polyglutamine (polyQ) protein mutated in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (SCA2), is a potent modifier of TDP 43 toxicity in yeast and Drosophila (Elden et al., 2010). Moreover,  the proteins physically associate in an RNA dependent manner, and ataxin 2 is abnormally localized in spinal cord neurons of ALS patients. Given these findings, we assessed the role of mutations in the gene encoding ataxin 2 (ATXN2) in ALS. Ataxin 2 bears a polyQ repeat which is normally 22 or 23 Qs, but becomes expanded to â¥34Qs in SCA2. We therefore considered that polyQ expansions greater than normal, but below the threshold for SCA2, may be associated with ALS. Analysis of 915 ALS patients revealed that intermediate length polyQ expansions (27 33 Qs) in the ATXN2 gene are significantly associated with ALS  (4.7% of ALS cases vs 1.4% in controls).The ATXN2 gene presents additional interesting features because  the polyQ expansions associated with SCA2 are typically pure CAG repeats. However, similar expansions that are interrupted with other codons in analysis to date present atypically with parkinsonism. Given the association of ATXN2 with ALS, we determined the sequence of  the ATXN2 expansions in our ALS patients (Yu et al., 2011). These  data indicate that expanded  alleles associated with increased risk for  ALS all bear at least one CAA interruption. These data suggest that the nature of the repeat sequence, as well as the length of the polyQ expansion, may play a role in neurological effects conferred by polyQ repeat expansions in the ATXN2 gene.

Currently there are no  treatments available that modify disease progression. However, novel Concurrent Symposia 13 therapeutic agents specifically targeting HD pathology are now on the  horizon.As Huntingtonâs disease has a 100% sensitive and specific genetic test, it allows us to study at risk subjects who carry the HD gene many years before symptom onset.

Somatic mutations in these same genes have been described in various human cancers.We have developed methods to quantify several of these mutations in human sperm and have also identified FGFR3 and HRAS mutations in spermatocytic seminoma, a rare type of testicular tumour. The combined evidence suggests that these mutations, although occurring rarely, provide a selective growth advantage to the mutant spermatogonial cell, resulting in clonal expansion over time, accounting for the PAE. To date, all examples of these âselfishâ spermatogonial mutations  locate within a single signalling pathway, the growth factor receptor RAS pathway, which is a key determinant of spermatogonial stem cell proliferation and renewal. Our recent immunohistochemical analysis of normal testes shows features consistent with the occurrence of mutational microclones; a variety of patterns of antigen positivity are observed, consistent with different underlying driver mutations.Regulation of cell turnover is important in many disease contexts, for example neurogenesis and neoplasia, so the consequences of mutations that hijack this process within the testis are potentially far reaching. Depending on the spectrum of average PAE mutations levels, they may contribute significantly to the âdark matterâ in human heritability, currently speculated to be explained by uncommon alleles of moderate effect.

 DNA damage and its implications for the aging epigenome,S09.3,P. Oberdoerffer,"Mouse Cancer Genetics Program, Epigenetics of DNA Repair and Aging Section, NCI Frederick, Frederick, MD, United States","Changes in chromatin structure are a conserved hallmark of aging  and age related diseases. The mechanisms driving these changes as well as their functional significance are heavily investigated. Over the past few years, it has become evident that DNA damage is a major contributor to a wide range of direct (genomic) and indirect (epigenomic)  changes observed in aged nuclei, placing it at the crossroads of age associated nuclear defects and functional decline. Recently, we were able to show that DNA damage associated epigenomic changes can be caused by the redistribution of the chromatin modifier SIRT1 from promoters and repetitive DNA to sites of DNA breaks, resulting in gene expression changes at ostensibly undamaged genomic loci. This SIRT1 associated gene deregulation correlated with a significant, albeit small fraction of age related epigenetic changes. Preliminary data from our lab now implicate numerous other chromatin modifiers  in DNA double strand break (DSB) repair, suggesting a more general role for DNA damage induced epigenomic reorganization in the aging process. Specifically, our data indicate that a repressive chromatin structure may be a critical and novel aspect of DSB repair, involving a significant nuclear reorganization of factors associated with age related heterochromatin formation. Unlike DNA damage itself, damage associated epigenetic changes are, at least theoretically, reversible and may, thus, provide a unique means to interfere with age related nuclear reorganization and concomitant tissue dysfunction.",2011

Each of these experiments requires hundreds of thousands of SNPs to be genotyped in thousands of samples and, until very recently, comprehensive application of these experiments has been cost prohibitive. To overcome this challenge, I describe the approach to the design, as well as the features, of a custom genotyping assay, the Metabochip, tailored to interrogate high priority genetic loci implicated in metabolic disorder and clinically important  anthropometric measurements. After a brief characterization of the properties of the array, I will focus on insights gained from extensive replication studies for type 2 diabetes: namely, (1) how the array provides clues to the extent of polygenicity of this trait, and (2) how the depth of replication results can be used to extract new biological insight, using text based mining approaches or protein protein interaction networks.

Susceptibility to AS is known to be highly heritable (h2>90%), and the major gene for the condition, HLA B27, has been known since 1972. However, only 1 5% of HLA B27 carriers develop  AS, and 10 20% of cases do not carry the gene, suggesting that other genes must be involved. Genetic studies of AS have made rapid progress over the past 5 years, with associations with novel genes 14 Concurrent Symposia 14 and genetic loci providing insights into the disease pathogenesis,  stimulating much follow up functional research and therapeutic development.In order to identify further genetic variants predisposing to AS, a gwas was performed involving 1782 British and Australian cases fulfilling  modified New York Criteria, and 5167 historical controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium 2 (WTCCC2). The study was combined with existing results from the Australo Anglo American AS Consortium (TASC) consortium, and replication of the most significant findings performed in 2109 cases and 4410 controls from Australia, Britain, and the Canadian SPARCC consortium. As well as confirming known associations at HLA, IL23R, ERAP1, KIF21B, 2p15  and 21q22,   we identified and subsequently replicated risk predisposing variants in RUNX3, IL12B, and LTBR, and found suggestive association at  ANTXR2, PTGER4, CARD9 , TRADD and TBKBP1 TBX21. Additionally, we identified a single SNP within the MHC, rs4349859,  which lies near the gene MICA and tags HLA B27 with near perfect sensitivity (98%) and specificity (99%). Studies in cases and controls carrying different HLA B27 subtypes, some AS associated and some not, indicate that rs4349859 is not itself AS causative, and further reduce the likelihood that an HLA B*27 linked gene is responsible for the association of B27 with AS. This SNP is far cheaper and easier to genotype than HLA B*27 itself, and can be used as an alternative to HLA B*27  typing, at least in European populations. In most common diseases the proposed genetic model involves interaction between loci, but to date no convincing examples of such interaction have been demonstrated. We identified an interaction  between HLA B*27 and variants within ERAP1 in the WTCCC2  (p,0.02), TASC (p,0.014) and replication datasets (p,0.0019). Specifically, risk variants in ERAP1 increased odds of disease in  HLA B*27  positive, but not HLA B*27 negative, cases (combined  P,7.3x10  6). In contrast, SNPs at other AS loci, including IL23R,  KIF21B, IL12B and the intergenic regions 2p15 and 21q22, were AS  associated in both HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve disease. This  result indicates that HLA B*27 +ve and HLA B*27  ve forms of disease  have substantially different but overlapping aetiologies. Interestingly,  in a separate WTCCC2 study, we have demonstrated that ERAP1is associated with psoriasis, and that the association is restricted to cases carrying the HLA Class I protein HLA Cw6. The findings support mechanisms of association of HLA B*27  and ERAP1 with AS that  involve peptide presentation, and that ERAP1 contributes to disease risk through its action in trimming peptides prior to loading into nascent HLA class I molecules, rather than by cleaving pro inflammatory cytokine receptors on the cell membrane.Many further genes are likely to be identified over the coming years.  The International Genetics of Ankylosing Spondylitis Consortium will perform what will likely be the definitive SNP genotyping study of AS, involving over 12,000 cases and 20,000 healthy controls genotyped for 200,000 markers targeting immunogenetically relevant genes using the âImmunochipâ. This study will bring new findings including new genes, fine mapping of known genes, data about the value of genetic risk prediction in different world populations, and even pharmacogenetic data regarding TNF antagonist response and intolerance.These findings provide substantial material for the functional biology community to research, with the promise of early translation in both therapeutics and improved diagnostic tests.",2011

 Drosophila: Parkinsonâs disease,S11.2,A. J. Whitworth,"MRC Centre for Developmental and Biomedical Genetics, Dept of Biomedical  Science, University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom","Neurodegenerative diseases present an increasing challenge to  biomedical science. Our understanding of the cause and nature of diseases is greatly informed by study of models organisms that recapitulate features of the disease. One model system that has proven surprisingly tractable for these diseases is the fruit fly,  Drosophila  melanogaster . In my lab we are principally focussing on  understanding the function of genes linked to Parkinsonâs disease (PD). PD is the second most prevalent neurodegenerative disorder principally affecting the dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra. The pathogenic mechanisms are unknown and there is currently no cure or disease modifying therapies. Genetic studies have begun to identify single gene mutations responsible for rare heritable forms of PD and define genetic risk factors contributing to disease prevalence in sporadic cases. These findings provide an opportunity to gain insight  into the molecular mechanisms of this disorder through the creation and analysis of appropriate genetic models. Analysis of a number of Drosophila models of PD has revealed some profound and sometimes surprising insights into PD pathogenesis. Moreover, these models can be used to investigate potential therapeutic strategies that may be effective in vivo, and tests have highlighted the efficacy of a number of neuroprotective compounds. I will discuss the methodologies employed in developing the various Drosophila models, and the recent advances that these models in particular have contributed to our understanding of the mechanisms that underlie PD pathogenesis and possible treatment strategies.",2011
 Modeling Parkinsonâs disease in zebrafish,S11.3,O. Bandmann,"Sheffield Institute of Translational Neuroscience, Dept","of Neuroscience,  University of Sheffield, Sheffield, United Kingdom. Parkinsonâs Disease (PD) is the second most common  neurodegenerative disease after Alzheimerâs Disease. The pathological hallmark of PD is loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra (SN). Currently, only symptomatic treatment is available. The identification of monogenically inherited subtypes of PD has provided  us with crucial new insight into the pathogenesis of this disorder, but not led to better therapy as such. Mitochondrial dysfunction is of crucial importance in the pathogenesis of both sporadic and familial PD.Zebrafish (Danio rerio) are emerging as a new animal model for human disease. They are vertebrates and therefore more closely related to humans than other model systems such as c. elegans  or  drosophila . There is very high sequence homology of many PD genes  between humans and zebrafish. The embryos develop externally and are transparent. The dopaminergic nervous system in zebrafish is well  characterized.We will use PD as an example how zebrafish can be used to study human disease. Knockdown of parkin (an autosomal recessively inherited PD gene, leading to the disease due to loss of function) leads to loss of dopaminergic neurons and mitochondrial dysfunction with specific lowering of complex I activity, mirroring both the biochemical and pathological abnormalities observed in human PD patients with parkin   mutations. A STOP mutation in PINK1, a further autosomal recessively inherited, loss of function PD gene also results in mitochondrial dysfunction and loss of dopaminergic neurons. In addition, PINK1  mutant zebrafish larvae display a behavioural phenotype compatible with the abnormalities observed in human patients.",2011
 PGD 21 years on,S12.1,J. Harper,"UCL Centre for PG & D, EGA Institute for Womens Health, University College London, London, United Kingdom","Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was developed in 1989 as an  alternative to prenatal diagnosis to help couples at risk of transmitting a genetic disease to have a healthy family. To achieve this patients go through in vitro fertilisation (IVF) procedures. Cells are removed from the embryo at one of three stages; polar bodies from the oocyte/Concurrent Symposia 15 zygote, blastomeres from cleavage stages or trophectoderm from  blastocysts. During the last 21 years, the majority of cycles have been performed using cleavage stage biopsy. The diagnosis has mainly been performed using the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) for monogenic disorders and fluorescent in situ hybridisation (FISH) for  chromosome analysis.This technology has also been used as an adjunct to IVF to help choose the âbestâ embryo for transfer by testing for as many chromosomes as possible; preimplantation genetic screening (PGS). PGS has been a controversial procedure as thousands of cycles have been performed, but eleven randomised controlled trials (RCT) have shown that it does not increase IVF delivery rates for certain indications.The European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) set up an international PGD consortium in 1997 to monitor  PGD and collect data on PGD cycles worldwide. We have collected data on over 33,000 cycles of PGD/PGS, produced four guidelines on PGD/PGS and have five working groups.Recent advances in the field of PGD/PGS have been the exploration of polar body biopsy (for those countries where embryo biopsy is not allowed) and blastocyst biopsy. Improvements in embryo freezing by using vitrification have resulted in an increase in pregnancies from biopsied embryos. The use of array comparative genomic hybridisation (a CGH) or single nucleotide polymorphism arrays (SNP arrays) is rapidly entering the PGD/PGS arena. Many groups are performing blastocyst biopsy, vitrifying the embryos, and using array technology to perform the diagnosis. The embryos are replaced in a future cycle. For PGS, the new technology needs to be shown to improve delivery  rates by performing RCTs.Controversially, PGD has been used for social sexing, the diagnosis of late onset disorders and HLA matching. Treatment of these indications has caused many ethical discussions and the use of whole genome scanning will bring more debate.",2011
 Use of a c GH in Prenatal Diagnosis,S12.2,A. L. Beaudet,"Department of Molecular and Human Genetics, Houston, TX, United States","Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) is currently being  offered as a rapid and reliable method of prenatal testing for the detection of structural and numerical chromosome abnormalities. aCGH can survey the entire genome for submicroscopic deletions and duplications, aneuploidy and other unbalanced chromosomal  abnormalities and is being increasingly applied to prenatal diagnosis, where it is already making significant impact. Inclusive of our reported experience with 300 prenatal cases (PMID 19012303), we now have aCGH data on 841 clinical prenatal samples, 545 (65%) of which were direct amniotic fluid or direct CVS specimens, allowing for a turnaround time far superior to that of cultured cells. Copy number changes were detected in 166 (20%) of the total 841 cases. Of these, 94 (11%) were CNVs that were interpreted as likely benign either because they were inherited from a phenotypically normal parent (90) or they  were de novo (4) but had been previously observed in our aCGH  database of over 26,000 clinical cases and phenotypically normal individuals. Of the 63/841 (7.5%) cases in which clinically significant genomic imbalances were detected, 23/841 total cases (2.7%) or 23/63 abnormal cases (36.5%) would not have been detected by conventional G banded prenatal chromosome studies alone. These data demonstrate the superior diagnostic power of aCGH compared to conventional karyotype analysis, with a relatively small number of findings of uncertain significance (1% or less), most of which can be resolved by analyzing parents or by using data from ever growing experience with diagnostic aCGH. It is noteworthy that we have now analyzed more than 400 prenatal samples on high resolution oligo arrays and the frequency of findings of uncertain significance  has remained at approximately 1%. Furthermore, the increasing availability and decreasing cost of prenatal aCGH will likely lead to its universal acceptance as a first line prenatal diagnostic test for fetal chromosomal abnormalities in the near future. Furthermore, we have successfully optimized aCGH technology to achieve detection of copy number imbalances of 1 Mb from single cells; with improving technology for fetal cell or fetal DNA enrichment, this may open up new avenues for non invasive prenatal diagnosis.",2011

 Genomic imprinting: an epigenetic gene regulatory model,S13.1,D. P. Barlow,"Research Center for Molecular Medicine of the Austrian Academy of Science, Vienna, Austria","Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic process leading to parental  specific expression of 1 2% of mammalian genes that offers one of the best model systems for a molecular analysis of epigenetic regulation in development and disease. In the twenty years since the first imprinted gene was identified, this model has had a significant impact on  decoding epigenetic information in mammals. So far it has led to the discovery of long range cis acting control elements whose epigenetic  state regulates small clusters of genes, of unusual macro ncRNAs that directly repress genes in cis and critically, it has demonstrated that one biological role of DNA methylation is to allow expression of genes normally repressed by default. Here we describe our progress in understanding how imprinted protein coding genes are silenced, in particular, focussing on the role of macro (or long) ncRNAs that have broad relevance as a potential new layer of regulatory information  in the mammalian genome. The Airn macro ncRNA silences the Igf2r protein coding gene on the paternally inherited copy of mouse chromosome 17. We have previously established an in vitro model in differentiating ES cells that emulates the developmental onset of imprinted expression of Igf2r and Airn (Latos et al., 2009). The ES cell  model was used to determine the functional length of Airn. Several ES lines carrying different Airn truncations were generated and tested  for their ability to direct imprinted Igf2r expression and to change the  physical characteristics of the Airn ncRNA itself. The data show the Airn  ncRNA sequence and structure do not play a role in Igf2r repression.  Since the Airn transcript overlaps the Igf2r promoter, we next tested if transcriptional overlap was sufficient to repress Igf2r by moving  the Airn promoter directly in front of the Igf2r promoter. Together, the  results do not support a functional role for the Airn ncRNA but, instead,  indicate that transcriptional overlap by the Airn ncRNA is sufficient to  repress Igf2r in cis.",2011

 Feedback of individual genetic results to research participants: in favor of a qualified disclosure policy,S16.2,A. L. Bredenoord,"University Medical Center Utrecht, Julius Center, dept Medical Ethics, Utrecht,  Netherlands","In recent years, a debate evolved regarding the question whether  researchers have a duty to return individual genetic research results to research participants. This unsettled debate has rapidly gained in urgency in view of the emergence of biobanks and the advances in next generation sequencing technology, which has the potential to  generate unequalled amounts of genetic data. This implies that the generation of many known and unknown genetic variants in individual participants of genetics/genomics research as intentionally or collaterally obtained by products is unavoidable.In both the scientific debate and in international guidelines, the extreme positions of full disclosure and no disclosure whatsoever are seldom defended. A duty to warn when this may save the life of a research participant is apparently recognized widely. As no disclosure is unethical because it fails to adhere to the so called rule of rescue  and full disclosure nonsensical (at best) as it could imply disclosure of all raw sequencing data, any disclosure policy in between means we have to consider how and by whom a selection should be made about which results are eligible for disclosure.In this presentation, a qualified disclosure policy is proposed. This policy contains a standard default package, possibly supplemented with three additional packages. Whereas the default package, containing life saving information of immediate clinical utility, should be offered routinely and mandatory to all research participants, offering (one of) the three additional packages is context specific.

Mass screening of newborn infants by analysis of blood samples dried  on filter paper (DBS) is performed all over the world. The aim is to find infants with treatable inborn diseases in order to improve the long term outcome by early institution of treatment.Neonatal screening started with the autosomal recessive disorder  phenylketonuria (PKU) in the early sixties by the pioneering work of Robert Guthrie. He developed a bacterial assay on DBS that could detect infants with this serious disorder before it had given symptoms. Patients with PKU born before the start of screening are mentally retarded while those treated since the neonatal period become completely normal.New disorders (eg galactosemia, congenital hypothyroidism, congenital adrenal hyperplasia, cystic fibrosis) have been added one by one when analytical methods for the screening of them have  been developed. Screening for congenital hypothyroidism is the most widely spread over the world. This disorder has a fairly high incidence (1:3000) and is easy to treat at a low cost with one pill of thyroxin a day.In the early nineties a new era for neonatal screening started with the introduction of LC MS MS. With this equipment the concentration of more than a hundred metabolites can be quantified simultaneously in a 3 mm diameter punch of dried blood on filter paper at an analysis time of 2 min per sample. New technologies for DNA analyses will certainly also contribute to the development of neonatal mass screening.LC MS MS has meant a technological break through but has also led to ethical and economical dilemmas with respect to choice of disorders to include in the screening panel.This is well illustrated by the differences between countries.

 Lynch syndrome (HNP cc ),ES2.1,E.

Lynch syndrome patients and their first degree relatives are recommended lifelong surveillance for  colorectal cancer and other Lynch syndrome malignancies starting in their 20s and 30s. The diagnosis can be made based on clinical data and family history (Amsterdam criteria) and/or when a causative germ line mutation has been detected. To date, private mutations in mismatch repair genes MSH2, MLH1, MSH6, PMS2 or deletions of EPCAM leading to epigenetic silencing of MSH2, are known as molecular causes of Lynch syndrome. The identification of a causative mutation is important, as it allows predictive testing in healthy family members. Not all Lynch syndrome patients meet the Amsterdam criteria for Lynch syndrome. The diagnosis of HNPCC should also be considered when the patientâs individual history and family history meet one or more of the less stringent criteria (revised Bethesda guidelines). Among these patients an examination of tumor tissue for Lynch syndrome characteristics is able to detect those, who have a high probability for Lynch syndrome and therefore should undergo surveillance and mutation screening. A high microsatellite instability and loss of DNA mismatch repair protein expression are characteristic for Lynch syndrome tumors.

Yet, 20 years latter, BRCA1/2  genetic testing remains complex because of the large size of the coding sequences, of the broad allelic heterogeneity   disease predisposing mutations being different from a family to another in most cases  , and of the vast number of rare variants with unknown significance (VUS). The international ENIGMA consortium (Evidence based Network for the Interpretation of Germline Mutant Alleles) has been recently created to classify these VUS by using multiple approaches including family cosegregation data. Tumour risk estimate is also a major concern. Numerous factors, both genetic and non genetic, are influencing risks. Their identification, still ongoing, is of the utmost importance for the individualised management of at risk women, and for opening new ways of prevention and treatment. Two international consortia, now associated, play a major role on their identification namely the IBCCS (International BRCA1/2  Carrier Cohort Study) and CIMBA (Consortium of Investigators of Modifiers of BRCA1 and BRCA2) consortia, for non genetic and  genetic factors respectively.The discovery of the involvement of the BRCA1 and BRCA2 proteins in the Double Strand Break DNA repair pathway has lead to specific clinical trials testing molecules increasing the tumour genomic instability such as alkylating agents and Base Excision Repair  inhibitors (PARPi).

Anderson,"Statistical Genetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom",Genome wide associations studies (GWAS) have revolutionised the  field of human genetics and have directly led to the identification of over a thousand loci associated with complex traits and disease. In this presentation I will begin by outlining the rationale behind genome wide association studies and the technological advances that were  necessary to make them a reality. I will go on to discuss how to design a successful GWAS and outline some of the steps that should be undertaken to reduce false positive and false negative findings. I will then review GWAS replication studies and meta analysis. Throughout the presentation I will draw on examples from the GWAS literature. I will finish by summarising the major lessons learnt from GWAS and discussing the ânext generationâ of genome wide association studies.,2011

 cutaneous mosaicism 2011: understanding the patterns and mechanisms,ES5.2,R. Happle,"Department of Dermatology, University of Freiburg, Germany, Freiburg, Germany","All nevi reflect mosaicism. Such skin lesions show a remarkable  divergency of archetypical patterns. Some unusual types are the âRuggieri patternâof pigmentary disturbances, and the hypopigmented macules of Pallister Killian syndrome.   Epigenetic cutaneous mosaicism  can today explain the hereditary patterns of lyonization as  well as hereditary autosomal pigmentary disturbances arranged along  Blaschkoâs lines.   Genomic mosaicism: Such mosaics can usually not be transmitted to the next generation. A new possible example of a lethal mutation surviving by mosaicism is papular nevus spilus syndrome that is characterized by ipsilateral neurologic defects, especially in the form of segmental hyperhidrosis. Phylloid hypomelanosis is a novel neurocutaneous phenotype that reflects mosaic trisomy 13q.   The concept of type 2 segmental manifestation of autosomal dominant skin disorders, reflecting early LOH, has been confirmed by molecular analysis in six different skin disorders including NF1, Hailey Hailey  disease, Darier disease and rhodoid nevus syndrome (âcapillary malformation arteriovenous malformationâ).   Conversely, in autosomal recessive epidermolysis bullosa, postzygotic loss of homozygosity may cause revertant mosaicism in the form of mosaic patches of  healthy skin. Similarly, ichthyosis variegata (ichthyosis in confetti) reflects thousands of revertant clones involving the KRT10 locus.    The concept of didymosis (twin spotting) explains the coexistence of  two different mosaic patches such as capillary didymosis, cutis tricolor, or phacomatosis spilorosea.   Superimposed segmental manifestation of polygenic skin disorders: Clinical examples now include psoriasis, atopic eczema, lichen planus, systemic lupus erythematosus, dermatomyositis, pemphigus vulgaris, vitiligo, graft versus host disease, granuloma annulare, drug eruption, and multiple melanocytic  nevi. This new genetic concept offers an explanation why in polygenic skin disorders âmixedâ cases of both segmental and nonsegmental involvement may occur; why the segmental manifestation is rather severe, tends to occur early in life and is rather difficult to treat; and why family members may show the same disorder in a nonsegmental form.",2011
" marfan syndrome: evolving nosology, evolving pathophysiology and evolving treatment with improved survival",ES6.1,"C. Boileau1,2,3","1Inserm U698, Paris, France, 2University Versailles SQY, Versailles, France,  3Ambroise ParÃ© University Hospital, Boulogne, France","Marfan syndrome (MFS), the prototypical heritable connective tissue  disorder, has been known for its pleiotropy since Victor McKusickâs founding monograph in 1955. Through the years, clinical pleiotropy has led to an evolving nosology (Berlin, 1986: Gent I, 1996; and Ghent II, 2010) that illustrates the difficulty of the diagnosis of MFS.  Twenty years ago the syndrome was found to be due essentially to mutations within the FBN1 gene that encodes fibrillin 1, the major component of 10 nm diameter microfibrils, matrix structures found as isolated aggregates or closely associated with elastin. Careful clinical investigations and the identification of molecular defects located in new genes (TGFBR2 and TGFBR1) have lead to the recognition of overlapping syndromic entities: Marfan syndrome type 2 and the Loeys Dietz syndrome. Conversely, FBN1 gene mutations have been identified in familial diseases affecting mainly one organ  system (isolated ectopia lentis, familial thoracic aortic aneurysm and dissection, Marfanoid habitus), thus showing that they are allelic to MFS. This molecular complexity of human diseases has benefited the understanding of pathogenic mechanisms underlying MFS since it opened avenues of research not only in the field of connective tissue remodelling, but also in alteration of TGF Î² signalling. Historically, MFS was thought to result from structural weakness of connective tissue. This was confirmed with the indentification of mutations (either missense or nonsense) in the FBN1 gene associated with a dominant negative or haploinsuffisiency effect, respectively. Mutations could reasonably well explain the altered mechanical properties of the zonules (ocular ligaments containing high levels of isolated microfibrillar aggregates) and the aortic media (containing elastin  lamellae closely bordered with microfibrils) in MFS. However, no clear genotype/phenotype correlation could be established between FBN1  mutations and various forms of MFS but for the identification of an association between mutations in exons 24 32 and the neonatal MFS as well as the tendency to a more severe phenotype in adults. Further insight into pathophysiology has been gained through the study first of the transgenic Fbn1  mgÎ and subsequently the KI Fbn1 C1039G mice  strains, the latter providing a model more analogous to the situation  in affected humans. The mice strains have led to the identification of increased TGF Î² signalling within disease tissues. This finding is in agreement with an additional role for fibrillin 1: matrix sequestration  of inactive TGF Î² and regulation of TGF Î² activation by targeting and concentrating TGF Î² at specific locations through its interaction with latent TGF Î² binding proteins (LTBPs). The identification of altered TGF Î² signalling has led to several clinical trials worldwide to test the efficacy of Losartan on blunting the overstimulation of the signalling and thus on the aortic disease. The scientific challenge is now the identification of genetic modifiers that could lead to the identification of prognostic factors and new therapeutic targets.Educational Sessions20",2011
 t he Ehlers Danlos syndrome: a disorder with many faces,ES6.2,A. de Paepe,"Centre for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium","The Ehlers Danlos Syndromes (EDS) comprise a heterogeneous group  of diseases which are characterized by fragility of the soft connective tissues and widespread manifestations in skin, ligaments and joints, blood vessels and internal organs. The clinical spectrum varies from mild skin and joint hyperlaxity to severe physical disability and life  threatening vascular complications. Current classification (Villefranche Nosology) recognizes 6 genetic subtypes, most of which are linked to mutations in one of the genes encoding fibrillar collagen proteins or enzymes involved in post translational modification of these proteins. Mutations in type V and type III collagen cause classic or vascular EDS respectively while mutations involving the synthesis or processing of type I collagen are involved in the kyphoscoliosis, arthrochalasis and dermatosparaxis type of EDS. Establishing the correct EDS subtype has important implications for genetic counselling and management  and is supported by specific biochemical and molecular investigations. Over the last years, several new EDS variants have been characterized which call for a refinement of the Villefranche classification. Moreover, the study of these diseases has brought new insights into the molecular pathogenesis of EDS by implicating genetic defects in the biosynthesis of other extracellular matrix molecules, such as proteoglycans and tenascin, or genetic defects in molecules involved in intracellular trafficking, secretion and assembly of extracellular matrix proteins.No causal therapy is available for EDS, but a series of âpreventiveâ guidelines are applicable to all forms of EDS. Key aspects of management include cardiovascular work up, physiotherapy, pain management and psychological support. Recently, a clinical trial has shown promising results for a betablocker, Celiprolol, in the prevention  of vascular catastrophies in patients with vascular EDS.",2011

 Neurofibromatosis,ES7.2,E. Legius,"Center for Human Genetics, Laboratory for Neurofibromatosis Research, K","U.  Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. RAS proteins play key roles in normal cell growth, malignant  transformation, learning and memory. Somatic mutations in RAS genes and several of their upstream and downstream molecules play an important role in different human malignancies.Neurofibromatosis type 1 is caused by heterozygous mutations in the  NF1 tumor suppressor gene coding for neurofibromin. Neurofibromin functions as a GTP ase activating protein towards RAS and neurofibromatosis type 1 was the first human inherited disorder to be associated with an increased signalling through the RAS Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway.Most features of NF1 are the result of tissue specific inactivation of the normal NF1 allele. âSecond hitsâ in the NF1 gene have been observed  in NF1 related tumors such as neurofibromas, gastrointestinal stromal tumors, pheochromocytomas, brain tumors, and glomus tumors of the  digits. âSecond hitsâ were also seen in melanocytes from cafÃ© au lait spots, and pseudarthrosis tissue. In addition patients with NF1 have an increased risk of malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors.These âsecond hitsâ in NF1 result in a deficiency of RAS signalling down regulation with subsequent overactivity of the RAS pathway. Cognitive difficulties in NF1 patients and Nf1 heterozygous mice have  been attributed to haploinsufficiency for NF1(Nf1). Pharmacological  down regulation of RAS activity is capable of correcting learning and memory deficits in adult mice. Clinical trials in humans with NF1 trying to pharmacologically correct the learning disabilities are running at this moment.Legius syndrome is a more recently described entity resembling neurofibromatosis type 1. It is caused by heterozygous mutations  in SPRED1, a negative regulator of RAF activation by RAS GTP. Legius syndrome patients show the same multiple cafÃ© au lait spots as patients with NF1 but without Lisch nodules, neurofibromas, optic pathway gliomas and NF1 related bone abnormalities. Melanocytes from cafÃ© au lait spots in Legius syndrome patients show a âsecond hitâ in the SPRED1 gene. Legius syndrome is associated with mild learning problems and the Spred1 knockout mouse model shows similar learning and memory deficits as the Nf1 mouse model. These findings point to important roles for the evolutionary conserved RAS MAPK pathway not only in oncogenesis but also in cognition, growth and development.In recent years germline mutations in genes coding for other components of the RAS signalling cascade have been recognized in a group of phenotypically overlapping disorders, referred to as the neuro cardio facial cutaneous syndromes or Ras o pathies. These disorders are characterized by variable degrees of cognitive impairment, cardiac abnormalities, facial dysmorphism, short stature, skin abnormalities and a variable cancer risk.",2011
 Arrays in daily practice,ES9.1,C. M. A. van Ravenswaaij Arts,"University Medical Centre Groningen, Department of Genetics, University of  Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands","This presentation will focus on the interpretation of array results in a  routine diagnostics setting from a cytogenetic and clinical point of view. The main take home messages will be:1. Know your diagnostic limits. Within these limits, data should be of high quality, accurate and reproducible. 2. Define thresholds that are realistic for the array platform used and are manageable without losing too much information.3. Be aware of the relationship of the array result with the underlying cytogenetic abnormality and with the possible mechanism of formation. This is important for the follow up studies that should be recommended (e.g. karyotyping, FISH or array) and for counselling (e.g. recurrence risk).4. Recognise the importance of clinical information and the use of databases. 5. Know when not to use arrays, and ensure you answer the physicianâs question.6. Be aware of the increasing number of CNVs that are ârisk factorsâ for MR/MCA, but which, on their own, may not be sufficient to cause a phenotype. This also implies that inheriting a CNV from a non affected parent may mean it can still make a contribution to the childâs phenotype.7. Be aware that for CNVs, âde novoâ does not automatically mean âpathogenicâ.8. Be aware of unexpected findings. Pre test counselling on the possibility of unexpected findings is important. If no national guidelines are available, local guidelines should be set up.I will give illustrative examples for all these take home messages.",2011
 Deciphering Developmental Disorders,ES9.2,N. P. Carter,"Molecular Cytogenetics, Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Improved diagnosis for children with developmental disorders requires  the integration of several important elements. These include accurate and detailed phenotyping, reproducible and consistent application of new genomic methodologies, a comprehensive database to inform diagnosis and genetic counselling, open data sharing for additional  research opportunities and a comprehensive collection of patient and parental DNAs to facilitate further disease gene discovery. We are bringing all these elements together by direct collaboration between the 23 UK Regional Genetics Services and the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute in the Deciphering Developmental Disorders (DDD) project (http://www.ddduk.org). The main aim of the DDD project is to improve diagnosis for children with developmental disorders within a 5 year period. This will be achieved by the systematic application of the latest microarray and sequencing methods to 12,000 children  with developmental disorders and their parents from the UK recruited through the Regional Genetics Services. The new technologies will raise ethical challenges that we will address by a programme of Educational Sessions21 ethics and sociological research, working with patients and the UK  genetics community. The high resolution genomic and phenotypic data collected on this unparalleled scale will deliver accurate diagnosis for 1000s of families; a knowledge base for clinical interpretation of results from new technologies; the design of cost effective, efficient diagnostic  assays; standards of good practice addressing ethical issues raised by new genomic technologies; and the opportunity for major UK research into diagnostic applications based on next generation sequencing.In his educational session, I will describe how the current DECIPHER database (https://decipher@sanger.ac.uk) can be used to inform  diagnosis of developmental disorders and how the database has been adapted to provide informatics support for patient recruitment and clinical reporting of significant findings for the DDD project. Furthermore, I will describe the pragmatic approach we are taking to  filtering the research findings to maximise the feedback of pertinent findings to the clinical teams while minimising the risk of feeding back incidental findings that might cause psychological harm to the patient or family.

Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) is one of the most frequent cancers in western countries, representing 35% of all cases of leukemia. Different genetic alterations have been identified in CLL, including chromosomal  aberrations detected by cytogenetic analysis, FISH and aCGH. The limitations of these techniques do not allow the identification of the full set of somatic structural variation at molecular level. Our understanding of oncogenesis has benefited greatly from next generation sequencing technology. Massively sequencing, in combination with computational approaches, offers the potential to carry out genome wide screening of all sort of chromosomal rearrangements. Using a toolkit (PeSVFisher) that includes several algorithms to identify structural variations in genomic sequencing, we have analyzed whole genome sequencing,  whole exome sequencing and SNP/CGH arrays data, to annotate the entire complement of genomic rearrangements in ten patients with CLL. By identifying read pairs that did not align correctly with respect to each other on the reference genome, we have catalogued hundreds of somatic rearrangements. Moreover, depth of coverage of whole genome sequencing and whole exome sequencing data provides a comprehensive catalogue of copy number variations. The analysis of these first ten CLL cases represents the first step in a comprehensive characterization of the genomic alterations at the structural level, coupled with functional analysis, of CLL in the framework of the CLL genome project to decode the genetic changes that are responsible for the development and progression of CLL.*Equal contributio",2011

Rahman1","1Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom, 2The Wellcome Trust  Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United Kingdom","High, intermediate and low penetrance genetic variants predisposing to  breast cancer have been identified but account for <30% of estimated disease heritability. Our systematic resequencing of candidate genes previously identified the predisposition genes, CHEK2, ATM, BRIP1  and PALB2. These genes are characterized by rare, inactivating,  primarily truncating mutations that confer a relative risk of breast  cancer of 2 4. It is highly plausible that there exist additional genes acting in a similar fashion and whole exome sequencing should allow their identification. However, there are significant scientific and cost constraints on such experiments.To explore the utility of exome sequencing in gene identification in breast cancer susceptibility we have sequenced 50 familial breast cancer exomes using the Agilent whole exome pulldown, Illumina Genome IIx sequencing and NextGENe software for data analysis. We  first identified rare (<5% frequency) mutations resulting in premature protein truncation, as these have the highest likelihood of being associated with disease. Each sample contained â¥ 15 such mutations. Five were in known genes (CHEK2 (n,3) ATM  (n,1) and BRCA2 (n,1))  and therefore likely to be causative. However, without prior knowledge of their role in breast cancer predisposition, recognition of these as pathogenic mutations would have been challenging. Amongst the remaining 45 samples were some interesting genes, including some with two truncating mutations which we are following up. Our data demonstrates that exome sequencing in familial breast cancer  can identify predisposition genes but that there are significant challenges in using this approach in an agnostic fashion to discover new genes.c01.3* The role of germline allele specific expression of TGFBR1 in colorectal cancer predisposition N.

A previous report suggested that allele specific expression (ASE)  of TGFBR1 confers an increased risk of colorectal cancer (CRC)[1].  Subsequent studies showed contradictory results[2 5]. Considering its  potential use in the clinical evaluation of CRC susceptibility we herein perform a validation study.While in the original study ASE was measured using SNaPshot, here we use pyrosequencing. We show that this technology is a  more powerful and robust method for allelic imbalance assessment, showing reproducible and consistent results when using different allelic markers, even when high quality RNA is not available. Blood lymphocytes and normal colon mucosae were used as source of non tumoral biological material.Two different populations were analyzed: 433 healthy controls and 426 CRC patients of Ashkenazi Jewish descent, and 178 CRC cases from a Caucasian dominated population. In the Ashkenazi cohort, 26% controls and 27% patients were informative. ASE values ranged  from 0.67 to 1.39 (median: 1.00) for controls and from 0.76 to 1.67 (median: 1.00) for cases (median difference  0.003; 95%CI  0.032 to 0.025; p,0.81). 50% of the Caucasian cases resulted informative. Their ASE values ranged from 0.68 to 1.40 (median: 1.01), and no significant differences were identified neither when compared with the Ashkenazi controls or with the cases. Only 25 50% of all individuals are informative for analysis, so novel approaches may be required to comprehensively determine the role of allele specific expression of TGFBR1 in colorectal cancer.Our results suggest that ASE of TGFBR1 does not confer an increased  risk of CRC.",2011

We undertook the present study to elucidate the mechanisms of LRP1B inactivation in cancer cells and to investigate the key roles  of this lipoprotein receptor in the carcinogenesis. Here we show that LRP1B inactivation (by chromosomal, epigenetic and microRNA mediated mechanisms) modulates the tumor microenvironment to confer cancer cells an increased invasive capacity. LRP1B displays frequent DNA copy number loss and CpG island methylation resulting in mRNA under expression. By using CpG island reporters methylated in vitro, we found that DNA methylation disrupts a functional binding site for the histone acetyltransferase p300 located at intron 1. We identified and validated a microRNA targeting LRP1B (miR 548a 5p)  which is overexpressed in cancer cell lines as a result of 8q22 DNA gains. Restoration of LRP1B impaired in vitro and in vivo tumor growth,  inhibited cell invasion and led to a reduction of soluble growth factors, cytokines and matrix metalloproteinases in the extracellular medium. These findings link DNA copy number changes, an epigenetic transcription factor and a specific microRNA with the modulation of the extracellular medium, through LRP1B (de)regulation.Concurrent Sessions23",2011

Benezra","Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, New York, NY, United States","Chromosomal instability, a high rate of chromosome missegregation during mitosis, is a hallmark of many human cancers and a major driving force for solid tumor progression. The mitotic checkpoint, a key surveillance mechanism to safeguard against chromosomal instability, is frequently hyperactivated in tumor cells. While we know  that p53 protects against varies forms of genomic instability, how aberrant p53 signaling leads to chromosomal instability through mitotic checkpoint hyperactivation has thus far remained elusive. We find that, via induction of p21 expression and inhibition of cyclin dependent kinase activity, crosstalk to the Retinoblastoma (Rb) pathway is critically important to prevent overexpression of the E2F target gene Mad2. Mad2 is a mitotic checkpoint protein whose overexpression is sufficient to hyperactivate the checkpoint and initiate aneuploid tumor formation in vivo. We show here that its overexpression is required  to mediate the chromosomal instability phenotypes of impaired p53  and Rb pathways. In the context of aberrant Rb pathway signaling, Mad2 overexpression is required for the acquisition of chromosomal instability and anaplastic mammary tumor formation. Additionally, in a p53 mutant knock in mouse model that develops tumors with stable, diploid genomes, the Mad2 upregulation and chromosomal instability that is caused by p21 loss can be rescued by genetic reduction of Mad2 levels. These results demonstrate that Mad2 overexpression is an essential mediator of the chromosomal instability and tumor phenotypes observed upon inactivation of the two tumor suppressor pathways that are most frequently impaired in human cancer.",2011

Recently, somatic amplification and gain of function mutations of the anaplastic lymphoma receptor tyrosine kinase (ALK, MIM 105590) gene, either  somatic or germline, were identified in a significant proportion of NB  cases.Here we report a novel syndromic presentation associating congenital NB with severe encephalopathy and abnormal shape of the brainstem on brain MRI in two unrelated sporadic cases harbouring de novo,  germline, heterozygous ALK gene mutations. Both mutations are  gain of function mutations that have been reported in NB and NB cell lines only. Electroporation of the neural tube of embryonic day 1.5 chicken embryos with a mutant ALK construction results in spreading of neural progenitors beyond the ventricular zone at two days post  electroporation; this phenotype is not observed when wild type ALK is over expressed. This supports the hypothesis that activating mutations in ALK disrupt neurogenesis in the central nervous system. These observations further illustrate the role of oncogenes in both tumour predisposition and normal development, and shed light on the pleiotropic and activity dependent role of ALK in humans. More generally, missing germline mutations relative to the spectrum of somatic mutations reported for a given oncogene may be a reflection of severe effects during embryonic development, and may have to be looked for in patients with extreme phenotypes.c02.1 Clinical and molecular findings in 91 patients with the clinical  diagnosis of  c ornelia de Lange  s yndrome I.

Microcephaly with simplified gyration (MSG) is a rare malformation of cortical development, not always associated with severe epilepsy. Infantile onset permanent diabetes is caused by inappropriate  apoptosis of pancreatic beta cells, e.g. Wolcott Rallison syndrome (WRS).We have previously described a WRS patient with MSG suggesting abnormal apoptosis as a common mechanism. Additional families exhibiting this combination have been collected.Genomic linkage revealed a region on chromosome 18 with a LOD score of 4.3.This corresponded to an area of overlapping homozygosity on SNP array.Two homozygous non conservative missense mutations in a novel gene were found in patients from two unrelated consanguineous  families, but not in 300 matched controls, and were predicted as pathogenic by Poliphen 2, SIFT programs and the HOPE project. The gene involved is highly expressed in ventricular and subventricular zone of the fetal brain cortex and pancreas and is presumably implicated in regulation of apoptosis. Patient fibroblasts and cells treated with specific siRNA showed an increased susceptibility to apoptosis under stress conditions. Autopsy specimen from one patient showed increased apoptosis in the cerebral cortex. qRT PCR revealed dysregulation of other genes in the apoptotic control system.in patient cells.We have identified a new syndrome with MSG, epilepsy and infantile diabetes caused by novel mutation pointing to apoptosis of neural progenitors in the developing cortex as the causal mechanism. This  work sheds light on the mechanisms of brain development and West syndrome.",2011

Because of the paucity  of reports on older persons with PWS, the natural history, the onset  and type of age related problems are not well known. We will present data on physical, behavioural, psychiatric and ageing characteristics in  the first cohort of individuals with PWS aged over 50 years. m ethod: Twelve persons with a genetically confirmed diagnosis of  PWS aged over 50 years are described (4 deletion; 8 mUPD). Data  were collected through semi structured interviews with the individuals with PWS and their main carers.Results: Cardiovascular diseases, diabetes, dermatological and  orthopedic problems were common physical complaints in elderly with PWS. Function in ADL, psychological functioning, physical functions  and care dependence were substantially worse in elderly (50+) compared to the control group (18 49 yrs). 7/8 persons with mUPD had a history of psychiatric illness. Behavioural and food related problems were not less prevalent in the older individuals compared to the control group.Discussion: Given the combination of age related physical morbidity,  physical appearance, behavioural and psychiatric problems and functional decline in our cohort, we hypothesize premature ageing in elderly with PWS. Healthy ageing in PWS requires a lifespan approach that recognizes the presence, progression and consequences of specific morbidity. The knowledge of the PWS specific age related  health risk factors will be used to adjust guidelines for preventive management.",2011

Ospedali  Galliera, Genova, Italy, 4Department of Pediatrics, University of Catania,  Catania, Italy. For a disorder as common as fragile X syndrome, a hereditary form of  cognitive impairment, the facial features are relatively ill defined. An elongated face and prominent ears are the most commonly accepted dysmorphic hallmarks. We analysed 3D photographs of 50 males with full FMR1 mutations using dense surface modelling (DSM) techniques  and a new method that forms a directed graph with normalised faces as nodes and edges linking faces showing closest dysmorphism. We identified as yet unrecorded facial characteristics such as infra orbital proptosis, hyperplasticity of the nasal bone cartilage interface, mid facial hyperplasia and increased supra orbital height. Subsequently, we began analysis of micro CT images of the fragile X mouse model. Results indicated reduced inter parietal bone length and reduced length and width of the inner skull. We also found reduced lateral separation of condylar surfaces and increased mandibular height due  to altered orientation of condyle, coronal and angle tip, and increased depth at anterior molars.Thus, we have refined the facial characteristics of fragile X syndrome and have obtained a 95% discrimination rate between affected and control males. Some of the abnormalities, e.g., nasal cartilage deficiencies in patients and mid facial effects in the mouse model, correspond in both species and suggest a common mechanism. This supports reports that FMR1, the gene silenced in the disorder, influences eye and cranial cartilage development through effects on neural crest cells and is consistent with a previous study of Bardet Biedl syndrome where similar nasal bone and mid facial abnormalities were linked to adverse neural crest cell behaviour.",2011

Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is caused by expansion of a CGG repeat  in the 5â untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1 (FMR1) gene. This mutation is associated with hypermethylation Concurrent Sessions25 at the FMR1 promoter and subsequent transcriptional silencing.  The absence of FMRP (FMR1 protein) at the synapse has many consequences, including up regulation of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) mediated signaling. It has been postulated that this increased mGluR5 signal may be responsible for many of  the clinical manifestations observed in fragile X syndrome. mGluR5 receptor antagonists have shown promise in preclinical FXS models and in one small open label study of FXS. We examined whether a receptor subtype selective inhibitor of mGluR5, AFQ056, improves the behavioral symptoms of FXS in a randomized, double blind, two treatment, two period, crossover study of 30 male FXS patients aged 18 to 35 years. We detected no significant effects of treatment on the primary outcome measure, the Aberrant Behavior Checklist Community Edition (ABC C) score, at day 19 or 20 of treatment. In an  exploratory analysis, however the patients with full FMR1 promoter methylation and no detectable FMR1 messenger RNA improved, as measured with the ABC C, significantly more after AFQ056 treatment than with placebo (P < 0.001). If confirmed in larger and longer term studies, these results suggest that blockade of the mGluR5 receptor in patients with full methylation at the FMR1 promoter may show improvement in the behavioral attributes of FXS.",2011

Microcephalic primordial dwarfism is an autosomal recessive group of  conditions with extreme growth failure, characterised by intrauterine growth retardation, short stature and microcephaly. Several genes involved in fundamental cellular processes have been identified for these disorders: PCNT in MOPD II ; ATR , CEP152 in Seckel  syndrome; but none previously for Meier Gorlin syndrome.Here, we report the identification of five further genes encoding components of the pre replication complex. Homozygosity mapping in a Saudi Arabian family with an uncategorised form of microcephalic primordial dwarfism established a novel locus at 1p32.3. Subsequent sequencing identified biallelic missense ORC1 mutations in 4 families with microcephalic dwarfism from a cohort of 170 cases. We found that replication licensing was impaired in Orc1 patient cell lines and cell cycle progression slowed, in keeping with ORC1âs role, (along with ORC2 6,  CDC6 and CDT1), as a component of the Pre Replication Complex that licenses replication initiation. Furthermore, developmentally, Orc1 depletion substantially impaired zebrafish embryo growth.Extending our studies to patients with Meier Gorlin syndrome, in which primordial dwarfism is accompanied by absent or hypoplastic patellae and microtia, we then identified biallelic missense/truncating mutations in ORC1, and through further sequencing multiple mutations  in other preRC complex components, ORC4, ORC6, CDT1 and CDC6.  We therefore implicate the pre replication complex as a whole in the developmental regulation of human growth, and surprisingly show that disruption of its function is associated with a distinct and broad spectrum of developmental abnormalities.Bicknell, Walker et al.

Although most cases are sporadic, transmission in a few families  suggests autosomal dominant inheritance. We sequenced the exomes of six unrelated patients and identified nonsense and frameshift heterozygous mutations in NOTCH2 for five of them. The five mutations are invariably located within the last 3â coding exon of NOTCH2, distal to the ankyrin repeats and NLS necessary for the transcriptional activity of Notch2 intracellular domain, while deleting the PEST domain. These results suggest that mutant mRNA products escape nonsense mediated decay and that truncated NOTCH2 proteins act in a gain of function manner. This mutational mechanism also suggests  that decreasing Notch2 signaling using selective gamma secretase inhibitors may have therapeutic interest in this severe and progressive disease. Finally, our findings establish an important role for Notch2 signaling in bone homeostasis that may notably be relevant to better understanding of mechanisms leading to osteoporosis.",2011

After mutations in all known OI genes had been excluded by Sanger sequencing, we applied next generation sequencing to analyze the exome of a single individual with a severe  form of the disease whose parents are second cousins. A total of 26,922 variations from the human reference genome sequence were subjected to several filtering steps. In addition, we extracted the genotypes of all dbSNP130 annotated SNPs from the exome sequencing data and used these 299,494 genotypes as markers for the genome wide identification of homozygous regions. A single homozygous truncating mutation, affecting SERPINF1 on chromosome 17p13.3, remained that was embedded into a homozygous stretch of 2.99 Mb.

We mapped a locus to chromosome 19p13  and identified ten different mutations in the ACP5 gene in 14 patients aged from 3 to 63 years.ACP5 encodes tartrate resistant phosphatase (TRAP), a lysosomal enzyme that is expressed predominantly in macrophages, osteoclasts and dendritic cells. The mutations abolish enzyme function in the serum and cells of affected individuals. Phosphorylated osteopontin (p OPN), a protein involved in bone reabsorption and in immune regulation, accumulates in serum, urine and cells cultured from TRAP deficient individuals. Patient derived dendritic cells exhibit an altered cytokine  profile and are more potent than matched control cells in stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions. Thus, TRAP deficiency leads to (1) a defect in bone remodeling, particularly at growth plates, and (2) accumulation of phosphorylated osteopontin, a potent pro inflammatory cytokine, leading to interferon release and autoimmunity.The discovery of TRAP deficiency as the basis of SPENCD discloses new therapeutic options such as hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, enzyme replacement therapy, or pharmacologic modulation of the OPN IFN axis.

FSHD is most often caused by contraction of the D4Z4 macrosatellite repeat array, but only when the repeat array is localized on a specific permissive genetic background  of chromosome 4q. Repeat contractions non permissive 4q or 10q chromosomes do not cause FSHD. D4Z4 repeat contractions are associated with local chromatin relaxation and transcriptional upregulation of the retrotransposed gene DUX4 in FSHD myotubes  only.We performed detailed D4Z4 sequencing in permissive and non permissive haplotypes and identified specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the polyadenylation signal of DUX4. While permissive chromosomes carry a typical polyadenylation signal for  DUX4, non permissive chromosomes have sequence variants that would predict the DUX4 polyA signal to be non functional. Indeed, transfection studies revealed that DUX4 transcripts are efficiently  polyadenylated and more stable when expressed from permissive chromosomes. These findings suggest that FSHD arises through a toxic gain of function attributable to the stabilized DUX4 transcript. In  addition to the SNPs affecting the polyadenlyation signal other SNPs are currently being investigated for their role in DUX4 mRNA processing  and stability. In controls DUX4 is highly expressed in the germ line and then is epigenetically silenced in somatic tissues. In FSHD, the combination of inefficient D4Z4 chromatin silencing and stabilization of DUX4 mRNAs results in inappropriate DUX4 protein expression  in muscle cells. Therefore, FSHD represents the first human disease  caused by the inefficient repression of a retrogene array.",2011

In total we identified 32 FOXL2 encompassing  and 10 regulatory deletions.  The deletion size and breakpoint locations  are highly variable, suggesting absence of a recombination hotspot. To unravel the mechanisms underlying these rearrangements, we aimed to determine the precise locations of the breakpoints. A second purpose was to identify genotype phenotype correlations for extra ocular features. We used high resolution tiling arrays to fine map the breakpoints. For 27 deletions, both breakpoints could be fine mapped, allowing junction PCRs. Of these, six deletions could be delineated at  the nucleotide level so far. At least two out of six deletions are caused by a recombination based mechanism using LINE and Alu elements  as recombination substrates. With regard to genotype phenotype correlations, an ATR  encompassing deletion was found in five of  eight BPES patients with reported microcephaly. Interestingly, in two patients with joint abnormalities the SOX14 gene was located within the deletion, potentially implicating this gene in the pathogenesis of this extra ocular feature.

We examine its effect by EMSA and luciferase reporter assays and show that YY1 binding is abolished. HCFC1 forms a complex (among others) with the MLL family of H3K4 methyltransferases that is important  in cell cycle regulation. We also show further downstream effect of HCFC1 de regulation on the E2F1 transcription factor and as such putatively linking HCFC1 de regulation to p53 regulated neurogenesis. Interestingly, YY1 itself has recently been found mutated in a sporadic case with ID (Nat Genet, 42(12):1109 12, 2010). Our data show that patients with MECP2 (and also HCFC1) duplications do not have their HCFC1 mRNA up regulated. Currently ~86% of all disease causing mutations are in protein coding regions, however, this may represent ascertainment bias, which can now be addressed at least partly by the application of MPS technology.",2011

Unlike the  aforementioned human syndrome, Nfi x deficient mice are unable to gain weight and die in the first three postnatal weeks, while they also present with a spinal deformation and decreased bone mineralisation. These features prompted us to consider NFI X as a candidate gene for Marshall Smith syndrome (MSS), a severe malformation syndrome characterized by failure to thrive, respiratory insufficiency, accelerated osseous maturation, kyphoscoliosis, osteopenia and unusual facies. Distinct frameshift and splice NFI X mutations creating premature translation termination codons that escaped nonsense mediated mRNA  decay (NMD) were identified in nine MSS subjects. NFI X belongs to the Nuclear factor one (NFI) family of transcription factors, but its specific function is presently unknown. We demonstrate that NFI X is normally expressed prenatally during human brain development and skeletogenesis. These findings demonstrate that allelic NFI X mutations trigger distinct phenotypes, depending specifically on their impact on NMD.Concurrent Sessions28",2011

We have observed reversion by mitotic recombination of a mutation in TERC (telomerase RNA component) in a family affected by Dyskeratosis Congenita (DC). DC is a disorder of telomere biology and is characterized by mucocutaneous  abnormalities and dystrophic nails. Persons affected by DC are at risk for bone marrow failure, cancer and lung fibrosis.We identified a deletion in TERC in the proband of a family with  autosomal dominant DC. Segregation of the mutation was confirmed in all affected relatives by sequence analysis on peripheral blood DNA. In two affected brothers, discrepancies in the peak heights suggested overrepresentation of the wild type allele, whereas the mutation had remained heterozygous in tissues other than blood. Therefore, this mosaicism in peripheral blood must result from somatic reversion of  the mutated allele to normal. Neither one of these patients developed bone marrow failure. SNP array analysis on blood DNA from the brothers showed acquired uniparental disomy of chromosome 3q, including TERC. In one of these two patients, two independent events  of mitotic recombination on chromosome 3 were observed, which were both present in different blood cell lineages of this person. Therefore, the reversion events must have occurred in non lineage specific haematopoietic precursor cells.In conclusion, we have found recurrent revertant mosaicism in a family with DC. This finding is important for improving diagnostic testing and understanding the variable phenotype of DC.",2011

Mutations in NIPBL have been identified in approximately 75% of patients with severe classical CdLS but have been found in a far lower  percentage of patients with mild or atypical features. NIPBL is required for the establishment of sister chromatid cohesion through the loading of Cohesin, a multimer consisting of SMC1 and SMC3 and the clasp proteins, RAD21 and STAG. Following the identification of NIPBL,  mutations in SMC1A and SMC3 were detected in a small percent of patients. These patients have a milder phenotype without major structural anomalies, although all have significant mental retardation. By mutation screening of several genes encoding cohesins or associated proteins in a cohort of 180 mutation negative individuals, two de novo   RAD21  mutations in patients with features that diverge from classical  CdLS were identified. We have measured the expression and activity  of these missense mutations in protein interaction, DNA damage and zebrafish developmental assays. In short, one of these RAD21 mutations which increases binding to STAG2, appears to function in a dominant negative manner and results in a more severe phenotype than the other loss of function mutation, which alters binding to SMC1.Cohesinopathies comprise a broadening spectrum of pediatric developmental disorders. We will discuss the current understanding of mechanisms by which Cohesin mutations may alter transcriptional profiles to result in multiple variant developmental phenotypes and speculate on clinical features that appear to be unique and common between different âdisorders of Cohesinâ.c05.1 Novel  m ethod to Estimate the Phenotypic Variation Explained by  Genome Wide Association  s tudies Reveals Large Fraction of the  m issing Heritability Z.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are conducted with the  promise to discover novel genetic variants associated with diverse traits. For most traits, associated markers individually explain just a modest fraction of the phenotypic variation, but their number can well be in the hundreds. We developed a maximum likelihood method  that allows us to infer the distribution of associated variants even when many of them were missed by chance. Compared to previous approaches, the novelty of our method is that it (a) does not require having an independent (unbiased) estimate of the effect sizes; (b) makes use of the complete distribution of P values while allowing for the false discovery rate; (c) takes into account allelic heterogeneity and the SNP pruning strategy. We then applied our method to the latest GWAS meta analysis results of the GIANT consortium. It revealed that while the explained variance of genome wide (GW)  significant SNPs is around 1% for waist hip ratio (WHR), the observed P values provide evidence for the existence of variants explaining 10% (CI,[8.5% 11.5%]) of the phenotypic variance in total. Similarly, the total explained variance likely to exists for height is estimated to be 29% (CI,[28% 30%]), three times higher than what the observed GW significant SNPs give rise to. This methodology also enables us to predict the benefit of future GWA studies that aim to reveal more associated genetic markers via increased sample size.",2011

Hoogendijk1, A. van der  Vaart2, P. Heutink1","1VU Medical Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam,  Netherlands","In recent years, genome wide association studies have been very  successful in identifying loci for complex traits. However, typically these findings involve noncoding and/or intergenic SNPs without a clear functional effect that do not directly point to a specific gene. Hence, the next challenge is to identify the causal variant responsible  for the association signal. Typically the first step is to identify all genetic variation in the locus region by, for example, resequencing a large number of case chromosomes. Once all variants are identified, the causal one needs to be ascertained in further functional studies. Because the experimental follow up can be laborious, restricting the number of variants to be scrutinized would yield a great advantage. Therefore, an objective method for choosing the size of the region to be followed up would be highly valuable. Here we propose a simple method to call the minimal region around a significant association  peak that is very likely to contain the causal variant. We model Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) in cases from the observed single SNP association signals and predict the location of the causal variant by quantifying how well this relationship fits the data. Simulations showed that our approach identifies genomic regions of on average ~50 kb with up to 90% probability to contain the causal variant. We apply our method to two genome wide association datasets and localize both the functional variant REP1 in the Î± synuclein gene that conveys susceptibility to Parkinsonâs Disease and the APOE gene involved in susceptibility to Alzheimerâs Disease.",2011

None of the above mentioned analysis strategies are well suited for identification of disease genes in small families segregatingautosomal recessive (AR) or X linked (XL) diseases.Here, we present an algorithm that can be used to narrow down the candidate regions in exome sequences of affected siblings of consanguineous or non consanguineous parents in AR disorders.

Our overall aim is to identify common genetic variants that modify the risk for psychiatric disorders based on the identification of genetic variants involved in the variance of the volume  of brain structures in healthy individuals. Mean total brain volume was automatically segmented in T1 weighted MRI scan using FreeSurfer. 16 groups worldwide have now pooled their imaging genomics data from a total of >7000 subjects. Genetic homogeneity of the samples  was assessed and genotypes were imputed using the HapMap III reference panel, and associations were tested via dosage of each imputed SNP (accounting for kinship in family based samples). After quality control, results files and summary statistics were pooled for  meta analysis. By February 2011, 16 groups had uploaded GWAS results in >7000 subjects. Association conducted at ~1.3 million autosomal SNPs showed that none of the individual sites contained genome wide significant GWAS results (p<10^ 8). Conversely, meta analysis of the data from the 16 studies yielded genome wide significant p values for total brain volume. To date, neuroimaging genetics has largely employed candidate gene, GWAS, or image wide GWAS analyses in samples < 1000 subjects. This leads to a lack of power to detect significant effects while controlling the false positive  rate.

Deciphering the influence of genetic variants on regulatory modules,  and the correlation between such regulatory variants and phenotype (e.g. disease) has been the subject of extensive research in recent years. Here, we present a novel approach to this problem, which entails analyzing modules of genes, rather than studying SNP gene  connections independently. First, we search pair wise connections between transcripts whose levels are co associated to the same SNP. Second, we combine these pairs into modules that share a regulating SNP. Third, we assign a confidence score to each module. Finally, we split the samples in each module according to the genotype of the main SNP and find the best allele specific SNPs that explain the expression of the largest group of genes in each subset of samples. We applied our method to data on genetic and gene expression in the liver across 371 samples by Merck. We detect 129,109 pairs of transcripts that are  jointly associated to the same SNP as their most significant regulator. These make up 10,354 modules, 518 including 10 transcripts or more. These are significantly more and larger modules than in permuted data (2,322+ 208, 220+ 42 of size 10 or more). We quantified the confidence in a module as a likelihood score, and prune a subset of 114 modules with FDR<0.02. We observe similar annotations of modules from two sources of information: the enrichment of a module in gene subsets and locus annotation of the genetic variants.

The dog population is composed of more than 400 breeds; each  one is a genetic isolate with unique phenotypic characteristics. Dogs tend to suffer from the same range of diseases as humans, but the genetic complexity of these diseases within a breed is reduced as a consequence of intense selection and inbreeding. In this study, we performed a comprehensive analysis using multiple test statistics to identify regions under strong selection in 518 dogs from 46 diverse breeds using a newly developed high density genotyping canine array consisting of >170,000 evenly spaced SNPs. We first identified 44 genomic regions exhibiting extreme differentiation across multiple breeds. Genetic variation in these regions correlates with variation in several phenotypic traits that vary between breeds, and we identify novel associations with both morphological and behavioural traits. We next scanned the genome for signatures of selective sweeps  in single breeds. These scans identify hundreds of regions strongly enriched for developmental genes and genes implicated in diseases. We characterised one highly differentiated region associated with body size and ear morphology, using high throughput sequencing to provide a list of variants that may directly affect these traits.In this study, we provide a detailed description of genomic regions under strong selection in the canine genome, including many linked to extreme phenotypic variation. We hypothesize that some of these regions will also contain canine disease genes of comparative relevance to human health.",2011

SERPINB11, located in the 18q21 gene cluster, is a  polymorphic gene/pseudogene coding for a non inhibitory SERPIN. This study sought a better understanding of the evolutionary history of  SERPINB11, with special focus on evaluating the adaptive signature identified in Africans in a genome wide scan for selection. Our study comprised the resequencing of SERPINB11 in 20 Yorubans and  the analysis of primate orthologous sequences. We identified a full length SERPINB11 variant encoding a non inhibitory SERPIN as the  putative candidate of selection, probably driven to higher frequencies by an adaptive response using preexisting variation. In addition, we detected contrasting evolutionary features for SERPINB11 in primates: While primate phylogeny as a whole is under purifying selection, the  human lineage shows evidence for positive selection in a few codons, all associated with the active SERPINB11. According to comparative modeling studies, positively selected codons are suggested to reduce SERPINB11âs ability to undergo the typical conformational changes of inhibitory SERPINs   suggesting that it is evolving towards a new function in humans. The recognition of significant correlations between SERPINB11 variants and pathogen richness has led us to propose a selective advantage through host pathogen interactions, which may be linked to an adaptive response combating the emergence of infectious diseases during the Neolithic.

There is, however, wide variation in the number and length of ROH across individuals and populations due to their diverse demographic histories: sub Saharan African populations are the least homozygous and Native South Americans the most. Using genomic  analysis we here demonstrate the remarkable lack of homozygosity in mixed race individuals: first generation (F1) West African x European individuals are the least homozygous of all, with an order of magnitude fewer ROH than commonly observed in other populations. Their parents may not share ancestors after the Out of Africa movement, ~70,000 years ago. Populations may be ranked by increasing mean number of ROH: (1) F1 West African x European; (2) F1 Afro Caribbean x European; (3) Afro Caribbean; (4) sub Saharan African (excluding hunter gatherers), F1 European x East African, F1 European x East Asian, Mauritian and  Seychellois; (5) F1 European x South Asian; (6) F2 Eurasian mixed race individuals; (7) other Eurasians; and (8) Native North Americans. Afro Caribbeans have on average ~20% European ancestry, and these haplotypes generate ROH in offspring with Europeans. F1 European x East Asian individuals carry a similar complement of ROH to sub Saharan Africans, emphasising the great genetic diversity in Africa. The variance in the number of ROH was highest for Native North Americans: NROH was strongly inversely correlated with the large and variable genomic estimates of European admixture. The reduction in genome wide homozygosity in mixed race individuals will reduce their risk for diseases with a recessive genetic component.Concurrent Sessions31",2011
 m icrosatellite choice and Y chromosome variation: attempting to select the best st Rs to date human Y chromosome lineages,C06.6,"G. B. J. Busby , C. Capelli","University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","Recently the debate on the origins of the major European Y chromosome haplogroup R M269 has reignited, and opinion has moved away from Paleolithic origins to the notion of a younger Neolithic spread of these chromosomes from the Near East. We investigate the young, STR based Time to the Most Recent Common Ancestor estimates  proposed so far for R M269 related lineages and find evidence for an appreciable effect of microsatellite choice on age estimates. We further expand our analysis to include a worldwide dataset of over 60 STRs which differ in their molecular attributes. This analysis shows that by taking into account the intrinsic molecular characteristics of Y chromosome STRs, one can arrive at a more reliable estimate for the age of Y chromosome lineages. Subsequently, we suggest that most STR based Y chromosome dates are likely to be underestimates due to the molecular characteristics of the markers commonly used,  such as their mutation rate and the range of potential alleles that STR can take, which potentially leads to a loss of time linearity. As a consequence, we update the STR based age of important nodes in the Y chromosome tree, showing that credible estimates for the age of lineages can be made once these STR characteristics are taken into consideration. Finally we show that the STRs that are most commonly used to explore deep ancestry are not able to uncover ancient relationships, and we propose a set of STRs that should be used in these cases.",2011

The mutation level of transmitted heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations varies significantly between embryos due to a segregational bottleneck. Prenatal (PND) or pre implantation genetic  diagnosis (PGD) of mtDNA disorders is complicated by the inability to accurately predict the threshold of clinical expression for most heteroplasmic mtDNA mutations. Here we tried to define a minimal mutant level below which the chance for an embryo of being affected is acceptably low, irrespective of the exact mtDNA point mutation. A systematic review was performed on muscle mutant levels of 159 different heteroplasmic mtDNA point mutations derived from 327 unrelated patients or pedigrees, excluding three overrepresented mtDNA mutations. We generated a distribution of mutation levels of  all affected individuals (n,195) and their unaffected maternal relatives (n,19) from 137 pedigrees with a familial mtDNA mutation, and predicted the risk of being affected given a varying mutant level. This prediction required an assumption of overall prevalence of affected status in familial pedigrees. For familial mutations, little difference in mean muscle mutant level was observed between probands and affected maternal relatives and between affected individuals with a tRNA versus protein coding mutation. The overall prevalence of affected status in familial pedigrees was estimated as 0.477. A 95% or higher chance of being unaffected was associated with a muscle mutant level of 18% or less.

We have explored the possibility for multiplex massively parallel sequencing to detect such fetal chromosomal aneuploidies.From three women, carrying euploid fetuses (46,XY [N,1], 46,XX  [N,2]) blood samples were drawn prior to invasive procedures and from five women, carrying aneuploid fetuses (47,XX,+21; 47,XY,+21; 47,XXX; 47,XX,+13; 47,XY,+18) blood samples were drawn after invasive procedures. Samples were taken at various gestational ages, ranging from 12 +4 to 19+6. DNA was isolated from 3.5 8 mL of plasma  using either a QIAamp DSP Mini Blood Kit or a QIAamp Circulating  Nucleic Acid Kit. Sequencing libraries were prepared individually and DNA was multiplexed after ligation of an unique sequencing barcode. Sequencing was performed on a SOLiD TM 4 system. Next, the  sequence reads were mapped to the human reference genome (hg19) and quantified according to their genomic location. Subsequently, Î¶ scores per chromosome were calculated as described elsewhere. Thresholds for aneuploidy were set at Î¶>+3.0 and Î¶< 3.0 for over  or  under representation, respectively, of a chromosome.All aneuploidies yielded Î¶ scores >3.0 for the aberrant chromosomes (range +3.38 to +9.43), whereas all other chromosomes were detected as normal (range  2.27 to +2.31). Our data thus indicate that full blown fetal aneuploidies can be reliably detected in maternal plasma using a multiplex massively parallel sequencing approach. Further improvements in the rate of multiplexing samples to reduce costs and increase efficiency are currently under investigation.Concurrent Sessions32",2011

Karyotyping has remained the gold standard for the detection of  numerical and structural chromosome rearrangements for prenatal genetic diagnosis. Molecular karyotyping by array CGH is now a widely used technique for postnatal genetic analysis providing genome wide detection of genomic imbalances at a resolution far superior  to conventional karyotyping. The use of array CGH is an attractive alternative in the prenatal diagnostic setting, given the ability to overcome the resolution & time limitations of conventional karyotyping or the locus specific limitations of targeted analyses such as FISH & MLPA.We have undertaken a prospective study into the use of a high resolution array for the prenatal diagnosis of pregnancies where fetal abnormalities were detected on ultrasound scan. Over 100 fetal samples have been analysed from amniotic fluid and chorionic villi,  using both direct and cultured material. Since UZ Leuven is a specialist referral centre for fetuses with isolated congenital diaphragmatic hernia (CDH), a subset of our referrals are from this cohort.We show that array CGH detects a number of causal submicroscopic imbalances in fetuses with ultrasound anomalies. Of particular interest, our results allow us to refine the minimal critical region associated with CDH on chromosome 15q26 to a single gene, NR2F2 (COUP TFII). We demonstrate an average reporting time of 8 days for uncultured material.

Of 34 cases with a known abnormal karyotype, 26 (75%) had a normal aCGH. This enabled us to reassure the families and the pregnancies were continued. The remaining 8 (25%) showed an abnormal aCGH, confirming the chromosomes were unbalanced, and were terminated. Of 397 cases with a normal karyotype, 7 had an abnormal aCGH and after genetic counseling they were terminated. Overall, new clinically relevant results were detected by aCGH in 41 cases, providing additional information for prenatal genetic counseling and risk assessment. c onclusion: Our results suggest that prenatal aCGH  should be offered particularly in cases with abnormal U/S (detection rate was 1:46).

These  spontaneous germ line mutations can have serious phenotypic consequences when affecting functionally relevant bases in the genome. In fact, their occurrence may explain why diseases with a severely reduced fecundity remain frequent in the human population,  especially when the mutational target is large and comprised of many genes. This would explain a major paradox in the evolutionary genetic theory of cognitive disorders.In this presentation, we will first describe our recent work on using a family based exome sequencing approach to test this de novo mutation hypothesis in 10 patients with unexplained mental retardation 1.  Unique non synonymous mutations were identified and validated in  nine genes. Six of these, identified in different patients, were likely pathogenic based on gene function, evolutionary conservation and mutation impact. These findings provided a strong experimental  support for a de novo paradigm for mental retardation.The clinical relevance and ultimate proof for disease causality of these novel genes lies in the identification of de novo mutations in additional  patients of similar phenotype. As such, we are currently screening ~1,200 patients with unexplained mental retardation for mutations in YY1, representing one of these newly identified genes. Moreover,  we are extending our family based exome sequencing approach to 100 patients to establish the diagnostic yield for de novo mutations in patients with unexplained mental retardation. 1Vissers et al.

Functional considerations and empirical data from animal models  suggest that most gene defects are inherited as recessive traits. However, research into recessive disorders has lagged behind because in Western societies with their small size families, most affected patients are isolated cases. Intellectual disability (ID) is a  particularly important problem of health care world wide, and most severe forms have a genetic etiology. Autosomal recessive forms of ID (ARID) are thought to be more frequent than X linked ones, particularly in developing countries where parental consanguinity is common and the incidence of ID is significantly elevated.Here we report on the first systematic attempt to shed more light on the molecular causes of ARID. By performing homozygosity mapping, exon enrichment and next generation sequencing (NGS), we have identified apparently causative gene defects in 72 out of 130 consanguineous  families from Iran and elsewhere. In 26 families, causative changes were found in previously described disease genes. In three of these genes, i.e. AHI1, SRD5A3 and PRKCG, allelic mutations were found in more than one family. In 46 families, single apparently causative mutations were detected in genes not hitherto implicated in ID or related disorders such as autism, epilepsy or schizophrenia. Many of these genes are involved in (the regulation of) transcription and translation or other regulatory pathways known to be important for brain function, while others interact directly with known ID genes. Thus, the systematic identification of novel ID genes is also a potent strategy to unravel the pathways and pathogenetic mechanisms underlying cognitive disorders.",2011

Proof of concept has been  obtained in cultured cells and the mdx mouse model and this approach is currently tested in clinical trials by Prosensa/GSK (GSK2402968 and PRO044) and AVI Biopharma (AVI 4658).The 2â O methyl phosphorothioate (2OMePS) chemistry used in the Prosensa/GSK trials has favorable pharmacokinetic properties, as it binds serum proteins, preventing clearance by the kidney and increasing serum half life. Uptake by healthy muscle is low, but is up to 10 fold higher in dystrophic muscle in animal models.Here, we tested the safety and efficacy of high dose (200 mg/kg/week)  AON treatment for up to 6 months in mouse models with varying levels of severity: mdx mice (mild phenotype) and mdx mice with one utrophin allele (mdx +/ ; intermediate phenotype). This was well tolerated. Notably, in the more severely affected mdx +/  mice the therapeutic effect was larger: exon skipping and dystrophin levels were higher, the creatine kinase levels were more decreased and rotarod running time was more increased. Preliminary results suggest that AON levels in the muscles of the more severely dystrophic mdx +/  are higher than in those in mdx mice, confirming the hypothesis that AON uptake is aided by the disease pathology.These results are encouraging for long term trials in patients, recently initiated by Prosensa Therapeutics/GSK.",2011

The causative gene, CHD7 , was identified in 2004 and is a large gene  comprising 37 coding exons. Not surprisingly, patients with a CHD7   mutation have a more variable phenotype than patients diagnosed with CHARGE syndrome based on the currently used clinical criteria.  This raises the question whether CHARGE syndrome is a clinical or molecular diagnosis and in which patients CHD7  analysis should be  done.We explored the phenotypic spectrum of our cohort of 280 patients with a CHD7 mutation. The phenotype was highly variable, but external ear  anomalies, cranial nerve dysfunction, semicircular canal hypoplasia and psychomotor delay were almost always present. In comparison with clinically diagnosed CHARGE patients cleft lip and/or palate and genital hypoplasia occurred more frequently and congenital heart  defects less frequently in patients with a CHD7 mutation. In 5 10% of patients with typical CHARGE syndrome no CHD7  mutation could  be identified. In these patients CHARGE syndrome remains a clinical diagnosis. In contrast, 14 17% of the patients with a CHD7  mutation  do not fulfil the clinical criteria for CHARGE syndrome and in these patients CHD7  analysis can be helpful to establish the diagnosis.  Confirming the diagnosis is important for the clinical surveillance of the patients. Moreover, finding a CHD7  mutation enables counselling of  recurrence risk and reproductive options.We propose a guideline for CHD7  analysis and indicate in which  patients imaging of the semicircular canals is helpful.

It is characterized  by degeneration of dopaminergic neurons in the nigrostriatal pathway and  other monoaminergic cell groups in the brainstem leading to bradykinesia,  resting tremor, muscular rigidity, and postural instability as well as non motor  symptoms. To identify rare causal variants in late onset Parkinsonâs disease  (PD), we investigated a family from Austria with 16 affected individuals by  exome sequencing. We found a missense mutation, D620N, in the retromer  protein VPS35 in all seven affected family members that are alive. By screening  additional PD cases, we saw the same variant co segregating with the disease  in an autosomal dominant mode with high penetrance in two further families with  five and ten affected members, respectively. Genotyping showed that the shared  haplotype extends across 65 kilobases around VPS35. Screening the entire  VPS35 coding sequence in additional 860 cases and 1014 controls revealed six  further non synonymous missense variants. Three were only present in cases,  two only present in controls, and one present in cases and controls. D620N and  a further variant detected in a PD case, R524W, were predicted to be damaging  by sequence based and molecular dynamics analysis. VPS35 is a component of  the retromer complex which mediates retrograde transport between endosomes  and the trans Golgi network and which has recently been described to be  involved in Alzheimerâs disease.  37 (p,2.2Ã10 8).

The tests are based on score statistics which require less numerical optimization than conventional likelihood ratio test.Results: We find many novel and known variants with allelefrequency down to 1% that associate with fasting plasma glucose levels at the significance level of<10 3. However, we were not able to replicate any of the top 20 variants by direct genotyping in independent study populations of 9,893 individuals.Conclusion: Low coverage exome sequencing driven association studies yield many novel low frequency and common variants; however; it seems that there are no single low frequency variants in the examined exome with a large effect on the fasting plasma glucose levels on its own, suggesting the need for testing various burden tests to evaluate the cumulative impact of multiple variants within the same  locus.",2011

Using a genome wide SNP homozygosity mapping strategy we identified a homozygous donor splice site mutation in  CEP152  cosegregation with the disease in six Turkish families. Inde  pendently, we identified CEP152  as causative gene in an additional  Seckel patient born to consanguineous parents using an exome se quencing strategy. Furthermore, additional screening identified two other patients carrying compound heterozygous mutations in CEP152 .  CEP152  encodes a 1654 amino acid protein that was originally iden   tified in a proteomic screen of human centrosomes. We could show that CEP152 deficient fibroblasts show severe defects in mitosis and spindle organization resulting in cells with multiple centrosoms and  abnormal nuclei pattern. In addition, Seckel cells showed an overall increased sensitivity to oxidative stress and responded with increa   sed apoptosis. Furthermore, DNA damage response was impaired in cells with mutated CEP152 confirming a functional link between centrosomal function and DNA repair responses. We could show that impaired CEP152 function leads to genomic instability via increased H2AX phosphorylation due to enhanced activation of ATM signaling pathways. These findings provide evidence for an important role of CEP152 in DNA damage response and genome maintenance.   In summary, we identified the centrosomal protein CEP152 as a novel protein involved in the maintenance of genomic integrity and in the abi lity to respond to DNA damage, and show that that recessive loss of function mutations in CEP152  can cause Seckel syndrome in humans.",2011

Defects of ciliogenesis have been implicated in a wide range of human  phenotypes and play a crucial role in different signal transduction pathways and cell cycle coordination. We thoroughly delineated the clinical, radiographic, and histological phenotype of the autosomal recessive short rib polydactyly syndrome Majewski type. Parametric  multipoint linkage and haplotype structure analysis confirmed a linked interval with a maximum LOD score of 2.95 (17.36 Mb / 18.65 cM) on chromosome 4 encompassing 38 genes. Assuming an overlap of the phenotypic spectrum of our patients with other ciliopathies, we used known genes of the cilia proteome database and compared them with the genes in our candidate interval. The NIMA related kinase 1 (NEK1) gene was highlighted as homozygous mutant mice show polycystic kidney disease, craniofacial anomalies, and growth reduction.Sequencing of NEK1 identified a homozygous nonsense and a Concurrent Sessions38 homozygous splice site mutation in the affected persons of two  consanguineous families as the underlying cause. NEK1 encodes a serine/threonine kinase with proposed function in DNA double strand repair, neuronal development, and coordination of cell cycle associated ciliogenesis. With immunofluorescence analyses we confirmed that  the absence of functional NEK1 significantly decreases the number of ciliated fibroblasts and alters the structural morphology of the primary cilium in vivo as well. Transmission electron microscopy indicated a defect in progression from stage I after vesicular accumulation of ciliogenesis to stage II and subsequent failure of axoneme growth. We further substantiate a proposed digenic diallelic inheritance of ciliopathies by identification of heterozygous mutations in NEK1 and  DYNC2H1  in a further non consanguineous family.",2011

As 85% of all disease causing mutations are within coding exons, the recent application of massive parallel sequencing with exon capture has shown the efficacy of this technique in the rapid identification of  mutations in Mendelian disorders. Herein, the genetic basis of a novel syndrome was sought in a non consanguineous kindred consisting of 6 offspring where 4 exhibited mid gestation intrauterine death. Dysmorphic features included cleft palate, high nasal bridge, short columella, micrognathia, wide mouth and low set ears. Systemic features included renal hypoplasia, duodenal atresia and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia with hydrocephalus, pre and post axial polydactyly consistent with a predicted ciliopathy. Linked regions were identified on 1p31.1, 4q,19p13.3 and 20q13.13 using high density SNP arrays  (Affymetrix 250k/sty and Illumina 550K). As the identified regions were large, whole exome capture (Nimblegen EZ Exome SR, v1) followed by massively parallel sequencing (Illumina GAIIx) was employed. A novel compound heterozygous loss of function mutation involving an essential splice site and a truncating change were found in an annotated gene which segregated with affected family members. Subcellular localization revealed a nuclear, centrosomal and basal body localization for this protein. Gene knockdown in zebrafish results in a ciliopathic phenotype consisting of curved body axis, U shaped somites, microcrania, microphthalmia, cardiac oedema and renal cysts. Whole exome sequencing has identified compound heterozygous mutations in a new ciliopathy gene and supports its role in gene identification in rare and novel syndromes.",2011

We performed SNP array analysis and positional candidate gene sequence analysis in two siblings with Sensenbrenner syndrome of a consanguineous Moroccan family. Both  patients suffered from nephronophthisis, and the youngest sibling had end stage renal disease since the age of 3 years. We identified a homozygous mutation in the initiation codon of C14ORF179 in both  siblings. C14ORF179 encodes IFT43, a subunit of the intraflagellar  transport complex A (IFT A) machinery of primary cilia. We show that the mutation disrupts translation; due to the mutation translation starts at an ATG in exon 2 instead of at the canonical initiation translation codon in exon 1. This results in a shortened N terminally truncated IFT43 protein. The IFT A protein complex (together with the dynein  motor) drives retrograde axonemal transport in the cilium. We show that in fibroblasts of one of the affected siblings, disruption of IFT43 affects this transport from the tip of the cilium to its base. In fibroblasts of the patient with mutated C14ORF179, we found that IFT B complex  proteins aberrantly accumulate in the ciliary tips. Interestingly, we observed the same defect in fibroblasts from a Sensenbrenner syndrome patient with mutations in WDR35/IFT121, encoding another IFT A subunit.

We hypothesised that  rare copy number variants (CNVs) could be involved in ADEOAD families without mutations in known genes. Using high resolution array CGH, we assessed the presence of rare copy number variants (CNVs) in two highly selected disease groups, 21 unrelated ADEOAD cases without alteration on APP, PSEN1 and PSEN2 genes and 12 isolated Alzheimer disease (AD) cases with age of onset before 55 years. This analysis revealed the presence of 7 singleton CNVs (4 in ADEOAD and 3 in isolated cases) not present in 1078 controls, thus  yielding a nominal significance for association of every CNV with AD of p,0.019 in the ADEOAD group and p,0.011 in the isolated cases group, respectively. Strikingly, 4/7 rearrangements target genes encoded proteins that are tightly related to Amyloid Î² (AÎ²) peptide metabolism or signalling.

Consequently, understanding the genetic basis of seizure disorders will provide novel insights into the underlying pathophysiology and result in novel diagnostic and therapeutic avenues.

The remaining genes on the panel represent putative candidate genes for epileptic disorders. Sequencing is performed on the SOLiD 4 platform. We developed a diagnostic pipeline to (i) identify regions that are underrepresented with reads, (ii) identify potentially pathogenic SNVs, (iii) identify small insertions and  deletions and (iv) identify larger indels including whole exon deletions and duplications.

Kalscheuer","Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany","The polyglutamine binding protein 1 (PQBP1) gene plays an important  role in X linked intellectual disability (XLID). To date, about 25 families with a mutation in this gene have been identified. Common clinical features include intellectual disability, microcephaly, and short stature. Most of the mutations cause frameshifts, which result in premature  stop codons. Interestingly the mutant mRNA is only partially degraded Concurrent Sessions40 via nonsense mediated mRNA decay and truncated protein exists  (Musante et al., 2010).To unravel the pathomechanism of the disease, we have searched for novel PQBP1 interactors. We have found several splicing factors, belonging to the SR protein family, which are important regulators of  alternative splicing. One of the newly found PQBP1 interactors, SRp20, is highly expressed in brain. In RNA protein immunoprecipitations, we could show that, in addition to SRp20 protein, the PQBP1 protein complex contains SRp20 mRNA. As other SR proteins, SRp20 is able to modulate its own protein level, by regulating alternative splicing of its RNA. To test whether PQBP1 is involved in this feedback mechanism, we have knocked down PQBP1 and overexpressed a minigene containing the alternatively spliced exon of SRp20. RT PCR experiments indicated that knock down of PQBP1 significantly  increased skipping of the alternatively spliced exon. Real time RT PCR on endogenous SRp20 mRNA confirmed these results. Interestingly, rescue experiments performed with mutant PQBP1 constructs revealed deficient splicing activity. Confirmation of several PQBP1 regulated target RNAs are in progress. Taken together, we provide the first evidence that the XLID PQBP1 protein plays a key role in nuclear RNA metabolism.",2011

The  mitochondrial respiratory chain complexes were severely disturbed in the patientâs heart and to a lesser extent in the skeletal muscle and brain. Since pathogenic mitochondrial DNA mutations were excluded as the cause of disease, we sequenced the whole exome of the patient to reveal the underlying nuclear disease gene. Over 65,000 SNPs were identified and filtered using our on site pipeline. The data analysis led to a single gene encoding a novel mitochondrial protein, which was found to contain a homozygous missense mutation. Compound heterozygous mutations in the same gene were identified in a second  family, with two affected children, who died of antenatal/neonatal hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. Protein modeling predicted different functional consequences of the two mutations for the enzyme activity, offering an explanation for the neonatal vs infantile disease onset in the patients. Our example shows that disease mutations of single patients can be identified by whole exome sequencing. Consequently, the genetic background of pediatric mitochondrial cardiomyopathies is now starting to unravel.

There are currently three human diseases known to  be caused by mutations in proteins involved in GPI synthesis. We report on a hitherto undescribed GPI deficiency related disorder. This autosomal recessive syndrome is characterised by dysmorphic features and multiple congenital anomalies together with severe  neurological impairment, chorea and seizures leading to early death.Methods. Homozygosity mapping was performed using Affymetrix  Human Mapping 250k NspI arrays. Sequencing of all coding exons of the candidate genes was performed with primer sets designed using the Primer3 program. Fluorescence Activated Cell Sorting was performed using conjugated antibody to CD59. Staining, acquisition  and analysis was performed on a FACSCalibur flow cytometer.Results. We mapped the disease locus to 18q21.32 18q22.1 and identified the disease causing mutation, c.2126G>A (p.Arg709Gln), in PIGN, which encodes glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) ethanolamine phosphate transferase 1, a protein involved in GPI anchor biosynthesis. Arginine at the position 709 is a highly evolutionarily conserved residue located in the PigN domain. The expression of GPI linked protein CD59 on fibroblasts from patients as compared to that in a control individual showed a ten fold reduction in expression, confirming the  pathogenic consequences of the mutation on GPI dependent protein expression. Conclusions. The abundant expression of PIGN in various  tissues is compatible with the diverse phenotypic features observed in the patients and with the involvement of multiple body systems. The presence of developmental delay, hypotonia and epilepsy combined with multiple congenital anomalies, especially ano rectal anomalies, should lead a clinician to suspect a GPI deficiency related disorder .",2011

Recent reports suggested the existence of hotspots favouring the appearance of CNVs in germline and somatic tissues, however the mutation rate of these variants remains largely unspecified. Rates of  3.6x10 3 to 1.1x10 2 have been estimated from 10 CNVs of 14 sub populations of the C57BL/6J strain. Similarly, human parent offspring trios allowed estimating a rate of 3x10 2 for a broader CNV size range. To assess how CNV alleles are transmitted from one generation to the next and estimate their mutation rate, we setup a large brother sister mating of C57BL/6J mice over nine generations, for a total of 692 mice. We used high resolution CGH arrays (2.1M features, mean probe spacing 1.2kb) to detect CNVs in 45 representative individuals from this cohort. We combined three independent detection methods,  a Bayesian HMM, GADA and Nexus5.1, to identify 485 CNV regions (CNVRs) covering 24Mb (1%) of the mouse genome. We selected 185 high confidence CNVRs and determined their absolute copy number with nanoString nCounter in the complete pedigree. To infer CNV alleles from absolute copy number for each individual, we devised a semi automated strategy relying on trio information. We followed the inheritance of existing CNVs and identified de novo CNVs, some of which appeared multiple times independently in different branches of the pedigree. This allowed calculating a genome wide mutation rate and ascertain general or gender specific segregation bias of a large number of CNVs in a large pedigree.",2011

We report the development of a microarray based technology coupled with  linear DNA amplification, termed translocation CGH (tCGH), that can identify and characterize balanced translocations in addition to CNAs. With this technology, we have developed tCGH assays for eight different hematologic disorders that simultaneously test for the presence of multiple, clinically relevant balanced translocations associated with each disease. Our data demonstrate the utility of the assay with the detection of >20 different balanced translocations in a variety of disease specimens. The ability of this technology to detect Concurrent Sessions41 clinically relevant balanced translocations, to identify specific partner  chromosomes precisely, to delineate the molecular breakpoints within the single genes involved and to reveal submicroscopic CNAs at these breakpoints provides distinct advantages over the current standard of chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis. In  addition, this technology is of value when cytogenetics or FISH fails,  is ambiguous, or is discordant. The novel findings revealed by tCGH will have a profound impact on future algorithms used in the diagnosis, prognosis and treatment of individuals with hematologic and other malignancies.",2011

In 0.4   1% of patients with MR/MCA a mosaic pattern is detected (Hoang et al, 2010). It has been reported that array CGH is able to detect up to 5% mosaicism (Conlin et al, 2010). However, until now,  detection of mosaicism is predominantly based on visual inspection of the graphical representation of the array results.We developed a statistical decision procedure to detect mosaic genotypes. Input parameters are the assumed a priori probability, e.g. the chance of 0.0001% that at a certain chromosomal region mosaicism is present, the variability of probe intensities, the desired area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and the mean deviation of a specific interval. The output is the minimal number of adjacent probes needed for a significant  deviation of the interval from the mean array intensity. For practical use we constructed tables. If an observed number of probes in an interval with a known average ratio surpass the threshold number of probes needed for the specific interval ratio given in the table, mosaicism is a reasonable explanation and confirmation studies should be performed.We aim to evaluate this decision procedure in a retrospective approach using 2000 patients with MR/MCA including 14 confirmed mosaics detected by visual inspection of the graph. The results of this retrospective study will be presented as well as a practical guideline for the use of the table in daily practice.",2011

Neri","Institute of Medical Genetics, UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Roma, Italy","During routinary array CGH analysis applied to the diagnosis of  intellectual disability, private CNVs inherited from an apparently healthy parent represent an emerging category of chromosome imbalances with no clear cut significance. It was recently suggested that rare inherited CNVs have to be considered benign variants. We analyzed by a CGH a total of 756 patients with intellectual disability usually associated with multiple phenotypical anomalies. Chromosomes imbalances were detected in 230 of them (30%). We classified the observed CNVs in the following categories: 1) clearly pathogenic, 132/756 (17.5 %); 2) likely benign: 58/756 (7.7 %); 3) with uncertain significance: 40/756 (5.3 %). This last category included private CNVs inherited from an apparently healthy parent, but not reported in Database of Genomic Variants. Each private inherited CNV was evaluated for gene content, size and nature of the rearrangement  (deletion vs duplication), parental origin and the associated clinical phenotype. New and more detailed information about clinical history of the family were collected in each case. To speculate whether the observed CNV could act as pathogenic factor in intellectual disability, we looked at the following mechanisms: 1) mosaic status in unaffected parents (FISH on metaphase chromosomes or interphase nuclei) 2) reduced expressivity; 3) imprinting effects; 4) uncoverage of a recessive allele.A total of 18 of 40 private inherited CNVs (44%), resulted to have pathogenic relevance.

Cohen syndrome (CS) is a rare autosomal recessive inherited disorder that results from mutations of the VPS13B gene. It has  been recently showed that copy number variation (CNVs) at VPS13B  locus could result in CS when present in a compound heterozygous state associated to a point mutation or in a homozygous state. We  screened for the VPS13B gene 54 patients from 46 families with CS  and identified at least one mutation in 12 families, 6 of which had mutations in compound heterozygous state, 1 in a homozygous state and 5 had only one mutation. 244K array CGH was performed in 2 groups, group 1 including the 5 families with one mutation and group 2 including families with no mutation but fulfilling the Chandler and Kolehmainenâs criteria, to seek to identify a large intragenic event. We identified a CNV in 3/5 families from group 1 and in 1/9 families from group 2. A targeted 8x15K array CGH was used in the 2 groups to look  for a smaller intragenic rearrangement not detected by the 244K array CGH but did not reveal any additional rearrangement. When pooling the different series, we found that a CNV could be detected in 33% of families with CS and showed that all of them could be detected by 244K array CGH. These results confirm that CNVs are a major cause of CS and allowed us to suggest that non targeted 244K array CGH could be easily used as an initial screening method for the molecular diagnosis of CS.",2011

This paper is based on a systematic literature review of ethical reflections on  the issue of incidental findings, specifically those arising from whole genome and whole exome sequencing in clinical and research genetics. A number of electronic databases were searched using the term âincidental findingsâ and variations of (bio)ethics, (bio )medical and research, and 25 articles were ultimately included for systematic review as being detailed ethical reflections on incidental findings in general or incidental findings in clinical and research genetics in particular. The ethical issues raised can be divided into two main clusters. One cluster revolves around the incidental findings  themselves. This cluster includes ongoing debate on how to classify incidental findings, a classification that determines whether and how disclosure to the patient or research participant will proceed. A second cluster revolves around the relationships between the various parties involved: professionals, patients or research participants, their families, the wider society, and overseeing bodies such as Institutional Review Boards. Where the emphasis is placed in each relationship has a bearing on the disclosure process, and there is a notable tension between research and clinical practice. We conclude that, cutting edge technologies notwithstanding, personal relationships between medical professionals and patients or research participants are key in realising the full promise of whole genome and exome sequencing.",2011

The questionnaire was sent to  1,385 members (>20 years). A similar panel was used in 2002.Results: In 2010 and 2002, the response was 70% (978) and 63%  (817), respectively. More respondents (64%) now believe that knowledge about the genetic background of disease will help people to live longer as compared to 2002 (43%).

In 2004 the UK NICE guidelines for familial breast cancer on women unaffected with the disease determined that âHealth  Care Professionals should not actively seek to identify women with a family history of breast cancerâ. Since 2004 a wealth of evidence on the efficacy of MRI screening and risk reducing surgery has emerged including the first real impact on survival. m ethods: A total of 1197 GPs and 1223 surgeons completed a  questionnaire on risk communication and management of familial  breast cancer in four EU countries (UK, France, the Netherlands and Germany).

All probands were subjected to biochemical and molecular collagen analysis. In 100/211 (47%) probands a causal COL3A1 mutation was identified. Evaluation of this COL3A1 mutation positive group revealed that 57% of the probands fulfilled the Geneclinics criteria.

However, little is known about the âwritersâ of the neuronal epigenome and how they lay down the basis for proper cognition. Here, we have dissected the neuronal function of the  Drosophila  euchromatin histone methyltransferase (EHMT), a member  of a conserved protein family that methylates histone 3 at lysine 9 (H3K9). We identify EHMT as a regulator of peripheral dendrite development, larval locomotor behavior, non associative learning and courtship memory. The requirement for EHMT in memory was mapped to a subset of neurons in the adult brain and memory was restored by EHMT re expression during adulthood, indicating that cognitive defects are reversible in EHMT mutants. To uncover the underlying molecular mechanisms, we generated genome wide H3K9 dimethylation profiles  using ChIP seq technology. Loss of H3K9 dimethylation in EHMT mutants occurs at 5% of the euchromatic genome and is enriched at the 5â and 3â ends of distinct classes of genes that control neuronal and behavioural processes that are corrupted in EHMT mutants. This study identifies Drosophila EHMT as a key regulator of cognition that  orchestrates an epigenetic program featuring classic learning and memory genes. Our findings are relevant to the pathophysiological mechanisms underlying Kleefstra Syndrome, a severe form of intellectual disability caused by mutations in human EHMT1, and  have potential therapeutic implications. Our work thus provides novel insights into the epigenetic control of cognition in health and disease.",2011

In this study we now resolved the underlying gene defect of MRT 5 and report three deleterious mutations in NSUN2 . This gene encodes a  methyltransferase, which catalyzes the intron dependent formation  of 5 methylcytosine at C34 of tRNA leu(CAA). Two of the observed changes were nonsense mutations (p.Q227X and p.Q372X), which Concurrent Sessions44 cause a complete loss of NSUN2  transcripts in the patients. In the third  family we found an intronic exchange of an adenosine for a guanine  11 nucleotides upstream of exon 6. This change causes exon 6 to be skipped during splicing and results in the loss of the main transcript. Hence all mutations lead to a loss of NSUN2 protein function in  homozygous mutation carriers and thus in all likelihood cause the patient phenotype. In order to gain further evidence for an involvement of NSUN2 in cognitive functions, we studied fruit fly mutants that lack the NSUN2 ortholog. These experiments revealed a marked learning impairment in mutant flies, which clearly underscores the relevance of NSUN2 in higher brain functions.Moreover we present mutation screening results for another hot spot locus (MRT11) in three Iranian families with several NS ARID patients overlapping on Chr19q13.2 q13.31. Mutation screening by  hybridization based enrichment of the exonic regions of all genes from the respective intervals and subsequent next generation sequencing revealed two different single nucleotide changes in ZNF526. Mutations in other genes were not observed.ZNF526 encodes a brain expressed C2H2 zinc finger protein with DNA binding properties that is thought to be involved in gene regulation. Each mutation affects a functional domain of ZNF526 and both alter the protein conformation, causing a putative functional impairment as suggested by in silico  protein  modelling. A decrease in DNA affinity was confirmed by CHIP seq and array based gene expression studies showed specific changes in the expression patterns of patient lymphoblastoid cells, which could be recapitulated in ZNF526 deficient neuroblastoma cells. Functional annotation showed significant enrichment of the deregulated genes  in pathways that play a role in protein synthesis, mitochondrial dysfunction, energy metabolism and gene regulation. Several zinc finger proteins were found to be involved in the pathogenesis of X linked ID, but ZNF526 is the first to be implicated in NS ARID. Our results show that both NSUN2  and ZNF526 belong to the still  few genes known to carry NS ID causing mutations in independent families, which suggests that defects in either gene belong to the more common causes of NS ARMR, at least in the Iranian population.",2011

Using a combination of autozygosity mapping combined to Sanger sequencing of candidate gene or identity by descent filtering of exome sequence data, we  identified three mutations in the genes encoding adaptor protein complex 4 subunits : a nonsense mutation within the AP4S1 gene (c.124C>T;p.R42X), a frameshift mutation within the AP4B1 gene (c.487 488insTAT;p.E163X) and a splice mutation within the AP4E1 gene (g.542+1_542+4delGTAA). All affected patients presented with severe ID, normal head circumference or mild microcephaly, hypotonia that progressed to spastic paraplegia with hyperreflexia and hypertonia, deformities of feet, and little muscle mass of the lower extremities. Finally, patients show an extreme shy and amicable character with  stereotypic laughter.Adaptor complexes (AP1 4) are evolutionarily conserved heterotetrameric complexes that mediate different types of vesicle formation and the selection of cargo molecules for inclusion into these vesicles.

Although it is known that fragile sites of the rare, folate sensitive type occur more frequently in cohorts of patients with cognitive disorders, few have been characterized at the molecular level. We studied three families with FRA2A expression. The probands  were characterized by slow early motor and language development and learning disability. As the molecular basis of this fragile site we identified an elongated polymorphic CGG repeat in the 5â region of AFF3. This gene is a member of the family of nuclear transcription factors including AF4, AF5q31 and FMR2, involved in regulation of gene expression, cell expansion, embryonic development and fulfill a role in the central nervous system. Interestingly, AFF3 is a paralog of FMR2, causative of FRAXE non syndromic mental retardation. Loss of expression of FMR2 occurs through dynamic repeat expansion of a  CGG repeat in the 5â untranslated region of the gene and subsequent hypermethylation of the promoter. This mechanism was first described in the fragile X syndrome. Expansion of the AFF3 associated repeat was shown in the probands of the 3 families and in five family members using Southern blot analysis. By cSNP analysis we could confirm that methylation of the promoter region silences transcription of the AFF3gene. All patients but not all parents were methylated. In conclusion we collected compelling evidence that transcriptional silencing of the AFF3 gene could play a role in the cognitive impairment present in all patients.",2011

Some associated features are common, including intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia and facial dysmorphism.We detected a 2.3Mb de novo deletion in chr.6q25 with molecular karyotyping in an infant with ID, facial dysmorphism, strabismus and  hyperopy.This deletion lies within previously reported regions and encompasses only 5 known genes. We hypothesized that haploinsufficiency for one of these may impair normal development. To identify the phenocritical gene we screened these five positional candidates for point mutations in 331 patients with moderate to severe ID.In one of these genes, ARID1B, highly expressed in brain and encoding a subunit of the mammalian SWI/SNF complexes important for different neuronal developmental programs, we found four de novo  sequence alterations. One 11bp deletion resulting in a premature stop codon, which shortens the protein by 58AA, a stop mutation in exon 16 and an in frame 3bp deletion. We thus identified a sequence alteration in ARID1B in nearly 1% of patients with unexplained intellectual disability. Additionally, CNV screening in 1,986 patients with intellectual disability revealed a validated de novo duplication of three exons  resulting in a frame shift. All five patients display a pronounced clinical overlap like ID, especially regarding expressive speech and similar facial phenotype.Moreover, recently the disruption of ARID1B was also reported in a translocation patient with ID, supporting our hypothesis of ARID1B mutation as a frequent cause of ID.This study is part of the German Mental Retardation Network (www. german mrnet.de).Concurrent Sessions45",2011

Microdeletions and/or duplications restricted to chromosomal region 1p21.3 have rarely been reported before. Several ID syndromes have been linked to  the microRNA (miRNA) pathway, but there are no previous reports of genome wide array studies that have led to the identification of miRNAs associated with ID.Methods: We characterized the clinical and molecular features of three sibs and 2 non related patients with overlapping 1p21.3 deletions, detected by genome wide array analysis. The deletions in the two unrelated patients were de novo. We determined the shortest region of  overlap (SRO) to identify candidates for the phenotype.Results: Clinical features comprised mild ID and autism spectrum  disorder. The SRO was 1.22 Mb and included one annotated gene, DPYD (dihydropyrimidine dehydrogenase deficiency), which was unlikely to cause the phenotype, since no associated metabolic defect was detected. Interestingly, the SRO also comprised microRNA 137 (miR 137), which was shown to be under epigenetic regulation of MeCP2 and involved in adult neurogenesis in previous studies in  mice. Our patients had a significantly altered expression of miR 137 and downstream targets. Furthermore, in mouse synaptosomes we  found significant enrichment of miR 137 at the synapse as assessed by qRT PCR, suggesting a role for miR 137 as a modulator of local translation at the synapse.Conclusion: We propose that these patients represent a novel  microdeletion syndrome that is caused by haploinsufficiency of miR  137.",2011

While the nuclear organisation of chromosomes affects gene function, relatively little is known about the role of nuclear bodies in the organization of chromosomal regions. The nucleolus is the best studied subnuclear structure and forms around the ribosomal RNA  repeat gene clusters on the acrocentric chromosomes. In addition to rDNA, other chromatin sequences also surround the nucleolar surface and may even loop into the nucleolus. These additional nucleolar associated regions have not been characterized.We present here a whole genome, high resolution analysis of chromatin endogenously associated with a subnuclear body. We have used a combination of three complementary approaches, namely fluorescence comparative genome in situ hybridisation, high throughput deep DNA sequencing and photoactivation combined with  time lapse fluorescence microscopy to study nucleolar associated chromatin.The data show that specific sequences from most human chromosomes associate with nucleoli in a reproducible and heritable fashion. The  nucleolar associated loci have in common a high density of AT rich sequence elements, low gene density and a striking and significant enrichment in transcriptionally repressed genes. Unexpectedly, both the direct DNA sequencing and fluorescence photoactivation data  show that certain chromatin loci can specifically associate with either the nucleolus or the nuclear envelope.We are currently comparing nucleolar associated loci in a model for cancer versus non cancer cells. This will allow us to identify genomic regions that are mis localized and of which gene expression maybe deregulated in cancer cells, and therefore can possibly be used as a probe to diagnose specific cancers or cancer stages.",2011

We have sought to identify polymorphisms acting in a cell specific manner from physiologically relevant tissue   freshly purified positively selected lymphoid derived CD19+ B cells and myeloid derived CD14+ monocytes.Cells were purified from a cohort of 288 healthy adult Caucasians. Subjects were genotyped at 731,442 markers (Illumina HumanOmniExpress) and expression analysed using whole genome microarrays (Illumina HumanHT 12, n,566). At a p value <1x10 11  we identify 1960 SNPs with eQTLs unique to B cells and 3700 SNPs with eQTLs unique to monocytes. Whilst the most significant eQTLs tend to be shared between cell type, over 90% of SNPs with eQTLs at a p value <0.01 are cell specific. Furthermore, we identify a subset of ~20 genes with SNPs that lead to opposing directional effects on expression in a cell dependent manner. We confirm the microarray results for multiple genes using quantitative PCR and analyse several monocyte and B cell specific eQTLs in a third cell type   Natural Killer cells.

To detect such mutations, we designed two capture arrays with 60 mer probes tiled with an off set of 10 nt covering the  entire coding sequence (1.53 Mb capture footprint) of all genes within 20 transmitted deletion regions (covering in total 57.9 Mb genomic DNA). Deletions varied in size from 0.15 to 11.0 Mb and contained up to 36 protein coding genes.

Sequencing reads were mapped against the human reference genome and all Single Nucleotide Variations (SNVs) were compiled  using in house developed SNP calling algorithms. Except for SNVs coinciding with indels and segmental duplications, all SNVs were close to 0 or 100% non reference calls, confirming the mono allelic nature of the regions studied. In all three cases tested, SNVs showed high concordance with SNP calls by Illumina HumanHap 300v3 BeadChips. Most of the 668 SNVs detected occurred in multiple samples.

The large majority of these CNVS originated on the paternal allele (78%, p,3.4x10  9). This paternal bias was independent  of CNV length and CNV type. Interestingly, the paternal bias was less  pronounced for CNVs flanked by low copy repeat (LCRs), suggesting that molecular mechanisms involved in the formation of rare de novo CNVs may be dependent on the parent of origin. In addition, a  significantly increased paternal age was only observed for those CNVs which were not flanked by LCRs (p,0.009).

Additionally, lineage  relatedness of megakaryocytes and erythrocytes prompted us to  explore the putative role of these genes in erythropoiesis. Morpholino (MO) knockdown of all five genes but tpma resulted in a variable  decrease in the number of erythrocytes. Arhgef3 depletion had the most profound effect on erythropoiesis, leading to further detailed studies. Examination of peripheral blood from arhgef3 MO injected embryos  revealed microcytic, hypochromic erythrocytes, a classic feature of iron deficiency. Anaemia was rescued by intracellular supplementation  of iron to arhgef3 MO injected embryos, demonstrating that arhgef3   depleted erythroid cells, once provided with intracellular iron are fully capable of haemoglobinisation. Disruption of the arhgef3  target,  RhoA, also produced severe anaemia, which was again rescued by iron injection. Moreover, silencing of ARHGEF3 expression in the erythromyeloblastoid cell line K562 revealed that the uptake of iron transporter, transferrin, was severely impaired. This is the first study to provide evidence for ARHGEF3 being a regulator of transferrin and iron uptake in erythroid cells, through activation of RhoA.In conclusion, our findings demonstrate the value of pursuing GWAS signals as a new and exciting forward genetics approach in identifying novel regulatory molecules and signalling pathways in haematopoiesis.",2011

Several disease genes and risk loci have been identified but do not account for all MAC cases, suggesting that additional disease loci exist. Using SNP homozygosity mapping  and targeted sequencing of the candidate homozygous segments, we identified a novel disease gene, STRA6, for isolated autosomal  recessive colobomatous micro anophthalmia (arCMIC). The STRA6 missense mutation was subsequently detected in additional families that presented at the genetics clinic, including one patient with Matthew Wood syndrome (MWS). We have shown that the mutant STRA6 protein is not expressed on the cell surface and has severely reduced vitamin A uptake activity. Furthermore, inhibition of retinoid synthesis in zebrafish embryos recapitulated the arCMIC phenotype, suggesting  that diminished retinoid levels due to decreased vitamin A uptake by STRA6, account for the eye malformations in the arCMIC patients. We demonstrate that STRA6 mutations can cause isolated arCMIC in addition to MWS, which opens the debate as to the genetic and environmental factors which determine whether patients with STRA6 mutations develop isolated eye malformations or multisystem congenital anomalies. Currently, STRA6 screening for diagnostic purposes is only  offered to patients with MWS. Our findings suggest that patients with isolated eye defects of unknown etiology should also be considered for STRA6 screening. The study also illustrates that the combination of  homozygosity mapping together with targeted array based sequencing is a powerful tool for identifying disease genes for recessive disorders.",2011

Muscular dystrophies (MDs) represent genetically heterogeneous  disorders, characterized by progressive loss of functional muscle fibres and its replacement by adipose and fibrous tissue. Despite earlier promises based on the discovery of molecular defects underlying several MDs there is still no causative therapy, which underscores the  need for a comprehensive understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying the common MD pathology.Investigating age related phenotypes of MD mouse models, we observed the frequent occurrence of spontaneous skeletal muscle derived tumors in mice lacking dystrophin, dysferlin, calpain 3, or Large, respectively. The primary gene defect and genetic background influenced tumor incidence, latency, localization, and gender prevalence. Combined loss of dystrophin and dysferlin or calpain 3 showed a strong synergistic effect. We found that these musculature  derived tumors are mixed sarcomas with rhabdomyo , fibro , and liposarcoma elements. Molecularly, these sarcomas shared non random genomic alterations including frequent losses at the Cdkn2a   and Nf1 loci, amplification of oncogenes (Met, Jun), and recurrent  duplications of whole chromosomes 8 and 15. Skeletal muscles of aged MD mice without overt sarcomas regularly harbor sarcoma specific genetic lesions. Consequently, we discovered that also dystrophic muscles and cultured cells from human MD patients are very similarly affected by DNA damage and chromosome copy number aberrations.Thus, we present a novel, unifying concept for the molecular pathogenesis of MDs. Our identification of tumor related DNA pathologies in muscular dystrophies builds a bridge between a whole  group of different rare diseases and the common entity of cancer diseases.

Immunohistochemical analysis of tissue constructs transfected with siRNA against POMP revealed aberrant staining of POMP, proteasome subunits and the skin differentiation marker filaggrin when compared to control tissue constructs. The staining patterns of POMP siRNA tissue constructs were strikingly similar to those observed in skin biopsies from KLICK patients. Furthermore, knock down of POMP expression in regular cell cultures resulted in decreased amounts of proteasome subunits and an increase in subunit transcripts. Prolonged silencing of POMP in cultured cells induced  an increase in C/EBP homologous protein expression consistent  with an activation of the unfolded protein response and increased endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. The combined results indicate that KLICK is caused by reduced levels of POMP, leading to proteasome insufficiency in differentiating keratinocytes. This disturbs terminal epidermal differentiation, presumably by increased ER stress and incomplete filaggrin processing. Our findings underline a critical role for the proteasome in human epidermal differentiation and suggest that tissue constructs with siRNA induced POMP insufficiency can  serve as a model for KLICK genodermatosis in vitro.Concurrent Sessions49 POst ER",2011

Like mental retardation, autism is likely to be caused by many different genetic mechanisms and genes rather than a single, or few, major genes or environmental effects. Applying routine genetic testing in clinical (CLIA certified) diagnostic laboratories itâs possible to identify the specific etiology and recurrence risk in 10% to 15% of autism cases and is clinically indicated for any child with autism.In this study we report 5 cases with different genetic syndromes in which ASD has been described as one of the possible manifestations:  Down syndrome, 22q13 deletion, ,,cri du chatâ syndrome   5p15 deletion, Cornelia de Lange syndrome, Sotos syndrome. c onclusions : The etiologies of ASD are complex and presence of a  wide variety cytogenetic abnormalities are providing us with extremely  valuable information about the role played by genetics in autism and collaboration with psychiatrists. Such recognition  and understanding  will help clinicians implement syndrome specific treatments of patients  identified with a genetic cause of autism spectrum disorder.

Specifically, issues regarding parental consent, assent, the question of minimal risk and benefit and the return of individual research results to parents and minors need in depth reflection.  For example, should parents be given the opportunity to consent to each possible genetic research on the samples of their children, or should they only be allowed to give specific consent? At which age is a child able to understand genetic research on his or her sample and/or assent to such research? What, if any, risks do children face when they participate in biobank research? Should such research specifically benefit children? Do parents have the right to access all genetic data that are generated by the research? Do researchers have a duty to return individual results that may be of potential health benefit  to the child? We have finished a three year project investigating these issues.

The concept relies on a quantitative parameter for bio resource use, similar to the  Impact Factor for publications. Such a BRIF would make it possible to document: 1. the quantitative use of a bio resource, 2. the quality and the importance of research results involving it, and 3. the scientific and management efforts of those who set up and made available a valid bio resource. A working group has been set up towards the creation of this BRIF, starting with an online forum http://www.gen2phen.org/groups/brif bio resource impact factor in EU projects. The work addresses several steps: 1. Creating a bio resource unique identifier, or digital ID; 2. Standardising bio resource acknowledgement in  papers; 3. Cataloguing bio resource data access and sharing policies; 4. Identifying the other factors to take into account when calculating the Impact Factor; 5. Prototype testing, involving volunteer bio resources and the help of journal editors. Such a system could be used to rationally evaluate bio resource activities over time. Such a system could be used to rationally evaluate bio resource activities over time. Specificities in data sharing versus biological samples have to be considered.

Unfortunately, those data are not usually shared with others. To address this deficiency, a novel system has been constructed that facilitates the discovery and controlled transfer  of diagnostic laboratory data to the wider community, via an internet based âCafÃ© for Routine Genetic data Exchangeâ (CafÃ© RouGE http://www.caferouge.org/).Actually, diagnostic laboratories are not reluctant to release their data, but merely face practical obstacles: First, their personnel do not have time nor funding to manually submit data to internet depositories such as Locus Specific databases (LSDBs). Second, they would receive no recognition or reward for releasing their data, giving them no incentive.CafÃ© RouGE takes account of these real world obstacles and the  needs of diverse LSDBs and aims to minimize the effort required to publish variant data by:a) Endowing data analysis tools used by diagnostic laboratories with a âdata submissionâ function that automatically pushes processed data onto the internetb) Producing a single internet depot (cafÃ©) to receive and display the existence of these data, with options for controlled download by diverse third parties.A modified version of the Gensearch sequence analysis package (PhenoSystems SA) now offers this submission functionality, and other tool providers are encouraged to do likewise.

The main aim of this cross sectional study was to investigate the long term psychological effect of being a BRCA1 mutation carrier and compare this to a  matched normal population. Secondly, we wanted to explore if losing a close relative in childhood due to cancer or being affected by cancer were associated with symptoms of anxiety and depression or the level of health related quality of life.Method: Of the 100 eligible participants, 78 consented to participate and were included in the study. Questionnaires were sent to them at least one year after a positive BRCA1 test result had been revealed to them. Result: Compared to the Norwegian general population, participants  reported higher level of anxiety and low level of depression. Mutation carriers who experienced losing a close relative in childhood due to cancer reported higher levels of anxiety and depression and lower psychological health (WHOQOL BREF) compared to those without this experience. There was no significant difference between mutation carriers affected by cancer and those not affected.Conclusion : The results from the present study show that living with  knowledge of being a mutation carrier may affect anxiety and physical health.

Evidence suggests that people fail to adjust their risk perception to account for longer time frames. It has been argued that using narrower time frames (e.g. 10 years) are more appropriate than life time frames. The aim of this study was to compare the effects of presenting risk  information on breast cancer in age related 10 years frames in addition to life time risks on the counseleesâ understanding and perception of risks, psychological well being, and intentions regarding breast cancer surveillance.Methods: In a randomized controlled multicenter intervention trial, unaffected women with a breast cancer family history were recruited. Women received one of two breast cancer risk presentation formats: lifetime risk in frequencies (i.e. X out of 100) (n,63) or life time risks and age related 10 years risk in frequencies (n,69). Baseline,  2 week and 6 month follow up measurements were assessed using questionnaires.Results The added age related risk led to a more accurate understanding of 10 years breast cancer risk but not of life time risks, and gave women more clarity. The added age related risk also lowered womenâs perceived relative risk of getting breast cancer. However, participants evaluated their own risk as less imaginable when expressed as age related risk compared to life time risk. The addition of age related risk had no effect on well being or preventive intentions.Conclusion: Our results suggest that the addition of age related risk to life time risk of breast cancer may have an additional value in breast cancer risk counseling.Genetic counseling, including Psychosocial aspects, Genetics education, Genetic  services, and Public policy51",2011

The gender distribution of breast and prostate cancer genetic risk profiles argues for elucidating gender differences in forming intent to obtain GT. We use a theory of reasoned action derived model  to test for such differences. m ethods: Cross sectional analysis of 1,824 US adults. Structural  equation modeling tested for gender differences in total/direct/indirect  effects of attitudes towards GT, knowledge  about genetic diseases and  testing, prior experience  with GT, and religious involvement  on intent  to obtain GT.Results: 765 men and 1,059 women were surveyed. Despite similar willingness to test for curable disorders (77%), men showed higher  willingness to test for incurable disorders (54% vs. 46% in women). Men were significantly more likely to have had prior experience with GT (7.5% vs. 5.1%). Prior experience with GT had a direct positive effect on intent to test among men (b,0.68; p<0.01), but no effect among women (p>0.05). For both genders, attitudes towards GT had a significant direct positive effect on intent to test (b,0.536 for men; b,0.391 for women; p<0.001) and individuals with high religious involvement held more negative attitudes towards GT and were less willing to obtain GT (b, 0.020 for men; b, 0.017 for women; p<0.05). The model explained 24% of the variance in intent to test among men, but only 12.1% among women. c onclusion:  Significant differences exist between men and women in  the pathways to formation of intent to obtain GT and underscore the  need to refine genetic counseling and outreach to account for gender  influences on GT behaviors.",2011

The main themes extracted from the data were knowledge, skills, nursesâ perception of the relevance of genetics to their roles, confidence and ethical issues. The evidence indicates that while nurses across a range of  countries and practice areas perceive genetics to be important to their roles, generally their knowledge of genetics is low, as is their ability to perform basic clinical skills, such as taking a family history or referring to genetic services. This is reflected in nursesâ low confidence in their ability to deal with genetics issues concerning their patients. In addition, some nurses have ethical concerns that genetic testing could cause discrimination against patients.

Wallace,"Leicester University, Leicester, United Kingdom","Returning individual research results to participants is an increasingly  debated subject. It is suggested that, in order to be returned, findings should be scientifically valid and confirmed, have significant health implications and there should be therapeutic or preventative options available. However, the process by which these findings will be  communicated will necessarily be different depending on the context of the research. Individual research projects are able to rely on available institutional guidance. Consortia whose members are all located in one country may need to deal with different institutional procedures, but will also have national law and regulations to guide their actions. International consortia face the additional problem of having projects that represent different legal, regulatory and cultural requirements for different aspects of the research process, including returning individual research results. Therefore, how should an international consortium  deal with this pressing issue? The International Cancer Genome Consortium has created a policy where the consortium itself will not return results, but recognises that local member projects may choose or be required to return results. Model consent language has been  created by the ICGC to assist projects as well as other researchers. Sample language from existing ICGC projects shows how the model consent has been adapted to suit local needs as well as those of the ICGC.

Ulph","University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom","Recently implemented Newborn Screening (NBS) for Cystic Fibrosis  (CF) and Sickle Cell Diseases (SCD) across the UK raises questions about the publicâs level of awareness of NBS. Pregnancy is believed to be a difficult time to communicate about NBS, as information is poorly absorbed and negative consequences may arise for parents during  pregnancy and after birth. Although awareness of NBS is suggested to reduce the distress associated with screening, research fails to stipulate what information is required or when it should be provided. Furthermore, the extent of lay disease knowledge prior to screening is not established. This study explored i) young adultsâ existing knowledge of CF, SCD and NBS, ii) how awareness of NBS can be improved for future generations and iii) the feasibility of providing NBS information to a young adult population.  Thirty four young adults took part in one  of seven focus groups. Thematic analysis was conducted to generate  codes and themes at a manifest level. Coupled with numerous misperceptions, students displayed limited knowledge of CF and SCD. Predominantly informed by Biological education, awareness of the severity of SCD was typically underestimated. Participants dismissed wanting further NBS information during young adulthood despite showing preoccupation with personal carrier risk. Lack of knowledge and perceived irrelevance of screening information causes concern about how to prepare the future generation of NBS programme users. The inclusion of carrier statistics, autosomal recessive inheritance and information about the severity of SCD are proposed to improve young adultsâ interest and understanding of NBS.",2011

Alleged adverse effects, like (a)febrile Genetic counseling, including Psychosocial aspects, Genetics education,  Genetic services, and Public policy54 seizures, may have great impact on public acceptance of vaccination  programs. In this study we investigated the etiology of epilepsy following vaccination, in a national cohort.Methods: Medical data of 1301 children, reported with convulsion(s) after vaccination in the first two years of life between 1997 2006 to the  National Institute for Public Health and Environment in the Netherlands, were re evaluated. Parents of children with onset of epilepsy within 24 hours after a DTP IPV +Hib vaccination, or 5 12 days after MMR vaccination were re contacted for follow up.Results: Twenty seven children (2,1%) had epilepsy with onset after vaccination. Follow up was available for 24. Ten children had a genetic cause: Dravet syndrome due to a SCN1A mutation (8), epilepsy in females with mental retardation (EFMR) due to a PCDH19 mutation (1) and a submicroscopic 1q deletion (1). A genetic cause  was presumed in four others: neuronal migration disorder (2) and autosomal dominantly inherited form of epilepsy (2). Of the remaining 10 children, three had a first or second degree relative with seizures. In one child the cause of the epilepsy was probably viral.Conclusions: In the majority of cases with epilepsy onset following vaccination in the first two years of life, a genetic cause is detected or suspected (14/24). Early diagnosis of Dravet syndrome and other genetic causes is not only important for treatment and genetic counselling, but also for safety surveillance of vaccination programs.",2011

Participants were  recruited through the Muscular Dystrophy Association and RCH Neuromuscular Clinic. A total of 13 families were interviewed: 15 parents, 1 grandmother and 2 adult sisters. Parents reported a 1 2 year gap between their first noticing signs of developmental delay and of receiving the DMD diagnosis; all found this delay in diagnosis to be very difficult. Most participants perceived population screening for DMD to be acceptable, preferring infant screening (6 months to 2 years) but generally opposing NBS. Two parents only felt resources would be better used for improving treatment. The main reason against  NBS was potential for a negative impact on parental child relationship. Participants supporting infant screening felt that a diagnosis in infancy would allow: implementation of early interventions; guidance with financial, practical and reproductive decision making; and greater understanding of the childâs struggle with developmental milestones. Some parents supported a more âtargetedâ approach to population screening of infants at â¥ 1 year of age, the time at which most started to be concerned with their childâs development.

This law addresses genetic testing among other aspects (e.g. embryo stem cell research, transplantation, medical aided procreation). In various French legal instruments genetic information is treated apart from other biologic information given its  potential misuses and its familial dimension. The proposal for revising the law is focusing on two major points of genetics: communication of the genetic Information and optimisation of laboratoryâs quality. Based on professional secrecy medical doctors could not inform, on their own decision, family members about genetic characteristics, even if relevant for them. New procedures to allow medical doctors to disclose such information to family members are proposed; liability incurred in case of non transmission of the information and the role of patients associations to deliver relevant information are underlined. Although  provisions on quality aspects in a bioethics law can be discussed, they aim to protect people through a high quality of laboratory tests and analyses performed, with regards to direct to consumer genetic tests on internet. A key role will be devoted to the âAgence de la BiomÃ©decineâ for assessing quality of laboratories and delivering information regarding such tests.

Moreover, as researchers begin to access such population biobanks for disease specific studies using (WGS) or, when begin using WGS in their own clinical research, the concept of âincidentalâ findings (ie. unforeseen and unrelated to the disease under study) may also be challenged, (if not become obsolete), as the whole genome of a person is exposed.

However, many of these tests, focusing on genes involved in multifactorial disorders, have limited clinical validity and utility. Due to the nature of the genetic information that these tests provide, coupled  with the relative lack of end user genetic information literacy, it is especially important that the quality of these tests (in both a clinical and DTC setting) be independently evaluated. A handful of tools and initiatives have been proposed to aid in the evaluation task. One such tool is the ACCE model; consisting of 44 questions, designed to assess the quality of a genetic testâs Analytical validity,  c linical validity,  c linical utility and also, to address Ethical, legal and social issues  (ELSI) of the test.

The Council found that these services have a number of potential benefits,  such as providing reassurance or enabling people to take preventative action. But potential harms were also identified. For example, the test results can be unreliable and difficult to interpret; âgoodâ results may lead to complacency in lifestyle; learning about risk of disease could be upsetting, particularly if no treatments are available; there is potential for misuse of personal genetic information; and people may seek unnecessary further tests or advice from their doctor. However, the number of people using genetic profiling services and whether this is currently leading to any actual harm is not known. Several ethical values come into play, such as individualsâ ability to pursue their own interests and efforts by the state to reduce harm, and the report explores the extent to which genetic profiling tests really do lead to healthcare becoming more âpersonalisedâ. On the basis of this, the Council makes a number of recommendations for policy. For example, regulators are urged to request evidence for any claims being made by companies about the clinical value of their tests, and governments are encouraged to provide information on their websites about the risks and benefits of personal genetic profiling, including the relevance for insurance.",2011

The European Network for Genetic and Genomic Epidemiology (ENGAGE) is a research project performing meta analyses in order to translate the wealth of data emerging from large scale research in genetic and genomic epidemiology from 23 population cohorts into information relevant to future clinical applications.The goal of BioSHaRE is to allow researchers to use data pooled from different cohorts and biobank studies, thereby creating sample sizes large enough to investigate questions relating to multifactorial diseases.In order to determine whether the use of already collected samples and data in international research consortia should be considered as either âprimaryâ or âsecondaryâ use, both the ENGAGE and BioSHaRE consortia will serve as models for our study.",2011
 m edical ethics and counseling genetic in sm A,P01.39,"A. C. Papari, G. C. Cozaru","Andrei Åaguna University, Constanta, Romania","Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most common autosomal  recessive diseases, affecting approximately 1 in 10,000 live births, and with a carrier frequency of approximately 1 in 50. The SMA phenotype is widely variable, with the severity of symptoms influenced by several genetic factors. Genetic risk assessment is an essential and integral  component of SMA genetic testing and impacts genetic counseling both before and after genetic testing is performed.To better understand the ethical difficulties associated with a condition like SMA, we report a couple where the man was diagnosed with SMA type IV. He has a family history of SMA. Couple was provided information on SMA, including range of severity and test limitations. Parents was requested prenatal diagnosis because they did not accept residual risk.More, it is almost certain that other fatherâs family members are also  carriers of genes mutation. Should the counselor be expected to break confidentiality to inform the at risk family members of their genetic risk?Comprehensive SMA genetic testing, comprising PCR RFLP assay, SMN gene dosage analysis and genetic counseling, offers the most complete evaluation of SMA patients and their families at this time. These cases illustrate that SMA testing, like other genetic testing, can lead to complicated scenarios and highlight the importance of genetic counseling for identified SMA carriers. A genetic counselor could help this couple to understand the risk for own children and to develop strategies to accurately inform their family members of their possible risk of SMA without being alarming.",2011
" Personal genome testing: c haracteristics of the test, the disease and the context to clarify the discourse on ethical, legal and societal issues",P01.40,"E. M. Bunnik , M. H. N. Schermer, A. C. J. W. Janssens","Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Background: Personal genome tests are currently marketed directly  to consumer to estimate genetic risks for a range of multifactorial  diseases and other traits. These tests have spurred critical discussions of their ethical, legal and societal implications (ELSI), but not all personal genome tests raise the same ELSI. We offer a systematic approach towards questions regarding what ELSI to expect from specific applications, and why.Methods: Review of the bioethical literature, expert interviews and conceptual analysis. Results: ELSI may vary with the characteristics of the test, the disease and the context in which testing is offered. For example, tests of limited clinical validity are less likely to be utilized as a basis for discrimination than do those of higher levels of clinical validity. Further, testing for a multitude of diseases simultaneously brings along an unequalled quantity of information, thereby threatening the feasibility of informed consent. Also, testing for psychiatric diseases such as clinical depression, is surrounded by various psychological and ethical sensitivities, which are much less pressing in testing for (most) somatic  diseases. A major context characteristic is direct to consumer access to personal genome testing, which is associated with ELSI of its own, such as lack of professional medical guidance. We have composed a comprehensive list of characteristics that are of relevance to the ELSI debate.Conclusion : In an informed and meaningful ELSI debate on  personal genome testing for multifactorial diseases, consideration of characteristics of the test, disease and the context is indispensable, for these characteristics determine the applicability of ELSI to specific personal genome tests.",2011
 Patientsâ experiences and views of DNA testing and familial cascade screening for Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH): a qualitative study,P01.41,"N. Hallowell1, N. Jenkins2, M. Douglas3, J. Lawton2","1Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, 2Edinburgh  University, Edinburgh, United Kingdom, 3NHS Lothian, Edinburgh, United  Kingdom","Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), an autosomal dominant disease,  manifests as a disorder of cholesterol metabolism. Early detection and treatment with statins can be effective in reducing morbidity and mortality from CVD. Familial cascade DNA screening for FH mutations is a clinical reality throughout Europe. Questions have been raised  about the most efficient and cost effective way of implementing cascading. The argument for direct (clinician mediated) versus indirect (patient mediated) cascading is that the former overcomes patientsâ reticence about disclosure and thus, maximises the number of relatives approached and captured in the cascade. However, research suggests that family communication about genetic testing takes place without a need for this intervention. Moreover, direct cascading is reliant upon the index patient revealing family contact details, and this may raise issues about confidentiality for some. To date no research  has been undertaken on the views of patients involved in indirect cascading. This paper looks at patientsâ experiences of DNA screening and mediating familial cascade screening. The data were gathered in in depth interviews with 38 patients who had DNA testing in lipid clinics SE Scotland. 15(39%) were referred for cascade appointments in clinical genetics. Patients appreciate DNA testing being undertaken by known and trusted lipid clinic staff. DNA testing was seen as part of the normal lipid clinic routine. Having a genetics consultation to identify relatives for cascading was perceived as facilitating, and potentially increasing, family communication about FH. Patients expressed a preference for indirect cascading, commenting that it may be less threatening for relatives than unsolicited clinical contact.",2011

Background: The use of electronic genealogical databases could  facilitate the construction of accurate and extensive pedigrees in genetic health care. Genealogical databases could be linked to specific disorder databases in order to increase the accuracy of pedigrees and inform the genetic risk assessment. Aim: Systematic review of the published literature on the use of genealogy databases to construct pedigrees for risk assessments in genetic health care.Design: A systematic literature search was undertaken using the following 12 combined search terms: âGenealogy database* AND genetic risk AND family historyâ, âGenealogy database* AND clinical geneticsâ , âGenealogy Database* AND medical AND family historyâ, âCancer registry AND genetic serviceâ, âCancer registration AND clinical genetics AND genealogyâ, âDatabase* AND family history  AND genetic risk assessmentâ, âGenealogy database* AND cancer registryâ, âDatabase* AND genealogy AND geneticsâ, âGenealogy OR heraldry AND databaseâ, âGenetic counsel* and clinical genetics AND genealogyâ and âCancer genetic counsel* and genealogyâ.Data sources:  EbscoHost, PubMed, Web of Science, Ovid, the Grey  literature and reference lists of identified studies.Results: Of 683 titles identified, one study described experience of using a genealogy database in a cancer registry in support of genetic health care.

But, genetic tests can also generate information about childrenâs health in the medium to long term future, rather than about current health problems. Decisions  about the optimum time to carry out a genetic test can therefore raise difficult issues for health professionals, for parents and for children and young people themselves. In 1994 a report from the UKâs Clinical Genetics Society recommended that predictive genetic testing was appropriate where a medical intervention was available and would  usually be offered during childhood, but that such testing should not generally be undertaken for adult onset disorders unless there were clear cut and unusual arguments in favour in a particular case. The report concluded that it was important to preserve or maximise childrenâs future choices where no clear benefits would accrue during childhood. The guidance has recently been reviewed by a working group on behalf of the British Society for Human Genetics, and a new report was published in 2010. This was informed by research, and took into account developments including other guidelines published over the last 15 years.

Accurate information about genetic aspects of disorders is needed in  genetic counseling. To address this need and enable clear and easily understood explanations, professionals in genetic health services have developed a number of educational aids. These aids can be used to inform the counselee of the inheritance pattern, risk to relatives,  genetic testing options, symptoms and surveillance. They can also be used as decision aids regarding genetic testing and prevention. Most often these aids are visual; images, booklets, interactive computer based programs, checklists and CD/DVDÂ´s,It has been shown that counselees using educational aids before or during genetic counseling session are more likely to remember their risk status, show significant knowledge improvement and are more satisfied with their decisions. However, the use of educational aids has not been shown to benefit the psychosocial aspects of genetic  counseling and counselees prefer personal communication.Recently, touch screen computers such as iPad, have made their way into the medical world. We have introduced the use of iPad in genetic counseling at The National University Hospital of Iceland. With an Genetic counseling, including Psychosocial aspects, Genetics education,  Genetic services, and Public policy59 iPad the genetic counselor can show the counselee defined packages  of information, including small videos, and use the touch screen to draw further images for explanation.

We evaluated the psychological impact of receiving a genetic test result in both partners of couples with a genetic abnormality compared to controls. m ethods: Longitudinal prospective index control study. Participants  received 3 questionnaires; just before disclosure of genetic test result,  3 and 12 months after disclosure. Outcome measures were scores on the Becks Depression Inventory (BDI), State Trait Anxiety Index (STAI) and Impact of Event Scale (IES).

Every routine diagnostic laboratory has to evaluate which methods can be adopted from the research setting for routine diagnostics and which are the factors that dictate the applicability of a given method in a diagnostic laboratory. In most  laboratories, instrumentation is not a limiting factor, but the challenge is to determine the most cost effective test, taking into consideration the utility of the test for patients.We have used Sotos syndrome as a model for test translation. The key issue in successful translation was a close collaboration between academic research and diagnostic laboratory, adding to that a close collaboration with a clinical genetics unit, ensuring the up to date knowledge in each phase of translation. We have tested altogether 150 Sotos syndrome samples, and detected a mutation in 30% of the  samples. Many clinicians meet Sotos patients rarely and, consequently, the test has been mostly used in cases of suspected Sotos syndrome rather than in confirming the clinical diagnosis. Finding the mutation is valuable for the patient/family, while the value of negative result is less clear and other differential diagnostic diagnoses should be considered. The Sotos syndrome test has been a suitable model for test translation, because the genetic background and genotype phenotype correlation are well characterised. However, in syndromes where mutational background or genotype phenotype correlation are less clear, the test for the patients and diagnostic laboratory may remain of low utility, and test translation should be carefully considered.",2011
 Direct to consumer genetic testing for non health purposes in East Asia,P01.54,"K. Muto , Y. Inoue, H.

In contrast, several Shanghai based companies stated to advertise in Japan to sell DTC genetic tests for non health purposes, such as tests advertised  to identify genes related to an individualâs talent, character traits and aptitude. Regulation of DTC genetic tests for non health purposes have rarely discussed before.Purpose and methods: To address broad ethical, legal and social implications arising from such tests, weâve conducted 1) systematic literature review and policy analysis towards genetic testing in Asian countries including Japan, South Korea, Taiwan and China, 2) questionnaire survey to the Japanese general public to know their recognition and interests towards DTC tests. Results: Advertisement is commonly observed in East Asia though some of the tests have been banned in South Korea. Our survey shows that 1.3% (47) of respondents has purchased DTC genetic tests, and 72.9% (2,627) of them hasnât recognized such tests. They show higher interests towards tests for health purposes (25.3 53.4%) than non health purposes (8.2% 21.9%). Younger generation shows higher interests toward DTC genetic tests for their children.Discussions: The trend of our survey shows the same trend from the survey conducted in 2007.

Associations between genetic variants and disease risk have been established, for instance for hereditary breast and ovarian cancer, colon cancer, diabetes mellitus (MODY subtypes), thrombosis, cardiovascular disorders, celiac disease and Alzheimer disease. Although these examples relate to monogenic sub forms of common disease, they can nevertheless be used to reflect on possibilities and relevant obstacles in using the new  genetics in public health. Recommendations have been formulated stressing: avoiding too high expectations of genomics applications; the need to establish clinical utility of genetic testing before introducing large scale applications; in case clinical utility is not proven, but likely, research should accompany pilot projects; monogenic conditions can serve as examples for common complex diseases, when identifying etiological pathways and developing healthcare in a responsible way; sufficiently qualified health care professionals should be involved in case of direct to consumer genetic testing; regulation is necessary to guarantee truth in labelling and truthful promotion of genetic tests; stratified medicine will only be successful if health care insurance is based on solidarity; especially in developing countries governments should avoid an access gap to genetic testing of proven clinical utility.",2011
 Genomics education for primary care providers in Estonia,P01.57,"L. Leitsalu1, L. Hercher2, A.

Since 2000, Estonian Genome Center of University of Tartu (EGCUT),  in partnership with primary care providers (PCPs) nationwide, has recruited over 50,000 gene donors for the Estonian Biobank. This collaboration has ensured a collection of high quality health data, as pre existing medical information has been included. Additionally,  it represents a starting point in the working relationship between EGCUT and PCPs, who are expected to facilitate the use of genomic information in the clinical setting once genomic information has sufficient clinical validity and utility. This study investigated the knowledge base and expectations of PCPs. Of 130 PCPs surveyed, 64 responded, representing 8% of the 804 PCPs in Estonia. Overall, PCPs demonstrated eagerness to apply genomic information in practice, as well as a willingness to improve their knowledge base in genetics and genomics. Results also indicated that substantial  improvements in genetics education are needed to achieve EGCUTâs plans for personalized medicine in Estonia. It is a goal of EGCUT to implement a database that can be accessed by all physicians in Estonia that would contain genomic data, along with all other medically relevant information on the patient, and could be used in medical counseling for and effective application of genomic information in clinical care. Several additional factors in Estonia may help to realize that goal: the national health care system, availability of electronic health care records, and the fact that University of Tartu is responsible for the education of health care workers as the only medical school in the country.",2011
 One more proof that practice makes perfect,P01.58,R. Dragotoiu,"Medical and Pharmacy University Carol Davila, Bucuresti, Romania","The aim of this study is finding a way to determine better achievements  in learning genetics. Motivation for a more thorough learning at the end of the first semester is a final examination, although many students bear in mind the wish to practice in another field beside medical genetics. Because âpractice makes perfectâ in every field under the  proper guidance, I have tried to discover if repeating the information could change the marks students obtained.The study group consisted of 128 first year medical students, who were tested twice. During the middle of the term they received marks for answering two questions: one from the practicalsâ and one from the lecturesâ content. Then all the questions from the lectures were discussed, so students could learn what was expected as an answer. Despite lack of time, these answers were briefly repeated at the beginning of the next practical. To view the impact of repetition,  I compared these marks in each of the two questions with those obtained at the end of the term. At this final test 88 students had to answer exactly the same two questions as the first time, while 30 control students received different ones, randomly distributed, but from the same question pool.In both groups about 70% of students had better results at the second testing, supporting consequently the idea that when teaching medical genetics one can mould his activity, repetition providing a better and therefore more satisfying outcome for both trainer and trainee.",2011

The majority of genetic diseases are molecularly and clinically highly heterogeneous and until recently, the available techniques lacked the required capacity to test many genes in parallel. Next generation  sequencing technologies already available in research provide a unique opportunity to develop new diagnostic tools for heterogeneous genetic diseases. But their clinical use raises major and previously unaddressed issues. In a context of innovation, implementing new technologies is aiming to optimize clinical care. How to preserve the essence of traditional clinical values and how to maximize the  translational relevance of genetic research for patients and for society? A main concern is that the rapid penetration of systematic technologies into genetic medical departments blurs established frontiers between research and clinics. A huge amount of personal medical data will indeed be produced, including results irrelevant to any particular clinical problem but which may be of importance to the patient in other ways or in the future. Our present inability to interpret most of the data requires ethical consideration. Questions of personal data storage, possible updating and conditions to re contact patients and families require the development of appropriate rules or guidelines prior to clinical implementation. Clinicians, public health practitioners and  relevant decision makers should also determine their strategies and approaches in an era of such rapid advances. Main general challenges raised by High Throughput Technologies will be discussed and some positions proposed.",2011

These techniques are debated in some European countries regarding Hereditary NonPolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC). This interview  study aimed to assess the psychological impact and the opinion about reproductive decision making in HNPCC mutated individuals, after genetic test results disclosure. m ethods: A self report questionnaire including socio demographic  data, psychological status and reproductive options was retrospectively  sent to 101 HNPCC mutation carriers (patients and their relatives) from a complete oncogenetic colorectal data base between 1997 and 2010. The prevalence of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) was  assessed at the time of result disclosure and at least one year later, using IES R(Impact of Event Scale Revised)Results: Complete data were available for 34 individuals (25 relatives,  9 patients): 17 males, 17 females, median age of 33.5(22 59), with mutations in hMLH1 (15) hMSH2 (15) and hMSH6 (4) genes.Only 13.8% of participants reported significant immediate PTSD. They mainly explained their distress by fear of premature death (43.3%) and passing on mutated genes (41.9%). For 90.3% of respondents, reproductive decision making remained unchanged after results. Among reproductive options, PND/PGD or spontaneous natural conception were equally reported (50%). None of socio demographic or psycho medical variables were significantly associated with both choices. c onclusion: A minority of mutation carriers reported significant  levels of distress after result genetic disclosure.

As about 10% of these cases are familial and non related, there are 60 new cancer prone families undergoing our attention yearly. With regards to colorectal cancer, 20 HNPCC families and 3 FAP patients have been identified based on family history and pathology data, being  referred to genetic counseling and specific cancer control strategies. As to less frequent conditions, patients with VHL Disease, Muir Torre Syndrome and Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome have been identified being under close follow up and individualized genetic counseling.In conclusion, the experience of our hospital shows that clinical geneticists working in close contact with oncologists and surgeons are of utmost importance for directing clinical investigation, especially in places where more specific examinations may be unavailable. Oncogenetics represents a true bridge closing the gap between basic sciences and clinical medicine, and can surely play a pivotal role in any interdisciplinary team devoted to cancer care and willing to provide a comprehensive approach to their families.",2011

The survey quantifies for the first time the views of this group about current and future options related to neonatal screening, permission for use in medical research, and issues related Genetic counseling, including Psychosocial aspects, Genetics education,  Genetic services, and Public policy65 to (length of) storage, management and secondary uses of the cards,  including medical research, diagnostics, and identification. The survey contains questions on knowledge of current storage, management and use policies (6 items), personal experience with heel prick testing (4 items), demographic information (9 items), and opinions on specific  storage, management, and use issues (41 items). Respondents were able to indicate their level of support for 10 categories of secondary use, including âto determine how often certain medical conditions occur in the Netherlandsâ (prevalence studies) and âto find out how certain diseases developâ (etiology studies). Respondents were also asked how long the collection of heel prick cards should be kept for medical research.",2011

A recent mapping exercise carried out at the MBRC showed a range of PPI activity taking place. This paper highlights three examples of good practice.(1) A patient advisory group (PAG) was formed to help design, translate and disseminate the outcomes from a programme of research looking at improving services for patients with inherited retinal disease. The PAG is made up of patients, representatives from a range of charities for visual impairment and Genetic Alliance and is attended by the wider  study team, including the primary investigator, health care researchers, genetic counsellor and health economist.(2) A parent of an affected child is a partner on the Dyscerne guidelines group, whose aim is to develop and disseminate clinical management guidelines for rare dysmorphic conditions. This has resulted in the inclusion of important information aimed at professionals dealing with children who have rare syndromes.(3) A public consultation was carried out with women at the surgery of their general practitioner. Women were asked to feedback their views of both cervical screening and proposed interventions to increase uptake via a questionnaire.

Traditionally, expanding screening is being discussed among a restricted number of medical experts. In this research we aim to explore the views of a wide range of relevant professionals to gain  more insight into the process of weighing pros and cons of neonatal screening for Pompe disease.We conducted semi structured interviews with over 25 professionals in the Netherlands. Some had experience with Pompe disease patients, such as paediatricians, neurologists, physiatrists, family doctors and patient organisation representatives. Others were involved in the organisation of screening or health care, such as representatives from the Centre for Population Screening, the Health Care Insurance Board, and well baby clinic doctors. They were asked about their first reaction  to neonatal screening for Pompe disease, after which benefits and harms and requirements for screening were explored in more detail.This study shows that many professionals expect benefits from neonatal screening for Pompe disease, especially for early onset  cases, since it has been shown that prompt treatment improves survival and health status in many affected infants. A distinctive feature of this type of screening is the detection of late onset cases that would otherwise present anytime between infancy and later in adulthood. Whereas some interviewees considered early detection a benefit in these cases as well, allowing for monitoring and timely treatment, others considered this a drawback or a reason not to screen, given the psychological burden.",2011

Most of them are born unexpectedly without family history of the condition. In about 1/100 couples, both partners are carriers of the same disorder, facing 25% risk of affected offspring in each pregnancy. Carriers are usually unaware of their carrier status. Preconceptional carrier screening enables carrier couples to make informed reproductive decisions before pregnancy. Our offers of preconceptional carrier screening for cystic fibrosis (CF) and/or hemoglobinopathies (2002 and 2005) were favoured by the target population and stakeholders. Despite positive results in pilot studies, meeting genetic screening criteria and constructive debates about ethical, technical and financial aspects, in most European countries a systematic healthcare offer of preconceptional carrier screening for the general population is lacking. Meanwhile, uncontrolled commercial  private testing is available online. Is this development desirable in terms of informed consent, counselling, and medical supervision? In the absence of a healthcare offer, the Clinical Genetics Department of VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam recently started to offer preconceptional CF screening tests on the hospital website, accompanied by sufficient medical information, without commercial goals and with availability of counselling. The experiences of (potential) users will be monitored and integrated when further developing the service. Is this the ideal answer in diversifying contexts of screening? Will screening for more recessive disorders become available in regular healthcare in the future?

Materials & methods: two  groups were collected in a similar way: group 1 (control) (n,95, average age 31 years, body mass 84.9 kg) got recommendations that they are overweight and have to reduce their body mass in order to lower the risk of future CV pathology; group 2 (experimental) (n,103, average age 30.8 years, body mass 89.0 kg) got similar recommendations and additionally got results of a genetic test assessing individual risk of CVD. Both groups were examined after a year and body mass was measured repeatedly. Results: Both groups reduced their weight significantly. Control group lost 1.51 kg (p<0.0001), while experimental    2.29 kg (p<0.0001). The weight lost did not differ statistically between Genetic counseling, including Psychosocial aspects, Genetics educa   tion, Genetic services, and Public policy66 two groups. Analyzing separately subgroups of men and women  showed that men lost their weigh independently from the fact of getting personal genetic cardiovascular risk estimates (1.5 kg and 1.8 kg in groups 1 and 2 accordingly), while women reduced their weight mainly in the group with genetic testing   4.2 kg compared to control  group who lost 0.8 kg. Conclusions: Our data reports that there can be gender specific reaction to genetic testing.

 Ethical i ssues in pre implantation genetic diagnosis in Portugal: a comparative analysis of professionalâs opinions in years 2000 and 2010 using questionnaires,P01.74,"N. M. P. O. Teles1,2","1INSA, I","P., Centro de GenÃ©tica MÃ©dica Jacinto, Porto, Portugal, 2Faculty  Medicine, University of Porto, Porto, Portugal. Medical genetics has made significant progress in the last decades,  especially in the field of prenatal testing. After the dramatic expansion of prenatal diagnosis that started in the seventies, pre implantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) became a reality in 1990, following advances in the techniques of medically assisted reproduction  (MAR). Ethical problems related to this technique start well before the analysis: it is necessary to offer appropriate genetic counselling, to obtain informed consent for the necessary procedures and to maintain strict confidentiality of the whole process. The main ethical problems concern the status of the embryo, the investigation and the manipulation of embryos, eugenic or sex selection and the provision of resources. In 2000 a questionnaire addressing several of the principal ethical concerns, namely the attitude towards PGD, embryos and genetic testing, was distributed to the Directors of the five largest MAR  centres in Portugal; in 2010 the same questionnaire was sent to 27 MAR centres and answered by 11. In all cases it was required that the answers should be based on the general policy of each centre. This work presents the comparative analysis of all the obtained data, particularly focusing on the main ethical problems related to this diagnosis, i.e., the status of the human embryo and the attitude of the genetic professionals working in this still relatively new, and very specific, field of genetic diagnosis.",2011

For example, more than 80% women have maternal serum test as screening in the UK. In Japan, we do not offer maternal serum test as screening in most obstetrics services. We might provide the information of screening test and further chromosomal test such as  CVS and amniocentesis with the information of genetic counselling. There is no regulation for prenatal diagnosis in ultrasound diagnosis, so some clinic would offer screening at some point and some do not. We do not scan the fetus as screening without patientâs request at our hospital.Historically, we have been concerned with prenatal diagnosis over 30 years at our hospital. At first, we had been doing only the test and given the result for referred patients; however we now offer genetic counselling for referred patients to avoid automatic screening and to  have informed choice for prenatal diagnosis.Prenatal diagnosis contains ethical issues all the time, but most pregnant women do not notice this problem until they consider termination at some point. Genetic counselling in prenatal diagnosis could be good support for the patient who has to face difficult ethical issues during pregnancy. It sometimes reduces unnecessary risk for worries and/or invasive test.",2011

Getting raised in the genomic era may not only increase the knowledge of available genetic testing but may also have an impact on how genetic information is perceived. However, little is known about how this  teenage group reacts to the language commonly used by health care professionals providing prenatal counseling. In addition, as risk communication is related to numbers and figures, having different educational backgrounds may be associated with separate risk perceptions. In order to investigate these issues, a previously developed questionnaire (Abramsky & Fletcher, 2002) was administered to high school students in Sweden. A total of 344 questionnaires were completed by students belonging to a natural science or a social science program. Our data show that teenage participants were  particularly worried by the use of technical jargon and words like rare and abnormal . Negative framing effects and perception differences  related to numeric risk formats were also present. There were some cases of gender and educational program effects on risk assessment but this outcome was not generalizable. Besides the questionnaire results, we discuss the ethical implications of the data based on the norm of non directiveness and try to provide some basic guidelines.

Patients with rare diseases are disadvantaged because the burden of proof is difficult to meet. There are obstacles both for industry and academia to performing large scale randomized, controlled trials.  Moreover, reimbursement rules discourage doctors from prescribing expensive medicines off label, even to small groups of patients. Examples of reimbursement problems with off label medicines are known from many rare disease areas, including genetic disease. Controlled n of one (single patient) trials with internal randomisation (e.g. AB BA BA) could generate new evidence for rare, chronic conditions where the aim of treatment is symptom control.Objective: This project aims to initiate development of an n of  one trial service, embedded in the Dutch health care system. Pilot  implementation will be designed, focusing on neuromuscular diseases as a model. methods: Reimbursement problems with off label medicines for rare  neuromuscular diseases are being inventoried among neuromuscular  specialists and patients with neuromuscular disease in the Netherlands. A consensus meeting will be organized to define legal, ethical and scientific preconditions for formalizing and sustaining an n of one trial service. An  electronic data registry system for n of one trials will be designed, and several protocols will be written for specific trials to be performed in a pilot implementation of the n of one trial service. i mplications: If an n of one trial service is successfully designed, a  subsequent project can pilot trials for off label neuromuscular indications  and eventually others.

DNA degradation analysis in post mortem soft muscle tissues in relation to accumulated degree days (ADD),P01.83,M. S. Nazir,"School of Forensic and Investigative Sciences, University of Central Lancashire, Preston, United Kingdom","After the death of an organism DNA starts to degrade: as the organismâs  cell structure breaks down, nucleases are released and directly cause DNA degradation. Subsequent colonisation, action of insects and microorganisms also contributes to the DNA degradation. As the post mortem interval (PMI) increases, DNA continues to degrade until no  high molecular weight DNA (HMW DNA) remains.In order to assess DNA degradation in the model organisms chosen (pig and rabbit), two nuclear genes, Connexin 43 and RAG 1, were aligned to identify conserved regions. Primers were designed to amplify 70 bp, 194 bp, 305 bp and 384 bp amplicons. The primers were also designed to amplify human DNA, which allowed the use of commercially purchased DNA standards to be used as controls. Following DNA extraction PCR analysis was performed using the four primers sets in a multiplex (4 plex): the PCR was optimised so that it  worked over a wide range of template amounts (0.1 ng to 75.83 ng). The multiplex (4 plex) PCR was found to work efficiently in triplicate samples of all three species down to 0.3 ng of DNA template.This multiplex has been used to assess whether DNA degradation can be predicted by accumulated degree days (ADD), which provides a measure of both time and temperature.Full 4 plex profiles were generated until day 7 (ADD 111.93) from whole carcasses and body fragments and up to day 11 (ADD 172.48) from insect activity free muscle samples.Future work will include; development of real time PCR quantification assays, DNA Fragment analysis and DNA preservation.",2011

No formal recommendations concerning preconception or antenatal testing of carrier status exist in The Netherlands at present. Earlier research identified registration of ethnicity as an issue in deciding not to introduce a screening program  in the past and found that health practitioners did not perceive ethnicity as an increased risk factor.This study investigates attitudes, behaviour and intentions of midwives and FPs towards haemoglobinopathy carrier screening on the basis of ethnicity.Methodology: A structured questionnaire based on the Theory of Planned Behaviour sent to 1800 midwives and 2100 FPsResults: 1346 questionnaires were collected (35% response). Midwives and FPs were positive about offering ethnicity based screening but do  not currently carry this out. Factors explaining intention were social norm, control over the ability to carry out the test and social norm (R 2 0.522). The main factor explaining intention was social norm: their perception of negative peer opinion. If screening would become  national policy most midwives and FPs would carry out ethnicity based haemoglobinopathy carrier screening. Both practitioners favoured ethnicity registration for health purposes.Conclusion: Whether ethnicity based haemoglobinopathy screening is offered, is partially influenced by FPs and midwives perception of their colleaguesâ opinion about carrier testing based on ethnicity. However most are willing to offer screening should this become national policy. In developing new policy, debate amongst midwives and FPs should be encouraged articulating the voices of colleagues who already actively offer haemoglobinopathy screening.

Pregnancy was complicated by vaginal  bleeding in gestational week 32. Furthermore, the mother recognized reduced fetal movements. Sectio was performed in gestational week 41 (APGAR score 3/8/9 at minutes 1/5/10, birth measurements within normal range). Developmental milestones were delayed with sitting  at 8 months, walking at 22 months, first words at about 28 months. At the age of 30 months a brain MRI showed marked hypoplasia of the inferior part of the vermis cerebelli. Investigations regarding inborn errors of metabolism, congenital disorders of glycosylation as well as classical karyotyping were unremarkable. However, array CGH analysis revealed an interstitial 6.92 Mb microdeletion in 10q26. Further investigations showed that the deletion had occurred de novo. This is the first case of a 10q26 microdeletion with an abnormal MRI of the cerebellum.

Both underweight and obesity have been associated with increased  morbidity and mortality. Weight faltering in childhood (or failure to thrive) have long lasting deleterious effects on development, including adverse intellectual outcomes. In contrast to obesity, molecular abnormalities underlying low weight remain elusive. While hemizygosity of a 600 kb  region on the short arm of chromosome 16 (chr16:29.5 30.1Mb) causes a highly penetrant form of obesity often associated with hyperphagia and intellectual disabilities, the corresponding reciprocal duplication is associated with underweight. We identified 108 carriers of this 16p11.2 duplication among 95,000 individuals. These carriers show significantly reduced weight (mean Z score  0.6; p<10  3) and adults have an 8.7  fold (p<10 10) increased risk of being clinically underweight (defined by  a BMI<18.5kg/m2). An early onset gender specific effect was found in  cases ascertained through developmental and intellectual disabilities,  with half of the boys younger than 5 years exhibiting failure to thrive. These features are only detectable postnatally and are associated with an unusually high frequency of selective and restrictive feeding  behaviours. Duplication carriers also have a significant reduced head circumference (p<10  5) which positively correlates with BMI. Weight,  BMI and head circumference phenotypes as well as food intake  behaviours are the converse of those reported in carriers of deletions at this locus, correlating with changes in transcript levels for genes mapping within the CNV, but not within flanking regions. The reciprocal  impact of these 16p11.2 copy number variants evidences that severe obesity and being underweight can have mirror etiologies, possibly through contrasting effects on eating behaviour.",2011

By  using cephalometric methods we evaluated 32 linear and 12 angular measurements of the craniofacial complex. We found smaller linear and larger angular measurements. Even if all face heights were diminished, we recorded a significantly shortening of the length of the anterior and posterior cranial bases, posterior face height, the length of the calvarium and mandibular ramus length, while the mandibular corpus demonstrated only a slight reduction. This can explain the significantly increased SNB angle as a compensatory mechanism between the accentuated shortening of the anterior and the slight  reduction of mandibular corpus, ramus height reduction of was compensated by a smaller gonial angle. The angles between the palatal and occlusal planes and between the palatal and mandibular planes were increased due to the fact that the palatal plane that was canted upwards. The patient was included in skeletal Class III growth pattern and associated a modified dentoalveolar complex with upper incisors having a reduction of the proclination and lower incisors in retrocline position.

The haploinsuficiency of the deleted region is expressed as severe phenotype which includes growth retardation, severe mental retardation, characteristic face, seizures and midline defects in  the brain, heart, palate, hypospadias, etc. The severity of clinical presentation is due to the size of the deleted region, as well as genes involved in the deleted region.We present five children with Wolf Hirshorn syndrome with variable clinical presentation. Present dysmorphic stigmata as Greek helmet like forehead, hyperthelorism, broad nose, short philtrum, low set dysplastic ears, and sacral dimple were classified as minor, mild and severe. Aditional congenital anomalies of the heart, kidneys, genitalia and intestine were taken into the consideration. Seizures were present  in 4 children, and were of variable type. Two of the children have visible cytogenetic deletion, two had microdeletion detected with FISH probe, and one child with less characteristic clinical picture had mosaic type of the deletion.The phenotype of the deletion of the short arm of cheomosome 4 is variable  from minor to full blown clinical presentation with characteristic facial dysmorphism and adjacent malformations. Characteristic appearance resembling âGreek helmetâ facies is the basis for establishing the diagnosis of Wolf Hirschhorn (WH) syndrome. Since it is a contiguous gene syndrome, different regions of chromosome 4p could be deleted.

Pietro Fatebenefratelli Hospital Rome, Italy, Neonatal Intensive Care  Unit, rome, Italy. Craniosynostosis, premature fusion of one ore more cranial sutures,  affects approximately one in 3000 live births. Syndromic trigonocephaly has been associated with chromosomal imbalances or point mutations in single genes. Recently, it has been suggested that rare copy number variants (CNVs) in patients with isolated single suture synostosis could  contain genes important for cranial development. In fact, some of the involved genes play a role in osteoblasts proliferation, apoptosis and differentiation, whose deregulation can evolve in precocious suture closure. We report the case of a 12 months old boy with an apparently isolated craniosynostosis and harboring a de novo microdeletion in the cytoband 4p15. The imbalance, about 4 Mb in size is, up to date, the smallest deletion described in this region, encompassing 12 genes. SLIT2, originally characterized in the nervous system as a guidance factor for axons, looks interesting because it was recently  described to have a role in in vitro osteoblast growth regulation. Further cases of CNVs including SLIT2 would be extremely useful in determining whether its deregulation could be implicated in premature suture closure. Among others, DCAF16 and NCAPG should also be considered for genetype phenotype correlation. In fact, these genes are involved in fundamental cell biological processes, and could be eventually associated with poor brain development. Up to now, developmental steps of our patient looked adequate for his age, but further follow up is needed in order to assess his psychomotor development. Genotype phenotype comparison with other previously described cases with 4p15 deletion will be discussed in detail.",2011

Thirteen AXIN2 SNPs were genotyped using TaqMan chemistry and tested for association with OFC using the Family Based Association Test (FBAT). An association between SNP rs7224837 and OFC was identified in the pooled populations (P,0.001), while SNP rs3923086 showed association with Chinese families from Beijing and Shanghai presenting cleft lip and palate  individuals only (P,0.004).

Background. Familial porencephaly results from cerebral stroke during  pregnancy or around birth and has been described with dominant mutations in the gene encoding for type IV collagen alpha 1 (COL4A1). We observed three porencephaly families that lack COL4A1 mutations. Mice harbouring mutations in either Col4a1  or Col4a2   suffer from cerebral and ocular bleeding and developmental defects.  We hypothesized that COL4A2 mutations could cause porencephaly in families without COL4A1 mutations. Methods. We sequenced COL4A2 in three families with porencephaly,  and characterized clinical, neuroradiological and cellular phenotypes by biochemistry and EM of skin.Results. Sequencing of COL4A2 identified the heterozygous pathogenic mutation Gly1389Arg and two probable pathogenic c.3206delC and Met813Leu in three families with cerebrovascular disease. In  patients with mutations, phenotypes varied including porencephaly, microcephaly, white matter tract abnormalities, secondary cerebellar and optic nerve hypoplasia, stroke at adult age and carotid aneurysm. However, in two families, patients without the mutation were described. In support of pathogenicity, fragmentation and duplication of epidermal basement membranes was observed by electron microscopy in c.3206delC and Met813Leu patient skin biopsies, consistent with abnormal collagen IV network. Cultured fibroblasts of one c.3206delC patient showed significantly increased rates of apoptosis under stress conditions, but, interestingly, no associated signs of ER stress.Conclusions. Dominant COL4A2 mutations are a novel risk factor for porencephaly, stroke and brain developmental defects. Basement membrane defects appear to underly pathology, but abnormal  regulation of apoptosis may be a contributing factor.",2011

Achondroplasia is a common form of chondrodyplasia  with a frequency of 1/15.000   40.000 new borns. It is transmitted by autosomal dominant trait with full penetrance but approximately 75 80% of the cases are caused by de novo mutations. The disease is determined by mutations in receptor 3 gene of the fibroblast growth  factor (FGFR3), mapped to band 4p16.3, resulting in decreased endochondral ossficication, inhibited proliferation of chondrocytes in growth plate cartilage and decreased cartilage matrix. The most frequent mutations (up to 99%) are G1138A and G1183C. The aim of this study is to establish the prevalence of G1138A mutation in FGFR3 gene in patients with achondroplasia in our care.Patients and method. The study group consisted of 27 patients (17 girls and 10 boys), aged between 1 year 8 months   22 years, who were registered in the Centre of Genetic Diseases of First Pediatric  Clinic Cluj in the period 2007 2010. The method consisted in: clinical assessment and radiological examinations (radiograms of the skull, upper and lower limbs, spinal column and pelvis). The DNA analasys was performed by PCR RFLP technique.Results. Between 2007   2010, 80 patients were diagnosed with bone dysplasia; 27 of them (33,75%) were diagnosed (on clinical and radiological basis) with achondroplasia. Out of this group, 13 patients (48,14%) were identified as heterozygotes for G1138A mutation in FGFR3 gene; this prevalence is very low comparatively with other studies (Hung CC, Alderborn A).Conclusions.

Acro Cardio Facial syndrome (ACFS) is a very rare genetic condition  with nine patients been published until now. ACFS is clinically heterogeneous, but split hand and split foot malformation and  congenital heart defect (CHD) are the most important diagnostic features. Other malformations and clinical signs reported are: cleft lip/palate, genital anomalies, facial dysmorphisms and mental retardation. Genetic cause is unknown and autosomal recessive inheritance is supposed.We describe a male born to non consanguineous parents, with hand malformations, CHD and peculiar morphologic facial features. Fetal ultrasound at 20 week gestation showed a complex CHD. At birth, he presented with cleft left hand and lack of flexion at the interphalangeal joints of the fifth right hand finger. On echocardiography the CHD detected consisted of truncus arteriosus type 1, ventricular septal defect and pulmonary atresia. Morphologic features of the face were: high forehead, broad nasal bridge, long philtrum, microretrognatia and large and dysmorphic low set ears. TC scan showed the presence of schisis of the posterior arch of the lumbar vertebrae. Karyotype was 46,XY, and array CGH is ongoing.We underline the clinical variability of this condition and the wide range of malformations reported requiring a multidisciplinary approach. Clinical genetic assessment is important in order to define the  diagnosis and genetic counselling is recommended for parents for high recurrence risk.",2011

Exclusion  criteria included genetically confirmed Marfan syndrome, LoeyseDietz type 2, familial bicuspid aortic valve and EhlerseDanlos type IV syndromes.Multidisciplinary clinical and imaging evaluation, genetic counselling and testing of ACTA2, and family screening.Main outcome measures Prevalence of ACTA2 mutations and corresponding phenotypes. Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology73 Results TAAD was familial in 43 cases and sporadic in 57 cases. Five  mutations in the familial TAAD group (12%) were identified that were absent in controls. The known p.Arg149Cys and the novel p.Asp82Glu, p.Glu243Lys and p.Val45Leu mutations affected evolutionarily conserved residues. The IVS4+1G>A mutation was novel. Of 14  affected relatives, 13 were carriers of the mutation identified in the corresponding proband while one deceased relative had no genetic test. Type A dissection was the first manifestation of aortic aneurysm in four probands and occurred unexpectedly in five relatives. The aortic aneurysm was age dependent and absent in mutated children. Of nine patients who had acute dissection, five died following surgery. At dissection, the size of the aortic aneurysm ranged from 40 mm to 95 mm. Extravascular, ocular, skeletal,  nervous and pulmonary traits were variably associated with TAAD, with iris flocculi being most  common.Conclusions Timely diagnosis of TAAD in the probands, genetic counselling and family screening identify predisposed relatives and prevent catastrophic aortic dissections.",2011

We report the clinical, MRI, and molecular genetic findings of ANE1 in 4 non related French patients. In all patients, the disease was manifested as a rapidly progressing acute febrile encephalopathy. The patients  were previously neurologically normal, with the exception of one child who had residual neurologic problems following a previous febrile encephalopathy.

The disorder was fatal in two patients. The two other patients recovered from the coma but experienced significant neurologic disability. Cerebrospinal fluid protein was consistently elevated among patients during the acute illness. Imaging findings showed multiple symmetrical  lesions affecting primarily the brainstem, the thalami and the external capsule. The four patients were heterozygous for the same missense mutation (c.1880C/T, p.Thr585Met) in the gene (RANBP2).

Apart from classical AGS, the  AGS spectrum comprises atypical AGS, retinal vasculopathy with cerebral leukodystrophy, chilblain lupus, and certain types of systemic lupus erythematosous, linked by a common genetic etiology. All can be caused by mutations in one, typically, of five known genes involved in nucleic acid clearance and/or innate immunity: TREX1, specifying the major 3ââ5â DNA exonuclease in mammals; RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B,  and RNASEH2C, encoding the components of the RNASEH2 RNA:DNA endoribonuclease complex; and SAMHD1. At least another, but minor, AGS related gene is likely to await identification. The AGS system is of both biological and medical interest. For clinical use, we have developed and launched a comprehensive testing package consisting of high throughput conventional sequencing of the coding regions of the above five genes. Our GeneTests listed AGS service is estimated to have a clinical sensitivity around 80% and is available with a target turnaround time of 8 weeks for routine diagnostic requests; responding to urgent diagnostic queries is also possible.

Jagged/Notch interactions are critical for determination of cell fates in early development. JAG1 mutations cause the well known Alagille syndrome (ALGS, MIM: #118450), but  growing evidence implicates this gene in various non syndromic right sided cardiac defects (1).Clinical caseWe report on a case of a 4 year old boy referred for evaluation of peripheral pulmonary stenosis. His weight and height were 20kg (0 SD) and 111cm ( 1SD) respectively. Developmental milestones were normal. He showed some dysmorphic features: broad and prominent nasal bridge with bulbous nasal tip, long upslanting palpebral fissures and broad chin. There were no other clinical or radiological features of  ALGS. Bidirectionnal sequencing of JAG1 (NM_000214.2) revealed a c.820G>T transversion in the exon 6, responsible for a p.Gly274Cys change in the second EGF like repeat.DiscussionThe interest of this case is the link with a previously described large kindred with a JAG1 mutation in the same codon p.Gly274Asp (2). Interestingly, the affected family members presented striking similar facial features and right sided cardiac defects, mainly Tetralogy of Fallot and peripheral pulmonary stenosis, but no other signs of ALGS. These findings suggest a genotype phenotype correlation. Patients with right sided cardiac defects should be carefully screened for dysmorphic features and family history of cardiac defects and even in the absence of other signs of ALGS, JAG1 should be screened.

Of the 87 infants with an/microphthalmia born during this period (prevalence at birth of 2.5 per 10,000), 89.6 % had associated malformations. Infants with associated malformation were divided into recognizable conditions (22 (25.3%) infants with chromosomal and 15 (17.2%) with non chromosomal conditions), and non recognizable conditions (41 (47.1%) infants with multiple malformations). Trisomies 13 and 18 were the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities. Amniotic bands sequence, CHARGE  association, Meckel Gruber syndrome and VACTERL association were most often present in recognizable non chromosomal conditions. Malformations in the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and central nervous systems were the most common other anomalies in infants with multiple malformations and non recognizable conditions. A de novo heterozygous loss of function point mutation in SOX2 was reported in 10 to 20 % of severe bilateral an/microphthalmia. The frequency of associated malformations in infants with anophthalmia and microphthalmia emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of these infants. Routine screening for other malformations especially musculoskeletal, cardiac and central nervous systems anomalies may need to be considered in infants with anophthalmia and microphthalmia, and referral of these infants for genetics evaluation and counseling  seems warranted.",2011

A majority would answer smell.  Despite this, smell has a major impact on our lives, i.e. related to food consumption, daily hygiene, detection of dangerous gasses and partner selection. Approximately 5% of the general population are anosmic, but although many are unaware of their condition, anosmia  has repeatedly been related to loss or gain of weight, depression and generally a poor quality of life. The majority of individuals suffering from anosmia have an acquired condition, which develops throughout life due to head trauma, allergies, sinonasal disease etc. A much smaller minority (~1% of the anosmic population) have no recollection of ever being able to smell and are thus classified as having isolated congenital anosmia (ICA). A genetic origin is likely to explain the anosmia in this group, however human mutations have yet to be found. The scope of this review is to focus on the genetic basis of ICA through  i) published families and cases with ICA, ii) anosmia in combination with other anomalies and iii) olfactory signal transduction pathway genes and animal models which may shed light on potential candidate genes and pathways involved. The lack of knowledge about specific genetic causes of ICA is a challenge but also an opportunity, which should now be within reach by application of the newest technological developments in genetic and genome research.",2011

Immunohistochemistry  (IHC) was performed in 16 myocardial samples from PLN mutation  carriers.Results Mutation R14del in PLN was identified in 31 of 240 (13%)  DCM and 12 of 97 (12%) ARVC index patients. This mutation was also present in an ARVC cohort from a different continent. Haplotype analysis revealed a common founder mutation, estimated to be 575  825 years old. A low voltage ECG was present in 42% of R14del+ patients. R14del+ DCM patients more often demonstrated: appropriate ICD discharge (42% vs. 9%, P<0.001), cardiac transplantation (19% vs. 3%, P<0.01), and a family history for sudden death (35% vs. 14%, P<0.01), when compared to R14del  DCM patients.

A recurrent 4.5 Mb duplication of Xp11.2 has been reported in females with variable degree of intellectual disability and language impairment associated with endocrine abnormalities, epilepsy and skeletal abnormalities.Case report. The proband is the first daughter of healthy non  consanguineous parents. She was born at term with normal antropometric measurements. At age 10, she was diagnosed with a de novo 4,5 Mb Xp11.2p11.23 duplication syndrome because of mild intellectual disability and speech delay, hirsutism, obesity and epilepsy.At age 12, she presented with rapidly progressive proximal muscle weakness of arms and legs. A positive Tensilon test was suggestive for Myasthenia Gravis. EMG evaluation revealed low evoked compound motor action potentials, consistent with Lambert Eaton myasthenic syndrome (LEMS). LEMS is a paraneoplastic disorder of neuromuscular  transmission, based on auto immunity to the voltage gated calcium channel. Only rare cases have been reported in childhood. Reviewing the histories of other female patients reported with a similar Xp11.2 duplication revealed that 3 out of 11 patients suffered from (potential) auto immune disease such as rectocolitis, Wegenerâs granulomatosis and hypothyroidism with hyperinsulinism.Conclusion. The observation of a rare autoimmune myasthenic syndrome in a young patient with a Xp11.2 duplication in conjunction with previously reported autoimmune disorders suggest that carrier females of this recurrent duplication might have a propensity towards autoimmune disease. Some genes within the duplication are involved in either immune response (e.g. FOXP3) or calcium homeostasis (e.g. RGN) and could have a potential role in the occurence of auto  immunity in general or LEMS specifically.",2011

The exact aetiology of autism remains unknown, although it is likely to result from a complex combination  of genetic, neurological, and environmental factors. Recent high resolution microarray based studies in autism have identified a number of novel submicroscopic copy number variants (CNVs) including both deletions and duplications.We report two children with autistic behavior and mental retardation. We have used genomic array CytoChip Oligo (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK), format 2x105K, version 1.1. and BlueFuse Multi software, version 2.2. The 2x105K array detects 35 Kb imbalances on the backbone and has tiling of 20 probes over 137 OMIM disease loci. Array CGH  Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology77 analysis revealed cryptic deletion of 16p11.2 region spanning 513 kb  in first patient and an amplification spanning 1,624 Mb of Xp22.31 region in second patient. Deletions and duplications at chromosome 16p11.2 appear to be associated with ~1% of unexplained, idiopathic and nonsyndromic autism. Several of the genes that reside within  the 16p11.2 microdeletion represent promising candidates for autism based on known expression and functional data. Submicroscopic duplication of Xp22.31 has been reported as either a possible cause of intellectual disability and/or autistic behavior or a benign variant. .

Our experience in clinical genetics proved that childhood autism is a heterogeneous syndrome. The aim of our work was to analyze children with autism for mitochondrial DNA mutations and discuss the possibility of their treatment. We made clinical and laboratory investigations and sequenced mt DNA regions in peripheral blood by the PCR SBT method in 4 of our patients with autism.We found different mt DNA mutations and polymorphisms. In a girl suspected for Rett syndrome we found G6852A in mt CO1,which  changed Gly>Ser. In the 3 boys with autism we found the polymorphism T4216C (connected with predisposition to LHON or insulin resistance) in the first,the polymorphism G9055A (protective of Parkinson disease) in the second, and a polymorphism connected with predisposition to LHON in the third. The children with mt DNA changes improved on treatment with a casein  and gluten free diet and high dose vitamin Q10.

To date, several genes and loci on chromosomes 4, 6, 13 and 16 have been found to be associated with ARS, among them mutations in PITX2 and FOXC1, which are responsible for the majority of ARS cases.We are reporting a neonate who was born at 32 weeks due to non immune hydrops and maternal mirror syndrome. Ocular findings in this patient consisted of bilateral anterior segment dysgenesis, glaucoma and posterior embryotoxon. Facial dysmorphic features included edema of head and face, depressed nasal bridge, hypertelorism,  upturned nose and posteriorly rotated, low set ears. MRI of the brain showed slightly small vermis, and echocardiogram revealed PFO and PDA.No mutations were found on sequencing of PITX2 and FOXC1, with  MLPA studies pending. Microarray analysis revealed a duplication at chromosome 3p26 of unknown significance, and parental chromosomal studies are pending.This case is the first report of an ARS patient with non immune hydrops fetalis, further expanding the phenotypic spectrum in this group of disorders.

BBS is typically inherited in as autosomal recessive manner. Fourteen genes are known to be associated with BBS: BBS1, BBS2, ARL6/BBS3,  BBS4, BBS5, MKKS/BBS6, BBS7, TTC8/BBS8, B1/BBS9, BBS10,  TRIM32/BBS11, BBS12, MKS1/BBS13, and CEP290/BBS14 . In some  families, mutations in more than one BBS gene may result in a clinical  phenotype of BBS. However, such families are difficult to identify and may account for less than 10% of all BBS patients.The object of this study was to detect the mutation spectrum of BBS genes in our patients. probands of 10 Iranian families with clinical symptoms of BBS were tested for BBS1 and BBS2 gene mutations, which account for 23% and 20% of the mutations in BBS patients.  Sequencing of BBS1 and BBS2 genes revealed a heterozygous mutation in one of the families, and 4 novel polymorphisms (c420, GCC>CCC, Ala>Pro, c424, AAA>AAT, Ala>Asn, c. 428 GCC>TCC, Ala>Ser & c.227 GAG>CAG, Glu>Gln) in BBS1 gene. We could not detect any mutation except one polymorphism in BBS2 gene. Since we could not detect any mutations in the two most prevalent genes which account for over 40% of the mutations in BBS patients, our results suggest that other known or population specific genes may be involved in pathogenesis of BBS in Iranian population. Sequencing of the remaining genes is under way.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology78",2011

This has allowed a comprehensive prospective clinical and genetic study of a cohort of boys with BTHS. We have shown that BTHS is a multisystem disorder or syndrome. Facial dysmorphism gives BTHS boys a recognisable appearance. Other features include early short stature followed by later tall stature, a nonspecific skeletal myopathy and food fads. Dilated cardiomyopathy and left ventricular compaction both occur and conduction defects are common and a cause of sudden death. Transplantation in earlier life is successful. Neutropenia may be cyclical and responds to treatment with GCSF.Pedigree analysis showed that families had a history of miscarriages,  stillbirths and male neonatal deaths. One family had three pregnancies presenting as fetal hydrops in the mid trimesterCaused by mutations in TAZ , BTHS can be reliably diagnosed by measuring cardiolipin. This is a cheaper and quicker diagnostic test which can be followed by TAZ analysis in order to detect female carriers. Retrospective diagnosis in affected males has been made on samples from newborn screening tests.Based on our figures for the prevalence of BTHS in the south west of England we suspect that BTHS remains and underdiagnosed condition and should be screened for in all boys presenting with cardiomyopathy and neutropenia and suspected in families with multiple unexplained male fetal loss or sudden death.",2011

BWS is caused by defective expression of imprinted genes (IGF2, H19, CDKN1C ,  KCNQ1, KCNQ1OT1) located on chromosome 11p15.5. The genes  are functionally divided into two domains that are controlled by  two Imprinting Centers: IC1 (H19DMR) and IC2 (KvDMR1). The most common defects in BWS patients are uniparental paternal disomy at 11p15.5 region, gain of methylation at IC1 and loss of methylation at IC2. Here we present six Polish patients with clinical diagnosis of BWS. Molecular analysis was performed by methylation sensitive multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification using MS MLPA BWS/RSS ME030 B2 kit (MRC Holland). The kit enables determination of methylation status of the 11p15.5 region, as well as  duplications or deletions in that region. The analysis demonstrated hypomethylation in KvDMR1 region in four patients, hypermethylation of H19DMR region in one patient and both KvDMR1 hypomethylation and H19DMR hypermethylation in one patient. Molecular analysis confirmed the diagnosis of BWS in all investigated patients.

Rapid genetic counseling and testing (RGCT) may aid in making informed decisions about therapeutic and preventive surgery and adjuvant treatment. Little is known about the effect of RGCT on  treatment decisions and psychosocial health. We are currently carrying out a randomized controlled trial to investigate these issues. m ethods: Newly diagnosed breast cancer patients with minimally  10% risk of a BRCA1/2 mutation have been recruited from 12 Dutch  hospitals. They were randomized to an intervention group (RGCT) or a usual care control group. Study outcomes include uptake of RGCT, surgery choice, cancer risk perception, cancer specific distress, quality of life and decisional satisfaction. Assessments take place at study entry, and at 6 and 12 months follow up.Results: Between November 2008 and December 2010, 271 women  were recruited and randomized to the intervention (n,184) or control (n,87) group. Currently, 106 women have completed all assessments (intervention group n,70). Of the 70 women in the intervention group, 63 chose DNA testing (90%) and 40 (57%) opted for accelerated DNA test procedures: 22 (31%) for rapid testing (<4 weeks) and 18 (26%) for semi rapid testing (4 weeks 4 months). Normally, test results are only available after 4 months. Eight (13%) patients were BRCA1/2  mutation carriers. c onclusion: Preliminary results indicate high uptake of RGCT among  high risk breast cancer patients.

In this study, we  report on the clinical data and the C16orf57 molecular analysis in  10 RECQL4 negative patients referred for syndromic poikiloderma.  Other symptoms included photosensitivity (6/10), growth retardation  (2/9), dysmorphism (6/10), dysplastic hair (7/10), nail dystrophy (2/10), bone abnormalities (1/10) and cataract (1/10). None had absent knee caps, gastrointestinal problems nor osteosarcoma. Two C16orf57   heterozygous nonsense mutations (p.W81X and p.Y89X) were identified in one 5 year old patient presenting with dental dysplasia, gingivitis, nail dystrophy, palmoplantar keratoderma, pachyonychia of the great toenails and generalized poikiloderma. No history of recurrent infections was reported. Previously undetected neutropenia was discovered after C16orf57 molecular analysis. Neutropenia  was absent in C16orf57  negative patients. Our report confirms that  neutrophil count should be performed in all patients with poikiloderma to target the C16orf57 gene sequencing analysis, prior to RECQL4  study.",2011

Background and Purpose. CADASIL (Cerebral Autosomal Dominant  Arteriopathy with Subcortical Infarcts and Leukoencephalopathy) is a rare genetic disease caused by mutations in the NOTCH3 gene. A dysfunction in vasoreactivity has been proposed as early event in the  pathogenesis of the disease. Aims of our study was to verify whether endothelium dependent and  independent function is impaired in CADASIL patients compared to age , gender matched controls stratified by the presence of cardiovascular risk factors (CVRF). m ethods. We studied vasoreactivity in 49 CADASIL patients (30  65 years), 32 male (58%) without significant disability (Rankin scale score equal or less than 2) and 25 controls by a non invasive pletismographic method. Endothelium dependent vasodilation was assessed by reactive hyperemia (FMD PAT) while endothelium independent vasoreactivity was studied by glyceryl trinitrate (GTN PAT) administration.Results. FMD PAT scores were similar (1.88 [1.57 2.43] vs 2.08 [1.81 2.58], P,ns), while GTN PAT values were significantly lower in  CADASIL (1.54 [1.01 2.25] than controls 1.89 [1.61 2.59], P,0.041). Among CADASIL patients, values below the 10 percentile of FMD PAT scores in the control population were found in 17 (35%) , P,0.013.  FMD PAT and GTN PAT values correlated significantly both in controls (rho,0.648 P<0.001) and CADASIL patients (rho,0.563 P<0.001) c onclusions . The impaired vasoreactivity observed in our CADASIL  patients highlights that both endothelial and smooth muscle  functional alterations may occur already in pre symptomatic subjects. The improvement of vascular function could be a new target for pharmacological trials in the CADASIL population.",2011

Chromosomal abnormalities have been described rarely. Access to  genetic testing is limited. Aim: To investigate the role and prevalence  of copy number variants in patients with CM.  m ethods: We performed  CGH (comparative genomic hybridisation) on 120 patients with varied brain abnormalities, recruited through the Oxford Brain Abnormalities Research Group, using customized 4x180K Agilent technologies arrays. Twenty five of these patients presented with a CM. Results:  4/25 patients (16 %) were found to have a microarray abnormality.  Three of the abnormalities were on the X chromosome (involving CASK and OPHN1) and the remaining was a homozygous deletion (involving NPHP1). The cerebellar phenotypes associated with these findings ranged from mild vermis hypoplasia to cerebellar hypoplasia with brainstem involvement. Clinically, ataxia and developmental delay were the most consistent findings, although developmental delay ranged from mild to severe. Other putative aberrations were identified, but have not been proven to be pathogenic as yet.  c onclusion : CGH  is a useful genetic test for determining the cause of CM. X linked CM should be kept in mind due to its implication on reproductive risks.

She is the first child of young and healthy non consanguineous parents. Familial history was negative. The pregnancy was complicated by preterm labor and threatened abortion. She was born by cesarean due to pelvic presentation. The clinical evaluation of the proposita showed hypotonia, a broad forehead, high hairline in front and back, oval facial shape, sparse hair and eyebrows, low set and malformed ears, telecanthus, down slanting palpebral fissures, convergent strabismus, infantile hemangioma in front, glabela and philtrum, small nose, microstomia,  retrognathism, and proximally set thumbs. A cranial computed tomography scan showed abnormal enlargement of sulci and cistern around the brain, with predominance of frontal areas. Echocardiogram revealed interventricular communication with hemodynamic effect. The cytogenetic analysis with GTG banding karyotype showed 47,XX,+mar. Based on dysmorphic features and cytogenetics characteristics, it was performed FISH with the centromeric probe chromosome 18, confirming the origin of the chromosome marker.

During clinical examination additional phenotypic features (mental retardation, hidden facial cleft, epicanthi, clinodactyly) were found. She had verbal development delay, and normal hematological  parameters.Cytogenetic analysis was performed to identify chromosome aberrations. Two consecutive karyotyping was carried out to confirm primary finding. Lymphocytes from peripheral blood samples were obtained from 72 h mitogen stimulated cultures, prepared according to standard cytogenetic procedures.

The HindIII  and YAP Y chromosome variants previously shown to influence blood pressure, lipid traits or height were typed in 3026 and 2783 samples. In addition 4 subgroups (N~100 each) representing extremes of LDL concentration or blood pressure (BP) were typed for a panel of SNPs defining main Y chromosome haplogroups and 19 STRs. The HindIII or YAP polymorphism were not associated with any of the studied traits. Extended analyses suggested a link between haplogroup  N3* and lower mean diastolic BP (P,0.009) but this finding was not replicated when a larger group of subjects (N,1077) was analyzed (P,0.69, a trend in opposite direction). Analysis of STRs did not show statistically significant differences apart from the DYS385II marker whose distribution suggested effects on both BP (P,0.015) and LDL (P,0.034) concentration. In conclusion, our study shows that the widely studied Y chromosome HindIII variant and the YAP variant do not influence blood pressure, lipid traits or anthropological characteristic. Although we cannot exclude an association between DYS385II and BP/LDL concentration our results do not support a major role of Y  chromosome genetic variation as defined by major Y chromosome haplogroups in determining cardiovascular risk in Poles.",2011

Van der Woude syndrome (VWS, OMIM #119300) is a dominantly  inherited developmental disorder characterized by pits and/or conical elevations of the lower lip, cleft lip and/or palate, and hypodontia. Popliteal pterygium syndrome (PPS, OMIM #119500) shares the clinical features of VWS, with the addition of other signs such as  popliteal webs (pterygia), synechiae connecting the upper and lower jaws, ankyloblepharon, syndactyly and genital anomalies.Since many signs occur in the orofacial region and the penetrance is incomplete, it is of great interest to better characterize VWS/PPS patients to see if an oral phenotype genotype correlation exists. For this, nineteen families (17 VWS + 2 PPS) from Trousseau hospital (Paris) were seen by a multidisciplinary staff, focusing on the orofacial phenotype. Panoramic imaging were used to check for dental agenesis.The coding exons of the IRF6 gene, including intron exon boundaries,  were sequenced, and Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification was performed to test for intragenic deletions or amplifications. We identified a mutation in IRF6 in 82% (14/17) of VWS and 100% (2/2) of PPS families. Affected individuals had clefts (79%), lower lip pits (78%), dental agenesis (72%), and abnormal dental morphology (60%). The upper lateral incisors and the second upper premolars were the most affected.This prospective study demonstrates the high frequency of dental anomalies in VWS/PPS patients, affecting mostly the upper lateral incisors and the second upper permanent premolars.

To the best of our knowledge, cholestatic liver disease was not previously reported  in these patients.Aim: To highlight the presence of cholestasis and liver dysfunction in this group of patients and to suggest modified criteria for clinical diagnosis. m ethods: The study included nine patients with CS from four different  families (five males and four females) in which CS was suspected  clinically. For all patients cytogenetic analysis revealed spontaneous chromosomal breakage that was increased after mitomycin C treatment. Diagnosis was confirmed by DNA repair assay. Results: Seven of these patients had evident liver affection ranging from mild elevation in liver enzymes to cholestatic liver disease and liver cell failure. The attacks were recurrent in two patients and were sometimes preceded by infection. These attacks may lead to deterioration of liver condition or neurological symptoms or it may end in liver cell failure that may recover completely or it may end in death. c onclusion:  liver disease could be considered common in Egyptian  patients with CS with the cholestatic form being the most evident.  Chromosomal breakage study and positive family history should be included as major criteria for clinical diagnosis of CS especially in a population like ours whereas consanguineous marriage is very high and molecular testing and UV sensitivity tests are considered  unaffordable.",2011

There were 5 girls and 11 boys; 10 had associated situs inversus totalis, 5 had situs solitus and 1 heterotaxy. Heart defects were present in 10 children (62.5%)   septal defect (27.7%), Fallot tetralogy (12.5%), transposition of great arteries (12.5%), aortic stenosis (6.25%), single ventricle(6.25%), left ventricle hypoplasia (6.25%), anomalous venous return (6.25%) and mitral valve prolapse (6.25%). The prevalence of heart defects was similar in boys (63.63%) and girls (60%). Complex heart defects were present only in males and more frequent in situs solitus and heterotaxy group (50%) than in situs inversus group (40%). In the literature common atrium, septal defects, pulmonic stenosis, transposition of great arteries and right aortic arch are the most frequent congenital heart defects associated with dextrocardia. In conclusion we present a study of 16 cases with dextrocardia, 62.5% of them having heart defects. Cardiac defects are commonly associated with dextrocardia and males are more severely  affected than females.

Recently, an X linked form of CdLS with milder  phenotype was attributed to mutation of the structural maintenance of chromosomes 1A gene (SMC1A) at Xp11.22. Only a handful of male CdLS patients with mutations in SMC1A are known. The phenotype in female carriers is limited to minor developmental and cognitive deficiency.

We report a Turner mosaic female with a severe form of CdLS who presented with growth and mental retardation, multiple congenital anomalies and facial dysmorphism. Array CGH identified a  novel deletion of SMC1A spanning multiple exons which suggested a possible loss of function effect. Additional molecular studies were initiated to more precisely define the deletion boundaries and the effect of this genetic alteration. Expression of a truncated RNA message was detected in lymphocytes. Sequencing of both genomic and cDNA demonstrated an 8,152 base pair deletion of genomic DNA  from exon 13 to intron 16.

CFNS is an X linked disorder with an unusual pattern of inheritance, as heterozygous females are more severely affected than hemizygous males. The CFNS causing  gene is EFNB1, localized in the border region of chromosome Xq12 and Xq13.1, encoding for protein ephrin B1. Ephrin B1 belongs to the B subclass of ligands of Eph receptors (receptor tyrosine kinases). Eph/ephrin signaling is important for the developmental processes of the embryo, including skeletal and craniofacial development. Here we aim to investigate the underlying genetic defect of a young girl with CFNS. The patient underwent surgical correction of her craniofacial deformities. Genetic analysis was carried out by Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). Products of exon 2 of EFNB1 gene were sequenced  as well as digested with BpmI enzyme. A novel de novo missense mutation 373G>A was identified within EFNB1 gene, leading to the replacement of Glutamic acid at amino acid position 125 with Lysine. The replacement of Glu125 with Lys, which lies within the G H loop, part of the dimerization ligand receptor interface, is expected to disrupt the interaction between Eph receptor and ephrin B1 ligand, thus leading to CFNS. Missense mutations in exon 2 of EFNB1 gene in patients with CFNS leading to aminoacid changes within the dimerization ligand receptor interface have been described elsewhere.",2011

The chromosomal region implicated in the syndrome has been mapped to 5p15.1p15.3. Main clinical features are a high pitched cat like cry, distinct facial features, microcephaly and severe psychomotor and mental retardation. The phenotype varies  depending on the size and location of the deletion. The critical regions for the typical cry and the mental retardation have been mapped to 5p15.3 and 5p15.2, respectively. SEMA5A and CTNND2  located within  the 5p15.2 critical interval have been suggested as candidate genes for the mental retardation. CTNND2  is highly expressed in the brain,  and is implicated in neuronal function. Furthermore, CTNND2 knock  out mice show severe cognitive dysfunction, and a correlation between deletion of CTNND2 and severe mental retardation in humans has been reported.

Several genetic defects have been elucidated to cause cutis laxa, still, the etiology in the majority of cases remains unknown. We describe a CL patient with duplication of the short arm of chromosome 11. Our patient had birth parameters at 90 percentiles, cutis laxa, cleft  lip, several dysmorphic features, macroglossia, deep palmar/plantar creases, abnormal hair growth and hypotonia. She was diagnosed with hyperinsulinism, Meckel diverticulum, umbilical and inguinal hernias, ventricular septum defect, aqueductal stenosis feeding difficulties and developmental delay. Histology of skin showed severe abnormalities of elastin fibers. Genetic analysis revealed a duplication of 11p of paternal origin, which is associated with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS). Many features in our patient are explained by the diagnosis of BWS, except for cutis laxa. Several clinical findings in  our patient, including extensive skin wrinkling, could, however, also fit into the diagnostic criteria of CS. Intriguingly, the HRAS gene, in which  gain of function mutations cause CS, is also located on 11p15.5. QPCR analysis in our patient showed an increase in HRAS expression  in fibroblasts. Based on this genetic dosage effect and the observation of similar phenotypes in other 11p duplication cases we suggest that cutis laxa and the clinical features comparable to those of Costello Syndrome in our patient, occurred due to duplication of HRAS.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology88",2011

Cytochrome P450 2C19 (CYP2C19) gene has several polymorphisms,  the most common of which are the CYP2C19* 2 and CYP2C19* 3 alleles.These two polymorphisms both decrease enzyme activity. This study was performed to evaluate the influences of two common CYP2C19 polymorphisms on the frequencies of typical and atypical symptoms in the Iranian patients with gastroesophageal reflux disease. m ethods: One hundred and sixteen patients with gastroesophageal  reflux disease were enrolled in the study. A gastroesophageal reflux  questionnaire was completed for each patient by direct interview. It was comprised of information such as age, sex, BMI and symptoms  of disease. A volume of 2 ml of venous blood was sampled from each subject. CYP2C19 genetic polymorphisms were detected using the PCR RFLP method.Results: There was an association between the frequencies of some atypical gastroesophageal reflux disease symptoms such as belching, anorexia, chest pain and hoarseness and CYP2C19 polymorphism, as the frequencies of these symptoms were higher in the variant CYP2C19 genotype (P<0.040). c onclusion:  CYP2C19 genotype might influence the appearances of  some atypical symptoms in the patients with gastroesophageal reflux  disease.",2011

A subset of X linked genes escape X inactivation (XI)  and are expressed   randomly or skewed   from both X chromosomes.  We report on 2 patients affected with 2 genetically different forms of X linked hypercalciuric nephrolithiasis (Dent disease 1 and 2) mapped to Xp11.22 and Xq26, respectively. We hypothesized that  X inactivation patterns might suggest the more likely genetic subtype. Here we discuss the clinical impact of XI results.Case reports and results. 2 male unrelated normally developed patients, 4 and 5 y old, both with proteinuria, hypercalciuria, hypouricaemia and microhematuria with normal renal function. Dent disease, an X linked proximal tubular dysfunction disorder, was confirmed by molecular analysis showing a mutation in the CCl5 gene in patient 1 and OCRL1 mutation patient 2. X inactivation studies revealed a significant skewing in the mother of proband 1 and random XI in the other. Discussion.  Non random X inactivation is more common in  heterozygous carriers of X linked disorders and can be an important diagnostic clue in MRX syndromes. Moreover, there may be a distinct correlation between the clustered fashion of genes which escape inactivation and the likelihood of skewing. Our observation of clearly different XI patterns in two clinically similar but genetically different subtypes of an X linked tubulopathy supports this relationship. Given the multitude of X gene loci of interest this may be useful for the proper timing of molecular investigations. Additional XI analyses in other females heterozygous for Dent disease are needed to prove this hypothesis.",2011

Purpose: It has been estimated that 20% to 50% of idiopathic DCM  cases are of familial/genetic origin, generally with autosomal dominant inheritance, but information about the efficiency of mutation screening is scarce.Methods : We report the results of ongoing genetic and familial study  of 125 index cases with idiopathic DCM (mean age at diagnosis 44Â±20 years, 74% males) followed up in a single reference unit. DCM was considered âfamilialâ when there was at least one relative with DCM. Genetic study has included the screening by a Sequenom platform of 600 previously described mutations and the sequencing of LMNA in all the patients.Results: Familial DCM was present in 29 cases (23%). Till now we identified a potentially pathogenic mutation in 21 cases (13%): 9 of 29 in cases with familial DCM (31%), and 12 in 96 (13%) in non  familial cases (p,0.024). The majority of them were identified in MYH7 (45%) MyBPC3 (25%) and LMNA (20%). Thirteen mutations had been previously described in association with either DCM (LMNA: R190W, S573L; MYH7: I201T; TNNT2: R131W), HCM (MYH7: G716R ; MyBPC3: IVS23+1G>A, A833T, V771M and A627V) or both (MYH7: I736T, R787H, T1019N and MYH6: A1004S). Five mutations had not been previously described (LMNA:S22X, R349L; MyBPC3: P873L, E838Q and MYH7: A1128T). We found two double and one compound heterozygote. Conclusion: The probability to identify a causal mutation was significantly higher in patients with familial vs. non familial idiopathic DCM thus, familial evaluation would be the first step to improve the mutation screening efficiency in DCM.",2011

The child was admitted to our hospital for seizures, fever secondary to pharyngitis and dysmorphic facial features. Anthropometric criteria revealed short stature (height 73 cm, below 3rd percentile) and dystrophy (weight 9200 g, below 3rd  percentile). The child presented with an unusually small mouth, small teeth with dentinal spots and improper alignment, small chin, small eyes, incipient cataract; small head and a prominent forehead, a small underdeveloped jaw, sparse hair, particularly that of the scalp, brows, and lashes. On the right cheek there was a scar secondary to surgical intervention for a mucous cyst done in the neonatal period. The karyotype of the child was 46, XY, 16qh+.

Recent data suggest that a recurrent 1,35 Mb microduplication on chromosome 1q21.1 predisposes to autism spectrum disorder, developmental delay and mental retardation. Other clinical features include macrocephaly, hypertelorism and a wide range of congenital anomalies. Variable expressivity, incomplete penetrance and non specific phenotypic features associated with 1q21.1 microduplication complicate genetic diagnosis and counselling.We report on two unrelated girls of two and three years old, presenting with developmental delay and similar facial dysmorphism such as  hypertelorism, flat nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nostrils, prominent philtrum and thin upper lip.

Timing of diagnosis varied from antenatally to adult age. Genetic counselling is possible at the adult age. Diagnosis was confirmed in all patients by biochemical studies or mutation analysis showing characteristic mutations in COL1A1 and COL1A2, resulting in skipping of exon 6, leading to the production of abnormal procollagen and defective collagen synthesis.For physicians treating patients with EDS type VII achieving mobility for the patient is the greatest challenge. The prognosis for achieving independent walking may be poor due to recurrent dislocations of nearly all joints in severe cases. We stress the importance of a diagnosis at various ages.",2011

De Paepe1","1Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium,  2Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research Center, Cochin, Kerala,  India","Musculo contractural Ehlers Danlos syndrome (MC EDS) is a recently described autosomal recessive form of EDS characterized by craniofacial abnormalities, congenital joint contractures, especially of fingers and toes, talipes equinovarus, tapering fingers and excessive palmar wrinkling, severe progressive muscle hypotonia and multi  systemic tissue fragility with ophtalmological, gastro intestinal and genito urinary manifestations, in addition to skin fragility, wound healing problems, bleeding diathesis and joint hyperlaxity. The condition is caused by homozygous mutations in CHST14, encoding dermatan 4 sulfotransferase 1 (D4ST 1). The clinical phenotype of MC EDS strongly overlaps with that of adducted thumb clubfoot syndrome (ATCS), and with a Japanese EDS variant, âEDS Kosho typeâ, two conditions that were independently shown to be caused by CHST14 mutations. Detailed phenotypic analysis of the 20 patients reported  with CHST14 mutations strongly suggests that these conditions form a single entity with multi systemic, but age dependent and variable phenotypic features, of which joint contractures and generalized muscle weakness are distinguishing features, hence the name âmusculo contractural EDSâ.Hitherto reported CHST14 mutations comprise six missense, two frameshift and one nonsense mutation, some of which were shown to result in loss of function of D4ST 1. This is a key enzyme in the biosynthesis of dermatan sulfate (DS), catalyzing 4 O sulfation of N acetyl galactosamine. Loss of D4ST 1 activity results in the replacement of DS by chondroitin sulfate. The broad array of physiological events in which DS plays a role, including the correct assembly of collagen fibrils mediated by decorin, a DS proteoglycan,  explains the multisystemic manifestations of this condition.",2011

Introduction: Ehlers Danlos syndrome (EDS) is a connective tissue  disorder characterized by skin hyperextensibility, abnormal wound healing and joint hypermobility. Clinical and genetic heterogeneity is described. Classification of patients in the several subtypes is sometimes difficult. We report on a patient with Osteogenesis  Imperfecta / Ehlers Danlos phenotype (OI/ED) and COL1A1 gene mutation.Clinical Report: The patient, a 6 years old boy, was referred at 17 months of age with clinical diagnosis of Osteogenesis imperfecta. Motor retardation, fractures, osteopenia, blue sclerae, macrocephaly, short stature and dysmorphic features. Physical examination revealed fine hyperextensible skin, abnormal healing, easy bruising, hyperextensible joints, lumbar kyphoscoliosis, pectus excavatum, long fingers and toes and inguinal herniae. Clinically suggestive of Ehlers  Danlos syndrome. We started treatment with byphosphonates due to bone fragility. Biochemical collagen analysis in cultured fibroblasts was performed with identification of an extra band migrating above the type I collagen chain. Molecular analysis of COL1A1 gene revealed a de novo heterozygous mutation in exon 8 c.607G>T (p.Gly203Cys, Gly25Cys). These results support clinical diagnosis of combined OI / ED phenotype.Discussion: A new mutation associated to OI / ED phenotype is described. This report extends the range of phenotypes caused by COL1A1 gene mutations. Consider treatment with byphosphonates in patient with Ehlers Danlos syndrome and bone fragility.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology92",2011

The syndrome is either caused by a 9q34.3 submicroscopic  deletion (75 %) or by intragenic euchromatin histone methyl transferase 1 (EHMT1) mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of the gene.We evaluated 42 patients referred by clinical geneticists presenting with the core phenotype of the syndrome but no deletion identified by routine subtelomere or whole genome chromosome testing. The molecular analyses included a screen for small intragenic EHMT1 deletions by MLPA and direct sequencing of the 27 exons for point mutations identification.In total, 9 intragenic mutations or deletions were found that are  highly likely pathogenic. 4 small deletions were identified by MLPA. 5 mutations predicted to result in nonsense mediated mRNA decay were found by sequencing: 1 previously described nonsense change (p.Arg620X) and 4 novel frameshift mutations (p.Glu342fs, p.Glu187fs, p.Val1026fs, c.2018_2018 +3 del 4). De novo occurrence was confirmed when DNA from both parents were available. As previously described, mutations were spread all over the gene.Frequently associated features reported in the Kleefstra syndrome such as obesity, congenital heart defect or epilepsy do not seem to be as frequent in our patients suggesting that genes, apart from EHMT1, included in larger deletions may be implicated in the phenotype.",2011

ESES related epilepsy syndromes share an association of infrequent seizures, deficits in language or global cognitive functioning and behavioural problems. The aetiology is often  unknown, but genetic risk factors have been implicated.Aim of the study: To detect copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with ESES syndrome in order to identify possible underlying genetic risk factors. m ethods: We included a consecutive series of patients with ESES  between January 2000 en August 2009, at the Paediatric Neurology  outpatient Clinic of the University Medical Centre Utrecht. CNVs were identified by array comparative genomic hybridization. To gain more insight into the pathogenic contribution of the identified CNVs,  we reviewed the literature, searched in databases for similar CNVs in patients and studied the function of the genes located within the CNVs. We compared the clinical characteristics of patients with CNVs and patients without CNVsResults: We detected seven CNVs in four of the thirteen patients with  ESES,    which consisted of six novel gains and one loss, the recurrent  15q13.3 microdeletion. The copy number variant genes in two of these patients belonged to the cholinergic pathway. There were no differences in clinical characteristics between patients with CNVs and patients without CNVs. c onclusion: Our data on CNVs in patients with ESES indicate that  specific chromosomal loci and genes may be involved in the aetiology  of ESES. In particular, our findings point towards putative alterations in  the cholinergic pathway.",2011

Pseudoxanthoma  elasticum (PXE) is another autosomal recessive multisystem disorder characterized by ectopic mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers of connective tissue including skin, arteries, and the eye. Classic PXE results from mutations in the ABCC6 gene.We report on two unrelated children with an unusual phenotypic overlap of GACI and PXE. They both presented with neonatal articular and vascular calcifications, with favourable evolution. Later in infancy, both patients developed abnormal mineralization in a number of organs, including ear ossicles, kidney, and eyes, associated with  hypophosphatemic rickets. Angiomatous cutaneous lesions were noted in both patients. The older patient presented also with PXE skin lesions, confirmed by histology. In both patients presence of ENPP1 mutations, and absence of ABCC6 mutations was demonstrated.This particular phenotype, overlapping between PXE and GACI appears to be associated with a better prognosis than the classical GACI with respect to vascular calcifications.Since ABCC6 was recently discussed as the causative gene in a case of GACI without mutations in ENPP1, we demonstrate here that, conversely, ENPP1 may be involved in some cases of PXE in the absence of ABCC6 mutations. We conclude that ENPP1 and ABCC6 are probably involved in the same molecular pathway.",2011

Congenital contractures are common and may be caused by reduced fetal  movements due to myasthenia gravis. Hereditary causes of congenital myasthenic syndrome have also been identified, mostly mutations in subunits of nicotinergic acetylcholine receptor (AChR). The AChR is composed of five subunits; two alpha, one beta and one delta subunit are invariably present. The gamma subunit (CHRNG gene) is present before the 33rd wk of gestation in humans but is replaced by a subunit in the late fetal and perinatal period, thereby forming the adult AChR. m A t ER i AL s  AND  m E t HOD s : Proband case was a four year old  male.

We describe a woman with no relevant clinical history until age 70,  when she underwent right hemicolectomy for multiple colonic polyps. Pathology examination revealed 40 adenomas, one of which, showing cancer foci, tested negative for microsatellite instability. At age 76 the patient developed an ampullar adenoma and at age 77 she underwent  surgery for lung adenocarcinoma (she is non smoker with no other lung cancer risk factors). Family history was negative for polyposis but her father and brother died at a young age for stroke, while her niece died at age 40 for medulloblastoma. Search for germline mutations in polyposis genes detected the heterozygous mutation c.6156delG (p.L2052fs) in APC, whereas MYH was wild type. The c.6156delG mutation was found in both duodenal adenoma and lung adenocarcinoma at the heterozygous state, excluding the loss of the wild type allele in tumor tissue. To our knowledge, the c.6156delG mutation has not been reported before. Its location at the 3â terminus of the gene may explain the attenuated colonic phenotype in this patient, consistently with the reported genotype phenotype correlations, but such extracolonic manifestations were unexpected. However, although molecular analysis on tumor tissue failed to find LOH, several factors suggest that the APC mutation may be the cause of the neoplasms arisen in the family: i) 50% of patients with classic FAP develop ampullar adenomas; ii) adenocarcinoma of the lung has been reported in three patients with FAP; iii) APC mutations can cause Turcot syndrome, featured by the association of colonic polyposis with the rare adult onset medulloblastoma.",2011

Since none of them appears as good candidate genes by their function, high throughput sequencing approach of the region of interest was used in eight FHS patients. This method  is based on the production of thousands or millions of sequences at once during the sequencing process. The analysis only revealed a nonsense variant in the exon 2 on the TMEM19 gene in one patient,  but segregation analysis showed that the mutation was inherited from his unaffected mother. This approach failed in identifying the gene responsible for FHS, and it can be explained by 3 reasons: i) our index patient could be a phenocopy of FHS; ii) the disease can be clinically heterogeneous since the diagnosis only relies on clinical features, iii) high genetic heterogeneity of the disease.",2011

In up to 85% of cases of GS, a mutation can be identified in the patched homolog 1 gene (PTCH1). PTCH1 gene is a member of Sonic Hedgehog (SHH), an  important signaling pathway of the cilia. PTCH1 is the SHH receptor  and represses the SHH signaling through inhibition of Smoothend (Smo). Mutations in PTCH1 render it unable to repress Smo which enters the primary cilia resulting in permanent activation of SHH signaling. So far, attempts to make genotype phenotype associations in GS have not been successful. However, no one has looked at GS from the pathogenic perspective of a cilia abnormality. We provide evidence supported by research reports that the apparently unrelated phenotypic features of GS have a ciliary dysfunction as their common  underlying mechanism. Support for this hypothesis includes firstly clinical overlap (cysts, hydrocephalus, medulloblastoma, skeletal abnormalities) between GS and other ciliopathies. Secondly, the important role of cilia in the development of the involved structures in GS (i.e. brain, skin, skeleton) and their malignant counterparts (basalioma, medulloblastoma). Furthermore, mutations in SUFU, a ciliary protein and a negative SHH regulator, have been found in sporadic medulloblastoma, as well as in germline in a family with GS. Also SUFU +/  mice have features of GS. The perspective of GS being  a ciliopathy can be clinically relevant for treatment with drugs targeted to downstream components of the primary cilia.",2011

These disorders have overall symptoms such as dystonia, choreatic athetosis, dementia, ataxia, rigidity dysarthria, bradykinesia and only patient suffered from Hallervorden Spatz disease have deformation  of foot, primary pigmentary degeneration of retina, blepharospasm, tremor, spasticity, diphthongia. The main feature of Hallervorden Spatz disease is the âeye of the tigerâ sign on brain MRI. The main confirmation of Huntington disease is expansion of repeat number more than 37 in IT15 gene. The main confirmation of Hallervorden Spatz disease is presence mutations in the PANK2 gene.",2011
 Hartsfield syndrome and Xq24 microduplication,P02.115,"R. Kosaki1, H. Okuno2, C. Torii2, K. Kosaki2","1Division of Medical Genetics, National Center for Child Health and  Development Hospital, Tokyo, Japan, 2Department of Pediatrics, Keio  University School of Medicine, Tokyo, Japan","The combination of holoprosencephaly and ectrodactyly was first  described by Hartsfield et al in 1984. Fifteen cases have been reported to date and the condition is likely to represent a single genetic entity (Hartsfield syndrome). The genetic defect is yet to be unraveled. Based on the observation that male patients have preferentially been affected,  X linked recessive mode of transmission has been suggested for this condition. Yet, no candidate genes have been suggested on the X chromosome. We report a patient with a full brown Hartsfield syndrome phenotype who had a microduplication at Xq24 that involved at least 5 genes: A Japanese boy had bilateral ectrodactyly of the hands, midline cleft lip with aplasia of premaxillary segment, cleft palate, a low nasal bridge and micropenis with undescended testes. A CT scan of the brain revealed lobar type holoproencephary. Cleft lip and palate was repaired a age 2 years and ectrodactyly was repaired at age 3. He had  multiple episodes of hyper natremia with serum sodium level as high as 194 mEq/l. His development was mildly delayed. His G banded karyotype was normal. Array comparative genomic hybridization using the Whole Human Genome CGH array (Agilent) revealed a duplication of 0.3 Mb, on Xq24. The duplication has never been recognzied as benign copy number variation in various CNV databases. The duplication was derived from the unaffected mother who had random X inactivation pattern. The fact that the X inactivation pattern was not incompatible with the notion that the duplication could be pathogenic.",2011

We report a patient carrying a 1,3 Mb submicroscopic deletion in 2q14.2, encompassing the GLI2 gene. She  presented with a HPE like phenotype (bilateral cleft lip and palate and  abnormal pituitary gland formation with panhypopituitarism),heterotaxy and normal psychomotor development. Submicroscopic deletions encompassing GLI2 have not been reported so far. Large  microscopically visible interstitial deletions spanning 2q14.2 are rare and have been reported sporadically in patients with multiple congenital anomalies and mental retardation. The clinical and molecular findings in our proband and her family are presented. Additionally, we review the features of previously reported index patients with a GLI2 aberration  (17 mutations and 7 large deletions spanning 2q14.2) . With the report  of this GLI2 deletion we confirm that haploinsufficiency of GLI2 is  associated with HPE like features. Comparable to what has been  described in families with GLI2 mutations, we observed an incomplete penetrance of the deletion in our family, illustrating the multifactorial etiology of HPE and HPE like features. The deletion contains five other genes, including the Epb4.1l5  gene . Based on observations  in Epb4.1l5 mutant mice embryoâs, we argue that haploinsufficiency  of Epb4.1l5 might be the cause of the heterotaxy in our proband. A  pathogenic effect of the GLI2 deletion cannot be excluded. Finally, we  conclude that, while other HPE genes have been excluded, GLI2 is still  a candidate gene for the Holoprosencephaly polydactyly syndrome, also known as Pseudotrisomy 13.",2011

Mutation screening for the genes SHH, GLI2, PTCH, TGIF, and SIX3  was carried out. No evidence of mutation was found. Then, aCGH analysis was carried out and a chromosome 17 deletion affecting the p12 band between 14052279 and 15102307 bp was found. The deficiency of this fragment has been associated to the hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP).

Here we report on a German family in which a duplication of the two adjacent genes TBX5 and TBX3 was identified. Affected members in five generations suffered from mild hand anomalies, heart defects, and supernumerary mammary glands. The phenotype except accessory mammary glands resembled HOS. Sequencing of all TBX5 exons was performed with inconspicuous results. Using a SNP oligonucleotide array, duplication at 12p24.21 was detected extending 210 kb and encompassing exclusively the TBX5 and TBX3 genes. To our knowledge duplication of both TBX5  and TBX3 genes have never been described before. Previously published studies have shown that TBX5 gain of function mutations are associated with HOS with mild skeletal involvement. Based on this knowledge the mild hand malformations in the family described here are likely caused by duplication of the TBX5 gene. Taking into account that TBX3 loss of function mutations result in hyploplastic breasts development, supernumerary mammary glands observed Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology96 in our cases are likely caused by duplication of the TBX3 gene.

The two oldest patients had convulsivant encephalopathy, major hypotonia, and one of them had choreoathetosis movements. Contrary to the heterozygous microdeletion, the homozygous 15q13.3 microdeletion displays an identifiable clinical phenotype. The neurological symptoms might be explained by homozygous deletion of CHRNA7. Taking into account  another patient from the literature with a homozygous deletion not including TRPM1 in one allele and absent eye manifestations, we conclude that homozygous deletions of TRPM1 might be responsible of the retinopathy.

Siu,"University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada","Ubiqitin ligases have been implicated in various neurogenetic  disorders, most notably Angelman Syndrome (UBE3A). The HUWE1 ubiquitin E ligase gene is an X linked gene involved in the ubiquitination of proteins in the nervous system. It functions upstream of the N Myc DLL3 Notch pathway and plays a crucial role  in regulating the balance between proliferation and differentiation of neural cells. Mutations in HUWE1 have been described in a family with Turner type mental retardation associated with macrocephaly (OMIM #30706) and 2 families with nonsyndromic XLMR. As well, 6 unrelated families have been reported with various duplications of the Xp11.2 region, encompassing both HSD17B10 and HUWE1. We present a male child with severe MR, partial complex seizures, and moderate to profound sensorineural hearing impairment. He was nondysmorphic as a child, but at 15 years, had poor eye contact, with long narrow face  and anterior maxillary overbite. MRI showed multiple hyperintensity foci on the T2 flare images with a large area involving the right temporal lobe. Array CGH demonstrated a microduplication involving the HUWE1 gene within cytogenetic band Xp 11.22. This represents a partial duplication of the gene with minimum size of 55 KB from exons 37 to 84 and maximum size of 99 KB including exons 24 to 84. His mother and 2 of his maternal half sisters have the same duplication and mild learning disabilities.

Boday1",1P&R Lab a,"s., Novy Jicin, Czech Republic, 2Hospital Podlesi, Trinec, Czech  Republic. Familial hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is characterized by  progressive hypertrophy of left (sometimes also right) ventricle, diastolic dysfunction, heart failure and sudden death. HCM is heterogenic disease, penetrance is incomplete with variant expressivity. Heredity is autosomal dominant with frequency 1/500. Genetic heterogeneity  is caused by mutations in approximately 12 genes that encode sarcomeric complex and others.Mutations in 3 genes: MYH7 (gene encodes heavy chain of Î² myosin), TNNT2 (gene encodes troponin T), and MyBPC3 (gene encodes myosin binding protein C) cause 2/3 of all cases of HCM.Because of the high frequency of disease and heterogeneity of HCM mutation analysis is extremely laborious and time consuming. Neither the clinical phenotype is not guideline to genetic analysis, because there are no specific symptoms that would correlate with mutations  in genes. The only option is to follow the frequency of mutations in the genes: MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TPM1, MYL2, MYL3, TNNI3 and others. We compare and discusse the sensitivity and specificity of SSCP, DGGE and heteroduplex analysis and we propose testing of patients with HCM. The results put further emphasis on the need for cooperation with cardiologist, clinical genetics and molecular genetics from diagnosis to interpretation the results of molecular genetic testing.",2011

Mutations in the MyBPC3 gene account for 20% of HCM cases and are usually  associated with a favourable prognosis. Despite the good survival of MyBPC3 mutation carriers, they may also be at risk of sudden cardiac  death (SCD). m ethods: A panel of 30 patients with primary HCM was formed. We  screened coding and adjacent intronic areas of the MyBPC3 gene by  direct sequencing in 4 patients. Patients had a medical examination, personal and family history was collected, physical examination, standard ECG, 24 hr HM and Echo CG.Results: Two known mutations (S217G, Q1233ter), 2 known HCM associated polymorphisms (S236G, R326Q) and 2 new  variants (c.2067+38 A>T, V449E) were found. One patient carried heterozygous variants R326Q, Q1233ter and c.2067+38 A>T, had early manifestation, fast progression and a positive SCD family history. Compound heterozygosity of Q1233ter and R326Q variants was previously described as associated with HCM but without SCD events.A patient with a mild form of HCM had a heterozygous S217G mutation shown previously as leading to both dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) and HCM (with sudden infant death).A carrier of the new V449E variant had a positive family history with SCD. A fourth patient with the HCM associated polymorphism S236G, had mild HCM with late onset at 45 y.o.

Background/objectives: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy has been  associated with more than 600 different mutations in sarcomeric genes. Several studies performed in reference centers have reported the presence of multiple families with the same mutation in a given geographic area. Our objective was to evaluate the potential founder  effects in a regional population.Methods: Analysis of the geographic origin of HCM families with mutations in sarcomeric genes identified in Galicia (Northwest Spain).Results: We have identified 67 different mutations in 376 carriers of 136 apparently independent families (32 MYBPC3 mutations in 61 families, 26 MYH7 in 49 families, 4 TNNT2 in 8 families, 3 TNNI3 in 8 families, 1 TNNC1 in 1 family, and 1 ACTC mutation in 9 families).Forty four of the 67 mutations (65%) had been previously described. Eighty eight of the 136 families (65%) shared mutations with other  families, and 58 of those 88 (68%) were repeated within the same or a bordering district, strongly suggesting a common origin. Twenty four of the 67 different mutations appeared in more than one family: 4 were in 2 different families, 9 mutations in 3 families, 3 mutations in 4 families, and 1 mutation was repeated in 5,6, 7,8 and 9 families respectively.Conclusions: Multiple families with the same mutations are frequent in our population. The knowledge about the geographic origin of the families in a regional setting may be useful to focus the genetic studies. The identification of a high proportion of previously described mutations in multiple families can improve our knowledge about genotype phenotype correlations.",2011

On 2p21,  however, two overlapping homozygous contiguous gene syndromes have been described. The first syndrome, referred to as 2p21 deletion syndrome, is characterized by neonatal hypotonia, seizures, severe developmental delay, elevated serum lactate concentrations, poor  feeding, growth retardation, facial dysmorphisms and cystinuria type I. The deletion affects at least four genes, PPM1B, SLC3A1, PREPL and C2orf34. The second syndrome, hypotonia cystinuria syndrome (HCS, MIM606407) is characterized by infantile hypotonia, poor feeding, growth hormone deficiency, mild facial dysmorphism and cystinuria type I; affected individuals carry homozygous deletions encompassing the SLC3A1 and the PREPL gene. Cystinuria is due to the loss of the SLC3A1 gene.We describe two siblings with a homozygous deletion of 83 kb  encompassing exon 1 of the PREPL gene   implicated in both syndromes   and the first three exons of the C2orf34 gene   implicated in the 2p21 deletion syndrome. To our knowledge, this is the first homozygous deletion on 2p21 not disrupting the coding sequence of the SLC3A1 gene. The affected individuals display the classical symptoms of HCS such as severe muscular hypotonia in infancy and pronounced feeding difficulties with growth failure, but no cystinuria. They also show additional features such as cleft palate and genital abnormalities which have not been reported so far, neither in the 2p21 deletion syndrome nor in HCS.

IgAD is 10 to 15 times more frequently in patients with celiac disease (CD) than  in healthy subjects.IgAD has been associated with chromosomes 18,14 and 6.Certain MHC haplotypes have been associated with susceptibility to IgAD:HLA A, B14, B8, DR3. Objective: The goal of this study was to assess the association between HLADQ and IgAD in Romanian children. Methods:From 122 celiac patients diagnosed between 2000 and 2010, 9 associated IgAD (diagnosis was IgG serology and histology based).A second study lot consisted in 10 IgAD children without autoimmune associations.The lot of control consisted in 20 healthy children.DQ2/DQ8 alleles were typed by PCR SSP in all children. Results:Alleles distribution for children with CD and IgAD was:8 cases (89%) presented homozygous DQ2 haplotypes (DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201 and DQA1*0501/DQB1*0201) and one (11%) associated heterozygous DQ8 haplotype (DQA1*0301/DQB1*0302 and DQA1*0301/DQB1*0103).From the second lot IgA deficient without CD, 3children (30%) presented homozygousDQ2 haplotypes.From the contol lot, one healthy children (5%) associated DQ2homozygous alleles. HLA DQ2 homozygous haplotype was present in 58% of total IgAD patients comparing to 5% in controls (p<0,00012).We found a  significant correlation between DQ2 homozygous haplotype and IgAD (r,0,62).Conclusions:Presence of HLA DQ2/DQ8 is mandatory but not sufficient for developing CD.Susceptibility to IgAD is associated with DQ2 alleles,but it is not equally in different populations.Differences in HLA association of IgAD reported by various studies suggest that multiple different genes within the MHC region might be involved in the pathogenesis of this immunodeficiency.",2011

All patients presented oral malformations, facial dysmorphism and distal abnormalities including mainly polydactyly (70%), 50% in hands and 70% in feet. All patients presented with neurological symptoms with mental retardation (5/5 cases), from  moderate to severe impairment. Supratentorial abnormalities, brainstem malformations, cerebellar malformations with constant MTS and cystic dilatation of the posterior fossa were always present. In conclusion, the OFD VI syndrome defined by the association of OFD features and cerebellar malformations presents with constant MTS associated to constant brainstem and supratentorial malformation and could definitively be considered as JSRD and an additional ciliopathy. Six of the nine causative genes implicated in JBS and JSRD (INPP5E; CORS2; TMEM67/MKS3; RPGRIP1L; ARL13B and CC2D2A)  were  studied in 5/8 families but no pathogenic mutation was found. The responsible gene(s) probably interact(s) with OFD1 gene and the JSRD genes.",2011

Human ciliopathies present with distinct but overlapping phenotypes whose core features include retinal degeneration, cystic disease of the liver, pancreas and kidney, postaxial polydactyly and situs inversus. To date,  there have not been other reported cases of aortic stenosis associated with JSRD. Indeed, cardiac screening is not currently recommended in the management guidelines for individuals suspected of having JSRD. We speculate that while the presence of congenital aortic stenosis in this child could be caused by an unrelated genetic mechanism, it could also represent a phenotypic overlap with another ciliopathy, the Bardet Biedl syndrome, in which aortic stenosis is present in about 38% of cases.We also review the range of cardiac lesions reported to be present in all human diseases known to be ciliopathies, in order to assist with the investigation and management of individuals with a suspected or proven ciliopathy.",2011

Key features are a  characteristic face, growth retardation, developmental delay and additional features such as hypodontia and persistent foetal fingertip pads. Recently, a gene causing KS was identified through exome sequencing, reporting de novo mutations in the histone methyl transferase (HMT) gene MLL2 in 66% of 53 patients with Kabuki  syndrome (Ng et al., Nat Genet.42(9):790 3, 2010).

In another series of 31 patients, we identified 21 additional novel MLL2 mutations. Thus the combined mutation yield of Sanger based MLL2 exon sequencing for both series is 55/76 , 72%, further supporting the major contribution of MLL2 mutations to the disease. We collected detailed clinical data of the 76 patients from both series (49 female, 27 male). Relevant clinical features were selected from the Dyscerne guidelines for KS (www.dyscerne.org) and interrogated using standardised questionnaires and checklists. Analysis focused on 7 clustered feature groups: facial, growth and development, cardiovascular, sensory (vision, speech, hearing), skeletal/orthopaedic malformations and accessory minor  feautures.

An up  to date example is the identification of de novo dominant mutations in  the MLL2 gene using a whole exome sequencing strategy in patients  with Kabuki syndrome. Kabuki syndrome is a classical, clinically well known multiple congenital anomalies/mental retardation syndrome, mainly characterized by a distinct facial appearance in addition to e.g. developmental delay, short stature, persistent fingerpads, and urogenital tract anomalies. In our study, we sequenced all 54 coding exons of the MLL2 gene in 34 patients with Kabuki syndrome. We identified eighteen distinct mutations in nineteen patients and twelve of  thirteen tested de novo. Mutations included four nonsense mutations,  two splice site mutations, six small deletions or insertions, and six missense mutations. The mutations were located throughout the MLL2 gene without a clustering in specific exons of the gene or domains of the protein. Interestingly, genotype phenotype comparison indicated a higher frequency of specific symptoms in MLL2 positive cases.  Mutation negative patients were subsequently tested for mutations in 12 highly relevant functional candidate genes (e.g. MLL1, ASC2, ASH2, and WDR5) and we identified one alteration in MLL1 with a  yet unclear causative role. Our results indicate that MLL2 is the major gene for Kabuki syndrome with a wide spectrum of de novo mutations and they provide evidence for further genetic heterogeneity.",2011

The result showed that 20% only have primary mutations (3460G>A, 11778G>A, 14484T>C) while 17% just present secondary mutations (4216Y>H, 4917N>D,...) ,of which only 6% have both types of mutations. 50% of patients with primary mutations showed 11778G>A while 33% have 3460G>A and 16% present 14484T>C mutation. Also 17% of patients are lack of any mutations and even polymorphisms and finally 46% revealed new homoplasmic mutations (9949V>I, 13802T>I, 3893T>S) which were  not reported before and not existed in LHON patients with primary or/and secondary mutations. Because the mitochondrial genome contains a large number of apparently neutral polymorphisms that have little pathogenic significance, along with secondary homoplasmic mutations that do not have primary disease causing effect, the pathogenic role of all newly discovered mutations must be rigorously established with familial assay, investigation of nuclear genes and evaluation of other diseases which have common symptoms with LHON . We believed that these new mutation may have primary effect in LHON.",2011

HÃ©di Chaker de Sfax,  Sfax, Tunisia. The clinical spectrum of mitochondrial disorders is extremely  heterogeneous, affecting young and adult patients at any age, with involvement of a wide variety of tissues. More than 100 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have been described in association with different neurological disorders and with respiratory chain deficiency.  Besides the most frequently reported mitochondrial tRNA mutations and deletions, pathogenic mutations affecting structural genes of mtDNA encoded respiratory chain subunits, mainly cytochrome b and cytochrome c oxidase (COX) subunit genes, have been reported in association with various mitochondrial disorders such as Leigh syndrome. Cytochrome c oxidase is an essential component of the mitochondrial respiratory chain that catalyzes the reduction of molecular oxygen by reduced cytochrome c. In this study, the authors report the second mutation associated with Leigh syndrome in the blood and  buccal mucosa of 2 affected members of a Tunisian family. It was a novel heteroplasmic missense mitochondrial mutation at nucleotide 9478 in the gene specifying subunit III of cytochrome c oxidase substituting the valine at position 91 to alanine in a highly conserved amino acid. It was found with a high mutant load in tissues derived from endoderm (buccal mucosa) and mesoderm (blood). However, it was nearly absent in tissue derived from ectoderm (hair follicles). It was absent in 120 healthy controls, and PolyPhen analysis showed that the hydropathy index changed from +1.276 to +0.242, and the number of structures of the 3D protein decreased from 39 to 32.",2011

Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome is a very rare but well  characterized genetic disorder that causes premature ageing. The clinical features affect growth, skeleton, body fat, skin, hair and the cardiovascular system. It is caused by mutations in LMNA gene, the most frequent being p.Gly608Gly (c.1824C>T) in exon 11. Here we present a four year old HGPS patient presenting a heterozygous LMNA missense mutation in exon 2. This mutation is  located far from the C terminal region implicated in the posttranslational processing of prelamin A, but it lies within the rod domain of lamin A/C that represents a highly conserved domain specific to nuclear lamins. We hypothesize that this region could be involved in early and severe strokes in HGPS, as those presented by our patient. This is the first report of an HGPS patient with Maghrebian origin.",2011

The deletion is of variable size. It usually involves less than 10 Mb in the 1pter 1p36.23 interval. Variability of the phenotype is partially related to the extent of the deletion. Some children with a 1p36 deletion were reported with  obesity and hyperphagia, raising the question of possible phenotypic overlap with Prader Willi syndrome. Correlation between presence of obesity and the size of the deletion has only be documented in one case. We report an 11 year old girl with 1p36 deletion and the classical dysmorphological features. In late infancy, she developed an uncontrolled voracious appetite, overweight, truncal obesity and elevated serum transaminases. Liver biopsy disclosed severe steatosis. The hepatocytes contained accumulation of lipofuscins. Lipolysosomes were abnormally numerous and extremely enlarged.  These features have not been previously reported in 1p36 deletion. Oligonucleotide based microarray analysis showed a subtelomeric 2.2 Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology103 Mb deletion at 1p36.33p36.32.

Mabry syndrome (hyperphosphatasia with developmental  disability) was first described by Mabry et al. in 1970 a single family (OMIM#239300) [1970]. At first considered rare, our work to describe the disorder has led to recruitment of over twenty families world wide.Descriptions of this cohort have resulted in the recognition of several  other salient features of the disorder including: a characteristic facial dysmorphology (hypertelorism, a broad nasal bridge and a tented mouth); subtle hand bone abnormalities (variable shortening of middle and distal phalanges) and nerve abnormalities (plaques disrupting Schwann cells). Like many infantile metabolic storage disorders, seizures associated with Mabry syndrome have an onset in the first year of life. Persistently elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) levels are now known to be associated with abnormalities of the phosphoinositol glycan (PIG) anchor, which was found to be disrupted  in eight of these families. Lysosomal storage material detected in patients with Mabry syndrome has been putatively identified as glycolipid material. As PIGV mutations have not been identified in all patients with a clinical diagnosis of Mabry syndrome, we describe this cohort. As twenty genes are integral to PIG anchor synthesis, PIGV mutations negative patients or those with vacuolar plaques may result from disruptions to other genes in the PIG anchor biosynthesis pathway. This work will assist in elucidating the inborn errors of metabolism that underlie Mabry syndrome.",2011

MAOA (monoamine oxidase A) is involved in the degradation of neurotransmitters. The detected deletion presumably leads to a complete lack of functional MAOA in male carriers. The proband in the present study is a 13 year old boy who was subjected to genomic microarray analysis using the Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole Genome 2.7M Array due to a history of behavioral problems including social interaction and slow learning. His intelligence has been classified within normal range, but he has a diagnosis of ADHD with symptoms in line with DAMP (deficit of attention, motor control and perception). He is obese with BMI 33,8. The proband also has a brother with a diagnosis of ADHD.We detected a 1.2 Mb deletion on Xp11.3 p11.4 in the proband,  including the first three exons of the gene MAOA as the only known gene. An identical deletion was detected in the boyâs mother. Functional analyses and extended characterization of the family is ongoing.This study describes the first kindred with an isolated functional abrogation of MAOA since 1993, when Brunner et al. reported a Dutch  nondysmorphic kindred with borderline mental retardation, prominent behavioral disturbances and an inactivating point mutation in MAOA. The behavioral problems noted in our proband seems similar to the  symptoms in the Dutch kindred.

Marfan syndrome: role of inflammation in dilatation or dissection of the aorta,P02.151,"R. Zhuraev, D. Zerbino","Lviv National Medical University after Danylo Halytski, Lviv, Ukraine","Background. The primary cause of early death in untreated Marfan  syndrome (MFS) patients is aortic dilatation and dissection. A defective gene causing MFS, FBN1, encodes for an extracellular matrix protein called fibrillin 1, a component of the elastic fiber system. The fibrillin 1 deficient mouse, an accepted model of MFS that recapitulates the  cardiovascular phenotype, shows medial degeneration in the aortic wall that was surprisingly associated with inflammatory infiltrates prior to dilatation or dissection.Methods. We examined 13 patients with MFS after aortic valve replacing root operations. Full aortic segments and blood samples were collected from patients undergoing repair. Immunohistochemistry staining was performed using antibodies directed against markers of lymphocytes and macrophages.Results. Immunohistochemisty demonstrated that the media and  adventitia had increased numbers of T lymphocytes and macrophages, indicating the role of inflammation in the onset and progression dissection of the aorta. Macrophages were significantly increased in the aortic media with infiltrated aneurysms. CD3+ cells were localized in the media and surrounding the vasa vasorum in the adventitia. Transmural inflammation was associated with increased aortic external diameter, intimal thickening, preserved vascular smooth muscle cell density, and decreased matrix proteins. We found elevated level of TNF Î±, IL 2, IL 6, IL 8 in 12 patients.Conclusions. These results indicate that infiltration of inflammatory cells contributes to the pathogenesis of MFS. Immune mediated aortitis may contribute to pathogenesis of dilatation or dissection of the aorta in MFS formation involve inflammatory infiltrates in the aortic media.  Superantigen driven stimulation of T lymphocytes may contribute to the initial immune response.",2011

Her height and weight is normal for age, wihle the bone age is slightly advanced.The endocrinological examination showed elevated prolactin and estrogen, with other hormones in normal range. All other investigations are in normal range. GH (growth hormone) and prolactin excess are common (21%), but the signs and symptoms can be very subtle. Most GH secreting tumors are co secretors of GH and prolactin, GH excess can worsen craniofacial bone disease and hyperprolactinemia can independently have an adverse affect on gonadal function. Consequently, it becomes  important to assess prolactin level and have an oral glucose tolerance test to look for non suppressible GH at least once, in order to make the diagnosis and treat.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology104",2011

Meier Gorlin syndrome (MGS) is an autosomal recessive disorder  characterized by microtia, patellar aplasia/hypoplasia and short stature. Additional common features encompass a characteristic facial appearance, lung and genitourinary malformations.Recently, we identified mutations in five genes from the pre replication  complex, crucial in cell cycle progression and growth, in 23/38 (61%) individuals with MGS.Here, we report on genotype phenotype studies in this unique cohort (13 females, 10 males; age 3 months   47 years). The triad of microtia, absent/hypoplastic patellae and short stature was observed in 60% of individuals. Microtia and short stature with normal patellae was seen in 15%; microtia and abnormal patellae without short stature in 15%; short stature only in 10%.Intrauterine growth retardation was present in 76%, postnatal growth  retardation in 86% and microcephaly in 50%. Compound heterozygous or homozygous mutations were detected in ORC1 (39%), ORC4  (13%), ORC6 (13%), CDT1 (31%) and CDC6  (4%). Seventeen  different mutations were identified: ten missense, three nonsense, two frameshift, two splice site mutations.Pre replication complex mutations appear to be associated with a broader phenotypic spectrum than previously expected. No clear genotype phenotype association was observed, although compound heterozygous frameshift mutations seem to give rise to a more severe phenotype compared to homozygous mutations, particularly in ORC1 and ORC4. Homozygous missense mutations in CDC6 ,  however, resulted in more severely impaired growth than compound heterozygous nonsense mutations in CDT1. Further studies in  additional individuals are needed to substantiate these observations  and to understand the role of the separate genes in normal and disrupted organ development.",2011

The methods utilised were cytogenetic, clinical investigations, somatometrical, statistical, psychiatric investigation and hearing tests, too. There were realised family investigations and were constructed pedigrees. We recorded 50 cases of hearing speaking disorders in studied population, which means a frequency of 8,39%. Eight cases (16%) of all cases recorded, have no mental deficiency associated.Over 10% of the cases with mental deficiency have hearing speaking disorders. It were observed increased frequencies in groups with  moderate and severe mental deficiency. The frequency of hearing speaking disorders in group with severe mental deficiency could be more increased because of the young age of children, when they canât cooperate with the person who investigate them. Most of cases proceed from rural area, perhaps because of agglomeration of some mutant genes. We could assume an autosomal recessive or dominant inheritance.

Most of cases proceed from rural area. The most often is observed the congenital vertebral column disorders. The frequency is meaningfully increased in children group with severe mental deficiency. This result can be explained because of the existence of congenital bony abnormalities, such as common traits in chromosomal syndromes or other syndromes which cause plurimalformative phenotypes associated with mental deficiency.Cranial and facial dysmorphism  has a frequency of 13%. This frequency is increased in the group of severe mental deficiency. These abnormalities could be caused by some genetic disorders which cause bony abnormalities, too.

We report on a 17 year old patient with a Smith Magenis syndrome like phenotype, including mild intellectual impairment, hyperactivity, aggressiveness, and self destructive  behavior. Sleep disturbances and nocturnal cry have been noted from childhood. After an episode of seizures at 10 years, antiepileptic treatment was successfully initiated. No mutation or exonic deletion were found in RAI1. Using a clinical oligonucleotide aCGH, we have identified a unique ~ 317 kb hemizygous deletion at chromosome 10q24.32 harboring seven genes, including transcription factor PITX3 that is known to regulate the development of midbrain dopamine (DA) neurons together with other transcription factors. Pitx3 /  mice have a selective loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading  to the significantly reduced DA levels in the nigrostriatal pathway and manifest anomalous striatum dependent cognitive impairment and abnormal lens development. Heterozygous missense mutations in PITX3 have been reported in patients with dominant congenital cataract and anterior segment mesenchymal dysgenesis. Interestingly, no eye anomalies were found in our patient and analysis of neurotransmitters in his cerebrospinal fluid revealed undetectable level of L DOPA and significantly decreased levels of catecholamine metabolites. Based on our data and the results of the experiments with dopamine agonists in the Pitx3 deficient mice, we suggest that the abnormal neurobehavioral phenotype in our patient, likely resulting from the decreased levels of dopamine, could be mitigated with tetrahydrobiopterin and/or L DOPA.

In the majority of mentally retarded individuals a specific cause can not be identified. Aim of this study  was determining chromosomal aberrations in patients with mental retardation by scanning whole genome. m aterials and  m ethods: Peripheral blood samples were collected  from 52 individuals between the ages of 0 18 with mental retardation regardless of gender. Genetic deletions/duplications were detected on DNA level using array CGH method. Isolated gDNAs from peripheral blood samples were hybridized on CytoSure Syndrome Plus(v2) Microarray 4x44K microchips. Obtained data were analyzed using CytoSure Analysis Software v.2.0.8.Results:Deletions and duplications with various sizes were detected in various regions of the genome on 38(73%) patients. No deletions/duplications were found on 14(27%) patients. Deletions/duplications with different sizes were found in different parts of the genome on 7(70%) of non syndromic mental retardation patients, 22 (78.6%) of patients with mental retardation associated with dysmorphic findings, (87.5%) of patients with mental retardation accompanied by epilepsy and 2(33.3%) of patients with mental retardation associated with epilepsy and dysmorphism. c onclusion: The diagnostic yield of array CGH in general population  of individuals with mental retardation is at least twice as high as  that of standart GTG banded karyotyping and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) in terms of high resolution. The limited ability to differentiate between inherited copy number variations (CNV) which cause abnormal phenotypes and rare variants unrelated to clinical alterations currently constitutes a limitation for guiding genetic counselling.",2011

Karyotyping is a usual method for primary screening of MR patients, however, detection of small duplications and deletions require a more sensitive technique. Because of the large number of known genes  involved in MR, mutation screening in all of them is not a feasible and cost effective approach. Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) has the ability of relative quantification of several target DNA sequence in a single reaction by using specific probes for each target.During the last year a total of 71 patients with dysmorphism and MR have been referred to us. Initially, all patients were clinically evaluated and karyotype analyses were performed. All of the patients had normal karyotypes.

Objective: To compare the spectrum of congenital anomalies (CA) and  minor anomalies (MA) between mentally retarded/developmentally delayed (MR/DD) patients with clinically significant CNVs and MR/DD patients with normal molecular karyotyping results.Methods: Molecular karyotyping using oligo arrayCGH and SNP  microarrays was performed on 114 MR/DD patients with/without CA and dysmorphic features. Based on the molecular karyotyping results, patients were divided into two groups. Group A consisted of patients with clinically significant CNVs (N,16) while group B consisted of patients with normal molecular karyotyping results (N,98). CA and MA were coded using Eurocat Malformation coding guides.Results and Discussion: CNS congenital anomalies occurred more often in group A versus group B (31% versus 11%, P,0.048). No significant differences were found between these two groups when  analyzing the rate of CA in the organ systems included in other blocks of the XVII chapter (ICD 10 classification, Q00 Q99). Interestingly, patients with chromosomal rearrangements (group A) were more likely to have at least one MA (P,0.02) and had a significantly higher frequency of eye, ear, face and neck MA (Q10 Q18) compared to patients from group B (68.8% versus 38.8%, P,0.04). The increased rate of CA in the CNS and MA of the eye, ear, face and neck in MR/DD patients with clinically significant CNVs provides useful information for counseling and may aid in the identification of submicroscopic chromosomal rearrangements in other patients.This research was funded by the European Union 7th Framework Programme [FP7/2007 2013] as part of the CHERISH project (www.cherishproject.eu , grant agreement nÂ°223692).",2011

We report two patients with chromosome duplications involving regions associated with common microdeletion syndromes. Among 90 patients affected  with mental retardation (MR) / developmental delay (DD) screened by MLPA for common microdeletion syndroms and subtelomeric rearrangements two were found to carry small duplications   at 3q29 and 10p15 respectively. Both patients are ascertained because of MR and dysmorphism of unknown etiology. Both cases are sporadic. At age of 13 years patient with 3q29 duplication presents mild MR, microcephaly and dysmorphism. Patient with duplication of 10p15 was refereed to our department at age of 18 months because of DD and epilepsy. After initial cytogenetic and metabolic investigations MLPA  was performed using consecutively kits P245, P70 and P36 (MRC Holland). Duplications were detected with at least two of the used kits. Chromosomal rearrangements were further characterized using arrayCGH. Phenotypes of our patients share similarities with cases reported recently by other investigators.Contiguous gene syndromes involving small chromosome microduplications are typically less frequently reported than their microdeletions counterparts. Although these rearrangements can arise from a common mechanism involving nonallelic homologous recombination, microduplication syndroms are usually less commonly recognized, possibly due to their milder and more variable phenotype and technical limitations of routine cytogenetics. Methods for molecular  karyotiping are invaluable in clarifying the etiology of MR/DD and the approach of âreverse phenotypicsâ broadens our understanding of human genome architecture and functioning.",2011

Selective tooth agenesis is usually genetic and not associated with natal teeth. In affected  persons in the family we report, at least 6 8 natal teeth are usually present at birth, and this is followed by selective tooth agenesis that results in absence of as many as 16 permanent teeth. Natal teeth with hypodontia occurs in some ectodermal dysplasia syndromes. In the family we report, natal teeth with selective tooth agenesis did not include ectodermal dysplasia or any other problem.

Mutations in the nebulin gene (NEB) are the main cause of autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy  (NM), with clinical presentations ranging from mild to severe proximal muscle weakness and protein aggregates, nemaline bodies, seen in the muscle fibres. At present over 130 NM causing NEB mutations  have been identified in more than 110 families. In addition to mutations causing NM, compound heterozygous mutations in NEB have been identified causing core rod myopathy (CRM) in one patient, and homozygous missense mutations in NEB causing distal myopathy with no or almost no nemaline bodies in four different Finnish families. It was concluded that perhaps the presence of two missense mutations  in NEB would lead to distal myopathy, while more disruptive compound  heterozygous mutations would cause NM or CRM. Recently, however, we have identified four different compound heterozygous NEB  mutations, only one of which is a missense mutation, in three non Finnish patients in two unrelated families with distal myopathy and nemaline bodies in their muscle biopies. One of the mutations has previously been identified in one family with the severe form of NM. We conclude that NM and distal myopathy caused by NEB mutations form a clinical and histological continuum. NM should be considered as a differential diagnosis in patients presenting with an early onset, predominantly distal myopathy.",2011

Taking into account the diseases covered by a molecular diagnosis certainty and with neonatal hypotonia as a major clinical sign, we are interested in three neurological disorders: Prader Willi Syndrome (PWS), spinal muscular atrophy type I (AMSI), and  myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1).The aim of our work is to establish a molecular diagnosis strategy of neonatal hypotonia with neurological origin (SPW, AMSI, and DM1).Our study was performed in 27 newborns referred to our laboratory for neonatal hypotonia. We carried the diagnosis of PWS by both MS MLPA techniques and TP PCR, for AMSI we have deployed the technique of PCR RFLP, for the DM1, both techniques of TP PCR and QMPSF were used. Patients without clinical suspicion of predilection were investigated with all these techniques. The PWS diagnosis was confirmed in only one patient. Among 17 patients with AMSI suspicion this diagnosis was confirmed for only 7. For the remaining 19 patients none of the 3 molecular diagnostics (AMSI, DM1 and SPW) could be confirmed and etiology of neonatal hypotonia is to unveil.Our work provides clinicians a strategy for the diagnosis of neonatal hypotonia. However this strategy remains incomplete and a multitude of other etiologies will have to be explored.",2011

The boy was born with a severe cyanotic congenital heart defect (CHD). m aterial and methods: We performed clinical, cardiology, neurology,  ultrasound and genetic examination on both patients, followed by  complex laboratory investigations.Results: The patients have a distinctive facial appearance, microcephaly, short stature, recurrent infections and multiple splenic tumours. The sister also has convergent strabismus of the right eye, right palpebral ptosis, areas of skin hypopigmentation, and severe IgA immunodeficiency. She was treated with intravenous immunoglobulin. The boy has CHD with double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, inefficient pulmonary artery banding, severe pulmonary artery hypertension, NYHA III cardiac failure, cachexia, severe  thrombocytopenia, severe motor delay, low mental retardation, and cellular immunodeficiency. A paravertebral T8 T9 tumour was detected in the boy. He was treated for heart failure. Thrombocytopenia is a contraindication for treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension. Splenic tumours and paravetebral tumour have to be investigated. Genetic tests are in progress for both, looking for mutation, and colony survival assay. Parents have Slavic origin. c onclusions:  NBS is rare in siblings and needs to be diagnosed  because of immunodeficiency that has to be treated, because of  radiation sensitivity, which means radiation exposure must be avoided, and a strong predisposition to lymphoid malignancy, which has to be sought.

About 50 60% of cases of CdLS are caused by mutations in one  of three genes, mainly in a regulator of cohesion   NIPBL, and less frequently in two building the cohesin ring   SMC1 and SMC3. Cohesin is involved in control chromosome segregation during cell divisions and also in double strand break repair and/or transcriptional regulation. We screened 32 patients with the CdLS classical phenotype and 38 with mild phenotype for NIPBL point mutations, using a combination of denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing. We identified 26 different NIPBL sequence variants. Eight of them were frame shift (exclusively present in the classical  type), 15 were missense and three splice mutations resulting in exon skipping. Moreover, within the group of patients without identifiable point mutations, we performed an MLPA analysis and detected two heterozygous deletions of the entire NIPBL gene, confirmed by aCGH. In our group, NIPBL point mutations account for 37% of CdLS patients. Large rearrangements were detected only twice, which explains only 7% of all detected mutations.

Noonan Syndrome (NS) is a common autosomal dominant disorder  that affects both sexes. The main features are congenital heart defect, short stature, learning problems, pectus excavatum, impaired blood clotting, webbed neck, and a facial dysmorphism. The incidence is 1/1,000  1/2,500 newborn. The range and severity of features can vary  greatly in patients with NS, and thus the diagnosis is often delayed. We present two cases of NS in newborns with clinical features that attest the phenotypic variability of disease. Case 1: girl, born at term, APGAR  7, first child of an apparently healthy couple; clinical examination: dysmorphic face with: hypertelorism, down slanting eyes, small and upturned nose, low set and backward rotated ears, short and webbed neck, muscular hypotonia, without any type of cardiac problems. The clinical examination of the mother indicated a phenotype of NS with short stature, mild mental retardation, short and webbed neck, facial dysmorphism, without cardiac problems. Case 2: girl, born premature at 35 weeks, APGAR 5, after a pregnancy complicated with polyhidramnios detected at 22 weeks, 2 nd children of a healthy  couple; clinical examination: generalized lymphoedema, dysmorphic  face with hypertelorism, small and upturned nose, short palpebral fissures, short and webbed neck, thoracic hypoplasia, and cardiac anomalies: pulmonary valvular stenosis, and ventricular septal defect,  hepatomegalia.

The mutations or polymorphic variants in mitochondrial DNA encoded genes or nuclear genes result in oxidative stress, which has recently been associated with various psychiatric  disorders. In order to understand the association of mitochondrial disorders with oxidative stress in OCD, we examined genetic variants of MnSOD and UCP 2 antioxidant genes, whose product imported into mitochondrion, and MDA and GSH, markers of oxidative stress. The study sample comprised 102 patients with OCD and 104 healthy controls. For MnSOD, the frequencies of CT (Ala/Val) genotype (p<0.01) in patients were significantly lower than those of controls. However, CC (Ala/Ala) genotype was significantly more frequent in patients than controls (p<0.05). For UCP 2 (I/D), the frequencies of  ID genotype (p<0.01) and I allele (p<0.05) were lower in patients as compared with controls. In contrast, DD genotype was more prevalent in patients than controls (p<0.01). While serum GSH was significantly depleted (p<0.0001), serum MDA was significantly elevated in patients compared with controls (p<0.0001). MDA levels were significantly elevated in subjects with DD genotype of UCP 2 (I/D) (p<0.05) and CC genotype of MnSOD (p<0.05) as compared with II or ID and TT or CT genotype, respectively. MDA levels in patients carrying CC (p<0.05) or CT (p<0.05) genotype were significantly higher than those of carrying TT genotype. In conclusion, CC genotype of MnSOD or DD genotype of UCP 2 might result in mitochondrial disorders by increasing oxidative stress in OCD.",2011

Other features are cleft lip and/or palate, cardiac, cerebral , renal malformations and mental retardation. Diverse chromosomal abnormalities have been associated with OAVS (trisomies/monosomies).Clinical Report: We report a 31 year old patient, with clinical diagnosis of Treacher Collins syndrome and several affected family members suggestive of autosomal dominant inheritance. Normal pregnancy and delivery. No gestational diabetes, uterine malformations, toxic environment. Physical examination: Long narrow face, bilateral  preauricular pits and tags, left anotia, agenesis of middle and inner left ear, micrognatia, macrostomia, high arched palate. Length: 167 cm, PC: 55 cm. Normal cardiological evaluation. Spine Xray: dorsolumbar scoliosis. No vertebral defects. Father: right macrostomia. No hearing defect. Born with preauricular tags.

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is a severe genetic disorder  characterized by reduced or absent biosynthesis of melanin pigment in melanocytes of the skin, hair follicle, and eye. Type I OCA results from deficient activity of melanocyte tyrosinase, a copper containing enzyme that catalyzes the first two steps in the melanin biosynthetic  pathway. In classic, type IA OCA tyrosinase activity and melanin biosynthesis are entirely absent, and in type IB OCA tyrosinase activity and melanin production are greatly reduced. Types IA and IB OCA were result from allelic mutations of the tyrosinase gene.In This study a patient with clinical phenotype of OCA I and her parents were investigated for mutations in TYR gene by PCR and sequencing method. This patient was homozygote for c: 89 T â A  mutation that changes amino acid Cysteine to Serine while her parents were heterozygous for this mutation.

OA/TOF may occur as an isolated anomaly or as part of a syndrome. Several Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology112 syndromes have OA/TOF as a clinical feature. The best known  is the VACTERL association that is seen in 10 30% of OA/TOF. Chromosomal anomalies have been reported in 6 10% of OA/TOF, but no single specific chromosomal defect has been confirmed as a main etiological factor. Several genes have been implicated in cases  of syndromic OA/TOF. It is thought that a combination of genetic and environmental factors play a role in the etiology of OA/TOF.We report a male infant, born at 33 weeks of gestation with IUGR presenting the combination of multiple congenital defects (OA/TOF, anal atresia, thumbs hypoplasia, tracheomalacia, sacral bone defect, cryptorchidism) resembling VATER association. Follow up examination showed psychomotor and somatic retardation. Genotype analysis revealed a normal male karyotype and absence of subtelomeric imbalances. Genome wide 250k SNP array analysis showed a 1.4Mb  gain in 17q12. This gain appeared to have occurred de novo (normal result in the patientâs parents) and is likely to explain the clinical picture of this patient.Recently, aberrations of this 17q12 region that is flanked by low copy repeats have been described by Nagamani et al. in patients with renal defects, epilepsy, brain abnormalities and intellectual disability. Among these patients, one presented with OA/TOF and vertebral defect.We propose to consider a role for selected genes in the 17q12 region in the development of OA/TOF.",2011

Recently, 6 mutations  within the GLI3 gene, responsible for Greig cephalopolysyndactyly and Pallister Hall syndrome (PHS), have been reported in some cases (6/21 cases, 29%) who presented features of OFD syndrome associated to midline abnormalities. Five of the 6 mutations were similar in position within GLI3 to other mutations that have been described in PHS.

No GLI3 mutation was identified. The difference between our cohort and the previous published results could be explained by the frequent HH (4/6 cases) in the previous published data and the rare prevalence (1/8 cases) in our cohort. When pooling with the previous studies, the frequency of GLI3 mutations in OFD syndromes with midline abnormalities is 21%, and 36% if a HH is associated.

Other less consistent deformities include anal, renal, cardiac, ear, and foot malformations. This disease results from of a mutation in the SALL4 gene, a human gene related to the developmental regulator spalt (sal) of Drosophila melanogaster. SALL4 mutations may also cause Acro Renal Ocular syndrome (AROS), which is characterized by radial ray malformations, renal abnormalities, ocular coloboma, and Duane anomaly. The majority of the mutations are truncating point mutations, which are expected to result in nonsense mediated mRNA decay and are considered to cause the phenotype via haploinsufficiency. The only truncating mutation predicted to escape nonsense mediated mRNA decay is associated with extensive clinical variability and severe hemifacial microsomia in one member of a large family.The only missense mutation identified so far is predicted to cause an increase of DNA binding capacity and is associated with central midline defects [Kolhase J, GeneReviews 2008].

Ectrodactyly, ectodermal, clefting ( EEC, OMIM 604292) is the prototype of these syndromes.Most patients present with all three components. We present a case with mutation in p63 and no limb involvement The proband is a 7 years old boy who was born at term to unrelated parents of Jewish origin. He had cleft lip and palate which as well as lacrimal duct stenosis which were corrected. He has spars thin and pale hair. He has hypodontia with 17 teeth missing. On his back there are hyperpigmented lesions. No abnormality was noted in his hands feet or nails. He has no abnormal sweating, no hearing impairment or kidney abnormality. He has no developmental problems.A diagnosis of EEC syndrome was suspected. Screening for mutations  in the p63 gene revealed an R304W mutation, known to be a disease causing mutation in this syndrome. The parents do not carry this mutation.Even though ectrodactyly is a hallmark in EEC syndrome and is found in the vast majority of the patients, it should be included in the differential diagnosis when the other two major components exist (i.e. ectodermal and clefting ). Lack of involvement of the limbs in this boy may be due to other genes affecting the expression of the mutated p63 in this case pointing at a more complex mechanism for the mild phenotype in this boy.",2011

Introduction Perception of pain is a complex process which implies multiple biochemical pathways together with unknown processes of cortical integration. The existence of individual differences in the response to painful stimuli suggest that genetic factors can be involved in  its modulation. The aim of our study was to investigate the genetic variation of 25 genes involved in different pathways of pain in patients from Salamanca (Spain), diagnosed with neuropathic pain.MethodsGenomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes by standard techniques. We selected 29 non synonymus SNPs. Studies were performed using TaqMan probes (Applied biosystems) for the analysis of the polimorphisms in the following genes: IL6, IL4, IL1B, NOS, eNOS, nNOS, TRPV, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, CYP2D6,  COMT, PTGS2, HTR2A, SLLC6A4, OPRD, OPRM, OPRK, CNR1, DRD2, GABRA1, GABRA6, PPARG, EDN1, BDNF and CHRNA5.Statistical analysis was performed comparing the different allelic variants of the genes in subgruopus of patients: patients with a VAS below and over 50.Results and conclusionPreliminary analysis has shown significant differences (p<0.05) comparing both groups of patients in the IL1B and PTGS2 genes. Il1B is an important mediator of the inflammatory response, involved in a variety of cellular activities, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis. PTGS2 is the key enzyme in biosynthesis of the prostanoids, regulated by specific stimulatory events, suggesting that it is responsible for the prostanoid biosynthesis involved in inflammation  and mitogenesis.This results support the hypothesis that polymorphisms in genes involved in different pathways could be asociated with increased susceptibility to suffer pain.",2011

It typically presents unilaterally (90%) without associated systemic findings. Between the three variants of PHPV(anterior, posterior or a combination of anterior  and posterior presentations) the last one is the most commonly seen. The patient usually has microophthalmia, leukocoria and reduced vision. Cataract and anomalies of the anterior chamber angle are present. Accompanying retinal lesions (detachment, dysplasia) may be seen. Other complications in PHPV are : amblyopia; strabismus; loss of vision; glaucoma.The treatment is surgical and the procedures depend on the clinical presentation. Early surgical rehabilitation may facilitate a better visual outcome. Material and methods: We present a 3 years old girl with visual impairment and moderate psychomotor  delay. She is the product of an uncomplicated full term pregnancy. In her motherâs family are present some cases of cataract and strabismus. Full evaluation (history, clinical exam, biological and imagistic tests, ophthalmological, neurological and genetic evaluation, audiometry) was done. Results: Bilateral strabismus, enophtalmia, amblyopia and cataract were noticed. Ocular ultrasonography revealed bilateral persistent hyperplastic primary vitreous. No hearing impairment was identified. Patientâs family disagrees with surgical eye procedures (vitrectomy). Conclusions: The visual prognosis is poor in this case because it is a bilateral complicated presentation of PHPV. The delay of the surgical rehabilitation would lead to irreversible amblyopia, even loss of vision. Genetic and family counseling, ophthalmological and neurological follow up are mandatory.",2011

The NPHS2 gene encodes podocin protein, which plays an important  role in glomerular ultrafiltration and controlling slit membrane permeability. Podocin is a raft associated component of the glomerular membrane where it is localized at the insertion of the slit diaphragm. It was known that mutations of an NPHS2 can determine specificity  of treatment for children with nephrotic syndrome (NS). In Russian patients with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS) mutations of the NPHS2 gene have remained mainly unknown. The aim of present study was to screen for podocin mutations in Russian children with SRNS. There were 61 patients with SRNS and 15 age matched healthy children. Mean age at onset of proteinuria was 6,3Â±4,8 years. Mutation analysis was performed in eight exons of the NPHS2 gene using the direct DNA sequencing method. We identified mutations and polymorphism variants in the NPHS2 gene: rs3738423 (S96S),  rs61747728 (R229Q), rs1410592 (A318A), rs3818587 (L346L), rs1410592 (A318A), IVS3+1507 C>T, IVS3+1460 C>T, IVS7+7 A>G, IVS7+1078 G>C.

We revealed two new mutations I255T and V338L. It is known that R229Q polymorphism associates with the SRNS in different ethnic groups. In our study frequency of R229Q polymorphism in children with SRNS have met in two times often than in the healthy  group. The frequencies of other polymorphisms was approximately the same in both groups. Thus the detected NPHS2 gene polymorphisms in our patients must be borne in mind when choosing therapy of SRNS.",2011

PCH are subdivided into six types (PCH1 to PCH6), of which PCH2 is  most common accounting for about 90% of all PCH cases.PCH2 is characterised by progressive microcephaly from birth combined with extrapyramidal dyskinesia, lack of voluntary motor or mental development, severe chorea, and frequently epilepsy. It is caused by biallelic mutations in TSEN54, whereby a homozygous c.919G>T (p.Ala307Ser) mutation has been identified in approximately 90% of PCH2 cases. This mutation is thought to be a founder mutation descending of a single couple that lived in the seventeenth century in Volendam, The Netherlands. Most children die before age ten years,  although survival beyond age 20 has been reported. Typical findings in PCH2 in cerebral Magnetic Resonance Imaging (cMRI) are, beyond ventral pontine atrophy/hypotrophy, cerebellar hypoplasia whereby the cerebellar hemispheres are more affected than cerebellar vermis with a relative sparing of the flocculi.

For the study of genetic diseases, epidemiology plays a central role in public health, improvement, and disease prevention. However, evaluation and ascertainment of the incidence of these disorders is limited  because of difficulties of diagnosis and rarity in general population. To elucidate the incidence of malformation syndromes, we used data from population based monitoring system and genetic clinic of highly specialized childrenâs hospital in the same prefecture. KAMP is one of the population based birth defects monitoring program operating from 1981 in Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan. It covers a half of total births, 40,000 annually. During the study period, the annual number of patients with Down syndrome in the genetic clinic has been correlated with the prevalence in the KAMP. These results suggested the hypothesis  that other recognizable malformation syndromes may visit the clinic with the same ratio. According to the known prevalence of Down syndrome (1/800), we calculated the incidence of the recognizable malformation syndromes.

 Dopamine gene receptors expression in psoriatic patients,P02.204,"M. Mohammadian1, G. Ahangari1, H. Mortazavi2, R. Torabi1, S. Ghasemi1",1Dept,"of Medical Biotechnology, National Institute of Genetic Engineering  and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2Department  of Dermatology, Razi hospital, Tehran university of medical science,, Tehran,  Islamic Republic of Iran. Dopamine plays roles as a neurotransmitter and neuromodulator with  functions in brain and peripheral tissues. Dopamine receptor (DRD) subtypes are related to depression and also have been shown to be present in certain cells of the immune system. There are some evidences that suggest that DRD subtypes are responsible for high  lymphocyte activation in psoriasis. Psoriasis is a proliferative and inflammatory disease. There are at least five subtypes of DRDs, D1, D2, D3, D4, and D5. The D1 and D5 receptors are members of the D1 like family of DRDs, whereas the D2, D3 and D4 receptors are members of the D2 like family. The aim of this study is evaluation of DRD (3,5) genes expression in psoriatic patients in comparison with normal individuals by Real Time PCR.The PBMC was separated from whole blood by Ficoll hypaque. The total cellular RNA was extracted and the cDNA was synthesized. This  process was followed by real time PCR using primer pairs specific for DRD mRNA and beta actin as internal control. Results show relative overexpression of DRD3 gene has significant changes between two groups, but we could not find significant changes between two groups for DRD5 gene. Considering these results the present study has shown a change in DRD3 gene expression in PBMC of psoriasis patients. Due to this data, we conclude that significant increased expression of DRD3 gene may has an important role in psoriasis.",2011

Methods: We reviewed data from all patients with PAH considered as idiopathic and patients with a family history of PAH who underwent genetic counseling. We compared clinical, functional, and hemodynamic characteristics between carriers and non carriers of a BMPR2 mutation, according to gender or BMPR2 mutation type.Results: PAH patients carrying a BMPR2 mutation (n,115) were significantly younger at diagnosis than non carriers (n,267) (35.8Â±15.4 and 47.5Â±16.2 respectively, p<0.0001). The presence of a BMPR2 mutation was associated with a younger age at diagnosis in females  (36.4Â±14.9 in BMPR2 mutation carriers and 47.4Â±15.8 in non carriers, p<0.0001), and males (34.6Â±16.8 in BMPR2 mutation carriers and 47.8Â±17.1 in non carriers, p<0.0001). BMPR2 mutation carriers had a more severe hemodynamic compromise at diagnosis, but this was not influenced by gender. No differences in survival and time to death or lung transplantation were found in male and female PAH patients carrying a BMPR2 mutation. No differences were observed in clinical outcomes according to the type of BMPR2 mutations (missense, truncating, large rearrangement or splice defect).Conclusion: When compared to non carriers, BMPR2 mutation carriers from the French PAH network are younger at diagnosis and present with a more severe hemodynamic compromise, irrespective of gender. Moreover, BMPR2 mutation type had no influence on clinical  phenotypes in our patient population.",2011

In germlinal retinoblastoma, mutations in RB1 gene predispose increase cancer  risk during development and segregates as an autosomal dominant  trait with high penetrance (90%).MethodsIn this study, we screened 30 family members from a certain families using high resolution melting assay (HRM) and DNA  direct sequencing.  We evaluate the phenotype and penetrance of a germ line mutation of  RB1 gene in a large Taiwanese family. ResultsThe molecular analysis and clinical details of this family showed  phenotypic variability associated with certain V654L mutation in exon 19 of RB1 gene in 11 individuals. The phenotype varies from  asymptomatic to unilateral tumor. Only 4 individuals (2 males and 2 females) developed unilateral retinoblastoma, which results in calculated low penetrance of 36% (4/11). In particular, none of them relatives in this family exhibited the variable severity and bilateral retinoblastoma.Conclusions The diseased eye ratio (DER) for this family was 0.36,  lower than current estimates. This suggests that the RB1 V654L  mutation was itself insufficient to develop the retinoblastoma.",2011

We report on a series of 28 patients, 16 probands and  12 relatives, presenting with heterozygous SALL4 mutations on  chromosome 20q13.13 q13.2.Patients. Sixteen probands were initially referred for Okihiro syndrome Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology119 (7/16), or other overlapping phenotypes such as Holt Oram (8/16)  or Townes Brocks (1/16) syndromes. After clinical expertise, final considered diagnoses were Okihiro (11) and Holt Oram (5) syndromes.Methods. The clinical and molecular characteristics were analyzed in order to identify genotype phenotype correlations. Clinical details  were obtained from the referent practitioners. Direct sequencing of the complete SALL4 coding region and quantitative real time PCR were  performed. After identification of the causal mutation or deletion, 12 affected relatives were also tested.Results. We identified 100% radial ray malformations (28/28), 39% Duane anomalies (11/28), 28.5% renal anomalies (8/28), 25% heart defects (7/28), 21% growth retardation (6/28), 14% deafness (4/28), 11% scoliosis (3/28) and 11% gastrointestinal abnormalities (3/28). Most of the patients carry either a frameshift mutation or a deletion in  SALL4 within exons 2 (68%: 19/28) and 3 (21%: 6/28). Two patients were mutated in exon 4, and 1 presented a complete SALL4 deletion.  Thirteen mutations had never been reported previously.Discussion. We confirm in this large series that SALL4 mutations  cause a range of variable phenotypes, including Okihiro and Holt Oram syndromes. These results suggest that all patients presenting with a radial ray malformation should be referred to an ophthalmologist and tested for SALL4 if an anomaly was to be identified.

FS are the most common type of epilepsy in childhood, with an incidence rate of 2 14%. If febrile seizures persist after six years old, they are considered as an epileptic syndrome named GEFS+, a rare familiar  disease that arises as FS and progresses to generalized epilepsy in adults. GEFS+ presents an extremely heterogeneous spectrum of epileptic phenotypes whose acuteness varies from mild to severe.It is well known that the gene coding the Î± 1 sodium channel subunit (SCN1A) is mutated in GEFS+ patients; moreover it has been recently suggested as a possible susceptibility locus for FS. We investigated the involvement of SCN1A in a group of GEFS+ and FS families by means of mutation analysis. The study indentified two missense mutations (R542Q and T297I) in highly conserved regions of the  channel together with several known SNPs. The R542Q is a de novo mutation already known to be associated with both autism and myoclonic epilepsy, while the T297I, previously associated with SMEI, was identified in all affected members of a family showing FS.Functional studies aimed at evaluating the effect of these mutations on the physiological properties of the channel are currently in progress. Preliminary results suggest that these variations can compromise the functionality of the protein altering the activation/inactivation properties of the channel.",2011

A longer isoform of 462 aa has been proposed but its role remains unknown.AIMS: To investigate the contribution of BSCL2 to HSP and motor neuropathies.METHODS: Sequencing the whole coding region of the large BSCL2 isoform (NM_001130702.1; NP_001124174.1) in: a) 106 cases of  spastic paraplegia without mutations in spastin and atlastin; b) 10 patients with peripheral neuropathy and pyramidal signs without mutations in other CMT genes. Sequence variations were checked in 180 control individuals.RESULTS: One family with the p.N152S (p.N88S in short isoform) mutation showed manifestation spectrum from pure HSP to SS and pyramidal signs without subjective symptoms. One family with the p.S154L (p.S90L) mutation presented pure HSP, CMT2 or dHMN. Seven new BSCL2 sequence variations were detected (4 missense, one in frame deletion, two intronic).CONCLUSIONS: Seipin mutations account for at least 1% of spastic paraparesis and 10% of motor neuropathies with pyramidal signs in our series. Variable expression within a given kindred is the rule,  difficulting diagnostic awareness. The role of BSCL2 isoforms in the nervous system, as well as the functional effect of sequence variants in motor neuron disorders remains to be elucidated.",2011

The patient here described shows a significant phenotypic overlap with the previously reported patients with SETBP1 haploinsufficiency. All these patients differ significantly from the Schinzel Giedion syndrome. The fundamental phenotypic feature of our patient and of the previously described two patients is the discrepancy between expressive and receptive language abilities, suggesting an essential role of SETB1 in expressive speech development. Functional studies will be necessary to unravel the exact function of this gene.",2011

 Autosomal recessive form of s evere c ombined i mmune Deficiency Disease as the predominant pattern in Iranian patients,P02.220,"M. Malek, M. Houshmand",Special Medical Center,"Genetic Laboratory, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. introduction : Severe Combined Immune Deficiency  (SCID) is a  rare syndrome which can show an X linked or autosomal recessive  inheritance pattern. World wide investigations showed nearly 48% X linked inheritance, caused by mutations of the IL 2 receptor. This form of SCID is characteristically T  /NK /B+. On the other hand many  genes are involved in the autosomal recessive form. The aim of this study was to determine the inheritance pattern of SCID among affected families in Iran. m ethods: Genomic DNA of 20 unrelated male patients with T B+  clinical symptoms of SCID was purified from peripheral blood. PCR and sequencing of the IL2RG gene was performed in patients to find out if they harbour any mutation.Results: Because the patients were considered to have T  B+ SCID ,  we analyzed the IL2RG gene of the patients for mutations by direct genomic sequencing. The X linked mode of inheritance was not detected in any patient. The IL2RG gene of all the patients was normal,  suggesting an autosomal mode of inheritance of SCID. Discussion: About 48% of SCID patients worldwide are reported  to have IL2RG deficiency, but our preliminary result shows that the autosomal recessive pattern is predominant in Iranian SCID patients. The high frequency of consanguineous marriage makes it less likely that isolated cases of SCID are caused by IL2RG mutations. However, this conclusion is based on only a small number of patients. This is a pilot study and much more investigation is needed to clarify which gene is most frequently causative in Iranian patients.",2011

We found a total of 3,787 aberrations with an average of 36 copy number changes per individual. To rule out copy number polymorphisms, a screening of all identified CNVs was carried out against an independent control cohort of 820 healthy individuals.To narrow down our search for potential pathogenic CNVs, we analysed all remaining 1,499 aberrations based on their gene content. A total of 46 CNVs (27 duplications, 19 deletions) in 34 patients were retained for follow up. Inheritance of 30 CNVs (2 de novo, 14 maternally and 14  paternally inherited) could be verified in 23 families. After re evaluating the parental growth phenotypes, 10 CNVs (2 de novo, 6 maternally and 2 paternally inherited) in 9 families, including 5 duplications and 5 deletions, were scored as potentially pathogenic. These CNVs cover a range of 34 to 14,229 kb in size with only one aberration smaller than 100 kb.This is the first report of a systematic approach using molecular karyotyping to identify novel genetic causes of shortness of stature.

SRS is caused by epigenetic dysregulation of the imprinted genes controlled by two Imprinting Centers Regions: ICR1  and ICR2 located on chromosome 11p15.5. Hypomethylation of ICR1 is found in ~40% of patients with SRS. In addition, hypomethylation of other imprinted loci can be detected in ~7% of ICR1 hypomethylation carriers. Moreover, 5 10% of SRS individuals have epigenetic alterations due to maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7).We analyzed 87 patients with clinical diagnosis of SRS. We examined the methylation profile of the ICR1 by MS MLPA analysis and mUPD7 by STR analysis for chromosome 7. We confirmed hypomethylation  of ICR1 in 31 individuals. Interestingly, 2 of these patients were monozygotic twins with both ICR1 and ICR2 hypomethylation. STR analysis carried out on patients without detected hypomethylation of ICR1 revealed mUPD7 in 8 patients. We demonstrated maternal hetero , isodisomy and a mixture of hetero  and isodisomy. Applied molecular techniques enabled us to confirm clinical diagnosis of SRS in ~45% of patients. The cause of almost half of SRS cases is still  unknown . It is hypothesized  that other imprinted loci and molecular  factors can be involved in SRS etiology.

In three patients probably pathogenic de novo imbalances were identified: a 5.4 Mb microdeletion in 15q26 including IGF1R, a 2.5 Mb microdeletion  of the DiGeorge region and a 9.1 Mb duplication in Xq26. In further 18  patients we detected a total of 26 different, so far unregistered copy number alterations (CNAs): up to now, 15 were determined to be probably apathogenic rare familial CNVs; for three CNAs a de novo origin was discovered. To our current knowledge it is unclear whether they are causative for the patientsâ clinical features. In summary, in three of 39 (7,7%) patients pathogenic de novo imbalances were detected. In further three patients the pathogenic significance of the CNAs remains unclear. In conclusion, submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances significantly contribute to the mutational spectrum of the SRS.

Recombination  and replication based mechanisms have been described to generate genomic rearrangements. The mechanism responsible for the vast majority of common sized  recurrent rearrangements is nonallelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between region specific low copy repeats (LCRs). This mechanism assumes that recombination between the same pair of directly oriented LCRs could result either in deletion or reciprocal duplication. So far, only a few duplications reciprocal to the recurrent deletions associated with different syndromes (e.g. Williams Beuren and Smith Magenis syndrome) have been described.Here we present a patient with 5q35.2 duplication of the Sotos syndrome critical region. The Sotos syndrome is characterized  by childhood overgrowth, learning disability and distinctive facial appearance, and is caused by NSD1 gene defects (point mutations, partial gene deletions and 5q35 microdeletions). Clinical evaluation of the patient at 13 years revealed short stature ( 4SD), microcephaly ( 3.5SD), dysmorphic face, bradydactyly, cone shape epiphyses, delayed bone age, and mental retardation.

Cutis laxa, characterized by fragmentation of elastic  fibres, has been associated with several syndromic phenotypes with heterogeneous mode of inheritance. Besides the skin symptoms, related systemic features are diverse, including skeletal, pulmonary, cardiovascular and metabolic symptoms. Results & discussion. The first child of healthy non consanguineous parents is presented, born at 38 weeksâ gestation. During pregnancy, an isolated unilateral hydronephrosis was detected. At birth, dysmorphic features were noted, including macrocephaly with sparse frontal hair, a pointed chin and low set, posteriorly rotated ears. In addition, redundant skin folds in the neck, hands and lower limbs were present. Skin biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of cutis laxa. Soon after birth, he developed episodes of hypoglycaemia. Radiographies revealed an advanced bone age (4.5 months for 5 weeks of age) and advanced  bone maturation.The phenotype of this patient showed resemblance to Costello syndrome. However, these patients do not have advanced bone age and maturation. Micro array analysis revealed a 5q35.2q35.3 deletion, compatible with Sotos syndrome.

Three cases of alleged Sotos syndrome with cutis laxa have been previously reported; however, contrary to our patient, neither advanced bone age nor hypoglycaemia were present.Conclusion. The phenotype of our patient does not fully comply with the Sotos with cutis laxa syndrome.

The molecular cause of Temple syndrome comprises a deficiency of imprinted gene expression in the paternal chromosome region 14q32 due to maternal  uniparental disomy 14 (upd(14)mat), an epimutation or deletion on the paternal allele. Chromosome 14 contains an imprinted gene cluster, which is regulated by a differentially methylated region (IG DMR) between the genes  DLK1 and GTL2. We report on a six year old boy with severe neonatal hypotonia and feeding difficulties, followed by hyperphagia with onset during his third year of life with absence of satiety and leading to obesity. Additional features were short stature, small hands and feet, delayed psychomotor development, sleep apnea and fever attacks. His phenotype was  strongly suggestive for Prader Willi syndrome, but methylation analysis of the 15q11 q13 region revealed no abnormalities. Considering Temple syndrome as an important differential diagnosis we consequently performed methylation analysis of the 14q32 region, which revealed lack of the paternal band.

Array based comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) revealed tetrasomy for proximal 14q corresponding to a 14,6 Mb region on 14q11.2q13.2 spanning more than 60 known genes. To determine the origin of the marker chromosome we analyzed polymorphic markers using quantitative fluorescent PCR (QF PCR). The results from the QF PCR indicate formation of the marker chromosome in  maternal meiosis. Partial tetrasomy 14q has previously been reported in four cases, however, this is the first described non mosaic case not resulting in early lethality.",2011

The abdominal wall is much more often involved in congenital birth defects than the thoracic wall, which are more severe and have dismal outcomes more often.  Material and methods: This is a 4 years period analysis of the entire cases of congenital thoracic and abdominal wall defects admitted to the pediatric surgery department of our hospital. Results: There were six cases of gastroschisis, two omphaloceles, one sternal cleft and one case of ectopia cordis. Surgical repair was performed in emergency conditions for all gastroschisis and omphalocels with good outcomes. Postoperative complications were: intestinal adhesions after one case of gastroschisis repair and rezidual eventration after omphalocele closure, considered with no significant influence over the  final outcomes. For ectopia cordis surgical covering was performed but, unfortunately the patient died 24 hours after surgery. No surgical treatment was necessary for the sternal cleft. Conclusions: Although the prenatal diagnosis is accessible, there are many cases diagnosed after birth. This study helps to bring together the most recent epidemiological data regarding outcomes and interventions for thoracic abdominal wall defects and to compare the epidemiology of such kind of malformations in different regions of the country.",2011
 t hree t umor Necrosis Factor promoter polymorphisms in Romanian patients with s jogrenâs syndrome Results from a pilot study,P02.237,"R. Sfrent Cornateanu, D. Opris, O. Popa, C. Bara, R. Ionescu","Carol Davila University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania","SjÃ¶grenâs Syndrome (SS) is an autoimmune disorder which affects  exocrine glands. Tumor Necrosis Factor alpha (TNF Î±) contributes to the physiopathology of autoimmune diseases including SS. The  857C/T,  308G/A and  238G/A polymorphisms of TNF Î± gene demonstrated their influence on the susceptibility and clinical phenotype of  autoimmune diseases.We aimed to investigate the influence of these three TNF Î± polymorphisms on the susceptibility and clinical phenotype of primary SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome in Romanian patients.We assessed 141 Romanian subjects (37 primary SS patients and  104 healthy unrelated matched controls) for all three polymorphisms. TNF Î±  857C/T (rs1799724),  308 G/A (rs1800629) and  238G/A (rs 361525) polymorphisms were genotyped by Real Time PCR (Taqman SNP Genotyping Assays C_2215707_10, C_7514879_10 and C_11918223_10 respectively, Applied Biosystems, USA). Association tests for each SNP were performed using SPSS 12.0 (T student test) and p values â¤0.05 were considered significant.The Hardy Weinberg equilibrium assessed using Chi square test was respected in all studied groups for all polymorphisms.The frequencies of minor alleles  857T,  308A and  238A, were similar in primary SS patients and controls (0.21/0,16/0.09 and 0.18/0,15/0.04 respectively). Primary SS patients carriers of A allele ( 238G/A) seems  to have less digestive (t, 2,95) and systemic (t,1,4) manifestations than G carriers. The primary SS patients carriers of T allele ( 857C/T) seems to have more xerophthalmia (t,2,8) and xerostomia (t,3,04) than C allele carriers.Conclusion: TNF Î± polymorphisms ( 857C/T and  238G/A) seems to influence clinical manifestations. The three polymorphisms of TNF Î± does not influence susceptibility to SS. These results should be confirmed on larger patients cohort.",2011
Unusual family advice causes t urner like syndrome,P02.238,M. A. Soylemez,"Marmara University Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey","Objective: To recognize long term use of high potency steroids from an  early age as a potential cause of iatrogenic Cushing Syndrome (CS)  and Turner like symptoms.Case Presentation: A 16 year old teenage girl was referred from her gynecologist with diagnosis of Turner syndrome (TS). The most  consistent features of TS are short stature and premature ovarian failure. She had initially presented for follow up of amenorrhea about 8 weeks prior to referral and was noted to have short stature (<3.p) at a hospital. Upon presentation to our clinic, she was noted to have a round plethoric face, supraclavicular/dorsocervical fat pads, centripetal obesity and short stature. Lab tests showed ACTH 15pg/mL (6 46pg/mL) and 8 a.m cortisol of 0.3mcg/dL (6 30mcg/dL). TSH, LH, FSH, and prolactin were normal. Chromosomal analysis revealed a 46,XX karyotype. Iatrogenic and factitious Cushing Syndrome  was investigated. Further discussion with the patient and her family revealed oral use of 0.75 mg/day dexamethasone for 12 years. The patient is a 16 year old teenage girl who had begun to take high dose deksamethasone by the advice of her family at the age of four. She continued to use the steroid so far.Conclusions: Oral intake of high dose steroid at the beginning of the  childhood can cause iatrogenic CS and Turner like symptoms. An inspection is not enough searching for the right diagnosis of genetic syndromes. We recommend a careful patient history and a detailed physical examination in terms of Turner syndrome and other genetic diseases.",2011

The unbalanced rearrangements are not common; however, have significant clinical expression. The parental balanced translocation produces unbalanced  chromosome, which is eventually transmitted to next generation through fertilization of gametes carrying the derivative chromosome. The carriers of balanced rearrangements mostly do not have recognizable phenotypic expression. We report a family comprising of healthy and non consanguineous young parents and their primi newborn severely affected with multiple congenital anomalies and systemic disorders. Conventional G banding analysis of somatic chromosomes identified a balanced translocation, t(6;10)(p23;q24) in mother and an unbalanced rearrangement, der(6),t(6:10)(p23;q24)mat in the child. The child has  inherited a derivative chromosome 6 with partial deletion of 6 (p23 pter) and partial trisomy 10(q24 qter), which has obviously resulted in fusion of genes of two different chromosomes. The prominent phenotypic features of del(6p), including high forehead, flat nasal bridge, agenesis of left year, atrio septal defect (ASD), craniosynostosis and growth retardation were overlapping with specific Axenfeld Reiger  , Larsen   and Ritscher Sinzel/3 C syndromes; however, lacking in ocular anomalies, skeletal laxity or cerebellar malformation. Therefore, this report rules out the isolated effect of del(6p23) or trisomy 10(q24) on distinct previously reported syndromes and proposes the combined effect of unbalanced chromosomal alteration.",2011

Maternal UPD 14 is characterised by intrauterine growth retardation, hypotonia at birth,  short stature, small hands and feet, scoliosis, mild developmental delay, early childhood obesity and precocious puberty, a phenotype overlapping with Prader Willi syndrome (PWS). Paternal UPD (14) is reportedly less common, more severe and is characterised by severe neonatal respiratory problems, hypotonia, abdominal muscular defects, skeletal anomalies, and characteristic facies. The study aimed to determine the frequency of UPD14 in 238 patients  who were referred for PWS (86 patients) or SMA (152 patients) testing and who tested negative for the requested disease. Patients were sub classified into an infantile hypotonia group and a childhood PWS phenotype group. Genomic DNA was modified with a bisulfite  modification kit. Multiplex methylation PCR of the modified DNA was used to determine whether UPD14 was present. Thirteen (5.5%) patients tested positive for paternal UPD14, while no patients tested positive for maternal UPD14. All paternal UPD 14 patients were from the hypotonic infants group. Further clinical and molecular analysis is in progress. Paternal UPD14 which is reported to be rare was identified in a  significant number of infants (<1 yr) referred for PWS and/or SMA testing, suggesting that neonatal and infantile hypotonia is a significant feature.

Modest perturbations in the dosage of the latter might substantially alter the expression of multiple target genes. Hence these genes are prime candidates to play  a role in the phenotype of the patients.To address the physiological and molecular role of one of these genes, the Bromodomain Adjacent to Zinc finger 1b gene (BAZ1B), in vivo,  we ablated by transposable element insertion the expression of its ortholog in mice. Almost all Baz1b  /  embryos (97%) die a few hours  after birth. The rare survivors do not present any of the craniofacial  abnormalities previously identified in knockouts of the murine orthologs of other genes of the WBS interval. They are, however, smaller in size than their control littermates and present a smaller heart with  larger ventricular walls. Noticeably, this abnormal heart appears to be associated with an increased cardiac function as measured by the percentage of blood ejected with each contraction. This translates in a significant increase in nighttime activity and sleep perturbation. We are currently characterizing histologically the heart of Baz1b  /  embryos.Potential candidates genes for these multiple phenotypes have been  identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation with antibodies raised against the BAZ1B unusual tyrosine kinase.",2011

The papules differed in size from several millimeters to one giant plaque covering almost  his entire back. At the age of one year, part of this lesion was removed from his neck in order to allow better movement of his head. Over the years two more papules were removed. Removed papules did not grow back.

It has nine exons and an open reading frame of 1,245 bp, encoding a 414 amino acids protein.In the last few years, considerable amount of data has shown that  WWOX  participates in a number of cellular processes including  growth, differentiation and apoptosis. Moreover, inactivation of WWOX   has been observed in a variety of human malignancies, and targeted deletion of one allele of Wwox in mice causes increased spontaneous and chemically induced tumour incidence, including lymphomas, lung papillary carcinomas, liver tumours, and gastric squamous cell carcinomas. Altogether, these data indicate that WWOX  is a  tumour suppressor and that inactivation of one allele is sufficient for tumourigenesis. Here we report the identification of a WWOX  germline mutation in a  52 years old female with psoriasis and an extradural mass (neurogenic tumour versus hemangiopericytoma or meningioma were considered as differential diagnosis), who was referred to our laboratory for molecular testing of Neurofibromatosis 1. The mutation consists in a 48.6 kb deletion and a 14 bp insertion, resulting in exclusion of exons 6 8 from the mature transcript. The same mutation was detected in the probandâs father and two siblings, without diagnosed cancer.Our findings show that inherited mutations in WWOX  gene do not lead  to a high predisposition to develop malignancies, as could be expected from mouse models and other reported data.

Forms of HDCT caused by mutations in the TGFBR1 or TGFBR2 genes have a severe prognosis due to the high risk of aortic rupture.Patients and  m ethods: We performed clinical and genealogical  examination of patients undergoing surgical repair of aortic root  dilation/aneurysm and their relatives. Personal and family history were collected, and clinical examination (standard and 24 hour Holter ECG, EchoCG, Dopplerography, chest radiography) and genetic analysis were performed.Results: We examined 66 index patients and relatives (mean age 33 y.o., range 4 to 64 y.o.) with HDCT symptoms (57% male). A positive family history was detected in 21%. A significant number of patients (77%) required operation because of large vessel aneurysm and/or  valvular insufficiency. The phenotypic spectrum within the HDCT group was as follows: Loeys Dietz Syndrome 5%, Marfan Syndrome 16%, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome type IV 14%, Ehlers Danlos Syndrome type VI 4%, TAAD 26%, functional valvular insufficiency 11%, aneurysms of large vessels 7%, MASS phenotype 3%, non differentiated HDCT 14%. The overwhelming majority of patients had had cardiac arrhythmias. Mutation screening in the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes is in progress now. c onclusion:  Correct molecular confirmation in families with HDCT is  required to identify probands at high risk for aortic dissection. Even in  the absence of identified mutations causing HDCT, we recommend standardized examinations of first degree relatives in affected families.

Aim: To present the case of a boy with Noonan syndrome and right renal hypoplasia. Material and Methods: 19 months old B.M., of male gender, was referred to our department for a urinary tract infection. We Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology128 based our diagnosis on clinical features and imaging studies. Results:  During the physical we noted the following features: micrognathia, low set posteriorly rotated ears, hypertelorism, down slanting palpebral fissures, epicanthal folds, proptosis, strabismus, dental malocclusion, short neck with low posterior hairline, shield chest, pectus excavatus,  brachydactyly, blunt fingertips, retractile left testis. Furthermore, the child had a short stature. The neurologic consult found a mild motor delay. The cardiac ultrasound showed aortic regurgitation and obstructive hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. We performed an abdominal ultrasound which revealed right renal hypoplasia. The audiologic and ophthalmologic examinations were unremarkable at this time, but the child will require ongoing follow up. Discussion: Renal anomalies are present in 10% of patients and are not usually clinically significant. In this case, a condition associated with this anomaly led to the proper  diagnosis.

There are no clear phenotypic differences between BP1   BP2 and BP1   BP3 deletions.

The 18q  deletion was first detected by G banding karyotype and appeared to be a small deletion. Molecular techniques, including whole genomic array, multiplex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with BAC probes were required in order to better define the rearrangement, to determine the breakpoints and to better delineate the genotype/phenotype correlation. The Cytogenetics Whole Genome 2.7M Array (Affymetrix) showed a result arr 18p11.32p11.22(234,125 9,782,925)x3, 18q21.2 q23(50,293,625 76,084,580)x1 dn.

FISH technique using RP11 113J12 and RP11 231N16 probes confirmed the results, since these probes were in upside down order. Thus, the duplication/deletion rearrangement probably originated due to an abnormal meiotic recombination within a pericentric inversion. The deleted and duplicated regions encompass genes whose imbalances contributed to the severe phenotype in the patient.

These rearrangements are associated with abnormal head size, mental retardation, autism and congenital anomalies. Most often, microdeletions and  duplications of 1q21.1 occur de novo. We  describe a large family with a 1q21.1 microduplication. m ethods & Results: The proband is the first child of non  consanguineous Dutch parents. Prenatal ultrasound revealed an  enlarged heart with a ventricular septal defect and wide aortic and pulmonary arteries. After pregnancy termination, external morphologic examination demonstrated a proportioned fetus with a round face, hypertelorism and short palpebral fissures. Autopsy showed a grossly enlarged heart, perimembranous ventricular septal defect,  absent pulmonary valve, dysplastic tricuspid valve, persistent left superior vena cava and abnormally wide and thickened wall of the ascending aorta. Genome wide SNP array analysis on DNA from cultured amniocytes revealed a 1q21.1 microduplication of 2.2 Mb.

Non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between these recombination substrates explains the existence of recurrent rearrangements within the 22q11.2 region, and the high prevalence of de novo events. The most common  recombination event occurs between LCR22 2 and LCR22 4, and gives rise to a 3.0 Mb deletion, associated with DiGeorge syndrome.We report on a novel recurrent 22q11.2 deletion syndrome in a 14 months old girl with a common arterial trunk, growth delay and mild dysmorphic features. She presented a normal development. The current deletion spans LCR22 4, the distal part of the common 22q11.2 deletion syndrome and the proximal part of the distal 22q11 deletion syndrome. This deletion did not occur by NAHR between any of the major LCR22s. However, by means of extended long template  PCR the proximal and distal breakpoint containing regions were found to coincide with a 3.7 kb block of 97% homology between 19,351,886 19,355,637 and 20,799,044 20,802,748. We believe that these homologous regions served as recombination substrates for this novel 22q11.2 deletion.An identical deletion was described recently in a normally developing girl with imperforate anus and multiple septal defects (Ogilvie et  al., 2009). Interestingly, both cases presented with a congenital  heart defect (CHD) and growth delay, but no developmental delay.

Since our patient had additional findings and differences compared to Sotos syndrome namely coarse features, wrinkled skin, hyperextensibility of joints, mainly in digits, growth retardation, while Sotos patients have excessive growth (>97 th centile) array comparative genomic  hybridization (aCGH) was performed showing a 0.5 Mb deletion in  5q35.2â ter with maximum,174416712 and minimum,174837769 breakpoint boundaries.

Ramos Arroyo","Complejo Hospitalario de Navarra, Pamplona, Spain","Distal deletions of chromosome 8p are associated with congenital heart  defects. Other features include microcephaly, mental retardation and facial anomalies. GATA4 has been involved in the heart defects and,  the TNKS in the behavioural problems and learning disabilities. The  region between them, including MSRA and SOX7, has been suggested  to play a critical role in microcephaly and facial dysmorphism. Some cases share a commonly deleted region of ~6Mb with breakpoints clustering in the same regions (low copy repeats 8p OR REPD and 8p OR REPP). However, there are exceptional cases with larger or smaller deletions with variable phenotype so, it is necessary to investigate the precise deleted region in atypical cases, to define the minimal critical region.We report a 3 year old non dysmorphic girl with microcephaly, speech and developmental delay and normal cardiac evaluation. Karyotype  showed a de novo del(8)(p23). FISH and MLPA confirmed a terminal deletion between 10.2 and 11 Mb involving TNKS and MSRA, but not  including the GATA4 region (TelVysion 8 Vysis, P036 telomere, P096 MR2 and P311 congenital heart disease, MRC Holland).Although the patient presents a larger deletion than previously reported, she presents less features, therefore it is important to test which specific genes are deleted. On one hand, GATA4  was  not deleted as we expected. On the other hand and as it has been proposed, MSRA deletion could explain microcephaly in our case but  other specific molecular analysis (aCGH) will be performed to find out if SOX7 is present, explaining the absence of facial dysmorphism.",2011

This deletion includes TNKS gene, known as a candidate gene for CdLS, supporting  other studies invalidating TNKS in CdLS. In addition, the absence of cardiac malformations often associated with the 8p deletions could be explained by the retention of SOX7 and GATA4 genes, known for their major role in cardiac development.

FISH analysis with subtelomeric probes confirmed the translocation. Further studies with array CGH analysis (Agilent, 180K) demonstrated the presence of several copy number variants, including a duplication on chromosome 3, two deletions on chromosome 6, and a deletion on chromosome 13: arr 3q26.1(163,992,703 164,108,151)x3, 6q13q14.1(75,314,285 76,187,164)x1, 6q14.1(80,785,392 80,911,216)x1, 13q31.3(89,597,407 90,636,021)x1.Deleted regions on chromosome 6 were 873Kb and 126Kb in size, and were separated by a 4.6Mb normal region. The deletion included 4 genes, one of which (COL12A1) is a known candidate gene for connective tissue pathology and is probably involved in the kyphosis and foot deformities seen in our patient.The small size of the 6q deletion (~1Mb) and the presence of copy number variations on both chromosomes 3 and 13, suggest the existence of a more complex rearrangement than the one previously described. Therefore additional analyses should be done to unravel the nature of this rearrangement. This study provides further evidence that cryptic genomic imbalances are common in patients with apparently balanced translocations and abnormal phenotypes, and emphasizes the importance of using high resolution genome wide analysis to characterize complex rearrangements.",2011

Intrachromosomal insertional translocation was found in at least three generations. Three mentally retarded cases and multiple abortions in the family were found. Material and methods: whole genome array CGH was performed on Agilent oligo chip 44K. Microsatellite markers and MLPA were used to confirm the array CGH findings. FISH using BAC probes were used to locate and confirm the insertional translocation.Results: in a series of 200 patients with mental retardation associated with congenital anomalies, we found one patient with an interstitial duplication in 19p13. Initially it was thought that this change had arisen de novo because the duplication was not present in the parents of the index case. However, the appearance of another case with the  same duplication in the family made us suspect the presence of an insertional translocation. This was confirmed by FISH with region specific probes.Discussion: Insertional translocations can be much more common than initially thought. Therefore, following the detection of a pure duplication or deletion that causes disease in a patient, it should be characterized by FISH in order to offer adequate genetic counselling.",2011

Diagnosis of 1p36 deletion represents a challenge for cytogeneticists inasmuch as these deletions are hardly visible by classical cytogenetic techniques. The solution is the application of FISH or array CGH. However, the former shows only  loss of a small chromosomal region, whereas the latter is expensive for numerous laboratories around the world. To avoid significant expenses, we have tested whether high resolution CGH (HR CGH) can be used for diagnosis of 1p36 deletion syndrome. Cytogenetic studies of 3500 children with mental retardation and congenital malformations allowed to identify the deletion in one case only. Additional analysis of 100 cases non randomly selected according to phenotypical manifestations by HR CGH provided for detection of three other 1p36 deletions: del(1)(p36.1p36.3), del(1)(p36.13p36.21), del(1)(p36.22p36.23). Array CGH  analysis has confirmed data obtained. Deletion sizes varied from 4.4 Mb to 12 Mb and encompassed regions previously reported to be involved in 1p36 deletion syndrome. It is noteworthy that one case demonstrated multiple chromosome abnormalities: constitutional 47,XXY and mosaic 12p tetrasomy in addition to 1p36 deletion. Phenotypic manifestations were similar to those usually observed in 1p36 deletions, being, however, insufficient for the clinical diagnosis of the syndrome. Our data shows that HR CGH can be used for diagnosis of 1p36 deletion syndrome (prescreening before array CGH application).

Speech delay was found in 5/6 patients, with dysarthry in 3/6, mental retardation in 4/6 patients, ASD phenotype in 3/6 patients, mild non specific dysmorphism (3/6) with prominent ear lobes in 2/6 patients, normal growth parameters with macrocephaly in 1/6 patient and microcephaly in 1/6. Variable expressivity or incomplete penetrance was found in both familial cases. The clinical and molecular data of this group of patients were compared to the other observations of the literature. The ELKS/ERC1 gene is found in the commonly deleted  region, and appears as a good candidate for speech delay.These results reinforce the hypothesis that the 12p13.33 subtelomeric or interstitial deletions can be responsible of a variable phenotyope ranging from normal developpement, speech delay, to mental retardation and ASD.",2011

Array CGH analysis with Spectral Chip allowing genome scan at 0.3 1Mb resolution has demonstrated duplication of 3pter >p22.3 spanning 36.3 Mb and deletion of Xpter >Xp22.2 spanning 6.4 Mb resulted from an unbalanced translocation t(X;3). Cytogenetic evaluations of parents have shown a presumably balanced translocation between chromosomes X and 3 in mother. Therefore, partial 3p trisomy and Xp monosomy in the index cases have resulted from a maternal translocation. In silico analysis of rearranged  chromosomal regions has shown that 3p duplication involves 285 genes (107 genes are indexed in OMIM) whereas Xp deletion involves 50 genes (22 genes are indexed in OMIM). Additionally, copy number variations (CNVs) located on 9q12, 10q11.22, 15q11.2 and 15q26.3 were detected. However, these CNVs are likely to be benign, taking into account data obtained by bioinformatic analysis (meta analysis of gene expression) and by comparison with previously reported benign CNVs indexed in genome variation databases. Although there are no fewer than 30 reports on similar chromosomal abnormalities, to our knowledge there are no descriptions of array CGH analysis of partial 3p trisomy in the available literature. Therefore, these are the first cases of partial 3p trisomy addressed by high resolution molecular cytogenetic technique of array CGH.",2011

Here, we present molecular cytogenetic and bioinformatic analyses of two cases of terminal 7q loss. The first case is an unbalanced translocation t(7q;21q)(q34;q22.13) reported previously (Vorsanova et al., 2008), whereas the second one is a deletion of 7q36 both featured by characteristic facial dysmorphisms, mental retardation, lumbosacral dysgenesis.

Over the last few years, rearrangements below the detection level of conventional karyotyping have been proved to contribute significantly to the cause of MR. The implementation of SNP array has enabled  the high resolution analysis of copy number variants (CNVs) as duplications/deletions and uniparental disomy (UPD).Here we report use of the SNP array analysis for the first time in an Armenian cohort of 95 children with MR who had no visible cytogenetic abnormalities ascertained by standard karyotyping as well as microdeletion/microduplication, and subtelomeric abnormalities determined by FISH. We applied InfiniumHD whole genome genotyping assay with the HumanCytoSNP 12 BeadChips (Illumina Inc.). Obtained data were analyzed with Illumina GenomeStudio and  QuantiSNP software. Most of the detected CNVs have already been reported in the Database of Genomic Variants or recurrently present in our cohort. Recurrent microdeletion syndromes and UPD associated syndromes were detected in nine cases (9.5%). Furthermore, 7 rare de novo CNVs (<5Mb) considered to be clinically relevant as well as 7 aberrations (>5Mb) also of potential clinical significance were discovered in syndromic and non syndromic cases (16.8%) in chromosome regions, including 2p21 2p16.2, 6q22.1 6q22.32, 9q22.33 9q31.2, 10q26.11 10q26.3, 12q21.2 12q21.32, and 14q23.1 14q24.3.

We report additional patients with these deletions from 2 unrelated families identified primarily due to mental  retardation (MR). One patient is a 5 year old boy affected with high functioning autism, mild MR, obesity and speech delay. The second case is a 4 year old boy suffering from mild MR, microcephaly, speech delay and chorioretinitis. Karyotyping revealed a normal karyotype in both patients. SNP array analysis (Illumina HumanCytoSNP 12) demonstrated in both cases identical ~800 kb deletions of 15q25.2 q25.3 (chr15:82.7 83.5Mb (hg18)) flanked by low copy repeats (LCRs). The deletions are adjacent to recurrent 15q25.2 deletions associated with congenital diaphragmatic hernia, cognitive  deficits and Diamond Blackfan anemia which are also flanked by LCRs. Chromosome 15q25.2 q25.3 has been predicted to be a hotspot for rearrangements based on its genomic architecture predisposing Cytogenetics137 to non allelic homologous recombination. The region deleted in our  patients encompasses 9 protein coding genes, of which at least 3 are good candidates for the phenotypes observed. The ZNF592 gene product plays a role in the regulation of genes involved in brain development, the PDE8A gene is involved in learning and memory,  and the NMB gene is associated with body weight regulation and obesity. The data currently available on the 15q25.2 q25.3 deletions suggest that they may represent another aberration from the growing list of genetic defects predisposing to neuropsychiatric phenotypes.

Recently, it was proposed that arrayCGH should become first choice when unexplained developmental delay or congenital anomalies are involved. Therefore, arrayCGH analysis of children with idiopathic mental retardation and/or dysmorphic features was performed to evaluate the importance of this diagnostic test in our laboratory. A series of karyotypically normal patients without subtelomeric abnormalities were included. In total, copy number variations (CNVs) in almost 45,5% of analysed patients were detected. CNVs with potential clinical significance were found in 18% of patients. Among them, 11% had aberration in regions with known microdeletion syndromes. In all cases, aberrations were causative for patients condition, therefore,  they were determined to be pathogenic. Additionally, 7% of CNVs were characterized as probably pathogenic, based on their size and position. One male patient showed ~1,1 Mb duplication in region Xq21.32, and one female patient had ~2,3 Mb duplication in 8q23.1. Two additional patients had smaller deletions in 11q22.3 and 20q13.33 respectively. In 5,5% of patients, CNVs were identified as probably benign, based on their inheritance pattern. In the rest of the patients, aberrations were marked as variants of uncertain clinical significance. Further investigations should be carried out in these cases.To conclude, diagnostic yield in our study was considerably higher (18%) than estimated average (~11%), due to the selected choice of patient. Nevertheless, we stress the importance of this test and emphasize the need of much bigger studies in Slovenian population.",2011

So,  impairment of a single gene but also combined deleterious effects of several genes were assumed to be causative.Here, we investigated 39 children with various patterns of epileptic seizures, mental retardation, and minor dysmorphisms and their healthy parents with the Illumina Â® Infinium Human1M DuoV3 array to  find de novo microrearrangements carrying epilepsy related genes.  In four patients without any malformations or major dysmorphisms  we found most likely causative de novo CNVs, i.e. deletions in 1q41q42.12 (3.3Mb), 19p13.2 (832kb), and Xq24 (165kb), and a  two part duplication in 17p13.2 (263kb) and 17p13.1 (464kb).

A first report of an unstably transmitted familial complex chromosome rearrangement,P03.034,"E. van Binsbergen, R. Hochstenbach, J. Giltay, M. Swinkels","University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","Complex chromosome rearrangements (CCRs) are rare structural  aberrations involving three or more breakpoints on two or more chromosomes. CCRs are classified as type I when they contain four or fewer breakpoints, or type II, when they contain more than four breakpoints. About one third of all CCRs are familial. Transmittance  of such a CCR results either in non disjunction at meiosis or is stably passed on to the next generation. Here we present a case of a phenotypically normal mother with a type II CCR involving chromosomes 1, 3 and 5 that gave birth to a phenotypically abnormal son. The boy presented with hypotonia and mild facial dysmorphisms. At the age of three he was severely mentally retarded, hypotonic and there were feeding disorders. Conventional karyotyping revealed the same CCR as previously was found in the mother. However, by  use of array CGH and FISH we discovered that during transmission of the CCR, a de novo deletion and duplication were evoked on two of the breakpoints by a mechanism of inversion/duplication on one of the derivative chromosomes. This is the first presented case of this mechanism in a structurally abnormal chromosome. Furthermore with this case we demonstrate the importance of breakpoint analysis in CCRs and stress that genetic counseling of a familial CCR is not straightforward.",2011

The role of CIN in this neurodegenerative disorder is incompletely understood. Molecular cytogenetic analysis allowed us identification of a dramatic increase in aneuploidy in the AT brain  (Iourov er al., 2009). Additionally, degenerating cerebellum exhibited non random breaks of interphase chromosomes and dramatically increased chromosome 7 , 14  and X specific aneuploidy. CIN more severely affects the cerebellum than the cerebrum. Paradoxically, AT patientsâ longevity has positively correlated with CIN rates in the cerebellum. To solve this paradox we propose two alternative hypotheses: (1) overproduction of immature neural cells with unrealized chromosome breaks and aneuploidy takes place exclusively during early brain development, and chromosomally aberrant cells  might be resistant to apoptotic clearance throughout ontogeny and, therefore, survive; (2) an age dependent increase of the percentage of chromosomally defective cells could be explained by abnormal adult neurogenesis in the degenerating cerebellum during brain aging. Therefore, we have to admit that adult neurogenesis can occur in the diseased AT cerebellum. We suggest the longer the lifetime of AT individuals the bigger amount of immature neuron like cells is accumulated in the degenerating cerebellum.  The persistence and  age dependent accumulation of neural cells with chromosome breaks during ontogeny (even immature and chromosomally abnormal) could protect the diseased cerebellum against dramatic cell loss and, therefore, partially prevents the progression of neurodegeneration with possible neuroprotective effect. Finally, CIN represents an important  genetic phenomenon mediating variety of cellular processes leading to neurodegeneration in brain.",2011

The etiology of MD is presently unknown, but epidemiological studies of families, twins and adoptions have consistently supported a genetic base. Some studies have supported the presence of autosomal dominant major loci. In  this study, we aimed at detect the relationships between chromosomal aberrations (CAs) and immunological markers and MD. We used the cell cultivation and conventional G banding. Random and non random imbalances CAs were found in %51, %25 and %7 11 of cells. We found numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 8, 15, 21, 22, X and Y. However, structural aberrations consisted of duplications, deletions and translocations, with a focus on: loci on del(1)(q12 q23), del(1)(q21.1 q24), del(1)(q21.1 q23), del(10)(p11.2 pter), der(2)t(2;4)(p25;p12), t(2;22)(p14;p13), t(19;Y)? and dup(10)(q26). The  susceptibility genes of MD may be located on these loci.

The percentage of CD2+, CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes of the father were significantly higher, whereas CD4+ lymphocytes were decreased in the mather. The percentage of CD4 level of the son were decreased, whereas CD8+ lymphocytes were higher. These results may suggest that and MD have a significant impact on both genetic and immunological parameters, and continuing anti inflammatory state in the family and this process may explain the cause of MD.",2011

BPES is a rare eye genetic disorder which either occurs sporadically  or familial. BPES is a genetic disorder which generally displays an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. The purpose of this study is to identify chromosomal abnormalities in patients with congenital BPES. It has been shown that penetrance is 100% in type I when  the transmission is by males only and 96.5% in type II in which transmission occurs through both sexes. In this study 20 sporadic and 3 familial cases of congenital BPES were enrolled for cytogenetic analysis. In all familial cases pedigree showed autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. Disease information and all medical records were reviewed. Peripheral blood was collected and lymphocyte cultures were set up for chromosomal analysis. 20 metaphases were analyzed using GTG banding. Review of reported cases concluded that locus for eyelid development is situated at the interface of long  arm of chromosome 3. Various reports linked the deletions (3q21, 3q22, 3q23, 3q24, 3q25) and translocations [t(3:7)(q26 qter:q+), t(X:3)(p22:q21), t(3:8)(q23:p22.1)] to the BPES. Thus cytogenetically different deletions and translocations of chromosome 3 have been described in patients with BPES. Deletions of 3q24 25 and 3q26.3 regions were found in two familial cases. We also found 3q ter, 3q24 25 and 3q26 qter region deletions in three sporadic cases. 3qter region deletion found in 2 cases has been already been linked to the BPES. Theses finding may represent a severe manifestation of the disease. BPES is a heterogeneous entity, and evaluation and counseling of affected individuals should be undertaken with caution.",2011

So, the size of the duplication as a whole is about 31,7 Mb. Breakpoint spanning  long range PCR revealed a PCR product of approximately 18 kb. Sequencing of this product is in progress and should identify the duplication breakpoints on the base pair level.The distal breakpoint of the inversion which is about 25 Mb in size was narrowed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with the breakpoint spanning probe RP11 111J7 (BlueGnome Â®, Cambridge,  UK) between 117.631.652 bp and 117.790.729 bp. Fine mapping of  the proximal breakpoint of the inversion by FISH is in progress.In conclusion, combination of FISH and high resolution CGH  or SNP arrays allows narrowing the breakpoints in complex chromosome  rearrangements more easily than previously applied techniques. This could be important for a better genotype phenotype correlation.Cytogenetics140",2011

Telomere length has been observed to be inversely associated with increased oxidative stress  and inflammation. Since chronic oxidative stress plays a major role in COPD, telomere length is hypothesized to reduce at a faster rate in COPD. The first aim of this study was to investigate telomere length in COPD patients in relation to oxidative stress and inflammation. The second aim of this study was to investigate the effects of caffeine, coffee, tea and alcohol intake on telomere length in COPD patients and healthy controls. m ethods: We measured telomere length in PBMCâs of 89 COPD  patients and compared these with 93 healthy, (ex )smoking controls.  In addition, the cytokines IL 8, IL 6 and TNF Î± were determined, as well as CRP, SOD and plasma homocysteine.Results and conclusions:  We found that telomere length was shorter  in COPD patients compared to controls. Cytokine plasma levels as well as CRP and homocysteine plamsa levels were inreased in COPD patients and SOD activity was decreased, indicating elevated oxidative stress in COPD patients. In addition, this study provides a first indication of the possible beneficial effects of coffee consumption and negative effects of alcohol consumption on telomere length. Future studies should focus on interventions with dietary antioxidants or anti inflammatory compounds, such as those found in coffee, and their possible beneficial health effects in patients with chronic inflammatory diseases.",2011

This type of aneuploidies is caused by the incorrect distribution of homologous chromosomes during meiosis. PATIENTS AND METHODS: In 149 from 600 pregnancies between 2007 2009 was requested molecular testing for early aneuploidy screening. 6 postnatal and 6 prenatal cytogenetic studies were carried out in individuals of three generations belonging to a family carrying a heterologous translocation. The DNA obtained from 3 related prenatal and 2 postnatal samples were amplified for 7 hypervariable genetic markers in chromosome 21 using QF PCR techniques.RESULTS: We identified one family carrying the t(14;21) translocation with 5 affected by DS, 9 non affected carriers and 5 abortions. The  definition of associated markers to translocated chromosome 21 in an affected individual, revealed identical genetic makeup except for the more distally located. The third chromosome 21 (paternal) differed in all markers with the two previous.The pedigree identified a set of individuals at possible risk of fathering children with DS.CONCLUSIONS: The origin of trisomy 21 was maternal, but double recombination in meiosis I generated an exchange of genetic material translocated, except the most telomeric region, before the incorrect distribution of homologous chromosomes 21 in meiosis II.Our results identified an unusual mechanism of double recombination of the extra chromosome and expose the diversity of causal etiology.Cytogenetics142",2011

Several brain malformations as PMG have been described in association with VCF. These anomalies seem to result from abnormal cortical organisation caused by ischemia occurring during a critical period of cortical development. The TBX1 gene on 22q11.2 encodes T box1  protein, necessary for the normal development of large arteries, could be a good candidate for DDMS.

The most frequent indication performed FISH analysis was the ultrasonographic (US) findings of fetal anomalies (54.6%). Aneuploidy was identified in 6 out of 175 uncultured amniotic fluid samples by FISH. Three cases of trisomy 18 and three cases of trisomy 21 were detected. 4 out of 6 cases with aneuploidy were with structural abnormalities at US. Conventional cytogenetic results revealed 4 chromosomal abnormalities not detectable by FISH such as 47,XXY, 45,X/46,XX mosaicism, balanced reciprocal translocation, and marker chromosome. These results suggest that FISH in uncultured amniotic fluid samples indicated the abnormal US findings in fetus is a reliable method for the rapid prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 18 and trisomy 21. FISH analysis should generally be used as an adjunct to the conventional cytogenetic analysis and not be used alone. Genetic counseling for prenatal diagnosis is important for patientâs  understanding about the limitations of FISH for detection of aneuploidy in uncultured amniotic fluid cells.",2011

Chromosomes with areas of constitutive heterochromatin (chromosomes 1, 9, 16 and Y) are commonly involved. However, several authors have studied the possible association of heterochromatin variants with selected  clinical diagnoses, especially with reproduction failure (sterility and/or repeated abortions).We have compared the incidence of heterochromatin variants in the group of patients with reproduction failure to the incidence in the control group. The study group was composed of 761 patients (93 individuals and 334 couples) with reproduction failure diagnosis karyotyped between 2007 and 2009 in our cytogenetic laboratory. The control group was composed of 885 fetuses who were karyotyped only because of the advanced age (35 years or more) of their mothers  between 2003 and 2009 in our laboratory; cases with unequivocally pathologic findings were not included.Heterochromatin variants have been found in 106 patients (13.9%) in the study group and only in 74 individuals (8.7%) among controls. The difference was statistically significant (p < 0.001). The most common variants were those of chromosome 9 (including pericentric inversions); they were detected in 51 (6.7%) patients with reproduction failure but only in 32 (3.7%) fetuses. This difference was statically significant (p < 0.01), too. There was no significant difference in the incidence of heterochromatin variants in men and women karyotyped for reproduction failure.Our results in Czech population correspond to findings of other authors.

AcH3K9 rich regions (the brightest AcH3K9 fluorescence)  corresponded to 32 R bands. Medium to weak fluorescent AcH3K9 signals were detected in 86 R bands. All G bands demonstrated weak AcH3K9 fluorescence. AcH3K9 was absent in heterochromatic blocks of chromosomes 1, 9, 16, Y.This H3K9 acetylation profile was compared to the relevant DNA methylation patterns after 5 methylcytosine antibodies staining. Non acetylated heterochromatic regions were hypermethylated. Among R bands with medium to weak acetylation 6 demonstrated weak, 48   medium and 32   high DNA methylation level. 32 AcH3K9 rich R bands  showed variable DNA methylation levels: 17   high, 12   medium and 3 (1p13, 2q31, 2q33)   low. Low level of DNA methylation in highly acetylated bands favors their specific function in lymphocytes.Both H3K9 acetylation and DNA methylation were also studied in lymphocyte chromosomes from fetal cord blood. Two highly methylated regions 2q31 and 2q33 and one hypoacetylated one   2q31   distinguished fetal chromosomes from their counterparts in adult.The co location of acetylated and methylated chromosome patterns suggests feasible distribution of active and inactivated chromatin regions which looks to be band and stage specific.Supported by RFBR and S.C.02.740.11.0698.",2011

One is a metacentric or submetacentric and heterochromatic chromosome, not containing the Prader Willi Syndrome/ Angelman Syndrome Critical Region  (PWS/ASCR) [dic(15)(q11).dic(15)(q11)], can be familial or de novo  and most children show a normal phenotype. The second type has 15q euchromatin including PWS/ASCR [dic(15)(q12 or q13)], that frequently derives from the two homologous maternal chromosomes at meiosis. This condition is associated with an abnormal phenotype, which constitutes the idic(15) syndrome, and is nearly always sporadic.The inv dup (15) displays distinctive clinical findings represented by early central hypotonia and intellectual disability, epilepsy and autistic behaviour. Expressive language is absent or very poor and  often echolalic. Epilepsy with a wide variety of seizures, as a typical Lennox Gastaut Syndrome (LGS), can occur in these individuals. Areas of increased and reduced skin pigmentation can be occasionally observed.We report on a 6 years old girl, patient of Neuropediatrics, with language delay, LGS and hypopigmented streaks on the trunk.

The phenotype of our patient deserves consideration, since an eyelid malformation has been also reported in the three patients with similar microdeletions retrieved from literature. More than 50 genes are included in the deleted interval and one can speculate on the involvement of one of them in eyelid  differentiation. Our report confirms that developmental delay and malformed eyelids is suggestive of a 2q31 microdeletion syndrome, in addition to the well known 3q23 BPES microdeletion syndrome.",2011

Originally balanced chromosome insertions, after meiotic segregation, can cause unbalanced structural rearrangements with deletions or duplications of the translocated segment, which explains the high risk (50%) of producing an abnormal  offspring. Here, we report an interchromosomal insertion in three generations of a family. The proband presented neurological disorders, mitral stenosis, velopharyngeal insufficiency and facial dysmorphisms.

The cytogenetic analysis of other family members identified six individuals carrying an apparently balanced rearrangement and two other members carrying the same unbalanced rearrangement [der(9)ins(9;15)(q33;q21.1 q22.31)].  Despite the clinical heterogeneity these individuals present some similar characteristics such as RDNPM, short stature and dysmorphic features. The high resolution array analyses (Genome Wide Human Array 6.0,AffymetrixÂ®) of three individuals with unbalanced karyotype revealed a duplication of 19.3Mb on chromosome 15 ranging from q21.1 to q22.31 [44275184 63567267   hg18].

These changes are usually cryptic chromosomal aberrations   microdeletions or microduplications. The OMIM database currently contains more than 100 microdeletion/duplication syndromes  of various types but due to the extensive phenotypic variation and overlapping phenotypes the correct diagnosis is often difficult to be determined.We have analysed 64 probands with normal karyotype and specific clinical findings such as mental retardation or developmental delay combined with neonatal hypotonia, congenital anomalies or facial dysmorphism. We used the MLPA method to scan for cryptic rearrangements. Each proband was analysed by the P245 kit to detect 21 most common microdeletion syndromes. Additional microdeletion  syndromes were analysed using the P297kit. Moreover, subtelomeric regions were analysed with the P036kit. Overall 10 positives (16%) were detected, 3 duplications and 7 deletions, respectively. The MLPA kit P245 was able to detect 9 of all found rearrangements. One abnormality was detected only by the MLPA kit P036.We have used the FISH method with locus specific probes to confirm the findings and to compare the efficiency of both methods in cases of MLPA positive probands. Surprisingly, we have found the discrepancy in 2 cases. The deletion of 10p14 15 and 1p36 was detected by MLPA and not confirmed by FISH.Although the application of FISH method is the matter of choice for the diagnostics of microdeletions, the MLPA method appears as more sensitive and more effective.

Among  different factors underlying abnormal chromosome segregation the epimutations of cell cycle genes is of particular interest. Epigenetic reprogramming during early ontogeny may predispose to methylation abnormalities. We aimed to determine the mechanisms and stages  of cytogenetic and epigenetic errors origin and suggest a model for identification of epimutations impact on mosaicism formation. Extraembryonic tissues of 69 diploid aneuploid miscarriages, 20 diploid miscarriages and 22 induced abortions of similar gestational age were examined for epimutations of cell cycle control genes RB1 and P14ARF which were hypermethylated in 42% and 10% of  mosaic embryos, respectively. Cytotrophoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm appears a convenient model to determine ontogenetic stages of aneuploidy and epimutations origin because they are derived  from different germ layers, isolate after implantation and differ in DNA methylation. Diploid aneuploid mosaicism originates postzygotically due to trisomy rescue or de novo mitotic error. If mitotic errors occur before germ layers divergence then both tissues will be mosaic. Mosaicism will be confined by one tissue if mitotic mutation occurs after divergence. Epimutations may originate from demethylation and de novo methylation errors during epigenetic reprogramming. Analysis of all possible combinations of cytogenetic and epigenetic abnormalities underlies our model. Interpretation of the methylation role in the origin of mosaicism using the model allowed concluding that RB1 and P14ARF epimutations are primary to diploid aneuploid mosaicism in Cytogenetics146 at least 4,7% of mosaic embryos.

Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) is a variant of  polymerase chain reaction that permits multiple targets to be amplified using a single primerpair. It is a robust, facile, flexible and inexpensive technique that can detect both deletions and duplications for more than 40 loci in one assay. Clinical applications of this modern method  are extending quickly.Due to the advantages mentioned above, we have introduced subtelomeric MLPA as a screening method (before more complex and expensive molecular methods) for patients with complex/ unidentified chromosomal rearrangements. Itsâ application will be illustrated for 6 cases with mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies. The karyotype of the patients (G banding) was abnormal, each one presenting an additional terminal chromosomal fragment (involving chromosome 4,9,15, 8). ). Using MLPA we identified in 5 cases terminal  duplications and in one case a known polymorphism (chromosome 15). Array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was used in 3 cases to validate our MLPA results. All the abnormalities identified with subtelomeric MLPA have been confirmed, but in one case an extra defecthas been identified.

The mechanism of ring chromosome formation is usually associated with loss of genetic material.We report 2 cases of mosaic ring chromosome 13. For the first patient, a male with a karyotype: 46, XY,r(13)[40]/45,XY,  13 [10]. He presented  a delayed psychomotor development, mental retardation, dysmorphic features and bleeding disorders. The second is a case of prenatal diagnosis; completed with the postmortem autopsy of a foetus of 33 week of gestations. The genetic amniocentesis analysis showed a mosaic karyotype : 46, XY, r (13) [8]/45,XY, 13[5] ; which was different of that of the cordocentesis analysis: 46,XY, r(13)(q32q34)[18]/46,XY,dic r(13) (q32q34)[2]. Sonography showed intrauterine growth retardation, holoprosencephaly that have been confirmed by the autopsy report; which revealed additional anomalies such as the partial agenesis of  the pancreas. The chromosomal terminal regions exploration by MLPA and FISH techniques revealed a 13qter deletion, for both cases. For the first patient, the array CGH (Affymetrix Cytogenetics Whole Genome 2,7 M Array) identified two terminal deletions of the ring chromosome 13, one of 350 kb and another of 3740 kb in the 13q34 region.We reported 2 cases of mosaic ring chromosomal 13 associated with deletion of the terminal region of the chromosome 13.

Cytogenetic analysis of the bone marrow is indicated in MDS not only  for diagnostic purposes, but also to assess individual prognosis and to plan tailored therapy. Conventional cytogenetic (CC) analysis is performed in clinical practice to detect chromosomal abnormalities. A new method has recently been described for the measurement of  the gene/chromosome copy number using genomic DNA: Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). The purpose of this study was to compare the results of the MLPA assay with the CC data obtained in a series of 38 MDS patients (M: 28, F:10, median age 70 years, range 44 87). Our study showed a good correlation between the MLPA and CC results (Table I), discrepancies were found in 7 samples (18.5%). MLPA analysis did not detect the presence of a chromosomal (chr.) translocation (sample nÂ°4); a chr. deletion and a chr. translocation (sample nÂ°11); a chr. deletion (sample nÂ°15); several  chr. translocations and deletions (sample nÂ°20); a chr. gain (sample nÂ°27). On the other hand, CC analysis did not show a small deletion in 2 samples: a deletion of the MLL gene in 11q23 (sample nÂ°23) and deletion of 7q22 (sample nÂ°37). With CC we also observed a karyotype failure (no metaphases) in 4 samples, while the MLPA assay showed 3 chr. deletions (sample nÂ°14), but no anomalies in the other 3 samples (25, 29, 32). MLPA and CC resulted complementary techniques, MLPA being particularly useful in MDS cases with karyotype failure and for identifying small rearrangements.Cytogenetics147 Table I sample m LPA Karyotype 1 No anomalies 46, XX 2 No anomalies 46, XY 3 No anomalies 46, XY 4 Del 5q 46, XY, Del 5q, t(1;12) 5 Del 7 45, XY, Del 7 6 No anomalies 46, XX 7 No anomalies 46, XY 8 No anomalies 46, XY 9 No anomalies 46, XY 10 Del 5q 46, XY, Del 5q 11Del 5q, Del  11q2345, XY, Del 11q23, Del 15, der 5 t(5;15) [16] / 46, XY [4] 12 No anomalies 46, XX 13 Trisomy 8 47, XY, Trisomy 8 14Del 7q, Del 12p, Del 20qNo metaphases 15 Del 11q2346, XX, Del 11q23 [5] / 46, XX, Del 9q22 23, Del 11q23 [15] 16 No anomalies 46, XY 17 No anomalies 46, XY 18 No anomalies 46, XY 19 No anomalies 46, XY 20Del5q, Del  12p, Del17p42~47, XX, Del 1p34 [3], Del 3 [6],  t(4;18) [10], Del 5q [18], der 9 [3], Del 12 [10], t(13q;17q) [3], der 15 [4], Del 20 [3],  Del 21 [2], Trisomy 22 [3], +m [10] [cp18] / 46, XX [2] 21Del 20q, Trisomy 21q, Trisomy 19p, Trisomy 848, XY, Trisomy 19, Del 20q, Trisomy 21[12] / 48, XY, Trisomy 8, Trisomy 19, Del 20q[8] 22 No anomalies 46, XY 23Trisomy 11q23 (MLL gene)46, XX 24 No anomalies 46, XX 25 No anomalies No metaphases 26 No anomalies 46, XX 27 No anomalies 46, XY,add(11)(p15)[10] / 46, XY[10] 28 No anomalies 46,XY 29 No anomalies No metaphases 30 Del5q22 33 46, XY, Del5q15 33[8] / 46, XY[7] 31 No anomalies 46, XY 32 No anomalies No metaphases 33 Trisomia 11 47, XY, Trisomy 11 34 No anomalies 46, XY 35 No anomalies 46, XY 36 No anomalies 46, XY 37 Del 7q22 46, XY 38 No anomalies 46, XY",2011

Many studies have shown that nicotine interferes with oocyte meiosis and chromosome disjunction. In this regard, in this study we tried to understand the frequency of embryonal chromosome aberrations  (CAs) in pregnancies of active or passive smoking mothers. In order to do so, we examined the effect of nicotine sulphate on amniocytes by designing an experimental setting consisting amniocytes grown in nicotine containing medium, study group, and amniocytes grown in a medium which did not contain nicotine (nicotine sulphate), in control group. Here, we provide the evidence that nicotine exposure in vitro (25 ng/ml) (in fetal serum, range 0.5 25ng/ml), has detrimental effects on fetal cells. According our findings, there is a significant difference in terms of CAs between nicotine containing medium and control medium, determined by the Ï2 test (P < 0.001). Nicotine containing medium  grown cells, totally 577 cells, revealed mainly numerical aberrations (112 cells, %90.3 of all aberrations). Numerical aberrations observed, usually consisted of polyploidy and aneuploidies. We found, most frequently, numerical abnormalities of chromosomes 21, 22, 8, 15 and 20. In conclusion, results of this study confirm an association between prenatal exposure to cigarette smoke and in utero aneuploidies. The  nicotine leads to significant direct genotoxic effects in human fetal cells  in vitro. Further studies are needed to clarify the modulation of the genotoxicity of smoke causing various genetic polymorphisms.",2011
Detection of copy number variants in patients with Noonan syndrome or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome,P03.072,"E. Seo1, J. Lee2, B. Lee1, I. Park1, H.

Diagnosis is based mainly on clinical grounds characterized by a distinctive craniofacial appearance, heart defects, musculoskeletal  and cutaneous abnormalities, and mental retardation. Although molecular genetic testing is available for all known genes, PTPN11, KRAS, SOS1 and RAF1 in NS, and BRAF, MAP2K1, MAP2K2 and KRAS in CFC, overall mutation detection rates are 60% to 70% in both syndromes. To detect pathogenic copy number variants (CNV) for NS and CFC patients who did not have any mutations in sequence analyses of all causative genes, we performed high resolution CGH based microarray in 13 NS and 5 CFC patients. Three CFC patients were found to have probably pathogenic CNVs; 3.7 Mb loss in 12q12q13.11,  1.3 Mb gain in 22q11.23, and simultaneous 2 Mb loss in 1p36.33 and 13.0 Mb gain in 17q24.3q25.3. This 22q11.23 duplication has been reported as a recurrent microduplication syndrome. Five CNV regions of unknown clinical significance were observed in 4 NS patients, including gains of GOLGA4, NDUFA4, THSD7A, TPD52L1, EIF3H and FBXO7. In present study, pathogenic CNVs are significantly frequent in CFC than NS patients. This result suggests that patients with CFC like features can be likely to have large CNVs and need a chromosomal microarray test. And also gene copy changes of unknown significance should be evaluated to validate the clinical relevance.",2011

If a genetic imbalance is observed and confirmed by karyotyping and/or FISH, parents are usually analysed with FISH using probes localized in the unbalanced regions to exclude a balanced rearrangement. This  is needed to assess the risk for further children with an unbalanced chromosome complement and to provide prenatal diagnostic options.We present a 20 year old male patient with severe developmental delay and autism. Array CGH analysis revealed a terminal gain of 1.07 Mb of 18p11.32 and a terminal loss of 16.8 Mb of 18q21.33q23. The terminal deletion 18q, also known as DeGrouchy syndrome, explained the phenotype in our patient. At this point, parental chromosome studies were offered but denied. Recently, we received amniotic fluid of the sister in law of our proband, because of ultrasound abnormalities. Cytogenetics148 Chromosome analysis showed an abnormal chromosome 18,  suggesting an unbalanced 18;18 translocation with extra 18q material on terminal 18p. After karyotyping, the prospective father and paternal grandfather proved to be carriers of an inv(18)(p11.32q21.33). Consequently, the fetus and the proband exhibited each a different  recombinant chromosome 18. The paternal pericentric inversion would remain unrecognized when FISH with probes from the abnormal regions was performed.In conclusion, the concomitant gain and loss of the terminal long and short arm of the same chromosome at array diagnostics should alert to a recombinant pericentric inversion. Further karyotyping studies in proband and parents are highly recommended, if necessary combined with metaphase FISH.",2011

Thirty eight Lithuanian patients with various clinical features were selected for subtelomeric FISH analysis. Results: For detection of subtelomeric deletions/duplications 33 unrelated patients with ID/developmental delay (DD), dysmorphic  features and/or multiple congenital anomalies were analysed using subtelomeric FISH.

Nowadays, using MLPA, FISH and array CGH (aCGH), this task is much easier. We present 4 families with different unique microdeletions. The proband from Family A suffered from developmental delay, obesity and suspected haemophilia B. Molecular  genetic testing revealed a deletion of all exons of the F9 gene. The Cytogenetics149 phenotype of the boy suggested a larger deletion, and aCGH indeed  showed that the deletion affected 5 additional protein coding genes. A boy from Family B was tested because of familial malignant histiocytosis. A deletion affecting all SH2D1A  exons was identified  using PCR, and aCGH revealed that the deletion also included a part  of the ODZ1 gene. Family C had a history of non syndromic aniridia. MLPA confirmed a PAX6 gene deletion in the proband, and aCGH  indicated that the deletion also encompassed 3 additional genes. A boy from Family D died of Norrie disease in infancy. PCR identified a deletion of the whole NDP gene, and aCGH showed that the deletion included also the MAOA and MAOB genes. The aCGH results allowed us to select locus specific FISH probes and to test a total of 14 patients from these 4 families. Eight of them were females at risk in reproductive age, and 3 were shown to be carriers of the microdeletions.

Ring chromosomes are uncommon cytogenetic findings. Most patients  carrying a ring chromosome are phenotypically abnormal due to deletions at one or both arms of the chromosome.Patients with a ring chromosome 11 usually have growth retardation and developmental delay to some degree, while only some of them  have clear facial dysmorphic features. CafÃ© au lait spots have been described in almost half of the patients.We present five new patients carrying a ring chromosome 11, with three of the patients belonging to the same family. All patients do have growth problems and cafÃ© au lait spots. Four of them have microcephaly, while one has a head circumference just within normal limits. Developmental problems are severe in one patient, but do not exist in two other patients.In four patients a terminal deletion of the short arm of chromosome  11 was demonstrated. In one of them an additional terminal deletion of chromosome 11q was detected, which does not contain any coding genes. The terminal 11p deletion in the familial ring chromosome contains six more genes than in the other patient. For the extra deleted genes no relationship has been reported with growth retardation or microcephaly. In contrast to the other patients, the fifth patient showed a considerable terminal deletion of 14 Mb on 11q, which fits with a diagnosis of Jacobsen syndrome.The differences in clinical characteristics are most likely due to the differences in size of the deletions these patients have, and the genes involved in these deletions.",2011

Severity is variable, often with asymmetric expression, and penetrance may be reduced. It is either isolated or it may be part of a wider, syndromic condition. The aetiology of isolated SHFM is complex and remains to  be fully elucidated; it has so far been mapped to five loci: 7q21, Xq26, 10q24, 3q27 and 2q31; however, the critical genes for all except one of these loci have not been identified.SHFM3 has been mapped to 10q24 and previous studies have shown it to be associated with a duplication of a minimum region of ~325kb, thereby implicating several candidate genes including FBX4, LBX1, and BTRC. FISH and expression studies have previously narrowed the minimal region of involvement to two genes, BTRC and POLL, and have also demonstrated up regulation of BTRC. We present 4 new cases with overlapping, different sized duplications of 10q24, detected by array CGH: two cases with SHFM had duplication of FBX4, LBX1, BTRC and POLL, one case without SHFM had duplication of BTRC, POLL and FBX4, and a further case without SHFM had duplication of BTRC and POLL only.

Both twins are heterozygous carriers of sickle cell disease mutation. Genotyping of blood DNA from both twins using Illumina Human 610 SNP array revealed a copy number imbalance for chromosome X in a proportion of cells in one twin. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis confirmed monosomy X (45,X) in 7% of proband nucleated blood cells. Unexpectedly, FISH analysis of cells from the other twin revealed 45,X and 46,XY lineages, both present in 1% of cells. The Cytogenetics150 mechanism behind formation of these aneuploidies suggests several  aberrant chromosome segregation events in meiosis and mitoses following conception. Our report contributes to the delineation of the frequency of somatic structural genomic variation in normal MZ twins. These results also illustrate the plasticity of the human genome for  tolerating large copy number changes in healthy subjects and show the sensitivity of the Illumina platform for detection of aberrations that are present in a minority of the studied cells.",2011

Multipotency and proliferative capacity of human embryonic stem  cells (hESCs) make them a promising source for basic and applied research as well as in therapeutic medicine. The introduction of human induced pluripotent cells (hiPSCs) holds great promise for patient tailored regenerative medicine therapies. However, in order to use  hESCs and hiPSCs for therapeutic purposes, they must maintain long term genomic stability in culture.Until recently, G banding was considered to be the gold standard for chromosomal abnormalitiesâ detection in stem cells. Our goal in this study was to apply high resolution techniques (FISH and CGH), that will enable us to examine stem cells genome with an ever finer resolution.Analysis of three hESC lines and two hiPSC lines over long term culture revealed a recurrent genomic instability, involving the gain of  chromosome 1q. This finding was detected in two unrelated cell lines of different origin and implies that gains of chromosome 1q may endow a clonal advantage in culture.In addition, aneuploidy rate was evaluated at different passages, using FISH probes (12,13,16,17,18,21,X,Y). Genomic integrity was shown to be maintained at early passages of hESCs and hiPSCs. However, at late passages, we observed higher rates of aneuploidy in hESCs, implying a direct correlation between number of passages and increased aneuploidy rate.These findings, which couldnât be detected by conventional cytogentic, emphasize the importance of using molecular cytogenetic methods for tracking genomic instability in stem cells. It also demonstrates the phenomenon of genomic instability of hESC lines, which bear a  resemblance to tumorogenic processes.",2011

Genotype/phenotype studies have not been able, to date, to show any correlation between type and size of clinically relevant SMC(15)s and the degree of severity of the clinical spectrum.We report 6 new cases of patients with a SMC(15) that were characterized by molecular cytogenetics (Multicolour FISH) and array CGH techniques, followed by microdissection, for the evaluation of the exact genetic content, correlating clinical features with SMC(15) sizes. One case is a small SMC(15)s and without clinical features and/or  development delay. The other 5 cases are large SMC(15)s with the Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome critical region, all having clinical features associated. Of these large SMC(15)s described, two cases are from group B, having symmetrical pattern corresponding to BP3 (BP3:BP3). The other 3 cases have large SMC(15)s from group A, showing an asymmetrical pattern with distal margins at the known breakpoint BP4.A full characterization of SMC(15) by array CGH techniques is essential to establish with more precision breakpoints position and size of duplicated segments.

Telomeres are non coding regions of DNA that maintain genomic  stability. Telomere length decreases with cell divisions despite telomerase which consists of two subunits: TERT (the catalytic unit) and TERC (the RNA component). This process is related directly with cellular and individual aging. The aim of this study was to analyze  differences between telomere length in people with Down Syndrome (DS), people with cerebral palsy (CP) and people without intellectual disability. We collected saliva samples from 122 subjects with DS (with a mean age of 34,61) 59 with CP (mean age: 30,85) and 115 without intellectual disability (mean age: 47,65). Genomic DNA was extracted from buccal cells and telomere length was measured by qPCR relative comparative. In addition, we analyzed two polymorphisms associated with lower activity of telomerase: TERT 1327C>T (rs:2735940) and TERC 63G>A (rs:2293607). The relative telomere length and the  polymorphisms analysis are shown in table. The analysis of the telomere length in subjects over and under 40 years old, shows significant results in DS and CP (p,0,021 and p,0,050 respectively) but not in controls (p,0,202). telomere lengthtERt  ( 1327c>t)tERc  ( 63G>A) Probands Vs  c ontrols P<0,001 P,0,152 P,0,055 D s  Vs  c ontrols P<0,001 P,0,316 P,0,102 c P Vs  c ontrols P<0,001 P,0,145 P,0,181 D s  Vs  c P P,0,952 P,0,711 P,0,898 Our data demonstrate premature biological aging in people with DS  and show, for the first time, that people with CP has chromosomal telomeres smaller than people without intellectual disability.

Tetrasomy 18p is a very rare chromosomal disorder and is the result of a spontaneous mutation early in embrionic development in most of the cases. It has a prevalence of 1/140000 live births and affects both genders equally.In this paper we reported a de novo tetrasomy 18p in a 3 months old  female dysmorphic child. The clinical features were distinctive, with a particular facies, strabismus, neonatal hypotonia and microcephaly. A small metacentric marker chromosome has been identified after standard cytogenetic analysis, without recognized parental origin of the supplementary genetic material. The childâs parents were also tested and their karyotype results were normal.The characterization of the marker chromosome using only conventional cytogenetic methods was difficult. Consequently, the marker was evaluated by molecular cytogenetic techniques. Fluorescence in Situ  Hybridization (FISH) analysis was the first step of diagnosis. Two types of DNA FISH probes were used in our study to describe the structure of the marker: a probe for the centromeric region of chromosome 18 and probes for the subtelomeric regions of chromosome 18. A more detailed description of the identified isochromosome 18p was performed using MLPA technique.Our patient was compared with other published cases with tetrasomy 18p.",2011

Finland is acknowledged of its high standard of clinical medicine  and in the disease gene hunt of its founder populations. What is perhaps not so well recognized is that Finland has probably the most comprehensive health registers and records: hospitalizations, surgeries, chronic diseases, cancers and prescriptions etc. have been  filed for decades.Relying on this infrastructure we have gathered clinical information from all distinct hospitals and laboratories on all reciprocal balanced translocations and inversions identified in Finland, and are currently constructing a national database (www.fintransloc.org). By analyses of the medical records and by searches of additional national registers, we are obtaining novel information of not only monogenic traits with unidentified mutations, but also of multifactorial traits associated with any given chromosomal abnormality. Moreover, we believe that such  a database will greatly assist genetic counseling efforts and scientific collaborations.To date, we have surveyed 2575 hospital or laboratory contacts involving translocations or inversions consisting of 572 families plus singletons. Some 25 families associating with interesting abnormal phenotypes are selected to investigate the breakpointsâ potential effect on the phenotypes.  A nationwide systematic sample collection  of DNA, RNA and cells with so far over 80% coverage of participants was launched in Aug 2010, and we are breakpoint mapping three pilot families providing presumed shortcut in the identification of their predisposing disease genes.Cytogenetics152",2011

For the son 1, karyotype followed by 105K Agilent aCGH study revealed partial trisomy of 11q (780Kb) associated with partial trisomy of 13q (28Mb). The son 2 carried a partial monosomy of 11q and partial trisomy of 13q.This is an unusual occurrence of paternally inherited unbalanced of (1) double partial trisomies (11q;13q) resulting from 3:1 segregation,  and (2) partial trisomy 13q and monosomy 11q from adjacent 2 segregation, both in paternal meiosis. Indeed these two modes of malsegregation, rather described in female meiosis, are uncommon in male meiosis and implicate the acrocentric 13 chromosome. Differences in severity of clinical features of both sons are observed. The son 2 developed a more serious phenotype resulting particularly from the monosomy 11qter described associated with Jacobsen syndrome. Clinical features of the son 1 will be discussed in relation with the types of anomalies, the genes localized in the duplications or at their breakpoints with genotype/phenotype correlation and will be compared with previous reports.

Molecular cytogenetic analysis of chromosome 7 breakpoints using DNA probes for WBS critical region 7q11.23, specific centromeric 7alpha satellit probe and set of BAC probes RP4 771P4, RP11  467H10, RP11 343J14 revealed the inv(7)(p10q11.23) in mother and in her child. FISH showed that one breakpoint of inversion is localised within the centromere 7p10 dividing it into two alphoid segments and making abnormal chromosome 7 as pseudodicentric. The second breakpoint was mapped in segment 7q11.23 more distal regarding to centromere of WBS single copy region and distal to the low copy repeats (LCR) sequences B mid, A mid, B tel, A tel and C tel blocks. ELN gene was not disrupted or deleted, therefore supravalvular aortic/peripheral pulmonary defects were absent in the mother and Cytogenetics154 child, though both of patients had distinctive WBS facial features.  We present the clinical data of cases and hypothesize that balanced intrachromosomal rearrangement induces position effect in WBS critical region neighbouring with centromeric sequences.",2011

He has neither cardiovascular malformations nor abdomino renal anomalies.Breakpoint mapping on chromosome 7 with FISH, using BACs clones showed that WBSCR17 gene (Williams Beuren syndrome critical region 17) was disrupted. However, breakpoint characterization on chromosome 5 was not achieved yet. For this we will perform a new  technology called array painting, which could map the position of translocation breakpoints more precisely either on chromosome 7 and 5 in a single experiment.Array CGH (Whole genome Tiling NimbleGen :Hg18,72K) confirmed that the translocation was balanced, and showed the absence of other unbalanced rearrangements which could explain the phenotype.These results strengthened the hypothesis that WBSCR17 is responsible for the neuropsychological findings in our patient, in line with its known implication in brain development. However, its implication in facial anomalies is less likely. For this the fine mapping of breakpoints on the two translocated chromosomes by array painting will help us to better understand the genotype / phenotype correlation in our patient.",2011

In contrast, the case reported herein represents mosacism manifesting as 46,X,idic(X)(p11.2)/46,XX without Turner syndrome phenotype and without a cell with 45,X karyotype. In average, 46,X,idic(X)(p11.2) was detected  in 10% of cells. The latter was found using multiprobe FISH on 350 metaphase plates and 1000 interphase nuclei. The structure of idic(X) was determined by FISH, as well. BrdU replication banding showed consistent inactivation of idic(X) in all affected cells. Phenotypic features referred to autistic and aggressive behavior (including self mutilation), severe developmental delay, lack of speech, mild microcephaly, abnormal pigmentation and mild facial dysmorphisms. Taking into account the severity of the phenotype and the amount of abnormal cells, we came to a conclusion that the index case is  likely to be associated with an X linked mutation and X chromosome isodisomy. To support this hypothesis, we have analyzed length of (CGG)n and (CAG)n repeat expansions of FMR1 and AR genes, respectively, using methyl sensitive restriction and QPCR, which showed the same parental origin of chromosomes X. Therefore, X chromosome isodisomy and an X linked mutation are most likely to explain phenotypic manifestations in the index case. Looking through the available literature, we concluded that this is the first reported case  of mosaicism involving idic(X)(p11.2) without 45,X cell line. Finally, this case shows that such mosaicism is a karyotypic marker of X chromosome isodisomy and X linked mutations as well as supports association of autism with mosaic X chromosome aneuploidy.",2011

The presence of the almost entire additional short arm of chromosome 3 had no visible effects because of suspected X inactivation. Analysis of allele polymorphism in the AR gene by HpaII digestion has confirmed a 100% skewed X inactivation. However, the spreading of gene silencing was probably discontinuous because of the presence of camptodactily, which was reported previously in patients with partial trisomies 3pter p23.

The  genetic etiology of RD is represented, in the majority of cases, by the chromosomal abnormalities. Aim: To retrospectively analyze the karyotype results in a selected group of couples with RD. Material and methods: The present study was performed in 266 couples with RD: 80 (30,07%) with primary sterility (ST), 149 (56,01%) with Recurrent Spontaneous Abortions (RSA) and 37 (13,90%) with Stillborn Children (SC). A GTG banded karyotype was performed on both parteners of each couple. Results: We identified a chromosomal abnormality in 43 individuals (16,16%): 20 cases (7,51%) with ST, 13 cases (4,88%) with  RSA and 10 cases (3,75%) with SC. The affected partner was female in 23 cases (8,64%) and male in 20 cases (7,51%). A X chromosome (numerical or structural) abnormality was detected in 18 cases (6,76%), most frequent X chromosome monosomy mosaicism in female and trisomy XXY in male; a balanced structural chromosomal abnormality (BSC) was detected in 23 couples (8,64%); in other two males with ST, the karyotype result was 46,XX.

They were aged between one month to 24 years.Our results showed that 29 patients (58%) had normal karyotype.The karyotypes of the rest of the cases were as follows:14 patients (28%) were congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH), twelve of whom showed 46,XX and two cases were 46,XY karyotype (both 3B hydroxylase deficiency).4 patients (8%) were 21 OH deficiency.1 patient (1%) was phenotypically male but 46,XX karyotype (XX male).2 cases (2%) have 46, XX/46,XY karyotype. There is a great discrepancy between phenotype karyotype in individuals having a chromosomal mosaicism.",2011

Among the available platforms, BAC and oligonucleotides, the last ones allow the detection of  smaller imbalances, offering a higher diagnostic yield. Meanwhile, a drawback of this higher resolution is that the generation of more data makes the interpretation increasingly challenging. This is particularly important when talking about copy number variants (CNVs), due to the progressive discovery of CNVs of unclear significance.We performed array CGH using Agilent 180K, an oligonucleotide microarray with 180 000 sixty mer probes and 17 Kb average probe spacing. The patientâs samples were hybridized in a loop strategy, where the three samples are labeled in the two colour dyes, Cy3 and  Cy5, and then each patient sample is hybridized against the two other samples.In a small cohort we have identified a cytogenetically detected chromosome 21 duplication that turned out to be an insertion from chromosome 4, a 6q21 deletion in a patient with a t(13;15) and a cryptic 20p12 deletion in Alagille syndrome region in a del2p patient.Our experimental group shows that more than one structural chromosomal alteration in the same patient might occur and that its frequency is probably underestimated.

Expression of this gene is predomintantly in testis and in silico analysis of the CCDC54 gene suggested it is a conserved gene. A yeast two  hybrid screening was performed, which identified Testis specific Zinc Finger Protein (TZFP), a transcriptional repressor, as a binding partner of CCDC54. To further investigate the effect of the binding of CCDC54 on the activity of TZFP, a luciferase reporter assay was performed. This suggested that CCDC54 is a negative co regulator of TZFP. Immunohistochemical staining of human testis tissue shows an overall expression of the CCDC54 protein in the seminiferous tubules.At the DNA level, conservation of the CCDC54 gene was verified and mutation analysis was performed. To detect the reported c.316G>T  or p.Glu106X polymorphism, a restriction digestion with BccI was performed on a control group of 150 European normozoospermic men, but the polymorphism was not found. The CCDC54 gene of 16 European men with a maturation arrest of spermatogenesis and 32 European men with Sertoli cell only syndrome (SCOS) was sequenced and only one missense mutation was found in 2 SCOS patients.These preliminary results suggest that CCDC54 could be an important protein for spermatogenesis.",2011

Research in this field is hindered by the fact that in modern societies the number of pregnancies is mostly determined by socioeconomic, psychological  and environmental factors, and the availability and awareness of contraception, whereas the original genetic determinants fade into the background. In Estonia modern contraceptives became available in the beginning of the nineties, illustrated by the fact that in 1994 only 234 out of every 1000 fertile women were using effective means of contraception and the abortion rate was 54 per 1000 women of reproductive age.We analyzed data from 944 women aged 40 101 (average age 65.2 years) with an average of 3.5 pregnancies (range 1 14); furthermore,  43% of the studied women had had at least 4 pregnancies.

Background: Hydatidiform mole (HM), represents a disorder of  genomic imprinting, a phenomenon whereby genes are monoallelically  expressed from the maternally or paternally derived copy of the gene. HM are classified as partial (PHM) or complete (CHM). The aim of this study was to analyze and to compare the methylation patterns of  imprinted genes in CHM and PHM. m aterial and  m ethods: We used methylation sensitive high  resolution melting technique (MS HRM) for the methylation analysis of  three paternally expressed genes, SNRPN, KCNQ1OT1 and GNAS  XLaS, that are normally only methylated on the maternal allele, and a maternally expressed gene, H19, which is normally only methylated on  the paternal allele. DNA samples including 25 CHM and 20 PHM were scored as hypermethylated, normal, or hypomethylated. Results: We found loss of cytosine methylation in 19 CHM and 1 PHM  at SNRPN DMRs, 20 CHM and 1 PHM at KCNQ1OT1 DMRs, and in  24 CHM and 3 PHM at GNAS XlaS DMRs. Hypermethylation at H19 DMRs was showed in 21 CHM and 1 PHM. Abnormal DNA methylation patterns at all imprinted genes were highly correlated to CHM than PHM (p<0.05). c onclusion: Our data confirm that abnormal methylation status  of imprinted genes is significantly associated to androgenic CHM  characterized by diffuse trophoblastic hyperplasia and the lack of foetal development. So, we confirm the correlation between phenotypic variability of different forms of HM and various degrees of disorder of imprinting. MS HRM analysis is a rapid, specific and sensitive method, which can be applied for the accurate differentiation between CHM  and PHM.",2011

The unfavourable genetic background is thought to cause for 15 30% of male factor infertility cases. Therefore, the correct determination of genetic basis of infertility is very important for further treatment of patients. Here, we  demonstrate a single step Arrayed Primer Extension (APEX) based microarray assay for the MFI diagnosis.Design & Method: The MFI APEX assay enables analysis of numerous genetic factors simultaneously, like AZF microdeletions; Klinefelter syndrome; mutations in cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene; genes involved in folate metabolism; cryptorchidism, hypogonadism, spermatogenic failure linked genes; and polymorphisms in androgen receptor gene. For validation of the MFI APEX assay we used blood samples obtained from 22 infertile  men and 10 fertile men as controls.Results: We developed MFI APEX microarray assay for the detection of genetic factor of the male infertility. Analysis of the APEX results revealed that 14 out of 22 patients had Klinefelter syndrome; 2 patients had Klinefelter syndrome and mutations in CFTR gene; 2 patients had AZFbc microdeletion; 5 patients had AZFc microdeletion; and 1 patient had AZFc deletion and mutation in CFTR gene. No alterations were found in fertile men with MFI APEX assay.Conclusions: Our experiments demonstrated that MFI APEX assay  is suitable for the rapid single step, robust, reliable and cost effective detection of possible genetic cause for male infertility problem. Furthermore, MFI APEX testing is recommended before the couple undergoes assisted reproduction in order to prevent the possible inheritance of the genetic lesion to the next generation.",2011

The past decades, many studies have been  performed aiming to identify genetic causes of maturation arrest  of spermatogenesis (MA). However, these studies were rather disappointing. In the present study, we looked for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) in patients with MA and controls with normal  sperm parameters m aterial and methods. CNVs were identified using 244K arrays in 9  patients. For regions of possible interest, more patients and especially  larger groups of control men were investigated by qPCR.Results. In the patient and control groups, on average 25Â±4 and 24Â±7 CNVs were detected, respectively. After elimination of regions that are not containing any known genes and regions that were also detected as CNVs in controls, 32 regions remained. A further reduction to nine  regions was done by eliminating deletions that are completely intronic (fi in PRKG), regions that were recently amplified in evolution (f.i. BAGE and PNMA genes) and regions with a well known function not involved in spermatogenesis. The remaining nine regions are being investigated by qPCR in order to investigate large numbers of controls (>100) and to conclude whether the observed CNVs are common or related to the fertility problems. Preliminary results show that at least some of the regions are exclusively detected in the patients. c onclusions . In this study, a small group of patients with MA have  been thoroughly investigated using array CGH. No common region  was detected in the patient group that was absent in control samples.

 Role of genetic factors and oxidative stress in male infertility,P04.19,"J. Thilagavathi , S. Venkatesh, M. B. Shamsi, R. Dada","All India Institute of Medical Sciences, New Delhi, India","Introduction: Infertility affects 15% of couples in their reproductive  age group where 30 to 40% of males are the sole contributor and majority of these are idiopathic. Methods: The study included 200 men with idiopathic infertility and 100 fertile controls. The work involved cytogenetic and Y chromosome micro deletion analysis, evaluation  of seminal reactive oxygen species levels by chemiluminescence assay and sperm DNA damage by sperm chromatin structure assay (SCSA). Results and Discussion: Out of 200 infertile men screened, 13% harbored cytogenetic abnormalities. Azoospermia factor (AZF) microdeletions were detected in 9.5% infertile men, where AZFc deletion were predominant followed by AZFb and AZFa deletions. This frequency is similar to that reported in French & Danish population. Level of ROS in both washed and neat semen was found to be significantly (P<0.0001) higher in infertile men compared to controls.  The average mean DNA fragmentation index (DFI) in infertile men was found to be 40.85% which was significantly higher (p<0.0001) compared to average mean DFI (25.62%) in controls. Conclusion: Cytogenetic abnormalities and Yq microdeletions are present in about 22% of men with idiopathic infertility. Analysis of sperm DFI and the cut off level of 30.42% is useful to predict outcome of ART as conventional semen analysis is a moderate predictor of fertility potential. Early detection of OS and suitable antioxidants therapy may prevent further deterioration of semen quality and improves chances of fertilization as it improves membrane integrity. Thus genetic analysis, assessment of ROS levels & DFI has both diagnostic and prognostic capabilities.",2011

Despite the large number of studies about the molecular basis of male infertility the molecular mechanism leading to spermatogenesis disruption is still largely unknown. Several  forms of male infertility can be determined by a common pathogenic mechanism related to alterations in testicular mRNA storage. DAZ and YBX2 are the main genes involved in the regulation of the stability and storage of male germ cell mRNAs. We previously analyzed using quantitative real time SYBR Green PCR assays the YBX2 and its direct interacting genes: PRM2, ODF1, TP1, ACTL7B and found large reductions in mRNA levels in all patients with spermatogenic defects except patients with idiopathic oligozoospermia. Patients with idiopathic azoospermia had similar levels of gene expression as those  carrying Y chromosome microdeletions independently from their SCOS or HS phenotype, suggesting a possible link of the selected genes to a common pathway leading to infertility and that variability of the histopathology is related to other genetic and environmental factors. Further investigations revealed that DAZ gene was not expressed in six patients without the AZFc deletion in the peripheral blood as expected. Testis biopsy was obtained from patients with obstructive azoospermia (10 normospermic controls) and infertile male (10 with Y microdeletions and 10 with idiopathic infertility) with the histopathology ranged from SCOS to severe hypospermatogenesi",2011

DNA of the above samples was isolated using the salting out method and microdeletions of AZF region and AZFc partial deletions were analyzed by multiplex PCR.AZF microdeletions were detected among 13.0% males with azoospermia (p,0.0001) and 8.0% (p,0.004) males with severe oligospermia: AZFa subregion was deleted in one patient (4.8%), AZFb    3 (14.3%), AZFb+c   7 (33.3%), AZFc   10 (47.6%) As AZFc subregion was the most frequently altered the study of AZFc partial deletions was done. 8.0% azoospermic/oligospermic men without AZF microdeletions were detected to have AZFc partial deletions. The analysis of AZFc partial deletions has shown the presence of AZFc gr/gr deletion among 2.5% persons (mainly with oligospermia), b2/b3 deletions   4.5% (three with aspermia and six with oligoastenoteratospermia) and absence of sY1291 locus in 1.0% of patients.No carriers of AZF microdeletions or partial AZFc deletions were identified among control group of fertile men. The differences in Y chromosomal partial AZFc deletions frequencies between infertile men (azoospermic/oligospermic) versus group of fertile men are significant (p,0.004) and substantiated AZFc partial deletion testing  for practical purposes.",2011

Approximately 500 cells were counted, and the percentage of spermatozoa with fragmented DNA (DFI) was calculated. Results: There are no significant differences in the mean of participantâs  age, sperm concentration, normal sperm morphology in two groups but the mean of sperm motility of fertile males was significantly higher than that of asthenozoospermic males.The difference was not significant between the percentage of DNA fragmentation in patients with asthenozoospermia and the normozoospermics men (9.46 Â± 8.68 and 8.19 Â± 6.84). In addition, no significant correlation was found between the degree of asthenozoospermia and the DFI value in the asthenozoospermic group, when this group was subdivided into moderate, severe, and extreme asthenozoospermia. c onclusion: Asthenozoospermia was not associated with an increase  of DNA fragmentation. So impairment of sperm motility is not a critical  parameter for analysis of sperm DNA damage.Reproductive genetics166",2011

About 10 15%  of couples suffer this problem and in the 50 %, the male factor affects. The human Y chromosome contains essential genes for spermatogenesis specially those which are located on four major intervals defined as AZFa, AZFb, AZFc and AZFd. Partial deletions  of the AZFc region is reported as a significant risk factor for oligo /azoospermia. The main purpose of this study is to investigate the association between Testosterone, FSH, LH serum levels and the prevalence of partial deletions in the AZFc region (gr/gr, b1/b2, b2/b3) in Iranian oligozoospermia males.Material and methods: Multiplex PCR technique and agarose gel electrophoresis were used to assess complete and partial deletions in 30 oligozoospermia infertile and 50 fertile men, and Levels of hormones were measured by Imunoenzymatic kit (EIA) in all samples. Results: 3.3% of the patients showed AZFb deletion but no microdeletion was detected in the control samples. In AZFc region, 17% patients showed deletions, in which 13.7% had gr/gr and 3.4% had b2/b3 deletions. 12% of the healthy individuals showed partial deletions, including gr/gr (10%) and b2/b3(2%). No significant correlation was detected between the presence of gr/gr microdeletion and the testosterone serum level (p,0.856). However, the serum levels for FSH and LH were significantly higher in patients with gr/gr microdeletion (p,0.0001, p,0.0001 respectively).Conclusion: The present study suggests that applying molecular investigation in oligozoospermia patients with increased serum levels for FSH and LH may be informative before using assisted reproductive treatments.",2011

To address this question we developed a sensitive, fluorescently labeled semi quantitative RT PCR assay coupled with gene specific restriction resolved on an ABI capillary electrophoresis. The detailed profile of alternative transcripts of GH2, CSH1, CSH2, and CSHL1 genes in placental samples of REPROMETA collection from uncomplicated term pregnancies was determined in association with the birthweight of newborns, grouped as appropriate for gestational age (AGA; n,23),  small for gestational age (SGA; n,15), and large for gestational age (LGA; n,34), and by maternal pregnancy related conditions of pre eclampsia (PE; n,17) and gestational diabetes mellitus (GD; n,11).The majority of pregnancies with SGA newborn show down regulation of the entire hGH/CSH cluster in placenta, while in case of LGA the expression of CSH1 1, CSH2 1 and CSHL1 4 mRNA transcripts in placenta is significantly increased compared to AGA newborns (P<0.0001, P,0.009, P,0.002, respectively) (MÃ¤nnik et al., 2010, J Clin Endocrinol Metab. 95:2433 42). Similarly, the entire hGH/CSH cluster shows reduced expression in placentas of PE compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. In case of GD, the individual genes in hGH/CSH cluster demonstrate differential expression pattern compared to uncomplicated pregnancies. Our results show that the expression level of placental hGH/CSH genes correlates with fetal growth and may influence maternal metabolism.",2011

Recently NR5A1  mutations were found to be associated with sporadic and  familial primary ovarian insufficiency (POI). The high mutation rate in  the previously published paper prompted us to further establish the significance of NR5A1  mutations in a large cohort of women with POI. m aterials &  m ethods: In 2005 a nationwide phenotype and genotype  study on POI was initiated in the Netherlands; all study cases were included for the current study. The entire coding region (exon 2 7) and splice sites of the NR5A1 gene were PCR amplified and sequenced.  The pathogenicity of identified mutations was determined with splice site involvement, Align GVGD class and Grantham scores. Results: 383 Women with POI were included, 77 of them had a  family history for POI. Adrenal dysfunction was excluded in all women. Five non conservative missense mutations (mutation rate 1.3%) in 3 sporadic and 2 familial cases of POI were found. Grantham variations were 29, 64, 98, 99, and 113. Splice sites were not involved. Align GVGD classes ranged from C0 to C25, indicating low to intermediate pathogenicity. c onclusions: The prevalence of NR5A1  mutations in a large  cohort of women with POI (1.3%) is lower than published previously. Furthermore, low to intermediate pathogenicity was predicted for these mutations. There seems to be limited value for the inclusion of SF 1 gene mutation screening in the diagnostic work up for women with POI.Reproductive genetics167",2011

Of the 74 patients, seven were born after ART (six after ICSI and one after IVF). Molecular studies revealed underlying genetic causes in all patients, including the seven patients born after ART of whom two had deletion of the paternally derived 15q imprinted region and five had trisomy rescue type upd(15)mat (TR upd(15)mat). The maternal ages at birth were increased in PWS patients conceived after ART (36 45 years), especially in those with TR upd(15)mat (38 45 years), consistent with the notion that the advanced maternal age is a risk factor for the development of TR upd(15)mat. The frequency of births after ART was significantly higher in PWS patients than in the general population (P,2.2Ã10  9), even after  adjusting maternal ages (â¥35 years) (P,5.4Ã10 6). Among PWS  patients, however, although the relative frequency of TR upd(15) mat was significantly higher in patients conceived after ART than in those conceived naturally (P ,0.008), it became non significant after adjusting maternal ages (â¥35 years) between the two groups (P,0.22). The results imply that ART and/or ART related parental and environmental factors can be a risk factor for PWS in general. In addition, the relative predominance of TR upd(15)mat in patients born after ART is primarily ascribed to an ART related maternal age factor rather than ART itself.",2011

In the present study, using immunofluorescence of tissue sections and tissue arrays, we demonstrate a shift in laeverin protein expression from  the cell membrane in healthy trophoblast to cytosol in preeclampsia. Electronmicroscopy indicated that laeverin is retained in the Golgi apparatus in preeclamptic placentas. Additionally, we tested the hypothesis that laeverin  gene silencing reduces the invasiveness of the  cell line HTR 8/SVneo trophoblasts through a basement membrane like matrix (Matrigel). Trophoblast invasion was reduced by 58% in laeverin  knock out cells compared to controls. Wound healing assay  demonstrated reduced migration of trophoblast cell line transfected with siRNA against laeverin . We further performed gene expression  profiling using RT2 Profiler TM PCR Array in order to find the molecular  pathways that might be affected by laeverin  silencing. Among the 84  genes present on the array, three genes were significantly (>4 fold) down regulated: integrin alpha 2  (39 fold), matrix metalloproteinase  1 (36 fold) and integrin beta 3 (5 fold). In conclusion, laeverin is up  regulated in the preeclamptic placenta both at transcriptional and protein level. It appears to regulate trophoblast invasion by affecting cell adhesion molecules and degradation of the extracellular matrix and thus might have a role in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia.",2011

Almog,  A. Amit, Y. Yaron","Racine IVF Unit, Department of Ob/Gyn, Lis Maternity Hospital, Sourasky  Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Tel Aviv, Israel","Introduction: Misdiagnosis in PGD occurs mainly due to allele drop  out (ADO), but can be prevented by the use of flanking polymorphic markers (most commonly CA repeats). The reliability of diagnosis depends on the number, heterozygosity and informativity of such markers. When database search yields insufficient results, it is  essential to discover novel markers.Aim: To describe a simple approach for detecting novel locus specific polymorphic markers.Material and Methods: To detect CA repeats, we copy the sequence of interest spanning 1 Mb upstream and downstream from the mutation site into a MS Word file. Then we search this sequence using the Ctrl F function for (CA)n or (TG)n, (where n>10). Such STRs will often be polymorphic. Primers are then designed for each site. A marker is considered informative when the CA repeat size is different among the  various alleles in family members.Results: Over the last 8 years we performed PGD for 65 different disease genes, using 545 flanking polymorphic markers. Of these, 344 (63.1%) were obtained using published data. However, for more than 20 disease genes, with insufficient informative markers, we were able to detect an additional 201 (36.9%) novel CA repeats using this approach. More than 90% of these sites indeed proved to be polymorphic. This allowed the use of at least 4 informative markers for each case of PGD.Conclusion  : We demonstrated a simple approach for search of novel  informative CA repeats that allows maximizing accuracy in PGD and prevention of ADO. This approach is now routinely used in our PGD lab.Reproductive genetics168",2011

Amit, Y. Yaron","Tel Aviv Sourasky Medical Center, Tel Aviv, Israel","Introduction : In translocation carriers, meiosis produces different  segregation variants. Most studies of segregation variant frequencies were obtained from observations of viable probands. PGD provides a unique insight into this phenomenon.Aim: Deduction of meiotic segregation patterns as assessed in  embryos of translocation carriers undergoing PGD. M&M: Ninety PGD cycles were performed for 35 translocation carriers. Two blastomeres were aspirated from each embryo for FISH analysis. The resulting segregation variants were deduced. Observed frequencies of different segregants were compared to predicted frequencies, based on pachytene shape analysis, taking into account the length of the centric versus the translocated fragments . Results: Overall 583 embryos were analyzed: 441 from reciprocal translocation carriers and 142 from Robertsonian translocations. In  reciprocal translocations, alternate segregation (balanced) was seen in 23.1% of embryos, whereas most were unbalanced (adjacent 1 in 29.4%; adjacent 2 in 5.9%; 3:1 segregation in 25.6%; and 16% had other anomalies).The overall incidence of unbalanced embryos was 71.4%, but was significantly higher in reciprocal translocations. In most translocations, adjacent 2 segregation was rare, but when present, the rate of balanced gametes was lower. There was no significant difference in the rate of unbalanced embryos between female and male carriers. Finally, the distribution of segregation modes was predicted correctly in 82%.Conclusions: Translocation carriers have a significantly high frequency of unbalanced embryos, more so among reciprocal translocation carriers. In PGD, the frequencies of the different segregation patterns  can be predicted by pachytene shape analysis. Some translocations predispose to a higher rate of unbalanced gametes, as compared to others.",2011

Although preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is an alternative option for couples at risk of having a child with single gene disorder, blastomere biopsy has been employed in most in vitro  fertilization procedures. Methods: In the present study, we validated and applied protocol clinically for PGD through the use of blastocyst biopsy, whole genome amplification, mini sequencing genotype coupling with genetic linkage of SMN gene involving three informative microsatellite markers, and  thawed embryo transfer. We report data to identify the SMN1 gene deletion on eighteen clinical embryos obtained from one participating couple, where both partners are heterozygous SMA carriers with 1 SMN1/3 SMN2 genotypes. Results: Approximately 78% (14/18) of blastocysts were successfully  amplified in a single PGD cycle. Among these embryos, ten (72%, 10/14) were diagnosed as unaffected, two (14%, 2/14) as affected, and two embryos (14%, 2/14) had no conclusive diagnosis due to allele drop out (ADO). Two unaffected embryos were thawed and transferred in the next cycle resulting in a singleton pregnancy, and the birth of a healthy girl who carries the 1  SMN1/3 SMN2 genotype. Conclusions:  The strategy of PGD using blastocyst biopsy and  thawed embryo transfer increased the reliability of the results and permitted more time for the execution of molecular diagnosis.

INTRODUCTION: In the Netherlands prenatal diagnosis (PND) for Huntington disease (HD) is available since 1987. Preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) was first applied in 1999. For this study we surveyed all couples referred for PND and/or PGD for HD between 1996 and 2008. METHODS: Information on couplesâ reproductive history, pregnancies with/without PND, PGD cycles, and follow up of all subsequent pregnancies was included until December 2010. RESULTS: 184 couples were surveyed. For the first pregnancy 59% opted for PND, 14% started PGD, 13% had their first child untested, 11% refrained from PGD after intake and had no PND in subsequent pregnancies, 3% had a miscarriage. In 79.9% of couples one partner was a known carrier (61 males/86 females). In 20.1% one of the partners was at risk (26 males/11 females). In subsequent pregnancies, 29 couples started PGD (24 after a history of PND and/or miscarriage). 22 couples secondarily underwent PND (19 after untested pregnancies, 3 after â¥1 PGD cycles). 68 couples applied for PND in â¥ 2 subsequent pregnancies.In total 132 couples performed PND in 266 pregnancies (86% direct testing, 14% exclusion testing): more details will be provided.PGD was performed in 51 couples (1 exclusion PGD): 123 cycles resulted in 25 deliveries (23 couples).CONCLUSIONS: According to the alternating use of PND and PGD we conclude that couples reconsider their choices in every subsequent pregnancy based on their previous experience, personal beliefs, and probably time pressure.",2011

From 2001 to 2011, 213 patients underwent PGD following 304 assited reproductive treatment (ART) cycles. 136 patients were carrying reciprocal translocation (RecT), 63 patients were carrying robertsonian translocation (RobT), 1 patient was carrying both reciprocal and robertsonian translocation, 1 patient was carrying a complex translocation and 12 patients were carrying inversions. Blastomeres or trophectoderm tissues were fixed with hypotonic solution/3:1 fixative method.Commercially supplied telomeric,locus specific and centromeric FISH probes were used. For cases done in years between 2007 and 2011, aneuploidy panel (13,16,18,21,22) was also included in the PGD study. From a total of 2000 biopsied embryos, 90% were diagnosed. For RecT carriers 197 cycles, for RobT carriers 90 cycles and for inversion carriers 14 cycles were performed. The clinical pregnancy rates were 36.8%, and 31.1% respectively. For RecT carriers 20.3% and for RobT carriers 34.7% of embryos were found to be normal or balanced. It was found that; the gender of the translocation carrier, maternal age and the type of the translocation affected the percentage of normal or balanced embryos. To date, 59 healthy babies have been born for translocation and inversion carriers.",2011

Since than, we have performed over 120 cycles with scheduled PGD for 43 different monogenic diseases. The list of diagnosis where we can offer PGD is being continually extended. In our center we use genetic haplotyping technique by multiplex PCR technique on products of MDA (multiple displacement amplification) from 1 blastomere biopsied from the cleavage stage embryo.In rare cases of unambiguous results from the blastomere, analysis can be repeated from trofoectoderm and embryo is still managed to be transfer on the day 5. We have been working on expanding of PGD cases resolvable in our center. This year we successfully completed first cycle of male partner de novo mutation case based on sperm haplotyping analysis supplemented by proof of mutation by  sequencing analysis.Up to now, we have accomplished 120 IVF cycles with PGH. In average 7 8 embryos were biopsied in one IVF cycle, as preferably mild stimulation protocols were applied.We completed accreditation of the method by ISO regulation 15189:2007 in 2009. We annually participate in EQA organized by UK NEQAS.PGD represents an alternative within prenatal diagnosis services and so offers a chance for many couples in risk of genetic disease to have a healthy baby and to avoid the risk termination of the pregnancy from genetic reasons or birth of affected child. Currently available PGD technology can help eliminate some genetic diseases in the future.",2011

For some carrier couples Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) could be an option to fulfil their child wish.In this study we retrospectively analyse the results of PGD for RecT at our centre. Materials and methods: An observational study was performed of all cycles for PGD for RecT at a tertiary referral centre between January 1997 and December 2007.Data on patient characteristics and cycle outcomes were registered.Results: During a period of 11 years 312 PGD cycles were performed for 69 male and 73 female carriers of RecT. The mean female age was 32.8years, the mean male age 35.8 years. Most carriers were diagnosed with a translocation because of fertility problems or recurrent miscarriages and most of them opted for PGD to avoid these  problems.In 150 of the 312 cycles, embryo transfer was feasible and 40 women delivered a healthy singleton or twin. This gives a live birth delivery rate of 12.8% per started cycle and of 26.7% per cycle with embryo transfer.Conclusion: Due to the large number of abnormal embryos, PGD cycles for RecT often lead to cancellation of embryo transfer, explaining the low success rate when expressed per cycle with oocyte pick up.Once embryo transfer was feasible, the live birth delivery rate was similar to that of PGD in general at our centre.PGD is therefore an established option for specific RecT carriers and its availability should be discussed during reproductive counseling.",2011

Previously we have reported a tissue specific loss of methylation in KCNQ1OT1 and PLAGL1 in 9.5% and 10.3% spontaneous abortions, respectively. The aim of the present research was identify DNA methylation levels of 115 differentially methylated  sites of 52 imprinting genes in samples of first trimester spontaneous abortions using GoldenGate Methylation Cancer Panel I (Illumina, USA). We have analyzed cytotrophoblast (CT) and extraembryonic mesoderm (EM) from 13 first trimester spontaneous abortions (8.3Â±1.8 weeks) with normal karyotype and 4 induced abortions (7.8Â±0.7 weeks) as a control group. Fourteen (27%) imprinting genes have revealed abnormal methylation in most miscarriages. Eight of these genes (PEG10, GRB10, CPA4, PHLDA2, WT1, ZNF215, HTR2A, GABRB3) were hypomethylated, whereas 6 genes (DCN, TRPM5,  H19, INS, GABRA5, PWCR1) were hypermethylated. Significantly, epimutations were found in both tissues (22%) or confined by EM (65%) or CT (13%). Presence of hypomethylation in both tissues indicates reprogramming errors in the primordial germ cells during gametogenesis or at early stages of preimplantation development. The hypermethylation of imprinted genes in both tissues can be a result of reprogramming errors during gametogenesis. Whereas, tissue specific epimutations allows suggesting independent sporadic epigenetic errors in imprinting maintenance in derivates of various embryonic germ layers after its divergence. Our results provide first evidence for the multiple germinative and somatic epimutations of CpGs within imprinting genes, which can be responsible for the dysfunction of imprinted loci during early embryo development.

Our case control study revealed that the minor allele was significantly frequent in the RPL group for all six of these SNPs, among which SNP5 showed the highest significance (P,0.002). As with the M2 haplotype for SNP1 4 (A C C A) suggested for a western population in previous reports, a haplotype comprising all of the minor alleles for SNP1 6 (A C C A  G T), the third major haplotype in the Japanese population, showed a significant frequency in our current RPL subjects (P,0.025). In addition, the second major haplotype (G A T G G C) was also found to confer a significant risk of RPL (P,0.036), implicating SNP5 as a major risk determinant for this disease. Our present findings support the hypothesis that genomic variations within the ANXA5 gene upstream region impact upon the disease susceptibility to RPL.

Sperm DNA damage was measured by flow cytometry and expressed as DNA fragmentation index (DFI). One of 48 RSA men (2%) showed 46, XY (1qh ) chromosomal complement. None of the subject showed Yq deletions. Sperm count was found be significantly lower in SA cases compared to group NS cases (p<0.0001) and FC (p<0.005). Male partners of RSA couples with abnormal and normal sperm parameters had higher sperm DNA damage (P<0.0001).

In majority of the couples experiencing RSA, the causes are unknown. This study was planned to analyze seminal oxidative stress (OS) as well as the level of DNA damage of sperm in couples with history of idiopathic RSA. m aterials and  m ethods: Twenty two (22) couples experienced RSA  and 30 fertile controls were included in the study. OS were evaluated  by assessing ROS levels in the semen by chemiluminescence assay and were expressed as RLU/min/20 million sperm. For analysis of the DNA fragmentation, SCSA (Sperm chromatin structure assay) was used as it delivers a highly accurate measure of fertility potential.Results: RSA and control groups did not show any significant differences in the sperm parameters. However, the mean seminal  reactive oxygen species levels were found to be significantly higher in RSA group as compared to controls (12629.23 Â± 3245.12 Vs 2535.55 Â± 135.24).

 Recombination hotspots and preimplantation genetic haplotyping for sickle cell anaemia,P04.55,"H. Patel, C. Ogilvie, Y. Khalaf, P. Renwick","Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom","Preimplantation genetic haplotyping (PGH) involves amplification of the  whole genome from a single blastomere followed by haplotyping. PGH requires sufficient fully informative STR markers in close proximity to the gene of interest for any given couple.Sickle cell anaemia (SCA) is caused by specific mutations in the  HBB gene (mainly HbS or HbC). Our experience with PGH for SCA using STR markers indicates that recombination hot spots close to the gene reduce the number of transferable embryos available, due to recombinant haplotypes, which may or may not carry the mutation. The distance between the recombination hotspot and the common mutation is ~30kb; informative markers within this region are therefore necessary in order to diagnose mutation status in all recombinant embryos. Alternatively, identification of a common haplotype harbouring the mutation could be informative for diagnosis. Novel STRs and SNPs were identified across the region; however, none were found within the 30kb region of interest. Following testing of DNA from 36 members of SCA families and 28 MDA products of single cells from embryos using these SNPs and STRs, a common mutation carrying HbS haplotype was observed in 9/10 cases. The single exception found means that this approach is unsuitable for definitive PGH diagnosis. An ARMS test was therefore designed for unique identification of HbA, HbS and HbC alleles; this test is now used when a recombination event is observed, for direct determination of the mutation status of the embryo.",2011

During meiosis, homologous chromosomes undergo pairing, synapsis, recombination, and faithful segregation. In male, sex chromosome recombination behaviors are fundamentally  different from female meiosis. Recombination between chromosomes X and Y is normally restricted to the pseudoautosomal regions located at both ends of the sex chromosomes. An obligate crossover in the pseudoautosomal region (PAR1) during male meiosis seems to be necessary for male fertility. Defects in meiosis are a leading cause of both infertility and birth defects (trisomy and monosomy) in humans. In the present study, abnormal recombination frequency between chromosome X and chromosome Y was estimated in sperm nuclei of patients with structural chromosome aberrations such as reciprocal,  Robertsonian translocations and other structural changes by using FISH technique.

It is one of the most common adverse pregnancy outcomes, affecting up to 15% clinically recognized pregnancies. Etiology of SAB has been tried to be explained by lots of  studies however the results are still controversial. In these researches, chromosomal anomalies and Y micro deletions are considered to be the main reason of SAB, except the advanced maternal age and teratogenic factors. Primarily, cytogenetic evaluation was performed from peripheral blood samples of the couples in spontaneous abortion cases. Additionally, the frequency of Y micro deletions of these patients and the same control group was examined. m aterial  m ethods: 30 women who had at least two spontaneous  abortions and their husbands were karyotyped to detect the  chromosome anomalies. Conventional karyotyping from peripheral blood samples with Giemsa staining was applied.

[Introduction]As for prenatal service, genetic counseling is basically offered before and after genetic test in Japan. It sometimes makes difficult us to follow up patients continuously. However, at our hospital, genetic staffs have opportunities to see patients at maternity visits and also at the delivery.  In this report, we reconfirm our role for the patients and for midwives at maternity ward.[Case 1] 39 y/o. Para 0 Gravida 0. At 29 weeks, congenital heart defect and single umbilical cord were detected at the growth scan. At 31 weeks, the fetus was diagnosed as 18 trisomy by amniocentesis.[Case 2] 33 y/o. Para 0 Gravida 0. At 12 weeks, she was referred to our hospital because of NT thickness. After genetic counseling, she declined any prenatal test and had been followed by former clinic. At 27 weeks, she was referred to our hospital again because of  polyhydramnios. She decided to have chromosome test at that stage and diagnosed as 18 trisomy.[Case 3] 36 y/o. Para 1 Gravida 1. At 31 weeks, she was referred to our hospital because of intrauterine growth retardation, omphalocele and congenital heart defect. She declined further prenatal test after genetic counseling.

Reports to date suggest that initially NIPD will test for Down Syndrome (DS) only. One essential piece of information that needs to be considered will be womenâs residual risk for the chromosome abnormalities that NIPD wonât detect. Aim: To calculate the residual risk of fetal chromosome abnormalities in women at increased risk of DS if they had NIPD for (1) DS only (2) DS, plus Trisomy 18 and Trisomy 13 (3) DS, plus Trisomy 18, Trisomy 13, and sex chromosome aneuploidies.Method: A population based data set of all prenatal diagnostic tests in Victoria, Australia, for 2008 (70,000 births) was used. Frequencies of abnormal fetal karyotypes amongst women referred for an increased risk of DS were extracted.Results: There were 2954 amniocenteses or CVS for increased risk of  DS, and 287 chromosome abnormalities detected (1 in 10). Of these, 129 were DS i.e. 1 in 23 overall.This means that 1 in 19 pregnancies had some other chromosome abnormality (residual risk). Inclusion of T18 and T13 in the detection panel reduces residual risk to 1 in 30, and if sex aneuploidies are added, to 1 in 42.Conclusion: In a population of women at increased risk of DS, the risk of non DS chromosome abnormalities is higher than the risk of DS. Women need to be informed about the spectrum of chromosome  disorders currently detected by karyotyping that will no longer be detected by NIPD for DS.",2011

DOWN syndrome (DS), the most common fetal aneuploidy, is caused  by an extra copy of chromosome 21 (trisomy 21) affecting 1 in 700 1000 live births Therefore diagnosis and prevention of live born affected fetus is a health care priority.We have successfully used a novel MGB TaqMan probe based real  time PCR assay for rapid diagnosis of trisomy 21.Chorionic  Villus Samples (CVS) and amniocyte samples was obtained  from 59 pregnant women who had the high risk criteria of having fetus  with trisomy 21. Quality and quantity of DNA was measured by the optical absorbance. DYRK1A and DSCAM genes (target genes) and PMP22 (reference gene) were selected and specific primers and probs for these genes and were designed. After determining of standard curve and PCR efficiencies for each gene, the target/reference genes ratio was calculated using comparative cycle threshold method . The results of gene dosage analysis showed the target/reference genes ratio of 1.56Â±0.09 and 1.02Â±0.11 in trisomy 21 and normal samples for Chorionic  Villus Samples and 1.61 Â± 0.09 and 1.03 Â±  0.05 for amniocyte samples respectively that showed statistically significant difference between two groups.The conventional cytogenetic analysis needs live cultured cells and is too time consuming for clinical application. In contrast, molecular methods such as FISH, QF PCR, MLPA and quantitative Real time PCR are rapid assays with results in 24h.Therefore, Real Time PCR technique can be used as an accurate, rapid and sensitive method for prenatal diagnosis of trisomy 21.Prenatal and perinatal genetics177",2011

White2","1QuantaLife, Inc, Pleasanton, CA, United States, 2National Genetics Reference  Laboratory (Wessex), Salisbury, United Kingdom","Determination of fetal load in maternal plasma is a pre requisite for a number of non invasive approaches to detecting fetal abnormalities. Existing techniques are faced with difficulties when trying to quantify the minute amounts of fetal DNA in maternal plasma, particularly for female fetuses. A new droplet digitalâ¢ PCR (ddPCRâ¢) system was  developed to address these challenges.The ddPCR system partitions the sample into 20,000 droplets, each one nanoliter in volume, such that some contain the target of interest and some do not. The emulsion is thermocycled to end point, then every droplet is read with a two color fluorescence detector. The number of positive and negative droplets is used to compute an absolute concentration of the target with high precision and accuracy. The simple workflow uses standard 96 well plate processing enabling the system to generate data for millions of PCR replicates within a  matter of hours.The assay uses a SRY Y chromosome marker for male fetuses and methyl sensitive restriction enzyme digestion of a RASSF1A marker as a gender independent test. We applied this method to the analysis of more than one hundred maternal plasma samples to obtain a distribution of total DNA and fetal load.",2011

Fetal nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) have emerged as the best  candidates for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis. But fetal NRBCs are rare in the maternal circulation. To assess the detection efficiency of the isolation of fetal NRBCs using the different density gradients and different osmolality of percoll, we counted number of NRBCs in the  blood of pregnant women at different gestational ages.Fetal NRBCs were isolated from 10ml of maternal in 179 cases using double percoll gradient with optimal osmolality (280 mOs/kgH 20, 1.077  g/ml and 520 mOs/kgH20, 1.119 g/ml). Magnetic activated cell sorting  was used to enrich isolated NRBCs, and morphological differentiation  was performed with Kleihauer Betke stain. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis was used to detect of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y. The mean number of NRBCs were 8.73 (6 to 14 week of gestation), 15.24 (15 to 20 week of gestation), 17.52 (21 to 28 week of gestation) and significantly increased during the period from 6 to 28 weeks of pregnancy (p,0.043, p,0.036). The frequencies of fetal NRBCs  were 71.35% (6 to 14 week of gestation), 60.78% (15 to 20 week of gestation), 55.83% (21 to 28 week of gestation). There was a significant increase in the frequency of fetal NRBCs in a first trimester compared to a second and third trimester ( p,0.005). The NRBC enrichment method using optimal osmolality in first trimester  can be a more useful prenatal diagnostic tool for fetal aneuploidy than in second trimester.This research was supported by grant SC1150 .",2011

Reports of prenatal diagnosis of FGFR 3 related skeletal dysplasias are not rare, however, the correlation between 2 nd  trimester ultrasonographic (U/S) findings and underlying molecular  defect in these cases is relatively poor. There is a need for specific U/S predictors than can distinguish lethal from non lethal cases and aid an earlier prenatal diagnosis. Here we present sixteen (16) sporadic and  one (1) familial cases with FGFR 3 related skeletal dysplasia and a normal karyotype. We evaluate biometric parameters and U/S findings consistent with the molecular diagnosis of skeletal dysplasia . U/S scan  performed even at the 18 th week of gestation can indicate a decreased  rate of development of the femora (femur length<5th centile), while  the mean gestational age at diagnosis is still around the 26th week.  The utility of other biometric parameters and ratios is discussed (foot  length, BPD, HC, FL/foot and FL/AC). In two cases of discontinued pregnancy, fetal autopsy led to a phenotypic diagnosis and confirmed the prenatal prediction of lethality.

The expansion reduces the expression of the FMR1 by promoting DNA hypermethylation of this region when  exceeding â 200 repeats. Molecular diagnosis relies on determination  of the number of allele repeats in the DNA template, and assessment of the methylation state of the FMR1 locus. Current conventional PCR amplification is only successful for normal and small permutation alleles, and is not informative for homozygous repeat alleles. Expanded alleles too large to amplify efficiently and female homozygous samples require additional Southern Blot (SB) analysis for categorization and sizing. Although regarded as gold standard, this technique is laborious, time consuming and involves (not always available) large amounts of  DNA. However, accurate and efficient quantification of the number of repeats in the 5â UTR of FMR1 gene is essential as premutation alleles are common in the general population.We evaluated a commercially available assay (Asuragen) using a large set of blinded archived prenatal samples that were previously analyzed for FXS with conventional PCR and SB analysis in our Center. The PCR reagentia were able to identify accurately and quickly FMR1 genotypes, ranging from normal over premutation to full mutation alleles, in patient and control samples. Exact sizing was possible for a spectrum of permutation alleles. The assay is also sensitive to size mosaicism and AGG interruptions.Prenatal and perinatal genetics179",2011

Molecular studies showed  a p.N540K (c.1659C>G) mutation in the FGFR3 gene. Subsequent investigations revealed that the mother also had this mutation, as well  as her son.The detailed fetal ultrasound of the ongoing pregnancy evoked the diagnosis of achondroplasia rather than hypochondroplasia. Initial molecular testing on amniotic cells failed to detect the p.N540K mutation.  Because of the suspicion on fetal ultrasounds of achondroplasia further molecular analysis was performed, and revealed the presence of the classic achondroplasia mutation p.G380R (c1138G>C), hereby confirming the diagnosis of achondroplasia in this foetus.In conclusion : this baby with a prenatal diagnosis of achondroplasia,  was born in a family with a mother and 2 sibs affected with hypochondroplasia. The age of the father at conception was 33 years.Since this is an unusual finding, further molecular studies to determine the parental origin of the p.G380R mutation using flanking  polymorphisms, are performed and the results will be discussed. If the mutation is located on the maternal chromosome there might be a mechanism that can explain that the FGFR3 gene in the mother is more prone to mutations.

The Apgar scores at 1 or 5 minutes were recorded following standardized procedures. We obtained information on idiopathic congenital cataract by linking the cohort with the Pediatric Ophthalmology Hospital Register.

Following amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling, samples were processed for routine karyotype analysis while DNA was extracted in parallel for MLPA analysis. When necessary, parental samples were  analyzed to determine the inheritance of the detected aberrations. We identified nine (9) fetuses with pathological genomic abnormalities (approximately 1 in 191), five of which had as sole indication advanced maternal age (1 in 240). In 2 cases an abnormality was suspected from karyotype analysis, while the remaining 7 cases would have otherwise remained totally undetected.  Our data represent the largest published  series involving this type of genomic analysis in routine prenatal diagnosis, without indication bias.

In particular massive parallel shotgun sequencing (MPSS) is capable to identify fetal trisomies. The accuracy of this approach is dependent on the number of fetal DNA molecules present  and the overall fetal fraction. A control reaction that is able to assess the fetal contribution to the DNA sample is therefore highly beneficial.We have previously developed a multiplex assay that utilized DNA methylation as a basis for discrimination of fetal derived DNA from maternal DNA. First, methylation sensitive restriction is used to isolate the methylated fetal DNA markers and amplified using competitive PCR in one multiplex reaction. Finally the amplicons are quantified using MALDI TOF mass spectrometry. This setup allowed us to obtain both fetal and total copy numbers and the overall fetal fraction. To minimize the complexity of the MPSS workflow, we have modified this fetal quantifier assay to integrate with standard laboratory equipment already used in the MPSS process. We have developed a novel PCR strategy where the amplification of the abundant total DNA markers is modulated using target specific PCR primer inhibitors.

Despite the advances in improving the analytical sensitivity of methods it is still very challenging to distinguish between fetal and maternal sequences and noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of  genetic diseases has not yet attained a clinical routine application. Fetal DNA in maternal plasma is in the presence of a large majority of wild type sequences of maternal origin which hamper the identification of fetal paternally inherited mutated alleles. To make widely accessible noninvasive prenatal diagnosis we developed conditions for the enrichment of fetal alleles based on co amplification at lower denaturation temperature PCR (COLD PCR).We designed assays for the identification of two beta thalassemia mutations, based on full COLD PCR. In this protocol, heteroduplexes  generated between mutant and wild type sequences were selectively denatured at a critical temperature and amplified allowing the enrichment of fetal mutated alleles which could then be simply detected by direct sequencing. Full COLD PCR enabled correct identification of fetal paternally inherited alleles in 35 couples.We provide the first evidence that the application of COLD PCR enables straightforward and reliable identification of inherited mutated alleles without the need of sophisticated procedures or advanced and costly equipment. Full COLD PCR can be successfully applied to enrich DNA variants irrespective of the kind and position of the mutation thus providing a powerful tool for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of fetal alleles in a variety of genetic diseases or in general for the identification of muted minority alleles.",2011

Increased foetal nuchal translucency (NT) between 11 and 14 weeksâ  gestation is a common phenotypic expression of chromosomal abnormalities. In the absence of aneuploidy it is associated with adverse perinatal outcome due to foetal malformations and genetic syndromes, including some monogenic disorders. Arrayed primer extension Prenatal and perinatal genetics181 (APEX) microarray assay was developed to analyse conditions which  are related to increased NT in case aneuploidy is excluded. The test includes 3 monogenic disorders (21 hydroxylase deficiency, Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome, spinal muscular atrophy), mutations in 5 genes associated with Noonan syndrome and polymorphisms in 22q11.2  region for detection of del22q11.2 syndrome.Objective: to evaluate the informativeness of the prenatal diagnostic test in case of increased NT in the foetuses with normal karyotype.Methods: 267 variations in 16 different genes were tested with APEX array in 220 DNA samples isolated from the foetal chorionic cells or amniocytes.Results: Genetic changes were detected in 24 DNA. In 9 foetuses mutations in gene related to 21 hydroxylase deficiency was detected. Mutations associated with Noonan syndrome were present in 10  foetuses and with Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome in 1 foetus. In one foetus homozygosity of the signals in locus 22q11.2 was observed and deletion in this region was suspected. Detailed genotypes and their phenotypic consequences are discussed.Conclusion: according to our preliminary data the informativeness of our diagnostic test is 9,1% in cohort of the foetuses with NT> 3mm and normal karyotype.

Ophthalmo Acromelic Syndrome (OAS, MIM 206920) is an autosomal  recessive condition mainly characterized by uni  or bilateral microphthalmia or anophthalmia and limb anomalies, especially synostosis of fourth and fifth metacarpals and foot oligodactyly. Recently, loss of function mutations in the SMOC1 gene have been  shown to be responsible for the disorder.We report on a consanguineous couple requesting a prenatal diagnosis of OAS; they have a son (6y) with bilateral anophthalmia, ulnar and fibular reduction defects, bowed tibiae, abnormal V th fingers,  fused IVth and Vth metacarpals, absence of Vth toes and metatarsals,  and syndactyly between IInd and IIIrd toes in whom we had diagnosed  OAS. Molecular genetic analysis of the SMOC1 gene confirmed  the diagnosis identifying the homozygous mutation c.395dupA (p. Tyr132fsX1) of which both parents are carriers.At 12 weeks and 1 day of amenorrhea (ultrasound corresponding to  11 +4) the mother underwent CVS for prenatal diagnosis of OAS and  karyotyping. At early morphologic ultrasonography, the lower limbs  were bowed and shortened in length, raising the suspicion of distal lower limb defects. Fetal karyotype resulted normal (46, XY), but mutation analysis of fetal DNA revealed the presence of the SMOC1  mutation in homozygosity. Identification of SMOC1 as causative gene will help defining the clinical picture of OAS.

Confirmation of diagnosis (COD) was therefore carried out on a cohort of embryos following PGH.Over a one year period, 49 CODs were carried out using material collected from embryos 1 to 4 days post biopsy; 9 (18%) were discordant with biopsy diagnosis. One discordance was due to biopsy of a binucleate cell. Of the remaining 8, two were DMD cases with mosaicism for the X chromosome; three CF cases were diagnosed as affected at biopsy, but had a third (low risk) haplotype at COD; two SMA cases gave aneuploid results with affected haplotypes at biopsy, whilst  COD indicated euploid carrier status; one HD case appeared to have monosomy 4 at biopsy, but a normal status at COD. Therefore, these discordances were all likely to be due to mosaicism in the cleavage stage embryos. In only one case (DMD) did COD detect a mutant haplotype not found at biopsy; in this case, the sex chromosome complement was abnormal, and this embryo would therefore not have been considered for transfer. No novel alleles were found in any of these embryos.These data indicate that neither meiotic mutation nor PCR slippage is likely to compromise PGH diagnosis.",2011

Abnormal QF PCR results were always followed up by karyotyping.We received 95 fetal samples. In 63/95 (66%), QF/array analysis was requested: 18/63 (29%) were abnormal with QF PCR, the remaining samples were array analysed. Although this revealed no clinically relevant abnormalities, we detected one paternally inherited gain in 16p13.11 (susceptibility locus), six inherited CNVs and one large contiguous stretch of homozygosity.

Alternatively, as results were mostly available within 10 days and SNP array analysis involves a complete genome analysis with no additional tests needed, one can also opt for implementing the QF/array strategy for all fetuses with structural ultrasound anomalies.",2011

We assigned PUAs to 8 organ specific categories  and the impact of quantitative and qualitative subgroup involvement was analyzed. A pathologic karyotype was found in 18.6% of these pregnancies. An almost linear increase of chromosomal abnormalities with the number of PUAs was found with up to 56% chromosomal abnormality rate when 5 or more PUAs were present. Multiple subgroup involvement showed even higher rates (62%). Single detected PUAs within the subgroups were qualitatively analyzed and the highest incidence of pathologic karyotypes was found amongst single detected hygromas  or hydrops (39%). Single detected PUAs in all other subgroups were only rarely associated with a chromosomal abnormality (2.4%). The most frequent, single reported PUAs were choroid plexus cysts and ventriculomegaly with less than 1% chromosomal abnormality rate. Due to the high impact of the number of detected PUAs and the number of affected organ systems on chromosomal abnormality rates any detection of PUAs should lead to an extensive screening for further fetal anomalies. If certain abnormalities such as choroid plexus cysts and ventriculomegaly are found solitarily, the risk for chromosomal abnormalities remains low.",2011

In this study, we report  our experience of dual prenatal testing with QF PCR and karyotype analysis in 13,500 cases. The main aim of the study is to examine the detection rate of clinically significant chromosomal abnormalities by QF PCR compared to karyotype analysis and assess the necessity of dual prenatal testing in all cases, regardless indications of referral. The rates of concordant results between the two methods were evaluated. Abnormal karyotype was found in 325 out of 13,500 cases (2.4%). From these, QF PCR did not detect the abnormality in 70 cases (21.5%), while 34 (10.5%) had a high or unknown risk of adverse outcome.  By selectively applying dual testing only at cases with ultrasound findings and/or genetic history, 20 out of these 34 would have been correctly diagnosed. Selective dual testing would lead to prenatal diagnosis of normal and high risk abnormal karyotypes in 13,483 out of the 13,500 pregnancies (99.87%). Our study strengthens the shift towards selective dual testing in the presence of ultrasound findings and/or genetic history, and QF PCR as stand alone test for the rest of the cases.

The diagnosis of Î² thalassemia relies on measuring red blood cell  indices that reveal microcytic hypochromic anemia, nucleated red blood cells on peripheral blood smear, hemoglobin analysis that reveals decreased amounts of HbA and increased amounts of HbF after age 12 months, and the clinical severity of anemia. Molecular  genetic testing of the gene encoding the hemoglobin subunit beta (HBB) is available in our laboratory and may be useful for predicting the clinical phenotype in some cases as well as presymptomatic diagnosis of at risk family members and prenatal diagnosis.Prenatal diagnosis is possible when both parents are carriers.Our protocol consists in: Fetal DNA extraction from chorionic villi sampling at 11 12 weeksâ gestation; detection of parental mutations with Reverse Dot Blot Analysis (RDB) and/or direct sequencing; the potential presence of maternal cell contamination (MCC) in fetal  samples is detected by Quantitative Fluorescent Polimerase Chain Reaction (QF PCR).Here we report a case of prenatal diagnosis in which both parents were carriers of the nonsense mutation Codon39. The fetus resulted heterozygote Codon 39. QF PCR showed no MCC but revealed a missing paternal correlation for the microsatellite D18S386. Fetal and parental samples underwent array Comparative Genomic  Hybridization (aCGH) to detect a possible microdeletion in that locus. This analysis confirmed a 147 kb deletion at 18q22.3 in the propositus inherited from the father, and so we can exclude any patological meaning. The QF PCR test could allow not only identification of MCC in the fetal material but also detection of chromosome rearrangements (13,18, 21 and sexual chromosome).",2011

Rapid aneuploidy testing in prenatal diagnosis using MLPA or QF PCR  with markers for the chromosomes 13, 18, 21 and XY is now being widely used. Arguments for using these tests are the short reporting time, high throughput and low costs. Additionally, unexpected findings as seen in full karyotyping and leading to difficult counselling issues,  which cause anxiety for the parents, can be avoided. The tests may be used in combination with karyotyping or as a standalone test for specific indications such as advanced maternal age or increased risk for Down syndrome.In 2010 a total of 397 amniotic fluid samples were analysed in our laboratory with QF PCR, using Aneufast kit S1/S2 and M13, M18, M21 and MXY (Genomed Ltd, Kent, UK), followed by karyotyping. QF PCR yielded unexpected findings in two cases: in one case the two most distal markers on the long arm of chromosome 18 were trisomic. Additional  karyotyping showed an unbalanced translocation (47,XX,+der(9)t(9;18)). The second case showed a mosaic 46,XX/46,XY, but no peak was seen for the SRY marker. Karyotyping showed a 45,X cell line and a cell line with an additional small derivative Y chromosome. We report two cases of unexpected findings with QF PCR in prenatal diagnosis. We conclude that, when offering QF PCR as a standalone test, unexpected findings are not completely excluded and should be discussed with the patient. In a minority of cases, full karyotyping will  still be necessary to enable appropriate prenatal counselling on the significance of the QF PCR results.",2011

Reciprocal translocations may be associated with infertility in some carriers, while all carriers have reproductive risks due  to abnormal segregation of the translocation chromosomes at meiosis, resulting in sperm or eggs with chromosome imbalance.We present three types of unbalanced reciprocal translocations detected prenatally using G banding, fluorescent in situ hybridization  and spectral karyotyping. The first two cases represent partial monosomy 4q and partial trisomy 4q due to a balanced translocation 4q;21p in the mother. Isolated 4q duplications result in variable clinical features, often including growth and developmental delay and dysmorphic appearance. Patients with 4q terminal deletions share  enough similarities to represent an identifiable phenotype. Findings in these patients include craniofacial anomalies, congenital heart and genitourinary defects, moderate to severe mental retardation, poor postnatal growth, and hypotonia. In third case we report an unbalanced segregation of a maternal translocation t(3;8)(p26;p22) causing partial trisomy 3p/partial monosomy 8p.

There are described in the literature recurrent deletions of a region of 8p23.1 which are associated with congenital heart defects.Couples carrying reciprocal translocations may request preimplantation genetic diagnosis in order to select embryos with no genetic imbalance and hence increase their chances of a successful pregnancy.Prenatal and perinatal genetics184",2011

In ~1 2% of cases, discrepancy in the phenotypical typing of rare D alleles may occur, and a molecular analysis of the RHD genotype is therefore required. From  January 2003 to July 2010 more than 2,000 blood samples presenting  ambiguity for D phenotype by routine serologic analyses were collected in laboratories from the French Blood Centre (Etablissement FranÃ§ais du Sang) in several French regions. Since the amplification of RHD exon 10 could not be achieved by a conventional PCR method  in 56 blood samples, we designed a protocol to investigate the region that was suspected to be deleted. We report the identification of a 5.4 kb microdeletion in all samples, including the whole sequence of exon 10, which contains the stop codon. Although the transcript  that is generated is suspected to be aberrant and thus degraded, a substantial amount of protein appears to be biosynthesized and some antigens may be partly recognized by anti D specific antibodies, then potentially conferring a weak D phenotype. This finding raises the question of noninvasive method for fetal RHD typing by amplification of exon 10, which is supposed to be negative while an aberrant, antigenic protein is nonetheless produced. Subsequent molecular analyses are currently in progress to investigate whether this haplotype derives from a common ancestor, or if the breakpoint is a mutation hotspot.",2011

Background: Detection of cell free fetal DNA in maternal circulation,  the new non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) approach, raised the challenge of finding safer methods for prenatal diagnosis.We report the first study of non invasive fetal RHD genotyping performed in Romania. Objective: The prenatal diagnosis procedures currently employed in Romania are based exclusively on invasive sampling procedures of fetal cells. Our aim was to develop a protocol for non invasive fetal RHD genotyping in pregnancies at risk: the pregnant woman is RhD negative and her partner is RhD positive.Methods: We developed a three step method for fetal RHD genotyping and we tested 56 pregnant RhD negative women with RhD positive partners. The cell free total DNA extraction was performed from 1ml maternal plasma using the QIAampÂ® DSP Virus kit with some  adjustments to the standard QIAGEN protocol. We performed the fetal RHD genotyping using a commercial 2x multiplex PCR master mix and specific primers for two sequences in the exon 5 and respectively exon 7 of the RHD gene. We also included the beta globin sequence detection as internal control. The PCR products were automated analyzed by high resolution capillary electrophoresis.Results: We detected 39 fetuses with RHD positive genotype and 17 fetuses with RHD negative genotype. All 56 cases were analyzed in triplicate and the results were confirmed by the invasive method.Conclusion: Our results confirm that this non invasive approach is feasible and accurate and improve the management of mother fetus RhD incompatibility and isoimmunization by eliminating the invasive procedure for fetal RHD genotyping.",2011

Marie, caucasian, 5th pregnancy, presents a poly   alloimmunization already known during a previous pregnancy: a non  evolutive anti RH1 + an anti RH2+ an anti JK1.   fetal RHD genotyping in maternal plasma performed at 23 weeks and  33 weeks show an amplification of exon 10, but no amplification of exons 4 and 5.   Maternal buffy coat showed no amplification.   It may be  a partial D inherited his African father (RHD gene no analyzed) .   The birth takes place at 37 weeks: at birth, the child has no anemia,  moderate hyperbilirubinemia quickly contained by phototherapy, no transfusion was necessary.   Results and hypothesis: the direct antiglobulin test is positive at  birth.   Elution test finds the presence of anti RH2, anti JK1 and anti  RH1 while the newborn is Rh:  1.2 and JK: 1.   The sequencing of the  RHD gene shows an aspect of partial D associated with a deletion of  some exons: how is the expression profile?   It may be a nonfunctional  gene and anti RH1 found in the eluate is present in the free state, in the close environment of the erythrocyte (Matuhasi Ogata phenomenon). Conversely, in case of a gene with partial antigen expression, the result of RH1 phenotype at birth may be due to saturation of antigenic sites by corresponding antibodies.   Conclusion: a new sample a few month after birth would confirm its  RH1 phenotype.",2011
 Fetal RHD genotyping in maternal plasma: Detection of variantsforms,P05.46,"S. MONNIER, E. GUINCHARD","EFS RhÃ´ne Alpes site de Lyon GHE, 69677 BRON Cedex, France","Background and aims: the prenatal determination of fetal RH1  represents an important tool to guide the management of pregnancy in severe maternal alloimmunization context or to indicate an immunoprophylaxis during pregnancy of non anti RH1 allo immunized women.   Normal and partial RH:1 phenotype can induce or re activate an anti  RH1 allo immunization: Itâs therefore important to detect wild and  variant forms of RHD gene, this capacity is determined by the choice of primers and probes.   Methodology: exons 4, 5 and 10 of RHD gene are analysed on free  fetal DNA containing maternal plasma after 10 weeks of pregnancy by quantitative real time PCR using TaqMan technology.Variant forms are suspected if non homogeneous amplifications of the three exons are observed, like the pseudogene Î¨ by Africans.  Buffy coat of one or the two parents are tested following the Ct values obtained by fetal genotyping. Variant RHD gene can be sequenced to study its functionality.Results: all variant forms of RHD gene found in our laboratory show amplification of at least one but not the three tested exons.Conclusions and prospects: buffy coat amplification profile of a few blood donnors in RhÃ´ne Alpes with sequenced variant forms of RHD gene are currently studied to verify the specificity of the method.",2011

The examination at 26 weeks of gestation showed severe intrauterine growth retardation. The suspicion of Seckel syndrome was raised, corroborating the growth parameter data with the typical facial signs: beak like protrusion of  nose and micrognathia.A male infant was delivered by caesarian section at 40 weeks of gestation, with weight of 1520 g; length of 39 cm; cranial circumference of 26 cm. On examination we noticed characteristic narrow face, receding forehead, large eyes, prominent beaked nose, micrognathia, low set ears. Other manifestations were: closed anterior and posterior fontanelles, clinodactyly of fifth finger, supernumerary nipple on the left side and criptorchidism. Thoracic X ray showed only 11 ribs, while cranial X ray revealed sinostosys of sagittal and metopic sutures.  MRI revealed smaller cerebral hemisphere volume, enlarged lateral ventricles, cerebellar hypoplasia .

Two mechanisms account for 70% of SRS cases: hypomethylation of 11p15.5 imprinting center region 1 (ICR1) and maternal uniparental disomy for chromosome 7 (matUPD7). Prenatal  diagnosis is possible only for matUPD7.We report the antenatal and postnatal data of three unrelated cases of SRS. Pregnancy was marked by asymmetric IUGR sparing the head at 22 weeks of gestation (WG) with normal prenatal karyotype. Cesarean section delivery was induced due to cessation of fetal growth at 32 WG (case 1) and at 30 WG (case 2) while case 3 was stillbirth at 27 WG. Postnatal echocardiography detected blocked supracardiac total anomalous pulmonary venous return (TAPVR) in case 1 and hypoplastic aortic arch and cardiac TAPVR in case 2. Both  died shortly after birth. Autopsy (refused in case 1) findings were: multivisceral hypoplasia (case 2), genital and extremity anomalies (case 3). Hypomethylation of ICR1 11p15.5 was identified in the three cases and confirmed the clinically suspected diagnosis of SRS.SRS should be considered in cases with second trimester asymmetric IUGR sparing the head. Notably, the association of SRS and lethal cardiopathies is rarely reported. Either they represent two distinct pathologies or SRS might be underdiagnosed when associated with lethal cardiopathies. Finally, IUGR, cardiopathies and prematurity led to death of cases (1 and 2). Should premature delivery in SRS be avoided to improve prognosis?

Sirenomelia is usually sporadic, and monozygotic twins are usually discordant (Stocker, 1987). Familial recurrence of sirenomelia is exceptional, with only one family reported, with two sirenomelic sibs, another with renal agenesis and the last with  imperforate anus (Rudd and Klimek, 1990). In monozygotic twinning, concordant twins have been described (Roberge, 1963), and semi concordants (Martinelli et al., 1982; Akbiyik et al., 2000). Sirenomelia with renal and anal anomalies in other siblings has been described once (Selig et al., 1993). We report two additional families. In the first family, the mother was operated of a short form of imperforate anus. Her first pregnancy was terminated because of presence of bilateral renal agenesis with anamnios. Her second pregnancy was interrupted because of sirenomelia. The second family was referred  because of the occurrence of caudal malformation in their two children. Parents have normal X rays of the spine. The first pregnancy gave birth to a girl with imperforate anus. X rays showed absent S3 S5 and coccyx. CT scan of the pelvis showed abnormal pelvic floor with poor musculature, mostly fibrous fatty content without tendinous attachments. The bladder was very anterior and almost bifid inferiorly. A bifid uterus was present. The second pregnancy gave birth to a baby girl with sirenomelia. No diabetes were present in the pregnancies.

 A case of co inheritance of alpha and beta thalassaemia with almost normal haematological indices: an alert for carrier screening,P05.51,"E. Boutou , A. Balassopoulou, E. Voskaridou","Laiko Hospital, Athens, Greece","Thalassaemias are a group of monogenic disorders characterized by  reduction of one or more globin chain synthesis.Prevention of haemoglobinopathies, mainly through prenatal diagnosis, is the major strategy against expansion of the disease. Prevention is based upon carrier identification based on red cell indices and HbA2  values. The high incidence of Î±  and Î²  thalassemia traits in Greece often results in co inheritance of both mutant aplotypes. In practically all cases, the haematological phenotype of a double heterozygote for both Î±  and Î² thalassemia is similar to the one of a Î² thalassemia carrier except from an increase in MCV values.We present here a quite interesting rare case of an Î±  and Î² thalassemia carrier whose erythrocyte indices are far from characteristic of the Prenatal and perinatal genetics186 underlying beta globin gene mutation. An adult pregnant female  was screened for thalassaemia and presented the following values: Hb:11,7g/dL; HCT:34,6%; RBC:4,29x10 6/ml; MCV:80,7fL;  MCH:27,3pg and HbA2:4,1%. Subsequent molecular genetic analysis,  due to the increased HbA2, revealed that the individual was a double  heterozygote for both Î±  and Î² thalassemia (beta globin gene: IVS 1 6 T >C substitution and alpha globin gene locus:  Î±3.7 deletion). Occasionally, carriers of IVS I 6 and IVS I 110 with only mild reduction in MCV and MCH values have been observed. In such cases, co  inheritance of a thalassaemia, as in the herein reported case, might further improve erythrocyte indices, near to normal, a fact which increases the risk for misdiagnosis. In conclusion, we propose that in similar cases identification of the underlying mutations is mandatory in order to avoid misdiagnosis.",2011

Thalassemia has high burden on health resources and has raised the need to adopt community based prevention program. This may include public awareness, population screening,  genetic counseling, and PND to reduce the incidence of thalassemia. Establishment of a comprehensive screening and prevention program faces many problems when prenatal diagnosis and termination of pregnancy is not permitted or financial resources are limited. In Iran, National Program for the Prevention of Thalassemia was implemented in 1997. This led to a sharp drop on the birth of affected children with thalassemia and sickle cell disease during the past 13 years by providing help to those couples who were both carriers. After this experience, Jordan, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain implemented  similar programs for thalassemia and SCD in 2001, 2002 and 2004 respectively. UAE and Oman are taking similar measures. Program in SA and Bahrain lacks prenatal diagnosis component, therefore one does not expect sharp drop in the birth of affected children unless carrier couples are guided to go to other countries for therapeutic abortions. In SA, in 1990, a Fatwa âallows termination of pregnancy in the first 120 days after conception if the fetus is shown beyond doubt to be affected with severe malformation that is not amenable to treatment.â Bahraini government also has stated that they have noticed sharp drop on the birth of SCD after the implementation of the program.",2011

While there is phenotypic overlap between the various members of each group, the two groups were considered to be separate with the former being strictly a structural skeletal condition and the latter group being confined to the nervous system. We report here on fetal akinesia as the presenting feature of severe metatropic dysplasia, suggesting that certain TRPV4 mutations can cause both a skeletal and a neuropathic phenotype.Case 1 was diagnosed at week 20 with short limbs, absence of limb movements, elbow pterygia, and finger contractures. Cases 2 and 3  (twins) were observed to have short limbs with arthrogryposis and akinesia at week 20. Both pregnancies were interrupted and fetal radiographs suggested metatropic dysplasia. Case 4 presented with joint contractures and absent limb movements at birth; skeletal survey showed typical features of metatropic dysplasia. The baby died of respiratory complications at age 4 months. Sequencing of the TRPV4 gene confirmed the presence of de novo heterozygous mutations predicting G78W (case 1), T740I (cases 2 and 3), and K276E (case 4). Although some degree of restriction of movements is not uncommon in  fetuses with skeletal dysplasia, akinesia as leading sign is unusual and may indicate that certain TRPV4 mutations produce a severe âoverlapâ phenotype.Prenatal and perinatal genetics187",2011

Hemophilia A (HA) is an X  linked coagulation disorder with a world   wide incidence of approximately 1 in every 5000 males. Almost half of the patients with severe HA have large inversions that disrupt either intron 22 (Inv22) or intron 1 (Inv1) of the factor VIII (F8) gene. The identification of carriers and the prenatal diagnosis of Inv22 and Inv1  have greatly improved with new strategies. Recently, inverse shifting PCR (IS PCR) has been developed as a new diagnostic test. Here we report the reproducibility of the modified method in prenatal diagnosis of Inv22 in an obligate carrier with a male fetus at 13 weeks of gestation. After determination the carrier status of the mother, genomic DNA of chorionic villus sample (CVS) was dissected and extracted according to standard protocols. Genomic DNA was digested by BclI, followed by self ligation to create BclI circles. PCR was performed on circular genomic DNA. Our results confirmed Inv 22 is responsible for  the disease in the family and fetus was normal.

The isolation of umbilical cord stem cells is of great value for treatment of several disease/disorders. These cells are unique because they can be expanded to therapeutically relevant numbers and cryopreserved for different uses. Cord blood collections from full term and babies range from 70 130 mL. Umbilical cord blood stem cells have now been  used in more than 10,000 transplants as an alternative to hematopoietic stem cells. The parentâs blood is tested for infectious diseases. The cord blood unit is delivered to the cord blood bank. Once stored, it is available for a transplant for the child or donated to a patient if he is a match. But many genetic disorders such as balanced translocation are not observed in the beginning or even in the whole life span. This type of umbilical cord stem cells if used in transplant can result in a severe and hazardous effects on the patient. Karyotyping is a test to examine chromosomes in a sample of cells, which can help identify genetic  problems. So this type of abnormalities can be prevented from being transferred, by making karyotyping mandatory. Many parents do not consider prenatal karyotyping as it is dangerous for child so at lest it should be made mandatory during blood banking or after birth.",2011

Background: Drug resistance is still a great obstacle to the success treatment of breast cancer. The Multi Drug Resistance Related Protein1 (MRP1) is a member of the ABC transporter that located on chromosome 16p13 and transports a wide range of compounds  including glutathione conjugates and cyclic nucleotides out of cellsIn this study we attempted to investigate the possible correlation between MRP1 and clinical response in patients with colorectal cancer (CRC).Materials and Methods: Tumor and adjacent normal tissues from 60 Iranian patients with colorectal cancer were assessed for the expression level of MRP1 by Real Time RT PCR.Sixty CRC patients were enrolled in this study. The project was approved by the local ethical committee of National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB) and written informed consent was obtained from all cases. Tissue specimens (tumor and normal tissue adjacent to tumor) were collected from Hazrat Rasool hospital between 2008and September 2010, Histological diagnosis was confirmed for all samples.Results: No statistically significant increase in MRP1 expression level was observed when tumor tissues were compared with normal tissues. Furthermore, The MRP1 expression was also independent of the age and sex of the patients, localization and size of the primary  tumor, tumor infiltration of the lymph nodes, distant metastases and histological grading.Conclusion: Our results suggest that MRP1 unlikely have an affect the clinical response to treatment in CRC patients.",2011

TNF can be produced by tumor infiltrating macrophages and by several types of animal and human cancers (e.g. ovarian and colorectal cancers, melanoma and hematological malignancies). Since TNF  are potent controllers of cell functions, it would be of interest to demonstrate that deregulation of TNF Î± production in ALL patients in genetically determined and therefore might be a contributing factor in the pathophysiology of lymphoproliferative disease.A common genetic polymorphism in the TNF gene  G308A is associated with greater susceptibility to various carcinomas. Guanine to adenine transition at the  308 site in the TNF promoter region (TNF A allele) and LTÎ± +250 have both been associated with variable TNFÎ± secretion after different stimulations, with increased levels associated with the  allele A, at both sites. We investigated a possible association of TNF polymorphisms G308A, and increased risk for acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).

Arsenic trioxide as a single agent factor (without chemotherapy) is the treatment of choice for APL patients; it induces cell death through apoptosis but  the mechanism by which arsenic targets apoptosis and dramatically affects gene expression remains poorly understood. Since arsenic is used as first line treatment in Iran, it is worth investigating its effect on expression of genes involved in APL.Materials and Methods: In this descriptive study, to understand  the underlying mechanisms of cell death induction by arsenic, we treated NB4 cell line in a dose and time dependent manner. Extracting RNA and synthesis of cDNA, gene expression of apoptotic genes in mitochondrial pathway including caspase3, Mcl 1 and Bcl 2 was  analyzed through Real Time PCR.Results: Our findings showed that As 2O3 induced cell death was  paralleled by reduced expression of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl 2 but  the expression of Caspase3 and Mcl 1 did not change after arsenic treatment.Conclusions: These results suggest that changes in Bcl 2 gene  expression may be one of the mechanisms of action of arsenic in  induction of apoptosis, while Caspase3 and Mcl 1 gene expression are not affected by arsenic at the transcriptional level.",2011

Copy number variants (CNVs) have  recently been recognised as important forms of structural variation which also predispose to human disease. It can be hypothesised that  in particular heterozygous microdeletions contribute to the underlying cause in yet unidentified genes responsible for adenomatous polyposis syndromes. m ethods: Genomic DNA from 134 unrelated mutation negative polyposis patients was used for genome wide SNP genotyping with  the HumanOmni1 Quad BeadArray (Illumina). Putative CNVs were identified by the QuantiSNP v2.2 algorithm, filtered according to various criteria by use of the CartageniaBench software, by in silico analysis, and by comparison with 531 healthy controls, and validated by qPCR.Results: 35 unique heterozygous deletion CNVs containing 38 genes could be identified in 33 of 134 patients but not in healthy controls. All CNVs are present only once in the whole cohort; all except two patients harbour just one CNV. 25 genes are partly or completely deleted, in 13 more the deletion affects intronic regions only. Candidate adenoma genes include protein kinases, transcription factors, and potential tumour suppressors. c onclusions:  By applying stringent filter criteria we identified a group  of rare deletions which might contain predisposing genes for adenoma  formation. The further work up will prioritize genes according to gene function and pathway. Promising candidates will be sequenced in all patients to look for germline point mutations.

Microsatellite instability (MSI) is a consequence of a functional  deficiency of the mismatch repair genes, and is a feature of the majority of Lynch syndrome tumors, and of a minority of sporadic colorectal (CRC), gastric and endometrial cancers. Several genes have been described to be target for mutations of the MSI condition. Androgen  Receptor (AR) gene has been involved in colorectal carcinogenesis.We aimed to assess the implication of AR gene in the carcinogenic process of CRC with MSI.We tested 343 sporadic CRC for MSI using five monomorphic mononucleotide markers. Polymorphic CAG repeat at exon 1 of the AR gene was analyzed from the normal and tumoral DNA. HpaII methylation sensitive restriction enzyme, was used to analyze the methylation status of the CAG repeat pattern. Capillary electrophoresis and GeneScan  analysis was used for all these experiments. MSI was present in 31 of the 311 CRC analyzed (10%). Insertion  deletion mutations at CAG repeat were detected in 25 out of 31 MSI tumors (80.6%) and in one of the 40 analyzed microsatellite stable tumors (2.5%) indicating that AR might be a new target gene for MSI  tumors (p<0.001). Interestingly, methylation analysis of MSI tumors with AR mutations showed 17 tumors with hypermethylation of the  mutated alleles and two tumors without methylation (p,0.023). The remaining six cases were considered as non informative.Our results suggests that AR gene is specifically mutated in tumors with MSI and those mutated alleles might be silenced by hypermethylation.

To date, more than 800 different APC germline mutations have been characterized. The high number and distinct spectrum of variations together with gene length make the automated  capillary electrophoresis DNA sequencing the gold standard method to develop an efficient and robust analysis of this gene. We have set up a 3 step workflow to detect mutations in the APC gene in a rapid manner aimed to homogenize and facilitate the experimental work. Step 1: Analysis of 65% of exon 15 in three amplicons (which harbors  the majority of mutations); Step 2: Analysis of 12 amplicons with RSA primers in a 96 well plate; Step 3: Analysis of the remaining sequence (8 amplicons). All sequencing reactions were run in a 3730XL Genetic Analyzer. We have studied 32 individuals; 8 with classical and 24 with an attenuated phenotype. Six germline variants were detected in FAP individuals and 8 in the AFAP families. Of these 7 were pathogenic and the remaining 7 were classified as USV. Ten of the 32 cases were reanalyzed on the newest 3500 Genetic Analyzer showing a perfect concordance regarding mutation detection when compared to the 3730XL analyses.

Induction of apoptosis by DNA damaging agents involves the activation  of mitochondrial apoptotic pathway. Aven has been identified as an antiapoptotic protein and has been shown to activate ATM in response to DNA damage. In this study, we demonstrated that enforced expression of Aven blocks UV irradiation , SN 38  or cisplatin induced  apoptosis upstream of mitochondria by stabilizing Bcl xL protein levels in breast cancer cells. Aven silencing by RNA interference markedly enhanced apoptotic response following treatment with DNA damaging agents. Aven is complexed with Bcl xL in untreated breast cancer cells and treatment with DNA damaging agents led to decreased Aven/Bcl xL interaction. Importantly, Bcl xL was necessary for the prosurvival activity of Aven and depletion of Bcl xL abrogated Aven mediated protection against DNA damage induced apoptosis. Analysis of breast cancer tissue microarrays revealed decreased Aven nuclear  expression in breastcancer tissues compared with non neoplastic breast tissues. In particular, we detected reduced nuclear expression of Aven in infiltrating ductal carcinoma and papillary carcinoma breast cancer subtypes compared with non neoplastic breast tissues and infiltrating lobular breast cancer tissues. Our resultssuggest that Aven is an important mediator in DNA damage induced apoptotic signaling in breastcancer cells and its nuclear expression is altered in breast cancer tissues, which may contribute to genomic instability in breast cancer tumors.",2011

In addition to mutations, other genetic events, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the TP53 gene, have been shown to contribute to the development of various cancers. Hence we hypothesize those polymorphic sites in p53 gene variants at codon 11,  Pro47Ser, codon 248 (exon 7), codon 31 of P21 and P73 exon 2 (GC/AT) may modulate risk for Bladder cancer (BC) progression in North Indians.Materials and Method: Genotyping for these polymorphisms were done in a group of 200 BC and 200 age matched, similar ethnicity unrelated healthy controls using PCR based methods.Results: In P53 codon248 polymorphism, heterozygous genotype showed high risk with BC (p<0.001; OR,1.58). Whereas in case of P73 exon2, variant genotype demonstrated significant risk (p,0.014,  OR,3.80), the tumorigenic effect of which was observed to be more enhanced in case of smoking exposure. Haplotype Glu Pro Trp/Gln was associated with two fold risk (OR, 1.91; p,0.002).

One mechanism allowing tumors to escape from that control is the downregulation or complete loss of MHC class I molecules. Total loss of MHC I expression can be due to  mutations in beta2 microglobulin (b2m) gene located on chromosome 15q21. The b2m protein is noncovalently associated with alpha chain of the MHC I for antigen presentation. When b2m protein is corrupted, or b2m expression is lost, stable antigen MHC I complexes cannot be formed.We analyzed tissue specimens of 50 primary melanomas. The tissue microdissection technique was applied to obtain DNA from the tumors. DNA from microdissected tumor tissues was obtained using phenol chloroform method. The technique of single strand conformation  polymorphism (SSCP) was used to screen 50 melanoma samples, and 172 normal DNA samples for mutations in the b2m. The leader peptide sequence/exon 1 and exon 2 PCR products were analyzed.Our results exclude any homozygotic/heterozygotic nucleotide change in exons 1 and 2 of b2m in 172 healthy controls.

Occupational exposure to carcinogens and cigarette smoking are among  the most significant risk factors for bladder cancer. Polymorphisms in genes coding for the xenobiotic metabolizing enzymes may affect the relevant enzyme activity and therefore cause inter individual metabolic differences. Aldo keto reductases (AKR) are highly polymorphic  phase I drug metabolizing enzymes, which are involved in tobacco carcinogenesis. AKR 1C family member 3 (AKR1C3) is one of the four known human AKR1C enzymes. The polymorphisms in the AKR1C3 gene may lead to changes in its expression or enzyme activity. When considered together with certain demographic and environmental factors, AKR1C3 genetic polymorphisms possibly define the levels of individual susceptibility to bladder cancer.In this study, the effect of the rs12529, a non synonymous polymorphism of the AKR1C3 gene, on the susceptibility to bladder cancer was  investigated in conjunction with cigarette smoking and sex. Using genotype data of 101 bladder cancer cases and 101 healthy controls, we demonstrated that men (OR,9,032; %95 CI,4,308 18,938) and cigarette smokers (OR,4,89; %95 CI ,2,617 8,963) are under high risk for developing bladder cancer and that rs12529 homozygote variant (GG) has a protective effect (OR,0,255; %95 CI, 0,101 0,644) when compared with the wild type homozygote (CC). The protective effect of the GG genotype becomes more apparent when the odds ratio is adjusted for cigarette smoking and sex (OR,0,243; %95 CI,0,743 0,8).

Our laboratory investigates in vitro effect of  hemocyanins derived from species Helix lucorum (HlH) and Rapana venosa (RvH), and their potential clinical use in comparison to KLH.Three structural subunits were isolated from HlH and two from RvH. Each subunit contains 8 functional units with mass ~50 kDa.The anti tumor effect was investigated on 647 V bladder tumor cell line and results suggest a direct cytotoxicity mainly from functional units. Gene expression profiling of the two pathways: Human Inflammatory cytokines (PAHS011) and Signal transduction pathway (PAHS014) on the tumor cells before and after hemocyanins treatment was  performed.Results suggest upregulation of genes for IL1A, IL1B, IL8 and C3 in Group1 G1 (cell line treated with Hlh Fu 7). IL1A and IL1B were significantly overexpressed compared to Group G2 (cell line treated with RvH II 6).

In our study, we estimated the proportion of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers among women  with triple negative breast cancer.BRCA1 screening of 109 patients who were diagnosed with triple negative breast cancer was performed in our laboratory. These patients were divided into 4 groups:I. Patients with family history of breast/ovarian cancer or bilateral breast/ovarian cancer patientsII. Early onset sporadic unilateral breast cancer patients diagnosed before 40 years of ageIII. Patients with medullary type of breast cancer diagnosed after 40  years of ageIV. Sporadic breast cancer patients diagnosed after 40 years of ageThere were identified 43 mutations (68.3%) in the first group, 6 mutations (23.1%) in the second group, one mutation (25%) in the third group and 5 mutations (15.2%) in the fourth group (overall 50,5%).In addition there was performed BRCA2 screening of 93 patients out of group I III with the result: four mutations (6.4%) were identified in the first group, two mutations (7.7%) in the second group and no mutation in the third group.Our results confirm that women with triple negative breast cancer are candidates for genetic testing of BRCA1 gene, especially those with family history.

We analyzed 53 VUS of BRCA1 or BRCA2, detected in consecutive molecular screenings, by using 5  splicing prediction programs and we classified them into two groups  according to the strength of the predictions. In parallel, we tested them by using splicing minigene assays. Ten VUS were predicted by two or more programs to induce a significant reduction of splice site strength, or activation of cryptic splice sites, or generation of new splice sites. Minigene based splicing assays confirmed 4 of these predictions. Five additional VUS, all at internal exon positions, were not predicted to induce alterations of splice sites, but revealed variable levels of exon skipping, most likely induced by the modification of exonic splicing regulatory elements. We provide new data in favor of the pathogenic  nature of the variants BRCA1 c.212+3A>G and BRCA1 c.5194  12G>A, which induced aberrant out of frame mRNA forms. Moreover, the novel variant BRCA2 c.7977 7C>G induced in frame inclusion of  6 nt from the 3â end of intron 17. The novel variants BRCA2 c.520C>T  and BRCA2 c7992T>A induced incomplete but strong skipping of  exons 7 and 18, respectively. We confirm the sensitivity of current algorithms for detecting VUS that induce changes of splice site strength or generate/activate new splice sites.

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are major cancer predisposition genes, responsible for a large percentage of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families. Screening for mutations in these genes is now standard practice for HBOC cases in Europe, and permits medical follow up and genetic counselling adapted to the needs of individuals  in such families.Currently, most laboratories performing diagnostic analysis of the BRCA genes use PCR of exons and intron exon boundaries coupled to a pre screening step to identify anomalous amplicons. The techniques employed for the detection of mutations and polymorphisms have evolved over time and vary in sensitivity, specificity and cost effectiveness.Recognising that direct sequencing is too expensive for us to apply systematically to all HBOC families for the foreseeable future, we  turned to the recently developed Surveyor TM heteroduplex cleavage  method as a sensitive and specific technique to reveal anomalous  amplicons of the BRCA genes, using only basic laboratory equipment and agarose gel electrophoresis.We managed to detect by this technique 3 BRCA deleterious  mutations, as well as 2 unclassified sequence variants (UVs) and 3 common SNPs. All variants were confirmed by forward and reverse dideoxy sequencing. We recommend therefore heteroduplex analysis (HA) by mismatch specific endonuclease as a sensitive pre screening method to precede systematic sequencing. Together with other alternative techniques, HA allows us now to save about 30% of BRCA sequencing costs, and certainly can do even better.This study was possible with partial financial support from the Romanian Ministry for Education and Research, by the CNCSIS  research grant PN II ID PCE 2008, code 1990/2008.",2011

Soon after clinical testing for BRCA mutations became available, a flurry of publications compared the histological characteristics and prognostic marker status of breast cancers in patients with BRCA 1 vs. BRCA 2 vs. BRCA X  (negative) patients. Invasive ductal cancer with medullary features and âtriple negativeâ (for ER, PR and Her2/neu expression) prognostic marker status are considered suggestive of BRCA associated breast cancer. The next wave of publications was epidemiological, whereas the current focus is molecular profiling of breast cancers for somatic mutations. In the interim, histology and prognostic markers have been displaced as major determinates in genetic risk assessment. We recently suggested that lobular histology is rarely, if at all, linked to BRCA mutations (DeLozier et. al., 2010). Our experience also  suggests that her2/neu overexpression at initial diagnosis may be an important negative predictor of BRCA status. We have counseled and tested 185 patients with invasive breast cancer at significant risk of carrying a BRCA mutation, for whom histology and prognostic marker information were available/adequate and for whom BRCA results were unequivocal. Of these 185 patients, 35 (19%) had Her2/neu overexpression as diagnosed by immunohistochemistry (IHC) and/or FISH assays. Twenty five patients (13.5%) were BRCA positive, but none of the Her2/neu positive patients had BRCA mutations, in spite of an average age at diagnosis of <40. If confirmed in larger studies, Her2/neu positivity might constitute a cost effective means of screening prior to the offering of BRCA testing.",2011

There are many different techniques for mutation scanning: (1) a prescreen that detects but does not characterize variants, and (2) the industry standard technique: direct sequence  analysis of the DNA by Sanger sequencing. Here we describe the development and verification of a direct resequencing workflow for mutation screening of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes on the 3500 Genetic Analyzer .This workflow contains all steps, from purified DNA to data analysis covering both genes, PCR cleanup, cycle sequencing, electrophoresis and data analysis. To simplify workflows and decrease time to result, we focused on a robust assay based on a âone individual   one testâ approach. Key to the success of this workflow was the 96 well plate design, which contained pre spotted PCR primers covering  both genes and also included multiplex non template controls. Finally the use of the new developed BigDyeÂ® Direct Cycle Sequencing chemistry eliminates the need for a separate PCR clean up step. This simplified process without a separate PCR clean up step reduced the overall workflow time by 40%.

The carriers of these mutations have a high risk, between 40 and 80%, to develop breast cancer. However, the number of women in the general population with breast cancer attributable to these mutations is very small (<5%), which is raising the possibility that there may  be low penetrance mutations in these genes that could change the susceptibility to breast cancer.There are several mutations in BRCA1 gene that appear frequently in the population (polymorphisms). We showed more attention to the group of missense mutations in exon 11 (including c.2731 C> T [rs799917], c. 3232 A> G [rs16941] and c. 3667 A> G [rs16942] that cause changes amino acid (p. 871 P> L, p. 1038 E> G and p. 1183 E> G).In this study, we hypothesized that clustering of mutations in exon 11  of BRCA1 gene may modify the risk of developing breast cancer in our population.The analysis of the distribution of these polymorphisms in patients diagnosedwith breast cancer, carrying mutations in one of the BRCA genes, showed that the TGG alleles are inherited together as a haplotype.Statistical analysis of results shows that there is a statistically significant relationship between the group of patients with familial breast cancer carriers of BRCA gene mutations and the presence of the haplotype TGG.",2011

The genetic alterations were not found in  patients without a family history of breast cancer. One patient with a family history of five breast cancer cases harbored a germ line mutation in the BRCA1 gene, that was a novel intronic BRCA1 mutation (IVS7+34_47delTTCTTTTCTTTTTT). In addition, two unclassified intronic BRCA1 variations (IVS7+34_47delAAGAAAAGAAAAAA in the  antisense strand and IVS7+50_63delTTCTTTTTTTTTTT in the sense strand) and one unclassified intronic point mutation (IVS7+38T>C) were also identified in the patientâs healthy daughter at the age of 25. RNA analysis of variants of unknown significance revealed a normally  occurring splicing process. These alterations were not found in family members or unrelated healthy volunteers. Of further interest, was that the deletion site was in close proximity to the triplet repeat sequence of TTCÂ·GAA. The deletion of a set of TTC repeats was identified both in the patient and the patientâs healthy daughter.

Using a murine model of familial pancreatic cancer that accurately recapitulates the clinical, histological and molecular features of the human disease, we find  that germline heterozygosity for a pathogenic Brca2 mutation suffices to promote pancreatic ductal adenocarcinomas (PDACs) driven by Kras(G12D), irrespective of Trp53 status. Unexpectedly, tumour cells retain a functional Brca2 allele. Correspondingly, three out of four PDACs from patients inheriting the founder 999del5 mutation in BRCA2 did not exhibit loss of heterozygosity (LOH). On the other hand, three tumours from these patients with confirmed LOH were acinar carcinomas, normally a rare pancreatic neoplasm. Acinar carcinomas were also observed solely in mice bi allelic Brca2 inactivation in the  context of mutant Trp53(R270H) expression.

We have selected 95 BC cases, which showed accumulation of clinical signs of the genetic disease (e.g., occurrence of BC among multiple relatives and/or  bilaterality and/or young age), but could not be explained by BRCA1/BRCA2 alterations or recurrent mutations in CHEK2 (c.1100delC, c.444+1G>A, del5395) or NBN (c.657_661delACAAA) genes. The analysis of coding regions was performed using HRM (high resolution melting) followed by DNA sequencing. First, we considered the extended study for the CHEK2 and NBN: these genes are well known for the founder BC predisposing mutations, but, surprisingly, they have not been subjected to a systematic full length screen. However, no novel mutations in CHEK2 or NBN have been detected  in our series. Next, we investigated the PALB2, BRIP1, BARD1, and RAD51C. These genes were shown to cause familial BC in selected publications, but their global wide relevance remains to be evaluated. We have identified 2 instances of the PALB2 mutation (p.R414X, p.Q921X) in bilateral BC cases. We then continued the analysis of other genes involved in double strand break DNA repair; by the time of abstract submission, the CHEK1, PARP1, PARP2, ERCC1, XPE, BLM, BRD7, RNF8, RAD51A, and FANCG have been investigated.

We performed mutational analysis in 350 index patients. Mutation detection was performed with High resolution melting curve analysis (HRMCA), followed by Sanger sequencing of the aberrant melting curves.Besides frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms and some novel, rare variants of which the clinical significance is currently under evaluation, we did not identify any deleterious mutation. To increase the number of probands to a similar number as in the initial report, we screened 100 additional families with HRMCA. Sequencing analysis of the fragments with aberrant melting curves is currently ongoing.We are the first group to investigate a cohort of breast and ovarian  cancer families of comparable size as Meindl et al., and based on their findings, we had expected to detect at least three deleterious mutations. As other studies on (male) breast cancer families also did not identify deleterious germline RAD51C  mutations, these may be  less frequent than initially reported.",2011

In addition we found one rare missense alteration in codon 1915(C>T) leading to replacement of Thr with Met in three patients   one with early onset and two with  strong family history of the disease. Conclusions:  Protein truncating  mutations of BRCA2 are usually deleterious and increase the risk of breast cancer up to 80% over a lifetime. The mutations discovered in the studied Bulgarian breast cancer patients were previously observed in other European populations. It has been known that 6174delT founder mutation occurs very frequently (1.5%) among Ashkenazi Jews, but also appears in non Jewish individuals from Europe, Canada etc. The Thr1915Met polymorphism (European population diversity C/T 6.4%) is a common variant in Poland that increases the risk of DCIS with micro invasion. Further analysis of the other BRCA2 exons is necessary in order to ascertain the full spectra of the BRCA2 mutations in the Bulgarian breast cancer patients.",2011

To evaluate whether CHEK2 mutation testing may be useful in clinical practice. PATIENTS AND METHODS: 7,494 BRCA1 mutation negative breast cancer patients and 7,217 controls were genotyped for four founder mutations in CHEK2 (del5395, IVS2+1G>A, 1100delC, I157T). Odds ratios were constructed for the cases, subdivided by the number of breast cancer cases reported in first and second degree relatives.RESULTS: A truncating mutation (IVS2+1G>A or 1100delC or del5395) was present in 227 (3.0%) cases and in 70 (1.0%) controls (OR , 3.0; 95% CI , 2.4 to 4.2). The OR was higher for women with a first  or second degree relative with breast cancer (OR , 4.4; 95% CI , 3.1   6.2) than for women with no family history (OR , 2.9; 95%CI , 2.2   3.8). If both a first  and second degree relative was affected with breast cancer, the odds ratio was 6.4 (95% CI 2.9   14.3). Based on the observed odds ratios, and assuming a baseline risk of 6%, we estimate the lifetime risks for carriers of CHEK2 truncating mutations to be 25% for a woman with one second degree relative affected, 30% for a woman with one first degree relative affected, and 38% for a woman with both first  and one second degree relative affected.CONCLUSION: CHEK2 mutation screening detects a clinically  meaningful risk of breast cancer.",2011

We examined methylation changes in 83 tumors and adjacent normal tissues and also in 6 out of 9 normal breast tissues from unaffected women (no breast cancer history) as controls. Immunohistochemical staining was used to investigate DKK1 protein expression in 9 controls and 70 out of 83 tumors as well as adjacent normal tissues. Immunohistochemical result was categorized as positive or negative for DKK1.Cancer genetics197 DKK1 gene methylation was detected in normal breast tissue from  unaffected women (33%). DKK1 gene was highly methylated in tumors (70%) and adjacent normal tissues (61%). Immunohistochemically, 67% normal breast tissue from unaffected women, 69% tumors and 83% adjacent normal tissues were DKK1 negative. DKK1 promoter  methylation and protein expression were not associated with age, tumor size, lymph node status, histological grade, and oestrogen receptor or progesteron receptor or CERB2 positivity. Our results showed that there is a positive correlation between hypermethylation pattern and lower expression level. However, there were no differences DKK1 promotor methylation and protein expression levels between tumor and adjacent tissues. This result indicates that there is no different methylation pattern in either breast tumor or normal breast tissue, indicating that DKK1 is not specific for breast tumor.",2011

Devilee","Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","Differential allelic expression (DAE) is a phenomenon in which the two  alleles of a gene are not expressed at equal levels. DAE affects a substantial fraction of the human genome, and has been suggested to be an important cause for human phenotypic variability, including complex traits and diseases. We have explored the hypothesis that  DAE at BRCA1 or BRCA2 may play a role in the pathogenesis of breast cancer. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 are tumor suppressor genes;  breast tumors developing in women who have inherited an inactivating mutation in either of these genes have virtually always lost the wild type allele at the gene locus. In a series of 130 breast cancer cases, we determined allele specific expression levels of BRCA1 and BRCA2  in normal skin fibroblasts cultured from mastectomy tissue. DAE was detected in 23% of patients at BRCA1, and 38% of patients at BRCA2. We then analyzed the allelic status of both genes in genomic DNA  isolated from matching tumor samples. Allelic imbalance was detected in 73% and 52% of tumors at BRCA1 and BRCA2, respectively.  DAE at BRCA1 in normal fibroblasts was not correlated with allelic  imbalance at the BRCA1 gene locus in the tumor, nor did we observe a preferential loss in the tumor of the allele that was expressed at highest level in corresponding normal tissue. A similar finding was made for BRCA2. We conclude that DAE at BRCA1 and BRCA2 does not operate in conjunction with allelic imbalance to contribute to tumorigenesis in the breast.",2011

P gp, which needs ATP energy to be functional, prevents the accumulation of potentially toxic substances and metabolites by extruding them out of the cell. The single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of the MDR1 gene can cause differences in P gp expression levels and this is associated with predisposition to some diseases including breast cancer.

 Silencing of a ubiquitin specific protease; USP32 in HeLa and mc F7 cancer cell lines,P06.041,"H. B. Akman Tuncer, A. E. Erson Bensan","Middle East Technical University, Ankara, Turkey","Previous studies identified chromosomal band 17q23 as a frequent  site of gene amplification in breast cancer. USP32 is one of the  oncogene candidates in this region. Ubiquitination changes activity, localization, half life, conformation, and stability of proteins. Hence, ubiquitination and deubiquitination may have important consequences  in cells. Previously, USP32 was shown to be an active deubiquitinating enzyme by an in vivo deubiquitination assay in our laboratory. We hypothesized that amplification of USP32 may contribute to breast  tumorigenesis by its deubiquitinating activity. Real time RT PCR was performed to detect USP32 overexpression in breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. Our results showed that USP32 was expressed more than 5 folds in 30% of human breast cancer cell lines and 2 folds in 22% of human primary breast tumors.RNAi silencing of USP32 was achieved by pSUPER shRNA and  confirmed by real time RT PCR. Proliferation rate of USP32 silenced  cells was determined by the MTT Assay. Transwell migration assay was  used to compare migration abilities of USP32 silenced cells. Stable silencing of USP32 in HeLa and MCF7 cells caused a decrease in the proliferation rate up to 35%. Migration abilities of HeLa and MCF7 cells were decreased after USP32 silencing as tested by transwell migration assay. In short, we detected that USP32 had roles in cell proliferation and migration which may be important for understanding the complex mechanisms of breast tumorigenesis. We are conducting expression experiments in non tumorigenic breast cell line MCF10A to further delineate its function in cells and contribution to tumorigenesis.",2011

Glioma is the most common primary brain cancer and it is characterized  with high mortality. A recent analysis of gliomas has revealed somatic mutations in the IDH1 and IDH2 genes, which encode cytosolic and mitochondrial NADPH dependent isocitrate dehydrogenase, respectively. Genetic aberrations in IDH1 or IDH2 genes have been  commonly found together with mutated TP53 gene and associated  with good prognosis for the patients. Materials and methods:To validate prognostic significance of genes  IDH1, IDH2 and TP53  in Bulgarian patients, we screened 50 primary intracranial tumours, including astrocytomas and oligodendrogliomas. All samples were examined by direct sequencing of exon 4 of IDH1 and IDH2 genes, and exon 5 8 of TP53 gene.Results: IDH1 mutations were detected in 12 (24%) gliomas, all were G>A changes within the isocitrate binding site (R132) at position 395. No mutation was found in IDH2. Aberrations in TP53 were detected in 12  (24%) tumours. Five (42%) of them carried also an IDH1 mutation.  Patients with mutations in both IDH1 and TP53 were younger (median age 35) then those with an aberration only in one gene (49.5) or non mutated cases (55; p,0.016). Median survival of patients harbouring mutations in two genes was 44.3 months compared to those with mutation in one of the genes and non mutated cases   11.9 and 7.3 months, respectively (p,0.04).Conclusions:IDH1 and TP53 mutations are common in gliomas with good survival  and may be used as specific prognostic biomarkers in Bulgarian  patients with brain tumours.",2011

CD38 shows weak prognostic value and also weak correlation with ZAP70 expression. Molecular analysis revealed that ZAP70 expression in del13q subgroup was the same as control group whilst it increased 2.7838 fold in del11q subgroup and 2.9547 fold in trisomy 12 subgroups compared to 15 cases of control group. Comparison of the mean and Standard Deviation of the ZAP70  expression profile within the subgroups showed that its value between the individuals of the del11q and trisomy 12 subgroups were highly variable, as against tight clustering for del13q subgroup. Therefore, there is a correlation between del13q aberration which has good prognosis with normal level of ZAP70 expression, whereas due to wide variation, no conformity is seen for del11q and trisomy 12 subgroups as poor prognostic discriminators.It could be concluded that CD38 could not be regarded as a reliable prognostic factor, and has a poor concordance with ZAP70 expression profile whereas ZAP70 shows a good concordance with cytogenetic abnormalities and simultaneous analyzing of these two markers produce better prognosis.",2011

Fifteen mutations were discovered among 507 non BRCA HBC cases and four among 513 controls. The frequency of CHEK2 variants was significantly higher among cases (p, 0.0076), and gave an OR for breast cancer of 4.72 for deleterious mutation carriers.

In the early post transplant period after allogeneic HSCT, coexistence of the host and donor lympho  and hematopoietic systems will develop.  This period, which is temporary in the majority of successful stem cell transplants, is referred to as mixed chimerism, whereas complete chimerism denotes the situation when all cell lineages are reconstituted by donor derived cells. Successful engraftment correlates with the engraftment of donor cells and relapse is thought to evolve from occult autologous malignant cells that survive to the pretransplant marrow ablative conditioning regimen and escape surveillance by allogeneic immune effector cells. Early analysis of donor and recipient chimerism patterns after HSCT gains importance in predicting engraftment  and rejection as well as in persistent and recurrent disease. It is also helpful in guiding risk adapted immunotherapy for prophylaxis and interventional therapy of graft versus host disease (GvHD) or imminent relapse.Several techniques have been reported for this purpose.

Chordoma is a rare malignant bone tumor arising from notochord  remnants, characterized by local invasiveness and variable tendency for recurrency. Given the implication of apoptosis in notochord regression, we studied the expression of 8 proapoptotic genes mapping in 1p36 region by RT PCR in 32 tumours showing loss of  heterozigosity (LOH) in 83% of cases. None of the analyzed tumour expression profiles overlaps with that of the control and the absence of 1p36 LOH has been correlated to a better prognosis. As the apoptotic pathway mediated by FAS FASL was found to be involved in notochord regression, we studied their expression in 34 chordomas and observed that most of them express FAS, but not FASL. To verify a possible implication of FAS/FASL pathway dysfunction during tumorigenesis, we started in vivo studies on zebrafish. We investigated zfas/zfasl  expression in embryosâ total RNA during different developmental  stages and observed that, while zfas has maternal and ubiquitous  zygotic expression, zfasl has maternal and specific developmental stages expression.

Kaempferol, a flavonoid, is an active component of Epilobium parviflorum and presents anti  and pro oxidant activity in various cancers.In this study, it is aimed to investigate miRNA expression differences in the Chronic Myeloid Leukemia cell line, K562, following the treatment with Silymarin and Kaempferol compounds.Cytotoxicity analysis was performed with several doses of silymarin  (between 4.69 and 300 ÂµM) and kaempherol (between 6 and 30ÂµM) at 24 hours intervals for three days in K562 cell line, using XTT assay. miRNAs were isolated from cells exposed to IC50 doses of silymarin and kaempherol. Relative quantitation of 88 miRNAs was measured by real time online RT PCR. Alterations in the miRNA expression were compared with kaempherol or silymarin  free K562 cells.It is found that, IC50 doses of silymarin (29.02 ÂµM) and kaempherol (9.84 ÂµM) inhibited oncogenic miR 21, miR 128 and miR 15b and increased the expression levels of miR 22, miR 29a and miR 29c, which are reported to can function as tumor suppressors.

In this study, MCF 7 and T47D cells were treated with  various concentrations of cisplatin for different times (24, 48 and 72h). Then, cell viability was assessed using MTT assay and IC50 was determined. RNA was extracted and cDNA was synthesized.

This accumulation is due both to decreased apoptosis and increased proliferation. Altered mechanisms  of programmed cell death and proliferation are not the intrinsic features of leukemic cells, but result from specific microenvironmental ef fect. Histological markers of CLL are pseudofollicles (proliferation centers), dispersed in involved tissues. Pseudofollicles are made up from stromal cells, T lymphocytes, follicular dendritic cells, endothelial cells as well as others. These create protective microenvironment for CLL lymphocytes. Nurse like cells (NLCs), first found in CLL mononuclear cells cultures, are also the part of this microenvironment.Mechanisms that improve survival and increase proliferation of CLL  cells are crucial in the context of effective therapy. The aim of the study was the analysis of proapoptotic genes expression on mRNA and protein level in CLL lymphocytes cultured with nurse like cells.PBMCs of 65 CLL patients were cultured for 14 days. Cell viability, apoptosis, proliferation, gene expression profile and selected proteins expression were assessed at day 0 and 14.We found that NLCs support CLL lymphocytes survival in vitro, and the effect depends on NLC number. Gene expression profiling and RT PCR showed the increase of proapoptotic genes BCL2, BCL XL  and SURVIVIN expression, what was further confirmed by their protein  products analyses. However, no signs of CLL lymphocyte proliferation (any mitotic figures or Ki 67 expression) were observed.",2011

Four different algorithms (QuantiSNP, PennCNV, SOMATICs, BAFsegmentation) were used for Cancer genetics201 genotype analysis and the results were compared by applying Java  programming language. CNV areas were plotted to the same graphics for visualisation of the results detected by four programs. That allowed choosing different analysing programs for different purposes and comparing in detail cancer tissue and germline copy number. About 140 CNVs per patient were detected, most of which were amplifications. Some were found in more than one patient: 3q25 q27, 5p12 p14, 12p13, 9p13, 8p22. The results were further compared with gene expression data obtained from the same patients, and 30 genes with altered copy number showed expected changes in expression.

In DNA isolated from lymphocytes, mutation scanning of the PABPC4L gene was performed with high resolution melting analysis and direct sequencing. No pathogenic PABPC4L mutations were detected in the  93 patients. Therefore, our data do not support the hypothesis that  PABPC4L is a candidate gene for colon cancer.

As far as cancer cell proliferation is dependent on Kras expression, we performed silencing by means of anti Kras siRNA. 38% of cell apoptosis was a result of this inhibition. The double decrease of cell viability (63%) was observed  when used a combination of anti Kras, Survivin , FLIP siRNAs. It is  interesting that additive effect of three siRNA action was observed.

Patients  were selected according to criteria suggestive of an increased genetic risk for CRC: (i) CRC before 61 years of age (or high risk adenoma before 51) with a first degree relative presenting with CRC; or (ii)  CRC before 51 years of age (or high risk adenoma before 41); or (iii) multiple primitive colorectal tumors in the same case, the first one diagnosed before 61 years of age if cancer or before 51 if high risk adenoma. The controls, aged from 45 to 60 years, were CRC free and had no familial history of CRC. Allelic expression of TGFÎ²R1 was then measured, using SNaPshot and 4 SNPs (rs334348 , rs334349 ,  rs1590 and rs7871490 ), by normalizing the ratio of the allelic peaks  obtained on RT PCR with the ratio of the peaks obtained on genomic  DNA.

In STEP2, the functional effect of the variation is assessed in an in vitro MMR  and in silico assays. Where LS cannot be confirmed or ruled out, more specific biochemical assays are required in STEP3. Here we verified the proposed model and its ability to distinguish pathogenic MMR variations from variants of uncertain significance by utilizing clinical, laboratory and in silico data of 37 MLH1, 26 MSH2 and 11 MSH6 variations. The proposed model was shown to be appropriate and proceed logically in assessing the pathogenicity of MMR variations. In fact, for MMR deficient MLH1 and MSH2 variations STEP3 is not required. STEP3 is important in assessing MMR proficient variations  showing discrepant in silico results after STEP2. MSH6 variations require appropriate selection in terms of ruling out MLH1 and MSH2 variations and MLH1 promoter hypermethylation. Overall, taking into consideration the susceptibility gene, the three step model can be utilized in an efficient manner to determine the pathogenicity of MMR gene variations.",2011

Some cases of MVA have been associated with homozygous mutations in the BUB1B gene, a component of the spindle assembly checkpoint (SAC). We have applied high resolution SNP array profiling as an approach to identify novel cancer predisposing genes in patients with early onset mismatch repair proficient colorectal cancer. We encountered a constitutional mono allelic deletion encompassing another important SAC gene, BUB1, in a patient who developed a colon carcinoma at age 37. Clinical examination revealed microcephaly and brachydactyly, two characteristic features of MVA syndrome. No mutations were found in the remaining BUB1 allele. In addition, no germline mutations in the APC gene were found. Since defects in the SAC are known to be  associated with aneuploidy, metaphases of the patientâs lymphocytes were analyzed and, by doing so, an increased level of constitutive aneuploidy (32%) was observed.Regulation of the SAC has been shown to be dependent on gene dosage. Bub1 hypomorphic mice revealed reduced checkpoint activity and increased aneuploidy in a dose dependent manner with increased spontaneous tumorigenesis. Furthermore, in a patient, who presented with early onset gastrointestinal cancer, a homozygous mutation in BUB1B leading to a reduced BUBR1 expression was recently reported. These data imply that, next to recessively inherited syndromes like MVA, haploinsufficiency of BUB1 or other SAC components may result in non classical forms of MVA with a predisposition to develop gastrointestinal malignancies.",2011

Overall, metastatic tumours systematically contained those genetic abnormalities observed in the primary tumour sample from the same subject. However, liver metastases from most cases (n,8/20) showed acquisition of genetic aberrations that were not found in their paired primary tumors.

We studied the levels of DNA damage in MSC from human bone marrow at various passages of cultivation using single cell gel electrophoresis (comet assay).Twenty eight samples of MSCâs cultures from bone marrow of healthy donors have been analyzed. DNA damage was assessed as percent Cancer genetics204 of DNA in comet tail. The level of DNA damage and the frequency of  apoptotic comets in cultures of MSCs studied at 3 4 passages and 10 11 passages.The levels of DNA damage in MSC didnât change during culturing (3,5Â±0,9% on 3 4 passages and 4,4Â±1,2% on 10 11 passages ). The  frequencies of apoptotic comets in MSC cultures were 2,8Â±0,9% on the early passages and 3,6Â±1,8% on the late ones. In one of the cultures of MSCs we have observed a high level of DNA damage (16,5% DNA in comet tail) and high rate of apoptotic comets (18,3%).",2011

INTRODUCTION: Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is the most  common and malignant primary brain tumor which is characterized by a number of different genetic alterations.AIMS: We aimed to analyze the DNA profiles in an unselected group of Bulgarian patients with newly diagnosed GBM. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Nine fresh frozen tumor samples from patients with histologically confirmed primary GBM have been studied using a high throughput DNA microarray analysis.RESULTS: The most common numerical chromosomal aberrations were monosomy 10, 13, 14, 22, and trisomy 7 and 20. The most frequently detected copy number changes were deletions at 10p12, 10q23, 1p36, and 14q32; and gains at 7q36, 1q44, and 20q11 13. We identified a number of candidate tumor suppressor genes (KCNMA1, FGFR2, GFRA1, BNIP3, BACH, KLF12, VRK1, NF2, and OSM) and  oncogenes (GNAI1, HGF, PCLO, SEMA3D, GRM3, RGS7, OPN3, CDK5, DNAJB6, ZNF658B, CDK5RAP1, and PTPN1), which are probably involved in the development of GBM.CONCLUSIONS: GBMs are genetically heterogeneous group of tumors with unpredicted therapeutic response.

Background: Interethnic differences are becoming increasingly  recognized as important factors accounting for interindividual variations in tolerability and efficacy of anticancer drugs. Although the reasons underlying ethnic diversity in drug responsiveness are likely multifactorial, inherited ethnic differences in drug related genes may  be, at least in part, the cause of the diversity.Methods: 18 polymorphisms in 10 genes, the protein activities of which may be addressed in different aspects of cisplatin metabolism, were tested for correlations with efficacy and toxicity of cisplatin based regimen (combination with cyclophosphamide) in Russian (n,104) and Yakut (n,87) women with epithelial ovarian cancer.Results: There were significant (p<0.05) differences between Russian and Yakut patients in genotype distribution for GSTP1 Ile105Val, GSTP1 Ala114Val, GSTA1 â69C>T, ERCC2 Asp312Asn,  ERCC2 Lys751Gln, ERCC1 19007T>C, CYP2E1 96bp and CYP2E1  â1053C>T. GSTP1 Ile105Val polymorphism was associated with  progression free survival (p,0.004) and overall survival (p,0.02) in Russian patients. In Yakuts correlation with progression free survival were observed for CYP2E1 7632T>A polymorphism (p,0.05). The  associations between genotypes and treatment toxicities were also different between ethnic groups. Russian patients with GSTM1 null and GSTM3 intron 6 AGG/AGG genotypes had a lower risk of anemia.  In contrast, in Yakut group anemia was less frequent among patients with GSTA1 â69C/C genotype. Nephrotoxicity in Russians was associated with two polymorphisms in ERCC1  gene but in Yakuts it  was correlated with ERCC2 Lys751Gln polymorphism. Conclusions: The marked ethnic differences in relevant pharmacogenetics may be a potential explanation for discordant platinum efficacy and toxicity in Asians and Caucasians, and are worthy of future studies.",2011

In several DNA repair genes, polymorphisms may result in reduced  repair capacity, which has been implicated as a risk factor for various types of cancer. The aim of the study was to investigate the association between genetic polymorphisms of XRCC1 and susceptibility to acute leukemia. We performed a case control study  involving 26 patients with acute leukemia (21 with myeloid leukemia and 5 with acute lymphoblastic leukemia) and 20 healthy controls for polymorphisms of codons 194 and 399 of the XRCC1 base excision repair pathway gene. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by enzymatic digestion of the PCR products was used for the genotyping of the two polymorphisms. The restricted products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel. The risk of development of acute leukemia was found to be significantly increased when variant XRCC1 399 (Arg/Gln) and XRCC1 194 (Arg/Trp) were present (p<0.05). These results suggest  that the polymorphism of XRCC1 gene may contribute to the higher risk of acute leukemia.Acknowledgement: This paper is partly supported by the Sectorial operational programme human resources development (SOP HRD), financed from the European social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the contract number POSDRU 60782.",2011

This means that tumor cells become insensitive to a wide range of chemotoxic drugs which are structurally and functionally different. A well known mechanism responsible for drug resistance is over  expression of ABC transporter genes.The aim of the present study was to investigate the expression level of MDR1and MRP1 in breast cancer tumors and adjacent normal tissues of breast cancer patients at levels of RNA as well as protein levels and examine whether the expression of either or combination of these genes in breast cancer correlates with response to chemotherapy.Fifty four patients with breast cancer who had undergone breast cancer surgery were enrolled in the study.Expression levels of MDR1 and MRP1in normal and tumoral breast tissues were evaluated by  quantitative Real time PCR and flowcytometry.Results showed that the expression levels of MDR1 and MRP1 in tumoral breast tissue were increased significantly than those of normal samples.Our findings showed that evaluation of the expression at RNA or protein levels using Real time RT PCR or flowcytometry are compareable but Real time RT PCR is faster and cost benefit .,2011

Cell cell adhesion plays a crucial role in epithelial tissue polarity and  structural integrity and E cadherin is a key player is this process. Reduced cell cell adhesiveness results in destruction of the histological structure and increase invasion, the morphological hallmark of malignant tumors. Despite the strong correlation between E cadherin  impairment and malignancy, the cause underlying its impairment remains unknown in most epithelial cancers.In the present work, we identified a novel E cad transcript, characterized its tissue specific expression and its functional role in a cancer context.A new E cad exon was identified within intron 2 splicing with exon 3 at its canonical splice site.    5â RACE and CAGE analysis pinpointed two potential  transcription start sites (TSS) and an ORF. This transcript includes all downstream canonical exons of E cad gene, is expected to be translated and was named CDH1a. CDH1a is specifically expressed  in spleen, a non epithelial tissue and is absent from the stomach epithelia. In stomach cancer cell lines, it becomes overexpressed. Forced overexpression of CDH1a in cell lines expressing the canonical E cad promotes cell invasion and angiogenesis and modifies their expression pattern as proved by microarray analysis. We identified a novel E cadherin protein isoform cis regulating the function of the canonical form. This finding may enclose a previously unrecognized mechanism leading to E cadherin impairment in cancer.",2011

Here  we investigated multi dimensional models to predict effects of DAC at the level of the genome, epigenome and proteome for subtypes of breast cancer. The present study initially assessed the effective dosage of DAC for breast cancer therapy based on the cell viability, cytotoxicity, apoptosis and methylation quantification assays for different breast cancer cell lines. Then two breast cancer subtypes including highly aggressive and non aggressive cell lines were investigated at various time points passages using multi dimensional omics approaches (gene expression, microRNA expression and proteomics analysis). Complete molecular profile of the studied subtypes was identified. Additionally, the biological interactions and possible early and late systematic stable or transient effects of the methylation inhibition were determined in details.The present study allows improving the effective optimal DAC dose cycles to establish intervals for epigenetic treatment of patients and also new DAC targets (including genes, miRNAs and proteins) and  new involved pathways were identified.

Breast tumors are classified based on estrogen receptor alpha status to ER negative (30 40%) and ER positive. Considering to the challenging nature of ERÎ±  tumors treatment, and its innate poor prognosis,  clarification of the molecular mechanisms that control expression of ERÎ± are essential. Aberrant methylation of gene promoter region is one of the mechanisms for gene silencing in breast tumors which are  potentially reversible and so they are good targets for new therapeutic strategies. For analyzing the methylation status of ERÎ± gene, ER3 region were assessed with methylation specific polymerase chain reaction (MSP). ERÎ± methylation was detected in 64 of 91(70%) breast tumors. A strong correlation was found between ERÎ± methylation in ER3 region and ER negativity in tumors as 88.9% of ER negative versus 52.2% of ER positive cases were methylated (P< 0.00001). There were significant correlations between methylation in ER3 region and negative status of progesterone receptor in tumors (P< 0.01). Presence of ERÎ± methylation in a sizable fraction of ER+ cases, maybe due to cellular heterogeneity in breast tumors. ER positivity in breast tumors is a dynamic phenotype and over the natural course of cancer progression, ER can be lost and many ER+ tumors become ER  in the course of the disease.

Breast cancer is one of the most frequent malignancies among Iranian  women and its age of onset seems to be about 10 years earlier in comparison to European countries. This cancer is a heterogeneous disease that includes many morphological and molecular entities. We had shown that ERÎ± promoter methylation is a frequent event in Iranian  patients. Therefore we investigated the association of this epigenetic event in different molecular subtypes of breast tumors. Although breast cancer subtypes were originally identified by gene expression analysis using DNA microarrays, large scale sub typing using gene expression profiling from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded samples is not currently feasible. According to recent approaches about immunohistochemical (IHC) based classification of breast tumors to molecular subtypes, we used IHC surrogates to identify breast tumor intrinsic subtypes in 91 breast tumors in Iranian patients. ER /PR / Her2  tumors were classified as triple negative (basal like) (25%), ER /PR /her2+ tumors as her2+ group(24%), ER+/PR+/Her2  as luminal A (34%) and ER+/PR+/Her2+ as luminal B tumors(17%). Methylation status of estrogen receptor promoter was investigated in these subtypes. There was a significant correlation between methylation in ERÎ± and triple negative subtype where 20/23 (86.7%) of them were methylated. Also significant correlation were found in Her2+ subtype tumors with 20/22 (90.9%) methylation in ERÎ± (P<0.002).

This mutation was detectable in fatherâs lymphocytes DNA but in low proportion (9%), suggesting the presence of somatic mosaicism in the father. The detection of the mutation in other tissues (buccal swab, normal colon tissue) and in the offspring suggests that it may have occurred early during embryogenesis, before the separation of the embryonic layers.

Several dilutions of mutated DNA in wild Cancer genetics207 type DNA show that the High Fusion Resolution (HRM) technique  allows a 2.5% proportion of the mutated allele to be detected. Sanger sequencing alone is not sensitive enough to detect low mosaicism levels and pre screening methods like HRM could be used for APC analysis. Mosaicism is an important consequence of the high rate  of de novo APC mutations and must be considered in the diagnosis  of apparently de novo cases.

Introduction: Germline mutations in adenomatous polyposis coli (APC)  are associated with the development of familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP), a hereditary colorectal cancer syndrome with autosomal dominant inheritance pattern. This syndrome is characterized by the presence of hundreds to thousands of adenomatous polyps in the  colon and rectum. Attenuated familial adenomatous polyposis (AFAP), is related to mutations in the end 5 â, in exon 9 and in the end 3â of the APC gene. Biallelic mutations in MYH gene have also been identified in patients with multiple colorectal adenomas and in APC negative patients with FAP.Materials and Methods: We collected samples from peripheral blood to probands belonging to 55 families of high risk for familial adenomatous polyposis. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells. Amplified PCR products were analyzed by CSGE, dHPLC, restriction  enzymes, MLPA, In silico analysis and direct sequencing.Results: Molecular analysis of APC gene, has allowed the identification of pathogenic germline mutations in 75% of FAP families and 17% of AFAP families. We found 41 different mutations in the APC gene, which have been cataloged in pathogenic mutations, variants of unknown significance and neutral polymorphisms. In MYH gene, the analysis revealed 6 different pathogenic germline mutations in 7 unrelated families, including 6 families with biallelic and 1 with monoallelic variants.Conclusions: We described 14 pathogenic mutations in APC gene; eight of them are reported for the first time. Additionally, we confirm that germline mutations in MYH gene are responsible for a significant fraction of colorectal polyposis.",2011

A family history of breast cancer is one prerequisite criterion for  testing for BRCA1 and BRCA2 germ line mutations. However, germ line mutations in BRCA1 BRCA2  genes account for only 15 20% of  breast cancer families. Recently, the PALB 2 gene, known as one of the Fanconi anemia genes (FANCN), has been identified as a Partner  and Localizer of BRCA2 and was reported to contribute to breast and pancreatic cancer susceptibility. Monoallelic germ line mutations in PALB2 have been reported in 1% to 3% of early onset and/or familial cancer cases and confer more than a two fold increased risk to develop breast cancer.In a series of patients previously analysed for BRCA1/BRCA2  with no  detectable point mutation or large rearrangement, we screened 94 index patients for germ line mutations in PALB2 by EMMA (Enhanced Mismatch Mutation Analysis). EMMA is, a new fast and cost effective  method based on heteroduplex analysis by capillary electrophoresis. The 13 coding exons and intron exon junctions of PALB2 were amplified as 19 amplicons in 6 multiplex PCR using a single condition. To validate the EMMA method we sequenced directly the exons for all samples. We did not observe any discrepancy between the two methods. We identified one truncating PALB2 mutation in a family with  three breast cancer cases (mean age 53 years) and 1 ovarian cancer case. Four novel missense mutations were also identified. This study is the first report of PALB2 mutation screening on French  breast ovarian cancer families. Although PALB2 mutations seem rare, their contribution to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer susceptibility needs further investigation.",2011

In an attempt to find the target of 14qUPD we performed exome sequencing on tumor DNA sample from a patient with polycythemia vera and carrying 14qUPD. We analyzed the exome sequencing data for point mutations and focused on the chromosomal region of 14qUPD. A homozygous nonsense mutation, R658X, was found in gene FANCM. Germline mutations in FANCM cause Fanconi anemia and an increased susceptibility to AML. We confirmed the Cancer genetics208 homozygous mutation in myeloid cells by Sanger sequencing, while  the buccal mucosa control sample was heterozygous for the mutation. Clinical data showed that the patient was initially diagnosed with polycythemia vera and had high hemoglobin levels, while at sample the patient was anemic and later transformed to AML. It is unclear  whether the nonsense mutation in FANCM caused proliferative advantage in the patient or there is a second, somatic mutation that drives the clonal outgrowth. In any case, acquired homozygosity for the germline mutation changed the clinical course of the disease. The interplay of somatic genetic events and germline deleterious variants provides another dimension in clonal evolution of cancers.",2011

Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is an autosomal dominant disease characterized by hundreds of adenomatous polyps in the colon and rectum and by a variety of extracolonic features.Mutation of the adenomatous polyposis coli  (APC) gene, a tumor suppressor , is though to be an early event in patients with FAP.Method: This study was conducted on 15 patient with FAP. Genomic DNA was extracted according to standard salting out protocol. Whole coding region of the gene was scanned using bidirectional sequencing analysis.Results: In the present study the screening of APC gene led to the identification of two novel missense mutations and one novel polymorphism. The mutations were including a A>G transition  (AAGâAGG) at nucleotide 6226 in exon 15. This alteration substitute an arginine to the normal lysine at residue 2057 (Lys 2057 Arg). The other mutation, G>C transition (AGCâ ACC), was identified at nucleotide 6772 in exon 15. This alteration replaces serine with threonine at residue 2239 (Ser 2239 Thr) in another proband. Moreover, 1novel polymorphism determined in codon 15, C>G transition (ACTâ AGT) at nucleotide 6820. It causes replacement of threonine with serine at residue 2255 (Thr 2255 Ser).Conclusions: Our findings showed that probably the mutations have been located in these regions are responsible for some cases of FAP deficiency. Therefore, we could consider these types of mutations in order to predict individuals at risk of FAP in our population.",2011

Previous studies demonstrate that children exposed to ionising radiation show an increased risk of PTC, and carry it with them into  adult life. Given the inter individual variation in response to radiation dose and familial aggregation of thyroid cancer, it is likely that genetic factors affect radiation related thyroid cancer.In 1999, the RAD group at IARC set up a population based case control study in Belarus and the Russian Federation to evaluate the risk of thyroid cancer after radiation exposure in childhood. The study aimed to investigate how environmental and host factors interplay to modify this risk. In the current analyses, we included 413 subjects from Belarus (83 PTC cases and 330 matched controls); all of them were  aged 15 or younger at the time of the accident.

Familial platelet disorder with propensity to myeloid malignancy (FPD/ AML) is an autosomal dominant disorder characterized by platelet abnormalities and a predisposition to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). FPD/AML is caused by constitutional point mutations and copy number changes in 21q22 RUNX1 . Given the clinical heterogeneity of FPD/ AML, the syndrome could be overlooked. In the past this has resulted  in stem cell transplantation (SCT) of patients from affected siblings before detection of the inherited RUNX1 mutation. Therefore, adequate diagnostics are essential to exclude FPD/AML. The identification of novel mutations is required to define clinical features and could contribute to risk stratification given the heterogeneous manifestation of this rare disorder. Here we report novel p.Gly143Arg and p.Gln235X (RUNX1b  variant) mutations in two pedigrees. In a third pedigree  no RUNX1 anomaly was detected by sequencing or copy number  analyses using array CGH. We hypothesized that FISH analysis could  reveal a balanced 21q22 RUNX1  translocation. A rearrangement of the  RUNX1  locus by a constitutional t(16;21)(p13;q22) was identified as a  novel pathogenomic mechanism in FPD/AML. The 16p13 breakpoint was confined to the proximity of the ATF7IP2 (MCAF1) locus, encoding  a transcription factor involved in proliferation in human cancer by epigenetic transcriptional control of Sp1 dependent maintenance of telomerase activity. This is the first report on a constitutional chromosome translocation with an oncogene rearrangement as a pathogenomic mechanism in a hematological malignancy.

Yet, a considerable proportion of gastric cancers lack classical CDH1  inactivation mechanisms (CDH1   mutation, loss of heterozygosity and/or DNA methylation), but  nevertheless loss or mislocalisation of E cadherin expression is still frequently observed. To address this issue, we explored an indirect pathway involving chromosomal abnormalities, a microRNA (miR 101) and a histone methyltransferase (EZH2), which may contribute to E cadherin impairment in sporadic gastric cancer. We confirmed that, independently of the histological type, E cadherin is frequently impaired (95%) in our series of sporadic gastric cancer. However, only 30% of the cases harbour classical inactivation mechanisms. We found that miR 101 expression is downregulated in most of  these cases and proved, for the first time, that this occurs via (micro) deletions at one of the microRNA 101 loci in chromosome 9p24.1 (miR 101 2 locus). Moreover, 40% of cases showing decreased levels of miR 101 displayed overexpression of EZH2 (a known target gene of miR 101) which, in turn, associates with loss or aberrant E cadherin expression. Conversely, we demonstrated that depletion of EZH2, by short interference RNA, rescues E cadherin cell membrane expression. Overall, we show that loss of miR 101 with parallel EZH2 upregulation may constitute an additional mechanism that can either directly impair E cadherin expression or may co exist with classical E cadherin inactivating mechanisms seen mainly in advanced cancers with intestinal morphology.",2011

MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression was  evaluated by immunohistochemical analysis, MMR genes methylation status by MS MLPA, and microsatellite instability (MSI) of the tumors with 8 marker sequences. High MSI was evident in 4.7% of gliomas, low MSI in 38.4%, whereas MSS was found in 57%. More instable markers were BAT 40, MYCL1 and BAT25, instead of the frequently BAT26 instable marker related to colorectal cancer. MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 protein expression was scored negative in 19.4%, 23.8% and 32.0% of cases. Furthermore, 9.3% of glial tumors showed loss of all of them and 43.3% had no expression of one or more MMR  proteins. There was a correlation between MMR protein levels and grade of malignance. Tumors showed MLH1, MSH2 and MSH6 methylation in 80.7%, 49.1% and 49.1% of cases. We have not found fully association between methylation status, protein expression and microsatellite instability, suggesting that there could be other repair system which compensates the loss of MMR expression in MSS tumors and promotes MSI in other cases. The study of MLH1 promoter SNP (rs1800734) showed an association between AA genotype and loss of MLH1 expression. Finally, we also analyzed p53 protein expression. P53 overexpression was demonstrated in 46.5% of gliomas and it correlated with MLH1 gene methylation and MSH2 protein levels.",2011

The aims were identify the MspI CYP1A1, PstI CYP2E1 and DraI CYP2E1 polymorphisms in patients with head and neck cancer (HNSCC) and  compare with individuals without cancer; to evaluate the association of these polymorphisms with clinical histophatological parameters. Patients and  m ehtods: In the case group, were evaluated 313  patients for CYP1A1, 217 for CYP2E1 (PstI) and 211 for CYP2E1 (DraI). In the control group were evaluated 417 individuals for CYP1A1, 334 for CYP2E1 (PstI) and 374 CYP2E1 (DraI). Molecular analysis was performed by PCR RFLP technique and for statistical analysis were used chi square and multiple logistic regression tests.  Results: We confirmed that age, smoking and alcohol consumption are risk factors for HNSCC. The Hardy Weinberg analysis showed that genotypic frequencies are in equilibrium in the patients. For control group, the CYP2E1 (PstI) is in equilibrium and the others genes there were not in equilibrium. The result for CYP1A1 (MspI) showed that age (OR:8.15; CI 95% 5.57 11.92) and smoking (OR:5.37; CI 95% 3.52 8.21) were predictors for the disease; to the CYP2E1 (PstI and DraI), there were an association of age (PstI OR:9.10; CI 95% 5.86 14.14/ Cancer genetics212 DraI OR:8.07 ; CI 95% 5.12 12.72), smoking (PstI OR:4.10; CI 95%  2.44 6.89/ DraI OR:5.73; CI 95% 3.34 9.82), alcohol (PstI OR:1.93; CI 95% 1.18 3.16/ DraI OR:1.69; CI 95% 1.02 2.81), respectively with disease development.

Diethylnitrosamine (DEN) is a hepatic procarcinogen which is frequently  used as an inducer of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) in mice. Although mice after DEN exposure are among the most widely used models for liver tumorigenesis, a detailed, mechanistic characterization of the longitudinal changes in the respective tumor genomes has never  been performed. We established the chronological order of genetic alterations during DEN carcinogenesis by examining mice at different points in time. Tumor samples were isolated by laser micro dissection and subjected to array comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and sequencing analysis. Chromosomal gains and losses were already observed in tumors by week 32 and increased significantly by week 56. Loss of distal chromosome 4q, including the tumor suppressors Runx3  and Nr0b2/Shp , was a frequent early event and  persisted during all tumor stages. Surprisingly, sequencing revealed  that Î² catenin mutations occurred late and were clearly preceded by chromosomal instability. Thus, contrary to common belief, Î² catenin mutations and activation of the Wnt/Î² catenin pathway are not involved in tumor initiation in this model of chemical hepatocarcinogenesis. Conclusion:  Our study suggests that the majority of the current  knowledge about genomic changes in HCC is based on advanced tumor lesions and that systematic analyses of the chronologic order including early lesions may reveal new, unexpected findings.",2011

We are one of the first to perform a genome wide association study (GWAS) of Chinese HCC patients in this study. The study cohort consisted of 300 Hong Kong Chinese male patients who were all positive for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg).

These 4  SNPs, located in the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region  around the HLA DQB2 and HLA DPB2 gene loci, were significant even after correction for population structure. This result supported previous findings that HLA loci have a putative role in the clearance of HBV  virus and the progression to chronic liver disease among HBV carriers.

The variants lie in exon 11, within a region previously described as âcritical regionâ, which spans between codons 200 300. Others suggested that this region was an important regulatory region  and suggested the presence of two ESE motifs, one of these covering positions c.690 to c.695. We assessed the putative effect of these variants on RNA splicing.For splicing analysis, lymphocytes from the carriers and healthy controls were cultured and a fraction of these was treated with puromycin to prevent nonsense mRNA mediated decay. The relative contribution of each allele to different transcripts was assessed based on allele specific cDNA analysis. In addition, an exon trapping vector Cancer genetics213 including the putative ESE motif will be used to show its functionality in  presence or absence of the variants.The alleles with either variant give rise to normal levels of the full length transcript, but also induce higher expression of in frame BRCA1Î11 isoform, which was found to be weakly expressed in controls.

Therefore, extreme genetic heterogeneity  serves as a model for inherited predis position to breast cancer. In agreement with this hypothesis, we have recently identified a novel  high penetrant predisposing gene for breast and ovarian cancer. The gene encoding RAD51C, one of five known RAD51 paralogs, has been found mutated in six out of 480 breast  and ovarian cancer (BC/OC) families (1.3%). In addition, we have identified a more common missense mutation (2%), exhibiting an OR of 3.44 in BC/OC families only (c.790G >A; G264S).In order to test whether other RAD51 paralogs are mutated in BC/OC or BC families, we now screened the genes encoding RAD51B and XRCC3, respectively. Apart from one and two misense mutations,  respectively, no mutations were found in the RAD51B  and XRCC3   genes. Although the application of several algorithms is indicating pathogeneity of the identified missense aberrations, mutations in the other RAD51 paralogs seem therefore to be rare.To validate further missense mutations identified in the RAD51C  gene, we employed different functional assays. E. g. the functional characterization of novel missense mutations by a transfection assay found in the RAD51C  gene led to the identification of at least five  further pathogenic mutations in the RAD51C  gene and will also be  reported.In summary, our data confirm RAD51C as a novel predisposing gene for BC/OC, but might exclude other genes encoding RAD51 paralogs.",2011

The missense gain of function mutations of the RET proto oncogene in MTC development has been well demonstrated.The aim of this study was to investigate the spectrum of predominant  RET germline mutations in exons 10, 11, and 16 among Iranian hereditary MTC patients.Materials & Methods: In this study 217 participants (151 MTC patients and 66 their first degree relatives) were included. Genomic DNAs were extracted from the leukocytes according to the standard Salting Out/Proteinase K method. Mutation detection was performed through PCR RFLP analysis. For Positive patients direct DNA sequencing was  carried out.Results: In 217 participants, 43 missense mutations were identified in exons 10(6%, 13 of 217), 11(13%, 28 of 217) and 16(0.9%, 2 of 217). Moreover, a novel germline mutation was detected at codon 686 in exon 11(S686N). Also four different polymorphisms were found in intron 16 of the RET proto oncogene in eight patients that most of them carried another mutation in exons 10 or 11.Conclusion: The obtained data in this study showed the frequency profile of the RET proto oncogene mutations in a sample of 217 Iranian individuals with MTC (19.8%). The most frequent mutation in  our population was C634G; whereas in most population it was C634R. Therefore the transforming activity and functional effect(s) of a new RET mutants such as S686N and intronic polymorphisms remain to be elucidated.

Kim","Samsung Medical Center, Seoul, Korea, Republic of","Hereditary Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) is an inherited  colorectal cancer syndrome and accounts for 5% of all colorectal cancer (CRC). A significant breakthrough in the diagnosis of HNPCC was made with the discovery of mismatch repair (MMR) genes that cause HNPCC. An alternative method for identifying HNPCC patients is  microsatellite instability (MSI). In sporadic CRCs, inactivation of MLH1 gene by promoter methylation causes MSI. Significant differences in the clinical phenotype between HNPCC families from South Korea and from the Netherlands were observed.To investigate methylation status in both distal and proximal regions of MLH1 gene, we used methylation specific PCR (MSP) and quantitative real time PCR (MethyLight) using 14 HNPCC and 37 sporadic MSI H CRCs. Germline mutations for MMR genes were tested in HNPCC patients, and BRAF V600E mutation and MLH1 protein expressions  were analyzed in all CRCs.GermIine mutations of MLH1 (n,7) and MSH2 (n,3) were detected in 10 of 14 HNPCC patients. BRAF mutations were detected in 2 (5.4%) sporadic CRCs.In CRCs from HNPCC patients, proximal and distal promoter regions of MLH1 gene was methylated 0% and 28.6% of cases, respectively. In sporadic MSI high CRCs, 62.2% and 67.6% were methylated in the proximal and distal promoter regions of MLH1 gene.

 s E s N3 dependent regulation of 2 c ys Prx by H s F1,P06.109,"M. Zamkova, P. Kopnin, B. Kopnin","Institute of Carcinogenesis, Blokhin Russian Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russian Federation","Induction of heat shock response is accompanied by elevated  transcription of Heat Shock Proteins, which are controlled by HSF1.Under normal conditions HSF1 appears as a repressed monomer shuttling between cytoplasm and nucleus. Upon stress HSF1 becomes activated which is associated with trimerization, nuclear  accumulation, hyperphosphorylation, acquisition of DNA binding and transactivation capacity. HSF1 protects cells from various stresses and increases cellular viability. It can also promote tumor survival as cancer cells depleted in HSF1 show significantly reduced growth and survival. Interestingly, HSF1 regulates up to 3% of genome beside HSPs and regulation mechanisms differ between tumor and normal cells. HSF1 role in the regulation of genes beside HSPs and their link to tumorigenesis has not been well studied.We found that promoters of sestrin family genes contained heat shock  elements. We assumed that HSF1 may influence peroxiredoxinsâ activity and subsequently regulate the level of Reactive Oxygen Species via regulation of sestrins.Our results show that introduction of constitutively active HSF1 into carcinoma cells increases the level of ROS and decreases the level of SESN3 mRNA. Surprisingly, introduction of active HSF1 into normal fibroblasts causes opposite effects. Active HSF1 slightly decreases tumor cell growth and increases cell growth of normal cells. According to our study HSF1 influences the activity of 2 Cys Prx and this effect seems to be SESN3 dependent as it was proved by shRNA analysis. We believe that our study will contribute to our better understanding of HSF1 role in the regulation of pathways beside HSP induction and subsequently in tumorigenesis.",2011

University of the Basque Country EHU,  Vitoria, Spain. Background: Epigenetic alterations are common events in human  cancer. Tumor cells show an aberrant reduction of global methylation levels and aberrant increase of gene specific methylation. In this regard, global hypomethylation seems to be a significant factor driving oncogenesis. However, so far, little is known about the global  methylation levels in common potentially malignant disorders such as oral lichenoid disease (OLD) and oral leucoplakia (OL), which malignant potential is controversial. The aim of our study was to assess the degree of global genomic hypomethylation in oral scrapings of patients with oral potentially malignant disorders compared to normal patients.Methods: We analyzed 205 cytological samples; 153 OLD patients, 22 OL patients and 30 controls. DNA was extracted from the oral scraping and the global methylation level was asses by analyzing the  methylation of repetitive elements (LINE1) by pyrosequencing after bisulphite treatment.Results: OLD and LO samples displayed a mean global methylation  level of 65.64% (SD,2.46) and 65.56% (SD,1.36) respectively. The reduction of the methylation level in both groups was statistically significant (p,0.002 and p,0.005) when compared to the control group. About 37.9% of OLD and 45.5% of LO samples were globally hypomethylated when evaluated against the minimum level of  methylation in control samples.Conclusion:  In oral malignant disorders the presence of global  hypomethylation may indicate that carcinogenic processes could be taking place and may favour the development additional alterations.â Grant supports: Carlos III Health Institute FIS(PI081516) and Government of the Basque Country (IT 435 10).

An understanding of factors associated with PCa mortality is increasingly important. Accumulating evidence implicates inflammation in PCa. Genetic variations within the sequence of candidate inflammatory genes like  TLRs 2, 3, 9 and COX 2 genes may lead to suboptimal inflammatory capacity and therefore increased PCa risk.   m aterial and  m ethods: We genotyped  195 PCa and 250 healthy  controls for TLR2 (â196 to â174 Del), TLR3 (c.1377C/T) [rs3775290],  TLR9 (G2848A) [rs352140], and COX 2 ( 765 G>C) [rs20417], (+8473  T>C) [rs5275] promoter gene polymorphisms using PCR RFLP.

The former was an interstitial in frame deletion depriving the protein of the pleckstrin homology domain, a well conserved region important for the function of the IRS family, whereas the latter was shown to be acquired and to replace a proline with a threonine. We conclude that IRS4 is mutated in a proportion of T ALL.  However, the pathogenetic impact and clinical ramification of such mutations remain to be elucidated.",2011

It was recognized that most colorectal cancers arise in a process progressing from adenomas to carcinomas. Kras, a small intracellular GTPase, is a central intermediary of the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) pathways. Kras mutations can be detected in  approximately 30 60% of patients with colorectal cancer. The most hot spot of the gene is located in exons 2 and 3. The aim of the current investigation was to examine profile of Kras mutations in adenomas and carcinoma in these exons.Methods: In this study exon 2 and 3 Kras gene in 48 tumors and 47 polyps biopsy were analyzed. DNA of the specimens were scanned using PCR sequencing.Results: Six mutations in tumors including 5 mutations in codon 12 (3 Gly12Asp ,1 Gly12Ala and 1Gly12Gly) and 1 mutation in codon 13,  Gly13 Asp, were detected. Moreover, 3 mutations determined in polyps including 2 in codon12, Gly12Asp, and one in codon 13 ,Gly13 Cys.Conclusion: Our findings showed that probably the profile of mutations in adenocarcinoma is not entirely compatible with the pattern of mutations in adenomas. However, just one of the mutations,Gly12Asp, was similar in the both group. Therefore, it seems that scanning the mutation in young individuals with polyps will be helpful for early diagnosis clinically and genetically and it would be useful for other follow up.Key words: Kras gene, Colorectal cancer, Mutation, adenoma , adenocarcinoma.",2011

The aim of the current study was to examine  promoter hypermethylation in two highly methylated in laryngeal carcinoma genes   MGMT and MLH1. They are both involved in DNA repair and are also associated with chemotherapeutic sensitivity.Methods: DNA was extracted from fresh frozen tumour tissues of 50 patients with laryngeal cancer. After sodium bisulfite conversion, promoter regions of MGMT and MLH1 were each amplified by PCR using two sets of primers   specific for methylated and unmethylated DNA.Results: MGMT promoter was found to be methylated in 10 (20%)  patients, while hypermethylation in MLH1 was detected in 34 (68%)  tumours. Epigenetic changes in MGMT were more frequent in older patients (p,0.02). No methylation of MGMT was observed in patients with early stage (T1 T2) carcinoma of the larynx.

About 95% of laryngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas (LSCC). The aetiology of LSCC is very complex, with both environmental (alcohol and tobacco use), genetic and epigenetic factors involved.  One of the common epigenetic events, which has been recognized as a cause of carcinogenesis in a variety of tumors, is global DNA hypomethylation, namely reduced level of methylation compared with healthy tissue. Hypomethylation affects many repetitive sequences as well as a number of single copy genes (e.g. growth regulatory genes, tissue specific genes) and may lead to chromosomal instability, loss of imprinting, retrotransposons and oncogene activation. DNA hypomethylation may occur at least partly as a consequence of cell cycle deregulation disturbing the coordination between DNA replication  and activity of DNA methyltransferases.The aim of study was 1) to assess the overall level of 5 methyldeoxycytosine in dinucleotide CpG sites in the genome of primary LSCC compared to normal laryngeal tissue; and 2) to examine of the expression level of the methyltransferases (Dntm1, Dntm3A, Dntm3B).

We observed quantitative allelic imbalance in tumor DNA in 4/19 (21%) of heterozygotes, where reduced signals of SNPs alleles could be seen compared to signals of ancestral alleles, and vice versa. This allelic imbalance was not found in any non tumor (normal) lung DNA sample. Finally, we evaluated this allelic imbalance by quantitative Real Time PCR of other loci in LNCR2 region by measurement of cycle threshold (CT) value of tumor DNA compared with CT value of DNA from normal lung tissue against to CT value for TFCR, a housekeeping gene.Supported by the grant project of MSMT CR, MSM0021620808",2011

To identify the gene loci involved on both  chromosomes we applied a sequential BAC clone mapping strategy. Using RT PCR we were finally able to detect a fusion mRNA transcript showing a fusion of the first (non coding) exon of BACH2 (basic  leucine zipper transcription factor 2) on 6q15 to the second exon of BCL2L1 (BCL X) on 20q11. Various fusion transcripts were detected  for different BCL2L1 (BCL XL) isoforms. The fusion ultimately results in strong expression of the Bcl2l1 (Bcl xL) anti apoptosis protein, as  demonstrated by immunoblotting. This is the first report that shows  involvement of both BCL2L1 and the transcription factor BACH2 in  a chromosomal rearrangement. It points to BACH2 as a possibly  important target in lymphomas with 6q aberrations, although other genes on 6q are probably also involved in these cases.

However, these techniques  are  expensive, time consuming and have low specificity.Our aim was to evaluate the current diagnosis of LS and to investigate the role of clinically based mutation probability methods (MMR pro,  Wijnen) to optimize it. We included 229 consecutive patients, counseled between 2000 and 2008, who fulfilled the revised Bethesda criteria and underwent further diagnosis of LS. From them, 67 (29%) had an  MSI tumor, 39 of them (17%) was due to LS. The average MMR pro score of LS patients was 0,73 (95% CI 0,63 0,82), significantly higher than the average score of non LS patients (p <0,001). A score of more  than 0,9 was present in 12% of all cases, 55% of them were LS. An MMR pro score <0.2 was obtained in 93 (41%) of patients, including three with LS. All three patients fulfilled the Amsterdam II (AMS II)  criteria compared to only one in the non LS group.Based on these results a diagnostic flowchart was designed, as follows: MSI is not performed if MMR Pro scores <0.20 (except for cases that are AMS II positive) or >0.90. In the high score group detection of the four MMR proteins and/or direct DNA sequencing of the MMR genes can be performed. This approach was validated in 67 additional patients: 49% could be excluded from tumor analysis without missing any LS.Therefore, integrating mutation probability scores in diagnosis of LS, can reduce the number of tumors tested by half with the same sensitivity.",2011

In  particular, MSH6 UVs account for a substantial proportion of these UVs. This study has been performed to evaluate the pathogenicity of five of such inherited MSH6 UVs found in patients suspected of Lynch syndrome.The mutated MSH6 proteins, all containing single amino acid substitutions, were tested for expression, stability and sub cellular  localization in an MSH2/MSH6 proficient cell line (HEK293T). Moreover, interaction of the MSH6 mutants with MSH2 was analyzed by yeast two hybrid experiments.Protein expression of the MSH6 mutants p.Ser144Ile, p.Ala326Val, p.Gln522Arg, p.Ala1021Asp, and p.Thr1219Ile was comparable with the expression of wild type MSH6 co expressed with MSH2. Analysis of MSH6 expression levels by real time PCR corroborated these  findings. These experiments showed a high similarity between the protein and the gene expression patterns. Furthermore, no effects were observed on protein protein interactions and all five MSH6 UVs showed a normal nuclear localization.

Tumors associated with Lynch syndrome are characterized  by microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of expression of one or more MMR proteins. In a considerable number of patients with tumors that fulfill these criteria a germline mutation cannot be identified. To elucidate the cause of the MMR deficiency in these tumors, we analyzed whether somatic mutations in the suspected MMR gene could explain the phenotype.Methods   In total 13 unexplained MLH1 deficient tumors and 9 unexplained MSH2 deficient tumors were screened for somatic mutations in MLH1 and MSH2, respectively. Results   In 10 out of 22 (45%) tumors one mutation could be identified that was not present in the surrounding normal tissue. In 4 MSH2  and 3 MLH1 deficient tumors (32% in total), a second mutation or LOH was identified.Conclusion    In 10 tumors, especially those that are MLH1 deficient,  we could only identify one mutation, suggesting the presence of an as yet unidentified second mutation in either the tumor or the germline.

The cumulative risks by age 40 did not exceed 2% for endometrial cancer and 1% for ovarian cancer, irrespective of the gene. The lifetime risks for other tumor types did not exceed 3%.Compared with MLH1 or MSH2 mutations, MSH6 mutations were associated with markedly lower cancer risks of both colorectal and gynecologic cancers. Lifetime ovarian and endometrial cancer risks associated with MLH1 or MSH2 mutations were high but increased only after age 40.

The colorectal and ovarian tumours were microsatellite unstable, the Grawitz tumour was not. All three tumours showed loss of the MSH6 protein demonstrated by immunohistochemical expression. Recently, our patient developed a paraganglioma; MMR staining and microsatellites will be tested after surgery. Grawitz tumours and paragangliomas have so far not been associated with Lynch syndrome; analysis of the paraganglioma is pending. Our case demonstrates that germline MSH6 mutations can be associated with a previously unreported diversity of tumours.

Using karyotyping, SNP and CGH arrays, and RNA seq, we have identified SCNA affecting gene expression (âSCNA genesâ) in seven human metastatic melanoma cell lines.

PeltomÃ¤ki","Department of Medical Genetics, Haartman Institute, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","MicroRNAs are small noncoding RNAs that contribute to tumorigenesis  by acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes. Many miRNA genes have associated CpG islands, suggesting epigenetic regulation of their expression. Compared to sporadic cancers, the role of miRNAs in hereditary or familial cancer is poorly understood. A custom  Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MS MLPA) assay, developed for 11 miRNA loci, was used to study 96 CRC, 58 GC, and 41 EC, occurring as part of inherited DNA MMR deficiency (Lynch syndrome), familial CRC without MMR gene mutations, or sporadically. Compared with the respective normal tissues, the predominant alteration in tumor tissues was increased methylation for the miRNAs 1 1, 124a 1,124a 2,124a 3, 148a, 152, and 18b; decreased methylation for 200a and 208a; and no major change for 373 and let 7a 3. Interestingly, by linear correlation  analysis, we found that miRNAs methylation was significantly correlated with transcriptional repression, indicating the observed methylation changes are likely to be functionally important. Moreover, hypermethylation at miRNA loci correlated with hypermethylation at classical TSG promoters in the same tumors. Furthermore, evaluation of global levels of DNA methylation using LINE 1 as a surrogate marker, were assessed by developing a second MS MLPA assay. Preliminary observations indicate that FCCX tumors, besides including high and low methylator subgroups based on TSG and miRNA loci (studied by MS MLPA), also showed evidence of global hypomethylation based on LINE 1. Our results highlight the importance of epigenetic events in hereditary and sporadic cancers and suggest that MS MLPA is an excellent choice for quantitative analysis of methylation.",2011
 m icrosatellite instability detection by high resolution melting analysis,P06.146,"R. Janavicius, D. MatiukaitÄ, L. GriÅ¡keviÄius","Hematology, oncology and transfusion medicine center, Vilnius, Lithuania","BACKGROUND: Microsatellite instability (MSI) is an important  marker for screening for hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome) as well as a prognostic and predictive marker for sporadic colorectal cancer (CRC). The mononucleotide microsatellite marker panel is a well established and superior alternative to the  traditional Bethesda MSI analysis panel, and does not require testing for corresponding normal DNA. The most common MSI detection techniques fluorescent capillary electrophoresis and denaturing HPLC (DHPLC) both have advantages and drawbacks. A new high resolution melting (HRM) analysis method enables rapid identification of heteroduplexes in amplicons by their lower thermal stability, a technique that overcomes the main shortcomings of capillary electrophoresis and DHPLC.METHODS: We investigated the straightforward application of HRM  for the detection of MSI in 70 archival CRC samples. HRM analysis for 2 MSI markers (BAT25 and BAT26) was evaluated, and 2 different HRM enabled instruments were compared the LightCyclerÂ® 480 (Roche Diagnostics) and the LightScanner(TM) (Idaho Technology). We also determined the analytical sensitivity and specificity of the HRM assay on both instruments using 11 known MSI positive and 54 microsatellite stable CRC samples.RESULTS: All MSI positive samples were detected on both instruments (100% analytical sensitivity). The LightScanner performed better for analytical specificity, giving a combined specificity value of 99.1% compared with 92.3% on the LightCycler 480.Cancer genetics223 CONCLUSIONS: We expanded the application of the HRM analysis  method as an effective MSI detection technique for clinical samples, which can be used to include additional markers.",2011

Constitutional MLH1 methylation, as causes of Lynch syndrome  (LS), is a rare condition that might be underestimated because of an inadequate analysis strategy. A total of 61 index subjects from Spanish families suspected of having LS and with immunohistochemical loss of expression of MLH1, were recruited from the Genetic Counseling in Cancer units from the Comunidad Valenciana. Somatic MLH1 methylation and germline mutations were assessed by MS MLPA and sequencing plus MLPA, respectively.MLH1 somatic methylation was negative in 38 cases and MLH1 germline mutations were present in 12 of them (31.6%). The remaining 26 cases were triple negative for MLH1 expression, methylation  and mutation. MLH1 somatic methylation was detected in 23 cases (37.7%). Sixteen of these patients were analyzed for constitutional MLH1 methylation and we found one case with MLH1 methylation in peripheral blood, colorectal mucosa of normal appearance and oral mucosa epithelial. This subject was diagnosed of colorectal cancer at age of 30, with no familial history of cancer and initially considered as a sporadic cancer with microsatellite instability.Our results show that 6.25% (1/16) of the tumors with loss of expression of MLH1 and somatic methylation, had actually, a constitutional silencing of MLH1 gene by methylation. The LS genetic/epigenetic  diagnosis strategy should incorporate the constitutional methylation analysis in all cases where MLH1 tumor methylation is detected.",2011

We have added to our molecular diagnostic procedure a functional minigene assay that assesses the impact on splicing of VUS identified in the MLH1 and MSH2 genes, involved in the Lynch syndrome. The assay  relies on the use of patient genomic DNA, which is always available in the molecular diagnostic laboratory. We have so far tested a total of 167 VUS (105 in MLH1 and 62 in MSH2), corresponding to 50 intronic  and 117 exonic variants, identified in the French national network of oncogenetic laboratories. We found that 49 VUS (29%) have an effect on splicing. Among them, 32 VUS (19%) lead to a major splicing defect by affecting intronic or exonic sequences close to a splice site or by creating a new splice site. In addition, 17 VUS are responsible for incomplete effects on splicing. Using an ESE (enhancer splicing regulatory element) dependent splicing assay, we showed that 4 VUS potentially affect splicing regulatory elements. Moreover, using this assay, we identified ESE containing sequences in eight different exonic regions of the MLH1 gene and four exonic regions of the MSH2 gene. Functional splicing minigene assays represent powerful tools to assess the impact of variants on splicing and can be used as a complementary approach to RT PCR analyses of patient blood RNA, together with clinical and family data and tumor analyses.",2011

We investigated chromosomal aberrations in 408 MPN patients using high resolution SNP microarrays to identify disease associated somatic lesions. Of the 408 patients 37.5% had a wild type karyotype and 62.5% harbored between one and fifteen chromosomal aberrations. We identified 25 chromosomal regions that were recurrently affected (in at least three patients).

Certainly during cell proliferation genetic profile of tumor cells changes. It is influenced by genetic abnormality background or tumors surrounding environment. This change is reflected in tumor behavior witch fluctuates from regression to more aggressiveness.The aim of this study is to compare genetic modifications between primitive and cultured neuroblastic tumor. Using MLPA, we followed the evolution of chromosomal rearrangement before and after in vitro proliferation of neuroblastic metastatic lymphadenopathy cells. Our results show that in vitro proliferation leads to the loss of initial genetic abnormalities noticed in fresh metastatic tumor cells. Whereas the primitive tumor seems to be of a very bad prognosis because of its localization, size, and patientsâ age.This comparative study demonstrates that analysis of genetic markers  of cultured metastatic lymphadenopathy cells does not reflect the status of these same markers in fresh metastatic tissue. Such results indicate that analysis of genetic markers even performed on fresh  metastatic lymphadenopathy cells does not reflect the genetic status of primitive NB. Therefore, tumor prognosis and therapeutic strategy that flows from could not rely on metastatic cells analysis.In fact, either a differentiation or a dedifferentiation of primitive tumor cells once migrated in metastatic lymphadenopathy could occur.",2011

Cutaneous neurofibromas occur in virtually all adults with NF1 appearing at puberty and increasing in number and size with age and pregnancy. They are composed  of multiple cell types, and are traditionally believed to arise from small nerve tributaries of the skin. Genetically, neurofibromas are lesions characterized by a bi allelic inactivation of the NF1 gene in a subpopulation of Schwann cells, but the tumorigenesis can only occur in an NF1 +/  background. The NF1 /  genotype obviously provides these  cells with a growth advantage, but it is not known what proportion of  the Schwann cells within a cutaneous neurofibroma carries an NF1  /  genotype and how much of the tumor growth can be explained by  the increase in the number of other cells with an NF1+/  genotype. In  the present study, our aim was to further elucidate the pathogenesis of cutaneous neurofibromas. The histological analyses of apparently normal skin from NF1 patients revealed minute neurofibromas, presumably in the early stages of development, in the immediate  vicinity of the hair follicular apparatus. Furthermore, we showed that human cutaneous neurofibromas contain multipotent NF1+/   precursor cells capable of differentiating in vitro into cell types found in neurofibromas, including Schwann cells, fibroblasts and epithelial cells. Together these results suggest that the multipotent cells present in the hair follicles may contribute to the development of cutaneous neurofibromas.",2011

NSCLC comprises about 80% of all lung cancer cases worldwide.  Surgery is most effective treatment for patients with early stage disease. However, 30   55% of these patients develop recurrence within 5 years. Therefore, markers that can be used to accurately classify early stage NSCLC patients into different prognostic groups  may be helpful in selecting patients who should receive specific therapies.Previously published dataset [1] was used to evaluate gene expression profiles of NSCLC different subtypes. Moderated two sample t test from R package LIMMA was used to find differentially expressed genes between all tumor samples and adjacent controls, SCC samples and AC/BC samples. The gene expression microarray results were validated using qRT PCR . Bayesian regression analysis and Kaplan Meier survival analysis were performed to determine  metagenes associated with survival.We identified 599 genes which were down regulated and 402 genes which were up regulated in NSCLC compared to the normal lung tissue and 112 genes which were up regulated and 101 genes which were down regulated in AC/BC compared to the SCC. Further, for stage Ib patients the metagenes potentially associated with survival were identified.Genes that expressed differently between normal lung tissue and cancer showed enrichment in gene ontology terms which were associated with mitosis and proliferation. Bayesian regression and Kaplan Meier analysis showed that gene expression patterns and metagene profiles can be applied to predict the probability of different survival outcomes in NSCLC patients. 1.

MicroRNAs (miRNAs), small noncoding RNA molecules, are important gene regulators on transcriptional level and involved in variety of cancers, including non small cell lung cancer. In the current study, we analyzed the expression levels of 858 miRNAs  in 38 Estonian non small cell lung cancer samples (stages I and II) and 27 adjacent non tumorous tissue samples using Illumina miRNA array. We identified 47 up regulated and 30 down regulated miRNAs in cancer samples compared with the normal lung tissue (P<0.01). Aberrantly were expressed several well known tumorigenesis related miRNAs (up regulated miR 9, miR 182 and miR 205, down regulated miR 101, miR 130a and miR 206), as well as some miRNAs with currently unknown function (up regulated mir 708 and miR 941, down regulated miR 1273). We also identified one miRNA, which expression showed association with patient survival (miR 374a). The  combinatorial effect of most aberrantly expressed miRNAs is predicted to affect pathways involved in cell migration, differentiation and growth, e.g. focal adhesion, cytoskeleton regulation and several signaling pathways.",2011

Non small cell lung cancer (NSLC) is the leading cause of death  related to cancer worldwide. The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently overexpressed in the NSLC. Somatic mutations of the EGFR are associated with the response of advanced NSLC to EGFR specific tyrosine kinase inhibitors. The most significant of the  reported EGFR mutations were several types of deletions in exon 19 and missense mutation p.Leu858Arg in exon 21, which account for about 90% of all mutations.In the presented study, we have analyzed EGFR mutations in NSLC tumours from 141 patients. Samples were tested by direct sequencing of exons 19 (deletions) and 20 (insertions) and by SNaPshot analysis of exons 18 (p.Gly719Ala/Ser/Cys), 20 (p.Ser768Ile, p.Thr790Met) and 21 (p.Leu858Arg, p.Leu861Gln). Altogether 9 mutated samples were identified, 6 of them carried mutation p.Leu858Arg in exon 21  and 3 harboured c.2235_2249del15 in exon 19. Mutation detection rate has been estimated at 6.4%.To achieve an optimal quality of material and higher percentage of tumor cells, we used and compared different approaches. We have isolated tumor DNA from bronchial swabs, FFPE biopsies and also peripheral blood. However, after comparation, acquisition of adequate material for DNA analysis still remains a problem.

One common genetic polymorphisms of the GSTM1 and GSTT1 genes, resulting from a homozygous deletion (null genotype)  leads to the lack of enzyme activity. The absence of GSTs enzymes involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics could lead to increased risk for OSSCs.In a case control study a possible association between GSTM1 and GSTT1 null polymorphisms and susceptibility to OSCCs was assessed by simultaneous analysis of both genes in a single reaction using real time PCR. Genotype discrimination was determined by melting curve analysis, using DNA extracted from 84 tumor and 175 control samples. After comparison of the melting peaks of the GSTM1 (215bp), GSTT1  (480bp) and control B globin (110bp) genes, the following results were obtained: 45% of tumor samples had the GSTM1 null genotype vs only 33% of controls samples (p,0.04; Fisherâs exact test).

Doing this we also identified at least two adjacent changed clones. Finally, we characterized the smallest regions of overlap for gains. This allowed us to determine anomalies strongly associated to the disease such as: deletions at 8p23 and 8p21 or amplifications at 8q24.21 and 8q13.2 The resolution of array CGH gives an almost direct link to the human genome sequence and, hence, to a list of candidate genes.

As still a significant  proportion of our families are lacking mutations in these known genes,  we decided to screen them for mutations in another recently detected predisposing gene for breast cancer, called PALB2/FANCN.Using direct sequencing, dHPLC  and/or HRM based technologies, we performed a comprehensive mutation analysis of the entire PALB2  gene  in 818 familial cases of breast cancer from Germany. All affected  index patients had been screened for small nucleotide alterations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 and tested negative for pathogenic mutations. We found seven truncating PALB2 mutations (six of them novel) and two  novel, potentially pathogenic missense mutations. Only one mutation, previously reported in another population, was identified in the German population. Remarkably, also some cases of ovarian cancer were reported for these PALB2 families, and breast tumor samples were either hormone receptor positive or negative.Therefore, our observations indicate firstly, low prevalence of deleterious PALB2 mutations, supporting the existence of individually  rare disease causing mutations, and secondly, a specific mutation profile within the German population, requiring screening of each population separately.

PALB2 (âPartner and Localizer of BRCA2â) is a breast cancer  susceptibility gene of moderate penetrance, accounting for about 1% of BRCA1/2 negative familial and early onset breast cancers. PALB2 encodes a protein that functions in genome maintenance. This protein interacts with BRCA2 and BRCA1, and it is required in the double  strand break repair. Different recent analyses suggested that the frequency of PALB2 mutations could be increased in breast cancer families with cases of pancreatic cancer.We aimed to evaluate the contribution of PALB2 mutations in 138 BRCA1/2 negative families with pancreatic cancer cases, collected from 11 centers throughout Spain. For this, direct sequencing and MLPA analysis of PALB2 gene has been performed.We identified two novel truncating mutations, the nonsense c.1653T>A (p.Tyr551Stop) located at exon 4 and the frameshift c.3362del  (p.Gly1121ValfsX3) in exon 13 together with one missense variant in the second base of exon 3 (c.110G>A, p.Arg37His), likely affecting the splicing process. None of these families had ovarian cancer. Moreover, 11 common polymorphisms and 9 rare or unique variants of uncertain clinical significance, 7 not previously reported, have been detected.Conclusion: In our series of breast ovarian cancer families with pancreatic cancer cases the frequency of PALB2 truncating mutations was 1.45% (2/138).

Kausitz",St,"Elisabeth Cancer Institute, Bratislava, Slovakia. Papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) is a common endocrine malignancy that  frequently harbors the oncogenic V600E BRAF mutation. As a novel prognostic molecular marker, this mutation has received considerable attention in recent years for its potential utility in the risk stratification and management of PTC. Many studies have reported that the BRAF  mutation is a marker of poor prognosis. The presence of the BRAF mutations in papillary thyroid cancer patients correlates with older age, extrathyroidal tumor invasion, distant metastases, higher tumor stage, and even higher rates of recurrent disease. Use of this unique molecular marker, in conjuction with conventional clinicopathological risk factors, to assist the prognostication of PTC is likely to improve the efficiency of contemporary management of thyroid cancer.The aim of our study was to establish methods for rapid, sensitive and cost efficient detection of BRAF mutation status in tumour tissues.  As we have a lot of experience with SNaPshot analysis for detection  of somatic mutations, we have concentrated on this method. The sensitivity of SNaPshot analysis (2 2.5%) is comparable to commercial DxS BRAF mutation test kit (1%). We used the optimized SNaPshot analysis to detect somatic mutations in BRAF gene in the set of 124 patient samples, and detected mutations in 54 tumours (43,5%).

They showed that development of the rare tumor, paraganglioma, occurs exclusively upon transmission via the paternal line. The causative gene, SDHD, encodes a subunit of mitochondrial succinate  dehydrogenase. The genomic mechanism behind this phenomenon was studied by Hensen and colleagues, who presented a model involving an imprinted modifier gene located on Ch11p15.5.Here we describe three cases of apparent maternal transmission of an SDHD mutation, leading to a paraganglioma or pheochromocytoma. We established the mode of inheritance of the mutations by analyzing all available family members. We then carried out both genetic and functional analyses of the available tumors to confirm bone fide SDHD related tumorigenesis. We found convincing genetic and functional evidence for the maternally related occurrence of a case of pheochromocytoma, and suggestive evidence in a pre operative case with vagal and carotid body paragangliomas. Haplotype analysis of tumor DNA from the first patient demonstrated somatic recombination, resulting in the loss of the paternal region of chromosome 11 including the remaining functional copy of SDHD, and the maternal chromosome including the centromere and the p arm. The third case appears to be sporadic, with no functional or genetic evidence to support a causal link between the mutation and the tumor. These data conform to the Hensen model and show that the transmission of SDHD mutations via the maternal line can, in rare cases, lead to tumorigenesis.",2011

Detailed characterization of diagnosis and relapse samples has shown that both disease presentations are clonally related in most cases, but may also show distinct genomic features. In contrast, consecutive  leukemic presentations of patients with a suspected predisposition to leukemia are expected to be fully discordant at the genomic level. Recently, we characterized diagnosis and presumed relapse samples of 22 patients with very late disease recurrence (>2.5 years), and identified eight patients with fully discordant leukemic presentations (Szczepanski et al., J.Clin.Oncol., in press). One patient showed a germline deletion comprising the recombination activating genes RAG1  and RAG2, and regulatory sequences of LMO2, genes frequently  affected somatically in T ALL, suggesting genomic predisposition to  leukemia.In the current study, we sequenced the exomes of remission and both leukemic samples of two patients with late discordant T ALL recurrences. In one of the patients, the two leukemic samples harbored 106 unique independent rare variants. Four genes were recurrently affected, suggesting an important role in leukemogenesis. In addition, 215 rare variants were shared between the two leukemic samples and remission sample, of which 5 nonsense, 1 canonical splice site, 4 potential frameshift and 54 non synonymous missense variants at highly conserved positions. Filtering of these variants for known T ALL associated genes resulted in several interesting novel candidate predisposing genes. We conclude that a considerable proportion of late T ALL recurrences may in fact represent second leukemias,  caused by predisposing germline abnormalities.",2011

Patients (30 male and 20 female) were in stage II and III of cancer and had no received prior chemotherapy and radiotherapy.Results 32/50, 36/24 and 24/50 of patients expressed Pgp, MRP1  and MRP2 in their tumor region respectively, while 30/50, 38/50 and 7/50 of patients expressed three protein in their normal regions. Interestingly, MRP2 was over expressed in tumor tissues of patients. MRP1 and MDR1 were expressed in most tumor and normal tissue  with high intensity and extension. Also most of males expressed MRP1 protein compared to females patients (P,0.052). In the contrary MRP2 expression was observed in patients with low extension and intensity.Conclusion  Unlike MDR1 and MRP1, over expression of MRP2 was  frequently observed in cancerous region compare to normal. Therefore MRP2 is intrinsically not expressed in normal tissue of CRC patients. But malignancy of tumor was leaded to over expression of it. The mechanism in which MRP2 is over expressed in malignant colorectal  tumor remains to be clarified.

Irinotecan is indicated for the treatment of ovarian and cervical cancers  in the field of gynecologic oncology. The association between UGT1A1 polymorphism and adverse events associated with irinotecan therapy has conventionally been reported in relation to the dose of irinotecan, but no consensus has been reached on this issue. It is currently  thought that an association between gene polymorphism and adverse events is seen even at such low doses of irinotecan.The dose of irinotecan used as for gynecologic cancers is lower than that used for the treatment of other types of cancer. In addition, an association with gene polymorphisms other than *28 also draws attention in east Asia. Thus, we investigated the association between these UGT1A1 gene polymorphisms and onset of adverse events in gynecological patients treated with irinotecan.The study involved 49 patients treated with irinotecan at our hospital for  gynecological cancers. UGT1A1*28, *6, *27 and *60 were analyzed. The association between each gene polymorphism and adverse events was retrospectively examined. Adverse events associated with anti cancer drug therapy were evaluated in accordance with the CTCAE v4.0.The incidences of grade 3 or higher neutropenia and grade 3 or higher diarrhea were significantly increased in heterozygotes for UGT1A1*28 and *6 and homozygotes for UGT1A1*6. Furthermore, the incidence of grade 3 or higher diarrhea was significantly increased in patients having any of UGT1A1 polymorphism.These findings revealed that an association between UGT1A1 polymorphism and onset of adverse events also exists in patients treated with irinotecan at low doses.",2011

This endocrine disorder occurs in approximately 75 % as a sporadic disease, or as a hereditary disorder either as a component of cancer syndromes: multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2 ( germ line mutations  in the RET proto oncogene located on 10q11.2), von Hippel Lindau syndrome ( germ line mutations in the VHL tumour suppressor gene located on 3p26 p25) and, much lesser in neurofibromatosis type 1 (germ line mutations in the NF1 gene) also known as von Recklinghausen disease or nonsyndromic familial disease. Germline mutations in genes SDHB (1p36.1 p35) and SDHD (11q23) that encode subunits of succinate dehydrogenase, which participate in aerobic electron transport and the Crebs tricarboxylic acid cycle, have been identified to cause susceptibility to familial pheochromocytoma. Head and neck paraganglioma is tumour of chromaffin cells, which Cancer genetics230 arise from parasympathetic ganglia, most commonly at the bifurcation  of the carotid artery (carotid body tumour). The causes of the hereditary paragangliomas are germline mutations in the SDHB, SDHC (1q23) and SDHD genes, which encode three of the four subunits of enzyme succinate dehydrogenase (SDH). Genomic imprinting might be a  possible cause as mentioned in some recent studies.Among 205 sporadic pheochromocytoma patients 7 germline mutations were found in the VHL gene. Further, 11 mutations in SDHB gene were detected. In addition, in 4 examined patients with paraganglioma we detected mutation of the start codon in SDHD gene.",2011

Alcohol metabolism primarily imply three groups of  enzymes: alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH), cytochrome P 450 oxidase (CYP) and acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH). Several studies have suggested that certain polymorphisms of those enzymes  could be carcinogenic susceptibility factors associated with alcohol consumption. Due to the high incidence of oral and larynx cancer in our region, the aim of this study was to analyze the ADH1B (rs1229984), ADH1C (rs698 and rs1693482), CYP2E1 (rs2031920 and rs3813867) and ALDH2 (rs440 and rs886205) polymorphisms in our region. m ethods: We analyzed 326 samples: 46 patients with an oral  carcinoma, 38 patients with a larynx carcinoma, and 242 controls.  DNA was extracted from oral cytological samples using a phenol chloroform isoamilalcohol method. The genotypes were determined  by PCR using Taqman assays.Results: When comparing the distribution of alleles, we only found  differences between the controls and HNSCC cases for ADH1B (p,0.014) and ADH1C rs1693482 (p,0.034).

More  frequently androgen receptor (AR) gene expression was increased relatively to expression in healthy tissue: in 90% of cases more than twice and in 40%   more than 5 times. The CYP17 was activated only in 15% of cases. At least one of the angiogenic cascade genes was activated in 50% of cases but never all three genes investigated (VEGF121, VEGF165, PDGFR ) simultaneously. All but one of PTEN decreasing cases (40%) were accompanied by PI3K and mTOR expression increasing. The mTOR expression was increased in 73% of cases. All activated HER2 cases (27%) coincided with increased  mTOR. Likewise, EGFR was co activated with PI3K and mTOR. It is interesting that increased PTEN expression coincided with increased mTOR but not with PI3K (increased in 50% of cases). Possibly, the mTOR may be activated in these cases by another way than through PI3K/AKT.In summary, we shown simultaneouse activation a number of genes important for prostate cancer development. For this reason targeted monotherapy may not be effective and combined therapy aimed at several genes are required.

Recent studies have differentiated new PC susceptibility loci on 8q24, one of them overlapping a breast  cancer associated region (Al Olama AA et al, 2009; Yeagers M et al, 2009). In the current study we attempted to replicate these findings in a case control study of Bulgarian PC patients.Material and methods: Using TaqManÂ® method, 183 PC samples and 183 controls were genotyped. Allele, genotype and haplotype analyses  were performed for the polymorphic variants rs1016343, rs4871008, rs7841060, rs620861 on locus 8q24. Results: The variant rs620861 did not show association with increased PC risk.

We  assessed the miRNA expression profile of a panel of 10 clear cell renal cell carcinoma derived cell lines and compared this with the miRNA expression profile of two PTECs. Eight microRNAs were significantly more abundant (p,0.05) in the ccRCC cell lines as compared to the PTEC cells. Fifteen microRNAs were significantly less abundant in the ccRCC cell lines. The latter set includes all members of the miR 200 family and miR 205 that are known to be involved in the epithelial  to mesenchymal transition process by directly repressing transcription factors ZEB1 and ZEB2. These transcription factors on their turn  strongly repress the expression of epithelial marker E cadherin, what indeed is observed in nine out of ten of our ccRCC derived cell lines. As microRNAs bring about a posttranscriptional downregulation of their target genes, we compared the miRNA profiles with the gene expression profiles of this set of ccRCC derived cell lines. The set of significantly upregulated genes appeared to be 4 fold enriched for genes that were validated targets of the miRNAs significantly downregulated in our panel of ccRCC cell lines. The expression levels of several genes showed an anticorrelation with the respective miR levels.",2011

The most commonly elevated expression in renal cancer relatively to expression in healthy renal tissue (distant from tumour regions) was observed in the genes  of VEGFR1, VEGFR2 and VEGF. Increased expression of at least two of these genes was observed in most of cases, half of the cases have been activated all three of these gene. A frequent lowering PDGFRÎ± expression was found. The level of expression is most pronounced (one to two orders of magnitude) differed in tumors relative to normal tissue in the genes of VEGFR1 and PDGFRÎ±. Moreover, the lowest level of gene expression PDGFRÎ± (500 times below normal)  corresponded to the smallest change in gene expression VEGFR1 in tumor compared with healthy tissue. Conversely, the unchanged level of gene expression PDGFRÎ± correspond to an increase of approximately 80 times the level of VEGFR1 gene expression in the tumor. In half of the cases expression of the EGFR was increased. The PTEN expression was observed as increased 4 fold in tumor and so reduced by 3 times compared to control tissue.The findings provide information about the gene functional features in renal cancer and can be used in future for the development of optimal schemes of effective individualized treatment of patients with renal cell  carcinoma.",2011

One of clear cell renal carcinoma (CC RCC) features is the inactivation of tumour suppressor gene VHL (von Hippel Lindau). The aim of investigation was to analyze somatic mutations in VHL  gene in 72 CC RCC patients from Bashkortostan Republic. SSCP analysis followed by direct DNA sequencing was used to investigate somatic VHL alterations.Mutations of VHL have been identified in 10 of 72 samples (13.9%)  with CC RCC. All the identified mutations were somatic and found only in tumor tissues that allowed us to exclude a hereditary von Hippel Lindau syndrome and consider all cases as sporadic forms.Eight types of mutations were detected in 10 CC RCC patients: 2 insertions and 8 point mutations in the heterozygous state.  Insertions resulted in frameshifts. In the 2nd exon of the VHL gene  we revealed: p.His115Tyr (in 1.4% of patients), p.Asp143Glu (1.4%) and p.Pro154Leu (2.8%), which change the structure of the binding of HIF 1Î± in Î² domain. In the 3d exon of the VHL gene we revealed  mutations: p.Val170Phe at 1.4% of patients, p.Arg176Trp (1.4%), p.179_Leu178dup (1.4%), p.Glu186_Asp187ins (2.8%), p.Glu186Lys (1.4%), which involve a violation of section interaction elongin C Î± domain.

The pathogenesis of RCC may be related to higher levels of exposure to certain risk factors. Epidemiological studies showed that environmental factors may be involved in sporadic RCC development. This case control study was designed to test for an association between genetic polymorphism of xenobiotic metabolism enzymes and risk of sporadic RCC. Genomic DNA was obtained from 130 patients with RCC (Russians, Tatars, Bashkirs) and 117 controls matched for age, gender, ethnic origin and area of residence. We used PCR RFLP to investigate polymorphism for the most common alleles at GSTM1 and CYP1A1.The null genotype frequency distribution of GSTM1 gene (0/0 GSTM1) in RCC patients didnât differ statistically significanty from that of the control group (P>0.05). There were interethnic distinctions  between control groups of Turkic and Slavic origins. The frequency of 0/0 GSTM1 genotype in Turkic group was 0,291, whereas in Slavic  0,444 (Ï2,5,133, P,0,023). The analysis of Ile462Val polymorphism between patients and controls didnât reveal statistically significant differences (P>0.05).

Cytogenetic abnormalities of presumed prognostic significance include karyotype complexity and allelic losses from the short arm of chromosome 1 and from the long arms of chromosomes  11, 16 and 22 and 1q gain. Genetic alterations seem to be of importance for morphology and tumor growth in distinct subtypes of renal cell carcinomas (RCC), thus distinct abnormalities may assist histologic subtyping. Reports of chromosomal analysis of RCC in children are scarce.We present a series of 27 WT, mostly without pre operation chemotherapy, 2 congenital mesoblastic nephromas (CMN) and 3 rare childhood renal tumors   RCC. We have detected numerical as well as structural changes in WT, which mostly involved chromosome 1, either  presenting with a deletion of 1p or the formation of an isochromosome 1q. One WT presented with an i(7)(q10) as the sole cytogenetic change, an aberration characteristic for adult WT. One RCC patient displayed the t(X;1) as the sole cytogenetic abnormality, another one showed numerical aberrations similar to those seen in adults. To gain further insight into genetic events responsible for the pathogenesis, arrayCGH was performed. This technique yielded results not seen by cytogenetics or in cytogenetically unsuccessful cases.

In 2010 the patient presented with recurrent disease and underwent surgical treatment including resection of neck lymph nodes. Histological and immunohistochemical studies revealed the presence of concurrent MTC and PTC metastases in all resected nodes, with significant predominance of MTC. Postoperative CT was 20 pg/ml (N,2 6 pg/ml). Pheochromocytoma, hyperparathyroidism and MEN 2B associated abnormalities were excluded. Familial history, clinical and biochemical examination of first degree relatives were negative for MEN 2A and  familial medullary thyroid carcinoma.

This unexplained parent of origin effect is not due to imprinting of SDHD itself as SDHD is biallelically expressed in several tissues. In paternally inherited SDHD there is loss of the entire maternal chromosome 11 in  tumour DNA, implying that tumourigenesis requires loss of maternal SDHD and a further, imprinted, tumour suppressor gene (TSG).We report the second case of an SDHD related tumour (a phaeochromocytoma in a 33 year old woman possessing the common pathogenic mutation, p.Pro81Leu) occurring after maternal transmission. It is the first reported investigation of tumour DNA in this situation. Tumour DNA revealed loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at paternal 11q23 causing loss of the wild type SDHD allele and LOH affecting maternal 11p15, including H19. These two LOH regions  were separated by a region exhibiting clearly retained heterozygosity, containing SDHAF2 (a recently reported paraganglioma TSG), which therefore appears uninvolved here.This case provides molecular evidence that the tumourigenic requirement for maternal 11p15 loss (in addition to inactivation of both SDHD alleles) drives the observed parent of origin effect. Paternal inheritance of SDHD mutations is more commonly associated with tumour formation as the necessary loss of both the wild type SDHD allele and maternal 11p15 can occur by a single event (loss of maternal chromosome 11). These findings have important implications regarding the clinical management of carriers of maternally inherited SDHD mutations   who we confirm can develop phaeochromocytomas   and the understanding of the parent of origin effect.",2011

Histone acetylation is a major mechanism to regulate gene  transcription. This post translational modification is modified in cancer cells. In various tumor types levels of acetylation at several histone residues are associated to clinical aggressiveness. By using immunohistochemistry we show that acetylated levels of lysines at Cancer genetics237 positions 9, 14 and 18 (K9 K14 and K18) of H3 histone are higher  in papillary thyroid carcinomas (PTC) than in corresponding normal tissues. Differently, in thyroid undifferentiated carcinomas (UC), only higher levels of K9 K14 acetylation is observed. By using rat thyroid cell lines stably transfected with doxycyclin inducible oncogenes, we  show that the oncoproteins RET PTC, RAS and BRAF increases levels of acetylated K9 K14 and K18. All these oncogenes activate MAP kinase (MAPK) pathway. The involvement of this signal pathway in the modulation of the H3 acetylation was confirmed by studying the effects of its inhibition. Human thyroid cell line WRO, treated with the MAPK inhibitor PD98059, reduces acetylated levels of these lysine residues. In the non tumorigenic rat thyroid cell line FRTL 5, TSH increases levels of acetylated K18. However, this hormone decreases levels of acetylated K9 K14. In conclusion, our data indicate that the  MAPK signalling pathway and TSH control levels of several acetylated lysines in the context of the H3 histone.",2011
 c ontribution of constitutional TP53 mutations to Wilms tumour,P06.206,"H. L. Hanson , S. Hanks, A. Murray, R. Linger, J. Douglas, .. FACT  Collaboration, N. Rahman","Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom","Wilms tumour is the commonest renal tumour occurring in childhood  and has been reported to occur at increased frequency in Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS), a cancer predisposition syndrome predominantly associated with sarcoma, breast, brain and adrenocortical cancers. Constitutional TP53 mutations are identified in up to three quarters  of families with clinically defined classic LFS. Mutations are typically  missense changes at hotspot codons within the DNA binding domain.We sought to investigate the contribution of constitutional TP53 mutations to Wilms tumour outside the context of LFS. We undertook mutation analysis of TP53 in 489 individuals affected with Wilms  tumour recruited from Paediatric Oncology centres in the UK. WT1  and 11p15 defects had been excluded in all cases.Overall no clearly pathogenic mutations were identified. Two non synonymous missense variants were identified; V197A and T256A,  neither is reported on the IARC TP53 database and both are predicted to retain at least partial function of transactivation capacity in a yeast assay. Although both are located in the DNA binding domain they are not at recognised hotspots and we have also observed non hotspot variants in this domain in a control series (6/1334, p,1.0). Furthermore V197A was present in an unaffected parent and we have observed T256A in a clinical LFS family in which the variant does not segregate with cancer. These data suggest that constitutional TP53 mutations do  not make an appreciable contribution to Wilms tumour susceptibility, outside the context of a family history of LFS.",2011

Nucleotide change in promoter region and 6 coding exons is determined by sequencing in 36 patients and control group.Results: BAX gene expression level in tumoral tissue of 62.5% of patients was higher than adjacent tissue, in 12,5% it was lower and in 25% was equal. In blood cells of 20,83% of patients the level was higher than adjacent tissueâs one. SNP polymorphism was observed at 3 locus of this gene. c onclusion : Bax gene sequence both in peripheral blood lymphocytes  and in tumoral cells of patients was homogenous so it is possible to  detect nucleotide change only by peripheral blood lymphocytes and to receive information about this gene expression since the significant relation between heterozygosity in promoter region and expression decrease has been clarified in this study.",2011

Partitioning the allele frequency spectrum in distinct clusters hence can provide an idea of the number of clones present in the tumor cell mass. We here work with the output of tumor sequence data as generated on the 454 platform (Roche Sequencing) and apply clustering algorithm.

Although a few prevalent mutations have been identified with the sequencing of a single melanoma cell line, the full spectrum of somatic driver mutations remains unknown. We have performed exome sequencing to detect somatic mutations in protein  coding regions of seven melanoma cell lines (five unrelated and two derived from the same patient sampled 12 years apart) and their corresponding germline DNA. The number of coding non synonymous somatic mutations in the cell lines ranged from 158 to 709. The most abundant class of somatic mutations in all melanomas is C>T, a hallmark of exposure to UV light. In the two melanomas derived from the same patient two thirds of the somatic mutations were shared and showed signature of UV light; remaining mutations might have originated during the transition to the invasive phase. Six melanomas  had mutations in the BRAF gene around amino acid 600 and one had a mutation (Q61R) in the NRAS gene. In two melanomas we identified novel mutations in genes that are key regulators of the MAPK pathway. These mutations were also observed in two individuals in a larger sample collection. Remarkably, all cases have germline damaging rare variants in genes involved in the HR and NER pathways. The contribution of these variants to predisposition to melanoma is under investigation.

Baniahmad1","1Pasteur Institute of Iran, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2National Institute of  Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Maintaining normal body status is controlled by at least three important  metabolic cycles that closely regulate synthesis of amino acids and nucleotides. Normal cells use different sources of energy including glycogen, fatty acids and amino acids, but the key energy source is glucose for cell growth. Instead, tumour cells show unusual metabolic  pathways with significant re programming. Cancer cells need a lot of metabolic energy for their rapid proliferation, so a non oxidative energy source is used such as glucose. This re programmed activity underlies events in the physiology of tumour cells and sometimes generates harmful products such as reactive oxygen species or oxygen free radicals, and sometimes results in unequal storage of nucleotides for DNA synthesis that increases the mutation rate. Cancer cells have high rates of glycolysis and NADH oxidation that generate a lot of ROS. Re programming of genes involved in metabolic pathways is a sign of physiological changes in cancer cells. Expression of some genes is altered dramatically in different stages of tumour growth that directly control metabolic pathways. These changes are characteristic of tumour cells. They help tumour cells to become more aggressive. The genes involved in oncogenesis include GLUT1,  G6PD, TKTL1 and PGI/AMF in the glycolytic pathway, ACLY, FAS and  ACC1 in lipogenesis and RRM1, RRM2, and TYMS for synthesizing  nucleotides. Over expression of these genes in many cancer cells was  observed. Taken together, down regulation of these genes can inhibit tumorigenesis and tumour progression.",2011
Genetic basis of Rhabdomyosarcoma,J06.02,"M. Barath, P. Taskar, A. Kanugovi",Padmashree Dr,"D.Y.Patil University Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Navi Mumbai, India. Rhabdomyosarcoma is a cancer of cells which normally develop into  skeletal muscles, most common in children under the age of 10. A specific chromosomal abnormality, t(2;13)(q35;q14), was reported in many cases of advanced rhabdomyosarcoma patients by RT PCR, FISH and spectral karyotyping. The other frequent abnormalities  observed were rearrangements of chromosome 1p and trisomy of chromosome 8 using conventional cytogenetic techniques such as G banding. The translocation between chromosome 2 and chromosome 13 causes the movements of the gene called PAX3 (or PAX7 if itâs chromosome 1) right next to a gene called FKHR. Paired box (Pax) genes are a family of tissue specific transcription factors containing a paired domain and usually a partial or complete homeodomain. The PAX genes play an important role in causing cells to grow while an embryoâs muscle tissue is being formed, but these genes usually shut  down once theyâre no longer needed. The normal function of the FKHR gene is to activate other genes. Moving them together likely activates the PAX genes, which may lead to the formation of tumor. Complete trisomy 8 is a leading cause of miscarriage in women while infants with trisomy 8 mosaicism are likely to survive but with retarded psychomotor development and moderate to severe mental retardation. About 3% of all tumors are found to be rhabdomyosarcomas, with them being rare in teenagers and adults but constituting more than 50% of embryonic tumors making them detectable by chromosomal analysis during pre natal diagnosis.",2011

Various factors have been identified as playing an important role in stimulating this cancer. During the last decades the increasing incidence of breast cancer has made it the most prevalent cancer among young Iranian  women. The mean age of onset of breast cancer in Iranian women is about 10 years lower than that of their counterparts in developed countries.A new study of the prevalence of breast cancer in immigrants from Asian countries to Sweden suggested that there are some biological factors that caused early onset of breast cancer in immigrants, including Iranian women, compared to native women of Sweden. Epidemiological aspects of Iranian breast cancer are uncertain and unfortunately no study has specifically addressed breast cancer risk factors in young  Iranian women up to now. The purpose of this study was to investigate the influence of polymorphic variants defined by single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the displacement loop (D loop) region of Cancer genetics239 mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) on the risk of developing breast cancer in  young Iranian women. We used PCR and RFLP analysis in this study.

Background/Aim: To understand the genetic alterations of  K ras gene in North Indian patients with pancreatic diseases, and the possible correlation between the presence of mutation, histopathological findings and other risk factors are assessed by standard questionnaire.  m ethods: A total of 65 pancreatic cancer  patients, 50 chronic pancreatitis and 50 controls were inducted in the  study. K ras mutations were examined using the PCR RFLP, followed single strand confirmation polymorphism (SSCP) and automated DNA sequencing. Results: K ras mutational analysis in surgically  resected tissue samples of the pancreatic carcinoma was 72.30 %( 47/65) which was significantly higher than the chronic pancreatitis 6% (3/50) (P<0.01). It was also found that K ras mutation rate was progressively increased from normal duct at the tumor free resection margin to pancreatic carcinoma. The mutation pattern of Kras codon  12 observed in pancreatic carcinoma was GGT_GGA and this was identical in chronic pancreatitis also. In this study male showed more prevalence of K ras mutations than female. The age > 40 yrs showed statistically higher incidence of pancreatic cancer than chronic pancreatitis (P<0.05*). Smoking was found to be one of the risk factor for pancreatic cancer compared to chronic pancreatitis (p<0.05*). Other possible associated risk factors like alcohol consumption, diabetes, tea, coffee, Milk products and dietary habits were found to be statistically non significant.  c onclusion:  This study shows evidence  of K ras gene mutation to be statistically higher in pancreatic cancer compared to chronic pancreatitis and this suggests that K ras gene represent a critical early step in the genesis of pancreatic cancer.",2011

The cells were cuboidal  with moderate cytoplasm and oval uniform vesicular nuclei. Nuclear crowding was observed and the neoplasm showed molecular focal capsular invasion. Deletion of a part of chromosome 22q was reported. Recent studies have mapped tumor suppressor loci associated with meningioma and neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2) to 22q. The deleted region reported has been expected to consist of the region corresponding to that of the tumor suppressor genes associated with NF2 and meningiomas. In this case, t(2;3)(q13;p25) translocation and the PAX8 PPAR gamma1 fusion was also expected to be present.  Rap1, a member of Ras family, has been implicated in the regulation of oncogenic pathways in thyroid and it has been found to regulate the ERK cascade and it is specifically required for the RET/PTC induced activation of BRAF MEK ERK. Rap1 functions as a molecular switch which cycles between inactive GDP bound and active GTP bound forms. Rap1GAP, a GTPase activating protein, functions as negative regulator of Rap1 activity. It was also reported that loss of Rap1GAP function may be implicated in promotion of invasion in follicular thyroid carcinoma as the tumor was found to be minimally invasive. The study of extent of loss of Rap1GAP activity can be used to determine the degree of invasiveness of the tumor. P07 c ancer cytogenetic",2011

INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of  clonal haematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more of the major myeloid cell lines, ineffective haematopoiesis, and an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).  Chromosomal abnormalities are detected in half of  patients with the novo MDS, with losses and gains of genetic material being the most frequent cytogenetic findings. Balanced translocations are not frequently associated with MDS. Recurrent translocations associated with MDS are the t(3;21)(q26.2;q22.1),t(5;12)(q33;p13),  t(3;12)(q26;p13),t(11;16) (q23;p13.3),t(6;9)(p23; q34).OBJECTIVE: To identify the frequency of balanced translocations in patients diagnosed with MDS in our centre.PATIENTS AND METHODS: Four hundred and twenty cytogenetic studies were performed on bone marrow samples from patients diagnosed with MDS.RESULTS: Twenty seven balanced translocations were diagnosed in 23 (5,4%) patients, who were classified according to the WHO (2008) criteria: refractory anaemia (AR) (n,1), refractory cytopenia with  multilineage dysplasia (n,7), AR with excess of blasts 1 (n,8), AR with excess of blasts 2 (n,5), and chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia (n,1). Seventeen of the 27 (63%) translocations were found as a part of a complex karyotype (>,3 chromosomal abnormalities). Two new translocations (2;3)(p21;q26.2) and t(13;17)(q21;p13), were found in two patients. All chromosomes were involved in the translocations, with the exception of chromosomes 8, 18, 21 and Y.REMARKS: The infrequency of balanced translocations in MDS makes their identification and reporting imperative for the recognition of the recurrent ones. This increases the likelihood of identifying which genes are possibly involved in the pathogenesis of the neoplasia.",2011

Objective : BACs On Beadsâ¢ (BoBs) (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland)  has been recently validated by our team showing its robustness and versatility for evaluating chromosome abnormalities in pre natal diagnostic. In BoBs technology the Bacterial Artificial Chromosomes are immobilized onto encoded beads that are used to assay gains and  losses. We reported here our preliminary study on 12 breast tumor DNA from frozen tissue. Methods : We evaluate here the Karyolite, a new kit which could screen all abnormalities with 3 to 4 beads per chromosome. 3 BACs are encoded per beads to increase the specificity. 12 breast tumors DNA were extracted with phenol chloroform from frozen tissue. Karyolite BoBs was performed at Poissy hospital using a L200 Luminex and 44k Agilentâs CGH array at Institut Curie RenÃ© Huguenin. Results: Out of those 12 tumors DNA, no false positive result in BoB was found according to CGH array analysis. At the opposite, and  as suppose by the beads design, small chromosome abnormalities as segmental duplications or deletions were not retrieved. All large chromosome abnormalities (one to half of a chromosome arm) were identified without any ambiguity. Conclusions : For tumor analysis, BoBs technology could open very interesting outlets as it is cheaper, less time consuming (100ng of DNA), low material consumption, and rapid throughput. Position in diagnosis is still under discussion as only low number of locus are explored. However, this could be proposed as an alternative to CGH array with dedicated specific beads design to breast cancer chromosome abnormality.",2011

We aim to evaluate and compare the expression of various proteins/genes as markers  of progression, from early stage neoplasia right through to invasive carcinoma. Primary investigations will involve the use of a wide range of biomarkers including diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic markers, as well as identifying human papillomavirus status/type in correlation with abnormal expression patterns. Samples will include biopsy material from normal, low grade, high grade and invasive neoplasia.In particular we will be investigating the epithelial growth factor receptor (EGFR), as its over expression/activation has been identified  as a common feature of multiple cancer types and contributes to epithelial tumour growth. This will be evaluated through the use of specific antibodies directed against various domains of the receptor, as well as family dimerization partner human epidermal growth factor receptor 2 (HER2) and downstream effector proteins (AKT, p AKT and mTOR); involved in up regulation of mRNA translation, cellular growth, proliferation and survival (anti apoptosis). In addition to IHC, fluorescent insitu probes directed against the EGFR gene will allow for identification of increased gene copy number which contributes to accelerated tumour growth. Analysis of these biomarkers may yield information of use in predicting whether specific tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) chemotherapies directed against EGFR, could prove to be an effective future therapy for invasive cervical cancer patients.",2011

Familial pancreatic cancer (FPC) patients with a personal or family history of melanomas are therefore offered CDKN2A mutation analysis. On the other hand,  CDKN2A testing is not generally recommended in the literature in FPC families without a history of melanomas.Methods: FPC families were defined as families with clustering of PC and not meeting diagnostic criteria of specific other familial cancer syndromes. Medical details of cancer diagnoses were retrieved and reviewed. Blood samples were obtained for DNA isolation from PC patients or first degree relatives (FDR) and analyzed for mutations in CDKN2A.Results: Among 40 FPC families, DNA analyses were carried out  in 28 families (70%), leading to identification of CDKN2A mutations in six families (21.4%) None of the CDKN2A families fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome and in three CDKN2A families no melanomas and/or dysplastic nevi were observed. In these latter three families two different CDKN2A mutations were found; in two families the Dutch founder mutation p16 Leiden (c.225_243del, p.Ala76fs) and in the third family the c.19_23dup, p.Ser8fs mutation. After disclosure of the CDKN2A mutation in one of the families, a curable melanoma was diagnosed at subsequent dermatological surveillance in a 17 year old female family member.Conclusion: CDKN2A mutation analysis should be included in genetic testing in FPC families, even in the absence of reported melanomas.  This strategy will enhance the recognition of individuals at risk for PC and facilitate the early detection of melanomas.",2011

The patiens were divided into two groups.Using classical I FISH gain of hTERC gene was found in 8 (42 %) of 19 patiens with cervical carcinoma, all woman with hTERC gain were HPV positive and 63 % of them showed positive lymphovascular invasion.In 15 patiens we tested gain of hTERC and MYCC genes in HPV positive cells using new Vysis Cervical FISH Probe Kit and relationships between HPV infection, chromosomal alterations and diagnosis were analysed.Our work confirmed that gain of hTERC is significantly associated with cervical carcinoma and worse prognosis. Furthermore we conclude  that Vysis Cervical FISH Probe Kit can be used as effective diagnostic procedure to identity the patients carrying highly risking HPV infection and chromosomal aberrations associated with this malignancy.Supported by IGA NT11089 4/2010",2011

Monitoring of minimal residual disease in CML by detection of Philadelphia chromosome is an important part of response evaluation of patients in treatment with tirozinkinase inhibitors, because it allows early detection  of suboptimal response or resistance to treatment.Materials and Methods: We analyzed 25 bone marrow specimens using interphase FISH and compared the results with those of conventional cytogenetics and with interphase FISH on peripheral blood specimens.Results: in comparison to conventional cytogenetics   interphasic FISH on peripheral blood did not generated any discrepancies in percent of BCR/ABL positive nuclei.Conclusion: Fluorenscent in situ hybridisation is a molecular  cytogenetics technique which allows minimal residual disease monitoring on interphase nuclei. MRD monitoring on peripheral blood has the advantage of generating results in short time (even in 24h) and is less invasive than bone marrow biopsy. In comparison with bone marrow culture it has the advantage of being a direct method which abolish artifacts introduced by the culture.

Recent advances in molecular cytogenetics techniques are likely to introduce a revolution in the field. In the present study we analysed a series of 57 CRC samples and their related normal mucosae by high resolution genomic arrays (Affymetrix SNP 6.0 arrays) and set up a series of bioinformatics tools that allow the generation of a rapid report on broad (>25% of a chromosomal arm) and small somatic copy number abnormalities (CNAs), somatic homozygous deletions, focal high level amplifications, and regions of loss of heterozygosity (LOH). MSI tumors represented 14% of our CRC  series and showed a median values of somatic broad CNAs of 3 (range 1 6), while microsatellite stable (MSS) tumors showed a median value of 12 (range 0 24). Therefore all MSI tumors were below a threshold of 6 CNAs, while 18% of MSS were below this threshold, representing a group of microsatellite and chromosomal stable tumors. No correlation was observed between the number of tumor associated CNAs and the number of somatic copy neutral LOH regions, suggesting that different mechanisms underlie such chromosomal abnormalities.

 Genomic instability at common fragile site FRA14B in cancer,P07.15,"D. Zheglo , L. Brueckner, A. Blumrich, M. Schwab, L. Savelyeva","DKFZ, Heidelberg, Germany","Common fragile sites (cFS) are chromosomal regions prone to  breakage under conditions partially inhibiting DNA synthesis. Approximately 90 cFSs have been cytogenetically identified, but few of these have been completely characterized. Most characterized cFSs coincide with extremely large genes and hotspots of chromosomal  rearrangements in cancer. We localized an aphidicolin inducible cFS, FRA14B, to an 800kb region of the 14q23 chromosome band  using six color FISH mapping with BAC probes on metaphase chromosomes of aphidicolin treated lymphocytes. FRA14B overlaps the large gene encoding gephyrin (GPHN, 670kb), a protein involved in synapse development and molybdenum cofactor biosynthesis. To assess the possible role of FRA14B in generating cancer associated  rearrangements, we performed oligonucleotide array CGH on 150 cell lines and primary tumors. We detected multiple breakpoints within  this cFS in 13 cancer genomes of melanoma and glioma cell lines and neuroblastoma, colon cancer and breast cancer cell lines and primary tumors. The breakpoints clustered at the first intron of GPHN  and extra genic regions, but not within exons. Subsequent validation of CGH results using FISH revealed at least two apparently normal copies of GPHN per genome in the majority of tumors and cell lines bearing rearrangements. All deletions were limited to introns or located within additional ectopic copies of GPHN. GPHN transcripts were  detectable by RT PCR in all the cell lines. In summary, activation of newly mapped cFS, FRA14B, can cause the instability of GPHN, the  role of which in cancer development remains to be investigated.",2011

Karyotype abnormalities have been documented in about 80 90% of MPAL pediatric patients, with no uniquely associated specific chromosomal aberration. Here we report on a case of childhood MPAL showing a complex karyotype, characterized by M FISH and array CGH. The patient was a 5 year old girl diagnosed with MPAL (T/myeloid) based on the expression of T lymphoid cyCD3 and myeloid MPO antigens.

The karyotype was: 47, XY, +8, t(6;19)(p21.3:p13.3), t(11;14)(q13;q32) [16] / 46, XY [3]. FISH was positive to t(11;14) (88%).In this patient we found a characteristic anomaly in MM, confirmed by FISH, a trisomy 8 that is a rare event in lymphoid neoplasia and a translocation not described in the literature. FISH is a sensitive method to investigate cytogenetics of MM but it should be performed always with conventional cytogenetics analysis. They are important to predict treatment responses and prognosis.rte superior do formulÃ¡rioThe authors compare the cytogenetic findings and the patientâs clinical status with those described in the literature.",2011

Only a few recurrent translocations involving the X and different autosomes have been associated with hematological malignancies.In contrast, structural alterations of the long arm of chromosome 20 are  non random recurring abnormalities in patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS), myeloproliferative disorder (MPD) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML). This suggests the loss of function of tumor suppressor genes at this location.In this study, we describe an additional case of t(X;20)(q13;q13) in a myeloproliferative disorder (MPD). To the our knowledge, this is the fith case of MPD associated with this rearrangement.The patient was an 75 year old female presenting with a thrombocytosis at 1.600.000/mmÂ³. The bone marrow evaluation suspected a MPD of  type essential thrombocytemia. Cytogenetic studies performed on bone marrows cells demonstrated a homogeneous karyotype with a Cancer cytogenetics245 t(X; 20) (q13.q13.3) as the sole abnormality. In total, the translocation t(X;20) has been reported in nine previous cases : 4 MPD, 3 MDS and 2 AML patients. It is invariably found in old women (mean age of 69 years), which suggests a probable influence of epigenetic factors. We will discuss the possible implication  of the inactive X in the translocation, which may exercise a position effect on 20q. The silencing of 20 q genes may be involved in the clinical presentation of myeloid disorders especially as deletions 20q represent one of the most frequent chromosomal abnormalities seen in myeloid disorders.

Micronucleus test (MNs)  and chromosomal aberrations test (CAs) are an excellent means to evaluate the genotoxicity and the risk associated with theses releases.Our study reports the finding of these genotoxicity tests for hospital staff  exposed to ionizing radiation (RI), anti cancer drugs and formaldehyde (FA) from Farhat Hached Hospital of Sousse (Tunisia).Patients and  m ethods: Assessment of chromosomal damage was  carried out in peripheral lymphocytes of 20 nurses handling anti cancer drugs, in 31 exposed to FA, and in 45 exposed (RI). We used controls matched for age, gender and life style.MNs frequency was evaluated after cytokinesis block. A total of 1000 binucleated cells were scored for each subject. Mitomycin C was used  for detection of CAs.Results: The frequency of binucleated micronucleated cells was  significantly higher in all exposed groups when compared with controls (p< 0.05). The frequency of CAs was also significantly higher in exposed than in controls. For example, in nurses handling anti cancer drugs, the frequency of MNs was 9.4â°Â± 2.88 versus 4.36â°Â± 1.32 in controls. In CA analysis, we detected in exposed group a significant increase (about 5.7 fold) of CAs. c onclusion: Based in the fact that exposure to MNs and CAs are an  excepted markers of exposure to genotoxic substances, our finding  of higher frequency of CAs and MNs in peripheral lymphocytes of exposed workers indicates that FA, anti cancer drugs and (RI) are a mutagenic agents in humans. .",2011

We report 2 cases of a lytic lesion of the proximal humeral epiphyso metaphysis in a 16 yr old boy (pat1) & in a 13 yr old girl after a traumatism (pat2). On both, a first biopsy showed an aspect of ABC. The X Ray confirmed the evolution of the lesion. A second surgical procedure consisted of curettage, phenolisation, allograft and plating. Additional curettages were performed in patient 2. However, 4 months & 5 years after the ABC discovery, respectively for pat1 and pat2, the histology was in favour of malignancy.Complex clonal chromosomal alterations were detected from the first  specimens of both cases in 4 27% cells.

To investigate cytogenetic effects in peripheral blood lymphocytes  (PBL) of breast cancer patients exposed in vitro to Î³ irradiation in the low dose range with regards to individual radiation sensitivity.Material and Methods. The irradiation of lymphocytes isolated from healthy donors was carried out on therapeutic apparatus âRockusâ  (with 60Co source) in range of 0,1 1,0 Gy. The metaphase analysis of chromosome aberrations had been carried out with group kariotyping including G2 radiation sensitivity assay.Results. Background frequency of chromosome aberrations in PBL of breast cancer patients was 7.2Â±0.95/100 cells and was 6 fold higher than in the cjntrol group of healthy donors. The peculiarity of spontaneous aberrations spectrum consist in the emergence of dicentric chromosomes (0.16/100 cells) in 55% of examined patients. When the PBL culture was irradiated in the low dose range (0.1 0.5  Gy), the dose curve had an abnormal shape with the formation of the plateau (dose independent part). The boundaries of its location depends on the individual radiation sensitivity of patients, the second plateau could be formed with increase of individual radiation sensitivity.Conclusions. For the first time, it was shown that individual radiation sensitivity significantly affects the yield of radiation induced chromosome aberrations in PBL of breast cancer patients and this effect was dependent on radiation dose.

Involvement of various matrix metalloproteinases is very important in the pathogenesis of these diseases. Matrix  metalloproteinase 13 (MMP 13) was shown to be up regulated in AAAs and atherosclerotic lesions of aorta. A functional MMP 13 promoter polymorphism ( 77A>G) was found to be associated with functional status in rheumatoid arthritis. The aim of the present study was to examine if MMP 13 ( 77A>G) gene polymorphism is a susceptibility factor of AAA or AIOD in Polish patients. Results: Based on a PCR RFLP analysis the MMP 13 genotypes (A/A; A/G/; G/G) were determined in three selected groups: 300 patients with AAA and 312 patients with AIOD who underwent surgery; 313 individuals  from control group. Genotypes were compared with demographic and clinical data of subjects and analyzed in relation to risk factors. No significant differences in genotype distribution and allele frequencies of MMP 13( 77A>G)gene polymorphism in the study groups were found. Conclusion: This study found no evidence of association of MMP13 ( 77A>G)gene polymorphism with AAA or AIOD in Polish patients.,2011

Drug response in patients who underwent chemotherapy is  accompanied by many adverse effects. The prediction of therapeutic effect may vary depending on individual gene variability. Many studies focus on the association between phenotype and DNA variations in genes of interest. Comprehensive approach in genotyping of numerous  variants is needed to achieve improvements in personalized medicine such as selection of appropriate drug for treatment.This work focuses on the design of a pharmacogenetically relevant panel which could be applied for the rapid genotyping of patients  treated with methotrexate, thiopurines, 5 FU, irinotecan or taxanes prior to treatment as well as in studies searching for new genotype phenotype associations. We selected 97 variable positions in 36 genes which were previously associated or may be potentially involved with altered drug response. Of these, 94 SNPs were genotyped by APEX microarray method, which is a valuable tool for fast, reliable and cost effective typing. Variations of tandem repeats or gene deletions were genotyped by capillary electrophoresis and PCR detection, respectively. Direct sequencing served as reference method for validation of APEX chip and control of observed results. 300 DNA samples from unrelated healthy volunteers were tested to estimate genotype frequencies for a Slovak population, which may be helpful in estimation of central European frequencies. All data were checked  for H W equilibrium and genetic linkage between loci and haplotype analysis were also performed.",2011

Significant excess of ID in the progeny of consanguineous matings and functional considerations suggest that autosomal recessive forms of ID (ARID) must be relatively common. To shed more light on the causes of ARID, we have set out in 2003  to perform systematic clinical studies and autozygosity mapping in large consanguineous Iranian families with non syndromic ARID (NS ARID). Previously we have reported 12 novel ARID loci as well as 2 causative gene defects in this cohort. By tripling the size of our cohort we were able to identify 27 additional unrelated families with NS ARID and single linkage intervals; 14 of these define novel loci for NS ARID. Altogether, 13 out of 39 single linkage intervals observed in our cohort were found to cluster at 6 different loci on chromosomes 1p34, 4q27, 5p15, 9q34, 11p11 q13 and 19q13, respectively. Five of  these clusters consist of two significantly overlapping linkage intervals, and on chr 1p34, three single linkage intervals coincide. We showed by Monte Carlo simulation that the probability for this distribution to be due to chance is only 1.14*10( 5). Thus, in contrast to our previous conclusions, here we indicate that common molecular causes of NS ARID do exist, and in the Iranian population, the most frequent ones may well account for several percent of the patients.

Although hearing loss is very heterogenous,  mutations in GJB2 gene (at DFNB1 locus) are the major cause of autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in many populations. Our previous study showed that mutations of GJB2 gene do not contribute to the major genetic load of deafness in the Iranian population.To determine the other important loci in ARNSHL in our population, 147 deaf Iranian families with 2 or more affected members, who were negative for GJB2 gene mutations, were subjected to linkage analysis using flanking or intragenic STR markers for 34 loci.

Novel loci and their genes can increase our insight into the mechanisms of HI. While the phenotype of the majority of  families is severe to profound, DFNB21 (TECTA) has been described  to show a recognizable milder audiometric profile. Presented here is a novel locus in an Iranian family with moderate to severe ARNSHI, localizing to a new locus on chromosome 11q12.3 13.2.  m ethods:  Linkage to DFNB21 (TECTA) as well as 14 other known loci was ruled out. Illumina 6K SNP chips (Linkage IVb panel) were used for a genome scan, followed by fine mapping by microsatellite markers. Results: Genome wide linkage revealed a multipoint LOD score of  3.51 on 11q12.3 13.2.

Affected individuals were found to have an internal  duplication of exons 2 3, of the complement factor H related protein 5 (CFHR5) gene. Results from 105 Cypriot patients carrying this mutation show that 41% of male patients over 50 yo develop end stage of renal disease.No other mutations have been reported in CFHR5 gene in relation to C3 glomerulonephritis or other glomerulonephritis cases. We screened 20 sporadic cases with macroscopic hematuria or unknown cause nephropathy, for mutations in the CFHR5 gene. We used SURVEYOR endonuclease digestion, which identifies and cleaves at mismatched  base pairs in heteroduplexes. The exons and flanking intronic regions of CFHR5 were amplified with appropriate primers. If cleavage was  evident at the digested PCR product (agarose electrophoresis), DNA re sequencing was performed.Four variants were identified (5UTR+249TC, P46S, IVS1+17TA, IVS5+33TG), but their frequencies found through 200 chromosomes of the general population, did not differ from the patients cohort. P46S and IVS5+33T>G (novel SNP) were also genotyped in additional 38 unknown glomerulonephritis and 39 unknown nephropathy patients but again the SNPs frequencies were comparable with the ones of the general population, therefore they cannot be associated with a pathogenic effect.

Reporter gene assays validated 62% of promoter cis rSNPs. Integrative genomic approaches can successfully isolate causal cis rSNPs beyond promoters: rs909685  is strongly associated with differential AE  of SYNGR1, shows association by RNA seq. in LCLs, is located in  active chromatin (DNaseI HS), and shows an allelic H3K4me1 signal in our ChIP seq. analysis.

Multiple other sites show converging functional data suggesting specific mechanisms for common cis rSNP  action. However, despite numerous functional genomic datasets,  only a subset of mapped cis rSNPs yield straightforward hypotheses,  suggesting the need for further tools for assessing non coding DNA.

Background: Alterations in left ventricular (LV) structure and function  provide independent prediction of myocardial infarction and stroke.  These echocardiographic traits are moderately heritable (~20 40%). The aim of this study was to identify genetic variants associated with these LV prognostic markers across the whole human genome. m ethods: 885 hypertensive participants in the Hypertension  Associated CardioVascular Disease (HACVD) sub study of the Anglo  Scandinavian Cardiac Outcomes Trial underwent echocardiography 1.5 and 3.5 years post randomization to BP and lipid lowering therapies. The average value of four measures of LV structure and function were studied; LV hypertrophy (LVM/height 2.7, LVMi), diastolic  dysfunction (eâ), systolic function (ejection fraction) and LV filling  pressure (E/eâ). 318,000 Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) were directly genotyped (Illumina HumanCNV 370 Duo BeadChip), and approximately 3.5 million loci were imputed using IMPUTE from  Hapmap rel#24 reference. Poorly imputed SNPs were excluded from further analysis. GWAS was performed using linear regression analysis under an additive model, adjusted for cardiovascular risk factors, and for principal components representing major genetic variation within the study population.Results and Discussion: None of the directly genotyped SNPs showed significant associations with any of the LV phenotypes. By contrast a number of regions containing imputed SNPs with low minor allele frequencies (<2%) were significantly associated with LVMi.  Permutation testing indicated that these SNPs were significant after correction for multiple testing of both genotypes and phenotypes. It is difficult to distinguish whether these associations reflect unmeasured genetic stratification in the population or direct causation by chromosomal regions.

We analyzed genome wide SNP genotype data collected in 3082 participants with multiple chest CT scans. We developed a novel image processing algorithm to quantify levels of calcification in the aorta and the coronary arteries.We compared three methods in order to find genetic loci associated with coronary artery calcification and aorta calcification (R 2,0.13): a  polygenic model, cross trait meta analysis, and multivariate regression. Although no single SNPs reach genome wide significance (p<5E 08), polygenic analysis shows that coronary artery and aorta calcification share a substantial genetic background. The explained variance  increases when more SNPs are included, reaching approximately 13% for both traits when SNPs with P values of up to 0.05 are included in the model.These results demonstrate that large scale genome wide meta analyses of calcification may reveal important genes involved in forming calcium deposits.",2011

Environmental influences can be measured at the individual level, such as by personal characteristics and lifestyle choices, or at the group level (called contextual variables), such as by  community factors and degree of local area development. To examine the interaction between genes and contextual factors, traditional approaches usually adopt asymptotic tests to assess whether the interaction exists. Such tests are limited as they cannot evaluate or quantify the strength of difference in genetic effects across different clusters or categories of the contextual variable.  m ethods: In this study,  we utilize a Bayesian hierarchical mixed effects model to investigate whether the genetic effect is modified by residential environment in a matched case control metabolic syndrome study. The group level  contextual covariate, availability of exercise facilities, contains four categories, from low to high. Based on posterior samples from Markov chain Monte Carlo methods, the interaction between this group level environmental condition and the individual level genetic effect is evaluated by differences in allelic effects under various contextual categories. Results: The Bayesian analysis indicates that the effect  of rs1801282 on metabolic syndrome development is modified by the contextual environmental factor such that, even with the same genotype, living in a residential area with low availability of exercise facility may result in higher risk.  c onclusions:  In summary, the  Bayesian hierarchical mixed effects model considered here provides a quantitative assessment for the cross level interaction between genes and contextual variables.Statistical genetics, includes Mapping, linkage and association methods251",2011

The study enrolled the CF patients born in Brittany since 1970. The cases born before the set up of NBS were registered through active enquiries and combination of data sources. Time trends in incidence rates were examined using Poisson regression and expressed by the average percent change (APC).Over the 40 year period, 569 CF children born in Brittany were registered. The average number of cases born each year varied from  17.7 in the 1970âs (decade 1970 79) to 11.8 nowadays (decade 2000 09). This corresponded to a decline in incidence rate of 29.0% (from 1/2260 to 1/3183, p,0.0039). Poisson regression also showed that the incidence rate decreased over the whole period (annual APC:  1.2%, 95% CI: [ 1.8;  0.5], p,0.0012), and especially since the availability of prenatal diagnosis in the 1980âs (annual APC:  2.0%, 95% CI: [ 3.7;  0.3], p,0.0216).This study highlights how the incidence of CF evolved in an area where CF is frequent and where carrier screening is not underway.

Here, we test the hypothesis that genomic variation in concert with the trisomy 21 determines the risk for CHD. This case control GWAS includes 156 DS without CHD and 192 DS with CHD  (AVSD,72, ASD,53, VSD,67). Trisomic and disomic SNPs were called separately. Trisomic single locus association reveals 4 SNPs as CHD risk alleles (Bonferroni adjusted p values < 0.05). One of these SNPs was also identified as a risk factor for AVSD+VSD combined (p,0.008), while a 5th SNP was identified as risk factor for ASD (p, 0.002) and AVSD+ASD combined (p,0.05). No significant signal was identified from the non chr21 GWAS. We then performed a 2 locus genomewide analysis. A significant interaction signal was observed between loci on chr5 and chr6 (p,0.002). Since DS is likely to be a  disorder of gene expression, we focused on 2 locus interactions using only eQTLs. Interestingly, 2 locus model analysis on chr21 eQTLs reveals an interaction between eQTLs for PDE9A and WDR9 genes and eQTLs for C21orf56 and C21orf57 genes.Furthermore, the 2 locus analysis of non chr21 eQTLs identifies an interaction between eQTLs for CLCNKA on chr1 and USMG5 on chr10 (p,0.01). A search for chr21 risk CNVs for AVSD using tiling 135K chr21 array did not show any significant risk variation. We propose that the CHD risk of DS is determined by not only trisomy 21 but also the genome wide interaction of specific alleles.",2011

Some cases are familial,  but most are sporadic and of uncertain cause. Presently, ten genes and seven additional loci have been reported to be associated with monogenic primary dystonias. We aimed to identify the genetic cause  of dystonia in an affected Iranian family. m aterials & methods: Whole genome homozygosity mapping was  performed in a consanguineous Iranian family with three dystonia  affected children using high density single nucleotide polymorphism chips. Affected individuals were DYT1 negative and exhibited childhood onset, segmental dystonia and mental retardation.Results: Haplotype analysis showed that all the affected individuals  shared a common haplotype expanding 13cM on chromosome 6.  Parametric linkage analyses resulted in a lod score of 1.6. More than 200 annotated genes exist within the linked region. Screening of four candidate genes has not revealed a disease causing mutation.Conclusions : These findings indicate that a novel dystonia gene  exists on chromosome 6. Mutation screening of other candidate genes within the linked region is being performed.Statistical genetics, includes Mapping, linkage and association methods253",2011

At the moment little is known about the genetic susceptibility for EBA. To find key genetic factors (MHC and non MHC EBA susceptibility genes) that control inflammation at the effector phase of EBA, we  used a multi step approach. First, different and 16 genetically well characterized inbred strains were tested for their susceptibility for EBA in the passive model. This allowed the identification of 8 associated loci indicating EBA severity to be regulated by loci on chromosomes 1, 6, 8, 9, 11, 12, 15 and 16. To confirm these, we used mice from an advanced 4 way intercross breeding of 4 different strains with different major histocompatibility complex (MHC) haplotype (MRL, NZM, BXD2, and Cast). For example on chromosome 8 and 9 that have already been tested, we could confirm the genes on chr 9.

Among different forms of epilepsies, idiopathic generalized epilepsies (IGE) are characterized by bilateral and synchronous generalized seizures in the absence of detectable brain lesions or metabolic abnormalities. Thus, the primary etiology for this  disorder is believed to be genetic.The proposed study includes a large highly inbred consanguineous family with multiple IGE affected individuals. The ultimate aim is identifying a new epilepsy gene to help in delineating the molecular mechanisms of this disease. Physical, neurological and EEG examinations were performed on the subjects recruited with information on family history. These examinations revealed 5 affected individuals, a mother with three children and their cousin, who exhibit varying types of seizures. Along with these individuals, 4 unaffected  individuals from this family were genotyped using Illumina Infinium HumanLinkage 12 Genotyping BeadChip (6090 SNPs). The genotype data were delineated using easyLinkage software platform, where Mendelian genotyping errors were determined using PedCheck, two and multipoint lod scores were calculated under the assumption of autosomal recessive inheritance via SuperLink and SimWalk, respectively, and haplotypes were constructed through GeneHunter. Analyses revealed a promising locus on chromosome 2p12, which was further analyzed through fine mapping with additional microsatellites spanning a region of 75.36Mb 78.52Mb. However, microsattellite alleles were heterozygous in the 3 affected sibs rejecting linkage under autosomal recessive inheritance.Future objectives include acquisition of extensive clinical data and  dense SNP genotyping of the family members in an attempt to unravel small regions that may have been overlooked.",2011

Paulescu Institute, Bucharest, Romania, 3Carol Davila University of Medicine  and Pharmacy, Bucharest, Romania. Background: Diabetic patients have a high risk of developing end  stage renal disease (ESRD). Some polymorphisms seem to increase the risk for renal failure in different populations.Objectives: The aims of this case control study were to estimate the possible impact of eNOS 4a/5b, MTHFR C677T, MTR A2756G, ACE  ID, ATR1 A1166C, HSPG2 BamH1 and TGFb C/T polymorphisms on the ESRD development in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. m aterials and methods: Clinical information and blood samples  were collected from 1350 unrelated Caucasians represented by dDM1 (type1 diabetes mellitus dialysed patients, n,225), DM1 (type1 diabetes mellitus patients without renal disease, n,180), dDM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus dialysed patients, n,225), DM2 (type 2 diabetes mellitus patients without renal disease, n,180) and HC (healthy controls, n, 540). Genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples with Wizard Genomic DNA purification Kit (Promega). Genotyping was performed by PCR and RFLP techniques.Results: The frequencies for these genotypes are in Hardy Weinberg  equilibrium. Our results are not in agreement with several earlier studies which have indicated a strong association between investigated polymorphisms and ESRD in some Caucasian populations.

This strategy, which we call EX HOM (EXome HOMozygosity), combines in a single step the capacity of exome  sequencing to identify all the coding variants present in a genome with the property of homozygosity mapping to limit the search for candidate genes to specific chromosomal regions.  m ethods: We sequenced the exomes of two siblings born to first  cousin parents affected with dysmyelinating leukodystrophy and  spastic paraparesis caused by a mutation in FA2H . We extracted homozygosity information directly from exome sequencing data, without performing previous SNP genotyping, and selected the  candidate variants contained in the homozygous regions shared by the two affected siblings. Results: We identified five regions of shared homozygosity, accounting  for 94.2 Mb, and containing three candidate variants.

The interaction effects between two genes were  determined by an interaction term in a logistic regression model. Test statistic is summation of Wald chi square values of GG interaction tests in the regression models. If each Wald test for interaction is independent, under null hypothesis, the test statistic followed a chi square distribution with m (number of GG interaction tests) degrees of freedom. If Wald tests are not independent, significance for test statistic is evaluated by permutation. For this approach, power evaluation in four scenarios according to asymptotic power functions determined by sample size and number of genes interacting with the gene of interest.

However, canine populations often show significant degree of stratification and cryptic relatedness. Several methods have been proposed to account for genetic structure: genomic control,  structured association, PCA based and mixed models.The majority of the methods have been designed to be used primarily for the analysis of human populations and to account for only some aspects of genetic structure. Therefore, genome wide association studies in canine populations often call for more specific solutions. Here, we present a workflow that we successfully applied to analyze a structured canine population with cryptic relatedness present.We analyzed 184 German shepherds (91 cases and 93 controls) using Illumina 170K canine SNP array. First, we used autosomal  IBS matrix, MDS and K means clustering to determine population structure. We confirmed that apart from population stratification, there is some degree of cryptic relatedness between the individuals. Next, we tested 4 different methods of dealing with genetic structure: 1) structured association (SA), 2) PCA based approach (PCA) 3), mixed model (MM) and 4) a combination between mixed model and structured association (MM SA).

To reduce the run time while minimizing batch effects we evaluated  two different strategies to call genotypes on a distributed computing environment, using a cohort of > 6,000 individuals genotyped with the Affymetrix 6.0 array, and the Birdseed v2 calling algorithm included on the Affymetrix Power Tools (APT) package. First, we divided the probesets in batches of 50,000 probes with 5,000 overlapping and ran jobs in parallel. Since the same normalization matrix was used by all jobs, the results are expected to be equivalent to those obtained in a unique run. GC was completed on 15 days, using 18 CPU with 16Gb RAM, but required large amount of disk space. To further reduce  the run time, we ran the APT on 7 clusters of 1,000 individuals with 100 overlapping, balancing the ratio of cases and controls to mimic the proportion observed in the entire dataset, and maximizing plates representation within each group. GC was completed in 2 days, using only 6 CPU and significantly less disk space.

We examine via carefully designed simulations that how well CIDRâs data cleaning rules work in practice. We found that genotype errors in siblings are detected more often than in parents for less polymorphic SNPs and vice versa for more polymorphic SNPs.

Two independent principal components and two factors were generated. The first principal component, PC1, explained about 52% of the total variance and had the high loadings of four rim related traits and cup to disc ratio. In the factor score FAC1 obtained by rotation of PC1, the number of initial parameters with high loading was minimized to three rim  related traits.

Hearing is a complex trait but, until now, few genes are known to  contribute to its variability and little is known about genetic factors involved in age related hearing loss (ARHL). To discover genes and pathways underlying auditory function and ARHL we planned an integrated strategy characterized by three approaches. A) a GWAS  meta analyzing quantitative traits data from 6 isolated populations . Results led to the identification of eight suggestive significant loci (p<10 7) with a series of genes expressed within the inner ear. Additional biological candidates (p<10â6) were identified. Some of these new loci map to already known hereditary hearing loss loci whose genes still need to be identified. Data have also been used to construct a highly significant âin silicoâ pathway for hearing function characterized by a network of 49 genes, 34 of which are certainly expressed in the ear. B) a similar GWAS on qualitative traits from the same populations  leading to the identification of some loci on the following chromosomes 2,13,19,17,16,20 involving in some cases genes related with hearing development and hearing function but also genes whose function is still unknown.

BattaloÄlu1","1Bogazici University, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey","Hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSPs) describe a heterogeneous  group of neurodegenerative disorders with progressive spasticity in the lower limbs. HSPs can be inherited in autosomal dominant, recessive, or X linked forms. To date, 41 spastic paraplegia loci and 17 genes have been identified with diverse functions such as axonal transport,  regulation of the cytoskeleton, and mitochondrial function.   In the first part of the study, the most commonly mutated autosomal dominant genes, SPG4 (Spastin), SPG3A (Atlastin), SPG31 (REEP1), ve SPG7 (NIPA1) were screened in 42 families. Using the SSCP  method and subsequent DNA sequencing one patient and his father were found to have an insertion mutation (c.310_311insA) leading to a truncated Spastin protein. Another patient revealed a heterozygous c.1741C>T change (p.Arg581X) leading to a premature stop codon in the same gene. Still one other patient was heterozygous for a missense mutation, c.941A>G (p.H258R) in Atlastin. All identified  mutations were previously reported.In the second part of the study, linkage to autosomal recessive loci for which the genes have been identified (SPG5, SPG7, SPG11, SPG15, SPG20 and SPG21 loci) was investigated in 15 families. Parents were consanguineous in 11 families with at least two affected siblings. Linkage was found to SPG11 in four families, to SPG15 in two families, and to SPG21 in one family. Sequencing of the relevant genes is  currently being performed to identify the causative mutation in these families. In two of the families, linkage to all tested loci was excluded that should be further investigated for other known AR HSP loci.",2011

HIF1A, the regulatory subunit of HIF 1 geneâs dimeric product, contains a missense polymorphism  Pro582Ser (C/T at bp 85; rs11549465). The rare T allele (proline to serine change) by increasing HIF 1A proteinâs activity and stability may improve glucose metabolism. The study aimed to determine the influence of the HIF1A Pro582Ser polymorphism on power  performance. One hundred and eight professional weightlifters of regional and national standard were recruited for the study. Controls  were 434 healthy unrelated volunteers, citizens of Kazan, without any competitive sport experience. Genotyping was performed on DNA samples obtained from buccal epithelium cells by DNA extraction kit. Genotyping for the HIF1A Pro582Ser variants (rs11549465) was  performed by PCR and restriction enzyme digestion. The number of carriers of the rare Ser allele (Pro/Ser or Ser/Ser) was significantly higher in weightlifters than in controls (28.7% vs. 13.4; P,0.0001). Thus, HIF1A gene Pro582Ser polymorphism is associated with elite  power athlete status, which suggests an important role for HIF 1a in skeletal muscle adaptation to power training.",2011

We have previously constructed a helper program, LIPED.COM, that automatically make an input file to LIPED, allowing LOD score  calculations for more than 800 markers and the results to be present in a usable form. This program has been tested by mapping more than 800 markers using families from the Copenhagen Family Bank (Eiberg et al.

We have therefore modified our linkage helper programs  to analyze genotype output files for > 106 loci. The materials can be  analyzed fast and the results shown graphically. This program, SNP6 LINK, demands a simple FORTRAN programming for each new project and several families can be analyzed in one process and the program can use Illumina genotype output files. Several parameters  can be adjusted before calculations as heterozygote mating for recessive traits, which reduce the output graphical presentation to fewer but informative positive or negative LOD scores. Also bed files for uploading of LOD scores to UCSC Genome Browser can be produced.

Major depressive disorder (MDD) is a severe lifelong psychiatric  illness with a heterogeneous background likely caused by interaction of a multiple set of genetic and environmental influences. Despite decades of genetic studies no genetic risk factor has been successfully validated for MDD. Most genetic studies have so far relied on single SNP association analyses. However, it is likely that in the susceptibility of multifactorial diseases risk factors interact to increase disease susceptibility. In the present study we have analyzed interactions of SNPs in the GAIN MDD study located in candidate genes selected from the STAR*D cohort.Forty seven markers that were found to be nominally associated in the GAIN MDD study were included in the study. Each marker was then tested for interaction with 2866 genotyped or imputed markers  in the same set of genes. The interaction model assumed a dominant effect from one marker. Interaction was then defined as deviation from additivity and measured using the attributable proportion. Odds ratios (ORâs) were used as risk estimates. Departure from additivity  indicated that two factors were jointly involved in disease susceptibility. We identified a total of 16 interactions. The strongest p values were in the order of 10( 14) and represented interactions between markers in GRIK4 NR3C2, ARHGAP10 GRIA2 and HTR2C FKBP5 genes. A subsequent pFDR test confirmed that the interaction effects were robustly reported. However, using ORâs may have inflated the risk estimates. Therefore, these results are currently validated using a permutation analysis.",2011

In particular, if there exist significant main effects unaccounted for during epistasis screening, false positives arise and therefore epistasis results reported might not be genuine. In this study, we use simulation  to assess the effect of implementing different corrective measures for lower order effects in an MB MDR context of two locus detection, on both power and family wise error rate.The implemented MB MDR strategy reduces the multi locus genotype dimension to one with three possible outcomes, while pooling multi locus genotypes into three groups of risk (High, Low and No Evidence) based on the liberal p value threshold 0.1. Adjusting for main effects is performed in two categories: main effects screening prior to and during MB MDR run. Data are simulated according to two quantitative trait models (M27 and M170) of Evans et al. 2006 that incorporate varying degrees of epistasis, and include a range of allele frequencies p: 0.1, 0.25, 0.5, at the predetermined functional SNPs. We consider 500 simulation replicates, involving 2000 unrelated individuals. MB MDR screening is performed on 100 SNPs which are assumed to be in Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium. No linkage disequilibrium exists between the SNPs.In conclusion, preliminary results showed that indeed uncorrected for main effects results have false positives amounting to as high as 100%.

With  YAMAS we present a software that avoids such loss without the need to impute. By using reference data from the HAPMAP and 1000 genomes projects users are enabled to analyze all SNPs that are present in at least one study. For each SNP that is missing in one study, the marker from the study with largest rÂ², according to the reference data, with the missing marker is chosen as a âproxy SNPâ. Furthermore, based on reference haplotype frequencies, âproxy allelesâ of a SNP and its proxy SNP are identified. For each SNP, MA of that SNP is done by combining the association results of the SNP or, if not available the  proxy SNP, across studies.We present results from a power simulation study and compare the performance of MA with imputation and imputation free MA. Imputation free MA in general is not quite as powerful as MA with imputation, since the marker panel is still smaller.

 Fast approximate test for genome wide association studies based on population data,P08.52,"G. R. Svishcheva, T. I. Axenovich, Y. S. Aulchenko","Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation","Genome wide association (GWA) analysis is a powerful tool for  identifying loci affecting complex traits. While standard association tests assume independence across samples, several approaches account for non independence expected in presence of genetic substructure. The mixed models are among the most powerful methods allowing to  account for relationship structure of the sample. However, application of mixed models to GWA scans is computationally demanding, and as a rule the computational time shows quadratic dependency on the number of subjects, requiring application of high performance computing when thousands of subjects and/or multiple traits are studied. Previously, two approximate methods, FASTA/mmScore (Chen and Abecasis, 2007; Aulchenko et al., 2010) and GRAMMAR (Aulchenko et al., 2007), have been proposed. mmScore gives unbiased estimates of model parameters, but computational time is quadratic on number of  subjects, while GRAMMAR shows linear dependency, though results in biased effect estimates and conservative test statistics.Here we propose new approximate method, which leads to unbiased effect estimates, has proper distribution of the test statistics, and is as fast as GRAMMAR. Our method is based on transformation of a vector of dependent phenotype residuals into a vector of independent ones by application of the matrix approximation allowing reduction of an effect of a covariance matrix to an effect of scalar factor. We derived an analytical formula for this scalar factor, making possible to apply simple linear regression method to estimate the effects and test statistics.

For all these cases, we applied FISH technique. Thereafter, we have developed a linkage analysis method by testing 8 polymorphic genetic markers within the PWS/AS critical region 15q11q13.FISH study allows us to classify our 20 subjects in two groups: 6 of 13 PWS (46%) patients had microdeletion of paternal 15q11 q13 and 6 of  7 AS patients (85%) had microdeletions of maternal 15q11 q13. The genotype and linkage analyses of the 8 non deletional probands and their family disclosed that Angelman patient had inherited two paternal alleles of chromosome 15 and 5 of 7 non deletional PWS (38%) subjects had a maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 (UPD 15). Among these PWS patients, 4 cases had a maternal heterodisomy and one had a maternal isodiomy. Moreover, and despite the abnormal methylation patterns of the 15q11 q13 region, the 2 remaining PWS cases presented none of the alterations shown by the above groups.A combination of these methods is important for the identification of genetic alterations involved in our PWS or AS patients and the assessment of the risk of recurrence.",2011

Among several forms of glaucoma, the most prevalent is the primary open angle glaucoma (POAG). The increase of intraocular pressure is the  most important risk factor for the development of POAG. There are at least 14 loci (GLC1A   GLC1N) associated with POAG identified from genetic mapping studies, most of them involving families that follow a Mendelian inheritance pattern but only three genes were identified. The first described gene was myocilin (MYOC   GLC1A), followed by optineurin (OPTN or Optic Neuropathy Induced Protein   GLC1E) and  WD Repeat Containing Protein 36 (WDR36   GLC1G) genes. The  purpose of this study was to evaluate regions in the genome associated with glaucoma through linkage study in one POAG informative  family, through single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) microarray. Comprehensive ophthalmic evaluation was performed and genomic DNA obtained from one Brazilian family (19 individuals) with POAG. Genome wide linkage analysis was conducted using the Affymetrix 10K SNP array and analyzed by JINGLEFIX and MERLIN softwares. The SNP array generated 8.962 valid SNPs. Three chromosomal regions (1p, 5q and 14q) with lod scores equal to 1.9, 2.1 and 1.8, respectively were observed. Although the results do not show values of lod scores more than 3.00, these three regions are of great interest because they will be refined with microsatellites markers to identify potential susceptibility genes for POAG.Supported by FAPESP.",2011

Janssens","Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands","The rapid identification of genetic markers for multifactorial diseases  from genome wide association studies is fuelling interest in investigating the predictive ability and health care utility of genetic risk models. Various measures are available for the assessment of risk prediction models, each addressing a different aspect of performance  and utility. Even though the assessment of risk prediction models is relatively standard, there is no single statistical package that would allow for the computation and production of all these measures and plots. Therefore, we developed PredictABEL, an R package that contains functions to obtain all descriptive tables, measures and plots that are used in genetic risk prediction studies. The package contains functions for the various measures that are used in empirical studies, including univariate and multivariate odds ratios (OR) of the predictors, the c statistic (or area under the receiver operating  characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC)), Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit test, reclassification table, net reclassification improvement (NRI) and integrated discrimination improvement (IDI). Also included are functions to create plots, such as risk distributions, ROC curves, calibration plot, discrimination box plot and predictiveness curves. In addition to functions to assess the performance of risk models, the package includes functions to obtain weighted and unweighted risk scores as well as predicted risks using logistic regression analysis. These logistic regression functions are specifically written for models that include genetic variables, but they can also be applied to models that are based on non genetic risk factors only.

To date, more than 35 genes have been associated with this disease in all modes of inheritance. Although the number of RP causative genes is continuously expanding, more than 40% of the cases remain  undefined. All available mutation detection techniques of all known RP genes remain labor intensive, time consuming, and expensive. To overcome these challenges and to generate a high volume, cost effective, and efficient screening tool, microarray which is high throughput molecular screening techniques has been prefered.Whole genome genotyping was performed by Affymetrix 250K SNP array in two consanguineous Turkish families in which two children have RP. Homozygosity mapping have shown linkage to chromosome 1 and chromosome 2 in these families respectively. RP causing  CRB1 and CERKL genes located in these chromosomal region was selected as a first candidate gene for mutation screening. The mutation screening in these genes revealed the presence of two novel mutations: 701dupACAGG(fs)Â¼.710X in CRB1 gene, IVS1+5G>C in CERKL gene.Mutation frequency survey of different populations for CERKL and CRB1 mutations showed that they account for 1% of all arRP associated gene mutations.

Such similarities suggest that these disorders may share an underlying pathology and thus may share some genetic risk variants. This study  involves next generation sequencing of the exonic regions of 215 potential susceptibility genes in an Irish sample of 150 cases of ASD, 300 cases of SZ and 300 controls, in order to identify single nucleotide polymorphisms, indels and structural variants contributing to one or both disorders. A multiplex target enrichment method is used whereby DNA samples are multiplexed together using DNA indexes/barcodes and enriched for the exonic regions of these genes using the Agilent SureSelect target enrichment method. This is followed by 80bp paired end sequencing in a single lane of an Illumina GAII. Gene selection  comprised of five categories: 1) Interactors of NRXN1, 2) Interactors of DISC1, 3) Genes within the Glutamate Receptor Complexes; NMDA, mGluR5 and AMPA, 4) Cell adhesion molecules and 5) Functional and Positional Candidates. Analysis of the pilot set of samples indicates that the approach undertaken is successful with an even spread of sequence information for 24 indexed samples per lane, >8X coverage for 84% of target regions and overall SNP concordance with previous GWAS data (Affymetrix 6.0) of 99.3%.

Marchini","University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","The 1000 Genomes project (1KGP) aims to construct a detailed  catalogue of human polymorphism using next generation sequencing technologies which consist of short reads of DNA mapped to a reference genome. These reads can be used for the detection of structural variation, indels and SNPs. However, it is costly to sequence  many individuals at high depth. An alternative approach is to sequence many samples at low coverage and then combine the information across samples to detect and genotype variant sites.Our method assumes that a scaffold of haplotypes at known SNPs is available, e.g. , from the HapMap project. At each potentially variant site we use a Gibbs sampling phasing scheme to update each  individuals haplotypes at that site and known SNPs in small flanking window. Rather than using an HMM in the phasing updates we use a simple, fast and novel method based on approximating a new haplotype as a draw from an appropriately chosen multivariate normal distribution. Since the haplotypes at the known sites are static many of the calculations involved can be efficiently implemented so that the method is fast and scales well. The evidence for variation at the site and estimates of individual genotypes can be obtained by summarizing the MCMC samples.We have applied our method to a set of CEU individuals from Pilot 1 of the 1KGP and we compare our SNP and genotype calls with other  existing methods.

To replicate this association in an independent population from Latvia, we sequenced regions of LINGO1 gene involving 10 markers (rs2137110, rs8030859, rs34476171,  rs9652490, rs7177008, rs13313467, rs8028808, rs11856808, rs72744599 and one novel SNP) in 141 unrelated Latvian ET patients (sporadic n , 64 and familial n , 77) and 130 normal controls, matched by age and gender.We observed significant association with A/G genotype of the marker rs96532490 in familial ET compared to controls (P , 0.0426, OR , 1.92, 95 % CI: 1.06   3.46). No other significant association was found. Our results suggest that the LINGO1 variants analyzed are not a major risk factor for developing ET in Latvian population, which propose the existence of other unknown genetic risk factors responsible for ET phenotype.",2011
 s election of endophenotypes in association mapping,P08.74,"Y. Chiu , H. Kao","National Health Research Institues, Zhunan, Taiwan","Most common diseases such as hypertension, diabetes, asthma,  schizophrenia, heart diseases, etc. have a complex etiology involving both genetic and environmental factors. This complexity challenges investigators in finding the relationships between phenotypes and genotypes. One option to dissolve the complexity is to select an  âendophenotypeâ to signify quantitative measures that are more proximate to the biological etiology of a clinical disorder than its signs and symptoms and thus less genetically complex than the disorderâs underlying mechanism. Since the endophenotype is influenced by fewer genetic and environmental risk factors than the disorder, its use would result in greater statistical power to detect the effects of individual genes. In practice, it is common for investigators to measure numerous phenotypes on affected individuals, to achieve a substantial possibility of success in gene mapping, a systematic statistical  method on the selection of endophenotypes would be helpful on identification of disease genes. In this study, we applied a developed statistical approach to select valid endophenotypes in linkage or association mapping. This approach allows investigators to assess the significance of an endophenotype on a pathway as incorporating a proper endophenotype into gene mapping can enhance the efficiency of disease locus estimate. This approach is applicable to all kinds of study designs in association mapping and linkage mapping.Statistical genetics, includes Mapping, linkage and association methods264",2011

Alternatively, molecular markers which are highly linked to the GJB2 gene  have proven to be  useful in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis of NSHL families.  These markers usually show a population dependent based haplotype frequency. However, to date, no information on the genotyping and frequency of the markers is present for the Iranian population.

X linked OA is caused by mutations of the GPR143 gene, encoding a pigment cell specific  receptor. Autosomal recessive ocular albinisms (AROA) represent  clinically mild variants of the occulocutaneous forms of albinisms (OCA), where apart from ocular characteristics, hypopigmentation of the skin and hair is usually present. AROA may result from mutations in any of the genes responsible for OCA, namely TYR, OCA2 and rarely  TYRP1 or MATP. Ocular albinism is difficult to differentiate clinically  from other forms of albinism in young patients, especially in those with light complexion. Therefore, genetic analysis presents a possibility for an early definitive diagnosis.Direct sequencing of the coding regions of the GPR143, TYR and  OCA2 genes were performed in 17 patients with clinical signs of ocular  albinism aged 2 to 17 years. Four patients had X linked OA due to mutations in GPR143 gene (29%). Two detected mutations were novel (p.Gly296Arg, c.360+5G>A).

GSTM1 non null genotype frequency was significantly higher in patient group compared to controls (64.6% vs 47.2%) and may be considered a risk factor related to alcohol consumption (OR,2.038; 95%CI [1.272 3.267], p,0.004). No significantly results were obtained in relation to the GSTT1  polymorphism. The conjugation of GSTM1/T1 non null genotypes in the same individual does not increase the risk for alcoholism. Although, the GSTM1 non null genotype appears to be a susceptibility factor to alcoholism, only patients classified as Type III and IV according to Leschâs Typology show higher risk for alcohol dependence. This study is the first report about the GSTM1 polymorphism as a risk factor for alcoholism. Our results pointed to significantly differences in ethanol preferring phenotype, as a human psychopathological state, and GST M1 polymorphism as a susceptibility gene for alcohol consumption, which probably indicated that this enzyme may increase tolerance to some alcohol metabolites involved in different biochemical pathways potentially linked to the risk for some additive behaviours.",2011

Genetic risk  factors are thought to play a major role in its pathogenesis. Recent research has described deletions in NIPA1 increasing susceptibility for Complex traits and polygenic disorders268 ALS. Mutations in this gene are known to cause hereditary spastic  paraparesis. In this study we investage whether missense mutations in NIPA1 and expansions its polyalanine repeat might play a role in ALS as well. m ethods: DNA samples were collected from 2293 ALS patients and  2777 healthy controls, of three different populations (Dutch, Belgian,  German). All exons of NIPA1 were sequenced and fragment analysis was performed to determine the polyalanine repeat length. Alleles were grouped according to their length, with short alleles consisting of 13 alanines respectively.Results: Sequencing reveiled 7 missense mutations in patients and 6 in controls (p , 0.59). In all populations the long repeat occured more frequently in patients, 2.82% compared to 1.80% in controls (OR , 1.63, p , 0.0007). Patients with these long alleles had a worse median  survival (HR 1.58, p , 0.0001) and an earlier disease onset (HR 1.39, p , 0.005). c onclusion:  We found that missense mutations in NIPA1 do not play a  major role in ALS. Instead, we found that short polyalanine expansions  in NIPA1 are associated with ALS. In addition, these expansions are associated with an earlier disease onset and worse prognosis. These results further underscore the role of NIPA1 in ALS pathogenesis.",2011

Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder,  sporadic (sALS) in 95% of cases. Currently, multiple genetic and environmental factors are considered to contribute to disease liability. We previously observed that rare missense variants within the cytosolic loop of Î±3,Î±4,Î²4 subunits of neuronal nicotinic acetylcholine  receptors (nAChRs) were over represented in a group of 245 sALS patients compared with 450 controls.Tested functionally in vitro, the observed variants were found to disrupt the receptor properties, leading to the hypothesis that they are a predisposing factor for sALS.We made a replication study in new independent cohorts of 682 Italian sALS patients and 1300 age  and ethnically matched controls, respectively. Sequencing analysis of CHRNA4  gene, encoding for Î±4  subunit of nAChRs, revealed six heterozygous missense variants and  a three nucleotide insertion in 13 patients (1.9%). Four of the missense variants were detected in six controls, four were present in both groups (but were more numerous in patients), six were detected exclusively in controls. The three nucleotide insertion has never been detected in controls. Using SIFT and PolyPhen, almost all variants found both in patients and controls or only in controls were predicted to be benign, while 50% of variants found exclusively in patients were predicted to be damaging. Combining present data with those reported previously, a total of 5 variants were detected only in patients but neither in 3500 chromosomes nor in dbSNP nor in 1000Genomes Project data.These data confirm our previous results, suggesting a possible role for CHRNA4  variants as predisposing factor for sALS.",2011

About 5 10% of ALS patients are diagnosed with FTLD, while FTLD patients can develop motor neuron symptoms. Furthermore, TDP 43 inclusions have been  found in the majority of ALS patients and in cases of FTLD (FTLD TDP). Previously, linkage studies in families with both ALS and FTLD have identified a locus on chromosome 9p13 21. We hypothesized that ALS and FTLD may be part of a spectrum of neurodegenerative disease and we sought to identify a common genetic basis for this neurodegenerative disease. We obtained genome wide SNP genotype data from previously published studies on ALS and FTLD TDP and performed genome wide imputation based on the HapMap3r2 reference. After quality control, genome wide data for ~1.2M SNPs  were available for nearly 4,400 ALS patients and over 13,000 controls and for 440 (pathology proven) FTLD TDP cases and 1,400 independent unaffected controls. Joint analysis of ALS and FTLD identified SNPs in locus chromosome 9p21.1 and SNP rs12608932 in gene UNC13A  as shared genetic variants contributing to susceptibility  to both neurodegenerative disorders. Using a conservative rank products analysis, weighing ALS and FTLD sample sizes equally, the associations were found to be consistent. By analyzing a subset of FTLD patients without motor neuron disease signs, we found that individuals with ALS symptoms did not solely drive the signal for both loci. Our study narrows the previously identified shared genetic locus on chromosome 9 and, additionally, implicates UNC13A  as a shared risk  locus further corroborating the role of UNC13A  in neurodegeneration.",2011

What  is clear is that Alzheimerâs develops as a result of a complex cascade of biological processes that take place over many years inside the brain. But the majority of Alzheimerâs cases are late onset, usually developing after age 65, and this form of the disease shows no obvious  inheritance pattern. However, in some families, clusters of cases are seen. The deposition of amyloid in the form of plaques is thought by many scientists to trigger the cascade of events leading to Alzheimerâs pathology. Amyloid now is believed to be a critical target for eventual treatment. The best evidence that amyloid causes the disease comes from the genetic studies in which mutations of APP, PS1, PS2 and APOE e4 (the genes so far identified as causing some cases of Alzheimerâs) all facilitate amyloid accumulation. Some current research is focused on the association between these two forms of ApoE and Alzheimerâs  disease. A growing body of research is also helping to identify various candidate genes. Several other genes also appear to influence the development of Alzheimerâs disease: inflammatory pathways genes (TNF Î±, CCR2, CCR5), calcium homeostasis modulator 1 (CALHM1), neuronal sortilinrelated receptor gene (SORL1).

AS is due to lack of UBE3A gene expression, but in 15% of the cases the molecular cause still remains unknown. Long non coding RNAs (lncRNA) constitute a large portion of the human transcriptome,  which regulates gene expression by different mechanisms, including splicing, translational repression and epigenetic regulation. The spatial and temporal expression of lncRNA appears to be extremely important for the development and function of the central nervous system. Our study is focused on an AS like patient with an unusual combination of a deletion that involves lncRNA AK097590 inherited from one parent, and a rare SNP within AK097590 inherited from the other parent. Besides, this SNP leads to a change in the predicted secondary structure of AK097590 that may affect its normal function. We have  performed AK097590 knock down experiments in differentiated human neuroblastoma cells. qPCR assays have demonstrated that a decrease of AK097590 levels is sufficient to modify the expression of UBE3A, PRKCG and PPP2R1A. Interestingly, these genes have a role in synaptic plasticity and long term depression, which are reduced in AS murine models. Our results suggest that changes in the expression levels of AK097590 may contribute to the clinical features associated to AS, offering a novel molecular basis for the cases non associated with mutations in UBE3A. A better understanding of the regulatory mechanism of AK097590 lncRNA and its target genes may help in the development of therapeutic strategies for these neurodevelopmental disorders.",2011

Background: Ankylosing spondylitis (AS), the prototypic seronegative  spondyloarthritis is a chronic inflammatory condition of the spine and sacroiliac joints. HLA B27 is a genetic marker for AS. Moreover, elucidating the role of tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) in AS has important diagnostic and therapeutic significance, given the good  results obtained with anti TNF therapy in these patients.Objectives: The aim of this study was to investigate three TNFalpha gene single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in HLA B27 positive ankylosing spondylitis patients from Romania.Methods: 112 Romanian unrelated AS patients (97M/15F) and 76 (40M/36F) ethnically match healthy controls were genotyped for TNF alpha  308G/A,  238G/A and  857C/T polymorphisms using TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assays C 7514879 10, C 2215707 10 and C  11918223 10 (Applied Biosystems, USA). All subjects were  HLA B27 positives. Association tests for each polymorphism and for the estimated haplotypes were performed with the software package PLINK v 1.07.Results: The minor allele TNF 857T was more frequent in AS patients (24%) than in controls (19%), but not statistically significant (p,0.2). None of the three SNPs were individually associated with susceptibility to AS in HLA B27 positive patients. Two haplotypes showed a negative association with the disease:  308G238A (p,0.04) and 857T238A (p,0.005).Conclusion: These data indicate that haplotypic variations in the TNFalpha gene influence disease susceptibility in HLA B27 positive individuals in our population. The protective effect of these haplotypes could be related to differences in TNFalpha production or could reflect the association of different HLA B27 haplotypes with ankylosing spondylitis.",2011

Schizophrenia is a severe psychiatric disorder that has a lifetime  prevalence of ~1% in most of the population studied. Similar to many common complex disorders, schizophrenia is a multifactorial disorder that is characterized by the contribution of multiple susceptibility genes that could act in conjunction with epigenetic processes  and environmental factors. There is quite impressive evidence supporting the association between genetic variants in dysbindin and schizophrenia in populations. In the present study, we investigated the association between polymorphisms P1635 and P1655 in dysbindin gene with schizophrenia. Subjects were 115 unrelated patients with schizophrenia and 117 unrelated healthy volunteers. Genome DNA was extracted from blood sample by using the standard salting out method. Genotyping was done with the PCR RFLP method. The allele and genotype association were analyzed with Ï 2 test. As the result,  no significant difference was observed between patients and controls  in allelic frequencies or genotypic distributions of the P1635 SNP (p,0.809), but we could find a significant difference between case and controls for the P1655 SNP (p,0.009). ). Also we could find a significant  association in A C haplotype in patient with SCZ (p,0.004, OR, 1.7) and a protective effect in A G haplotype (p, 0.003, OR,0.57). The present study may provide further support for an association between P1655 SNP and schizophrenia in Iranian populations. Studies with more markers and subjects for various populations will be necessary to understand the genetic contribution of Dysbindin gene for the development of schizophrenia.",2011

In the most association studies candidate genes were compared between controls and all asthma patients in one group. The aim of our study was the association  analysis of selected genes in Slovenian asthmatic children. We analyzed candidate genes in all asthmatics and separately in the group of atopic asthmatics and the group of non atopic asthmatics. In addition, we have analyzed the correlation among selected polymorphisms, clinical parameters and response to therapy with glucocorticoids. Using bioinformatics tools nine single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in nine different candidate genes were selected. We have genotyped 304 children with asthma and 195 healthy controls. We have performed genotyping by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and  by the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. We have found significant association of genes CCR5, IL13 and RANTES and asthma. Our study was the first that associated IL12B and IL13 gene with a nitrogen in the exhaled air of asthmatic patients. In addition we were the first ones who associated IL13 and ORMDL3 with response to asthma therapy with glucocorticoids in the group of atopic asthmatics. Our results contribute to our understanding of the  asthma pathogenesis. Identification of polymorphisms associated with  asthma phenotypes and response to therapy may lead custom tailored and better management of asthma patients.",2011

Before the advent of genome wide association studies (GWAS), a  massive number of independent candidate genes studies suggested that SNPs from ADAM33, ADRB2, CD14, MS4A2 (alias  FCER1B),  IL13, IL4, IL4R, and LTA TNF genes were among the most replicated  associations with asthma. To date, except for the IL13 IL4 region,   none of these genes was found in close proximity of GWAS hits in  asthma or related traits. Among studies with Spanish samples, most have comprised direct associations of 1 2 SNPs/gene and limited case numbers. To test the credibility of associations of these eight candidate genes with asthma, we systematically evaluated previously associated SNPs as well as tagging SNPs (average r 2,0.96) in a large study sample  of 606 asthmatic cases from the Genetics Of Asthma (GOA) study  and 1259 population based controls. After population stratification adjustments based on 83 additional SNPs, we found nominal significant associations with asthma for 14 SNPs in 4 genes (IL4R, ADAM33,  MS4A2, and LTA TNF; 0.004â¤p valueâ¤0.047), including some of the  previously associated SNPs (MS4A2: Gly237Glu; IL4R: Gln551Arg,  Cys406Arg and Ser478Pro; LTA TNF:  857C/T and  753G/A).

It is unknown whether this is mediated by an unfavorable cardiovascular risk profile and associated atherosclerosis. Therefore, we investigated functional, structural, and genetic markers  of atherosclerosis and cardiovascular disease in migraine patients. m ethods: Subjects were participants of the Erasmus Rucphen Family  (ERF) genetic isolate study, in which confounding is reduced because of the relatively homogenous genetic and environmental background  of subjects. Atherosclerosis was assessed in 360 migraineurs (209 had migraine without aura and 151 had migraine with aura) and 617 subjects without migraine or severe headache. Atherosclerosis was quantified by Intima Media Thickness (IMT), Pulse Wave Velocity (PWV) and Ankle Brachial Index (ABI). A large number of putative cardiovascular risk parameters and the Framingham risk scores for coronary heart disease (CHD score) and stroke (stroke score) were evaluated and gene based p values were calculated for two genes implicated in cardiovascular disease ( MTHFR and ACE). Results: No difference was found in carotid IMT, mean PWV, or ABI  between migraine patients and controls. Migraine patients had no increased odds of having an elevated CHD score or elevated stroke score (>10%). No association with MTHFR or ACE was found. c onclusions : Migraineurs do not have increased risk for central  or peripheral atherosclerosis.

Formation and further progression of atherosclerosis is based on the intricate biological pathways. Our previous study (Linkoping Vilnius coronary disease risk  assessment study) showed the higher mortality from coronary heart disease (CHD) of Lithuanian men in comparison with Swedish men. Subsequent observations revealed that Lithuanian men had some differences in atherosclerosis phenotype, which may be influenced by complementary factors. It appears that one of these factors could be the oxidative stress. Thus the goal of this study was to evaluate the mainstream biological pathways inducing and maintaining the atherosclerotic process by analyzing genetic biomarkers particularly in inflammatory, metabolic pathways where the main focus is laid on  oxidation process. After bioinformatic analysis (Medline data mining) there were 150 SNPs in 89 genes selected for the construction of microarray based on the APEX technology (Asper Biotech, Estonia). Genotyping was carried out in 23 families and the TDT, S TDT as well as combined analysis were performed.

Initial signs can be seasonal or non seasonal depending on allergens involved. In a similar pattern as in human atopic dermatitis typically face, ears, paws, extremities, ventrum and flex zones are affected. The diagnosis is based on clinical signs and exclusion of differential diagnoses, such as flea allergy dermatitis, cutaneous adverse food reactions, scabies or other pruritic ectoparasites, pruritic bacterial folliculitis and Malassezia  dermatitis.

Joubert syndrome (JBTS) is an autosomaal recessive disorder  characterized by hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis, the characteristic neuroradiologic âmolar tooth sign,â and neurologic symptoms, including dysregulation of breathing and developmental delay. JBTS also includes variable features such as retinal dystrophy and renal  anomalies. Up to 27% of JBTS patients show features of autism. Thus far, 10 genes for JBTS have been identified. The ciliary gene AHI1  has been found mutated in 7 to 16% of cases with JBTS. On the other hand, of the 39 genes associated with autism, 29 (74%) encode ciliary genes. This association of ciliary genes with autism is highly significant (P < 0.001; two sided Fischer exact test). Therefore, we tested the hypothesis that ciliary genes may be involved in autism, by performing a candidate gene association study with a cohort of 84 patients with autism vs. 145 healthy controls for the 10 known JBTS genes (AHI1,  NPHP1, CEP290, ARL13B, RPGRIP1L, MKS3, CC2D2A, OFD1, TMEM216, and INPP5E).

Among the remaining patients with FXS, of those who do not meet the criteria for an autism spectrum disorder  (ASD) diagnosis, the majority have one or more autistic features, such as hand flapping, poor eye contact and tactile defensiveness. Also it is reported that FXS is the most common single gene cause of autism, responsible for 2% to 6% of all cases of autism.We studied 41 patients with non syndromic Autism in Western Saudi Arabia, we determined the trinucleotide repeat number (TRN) of CGG in 5â end for the untranslated region of the gene FMR1 using PCR technique as described by Chong et al, (AJMG 51:522 526, 1994).After performing gel electrophoresis for the PCR products using 2%  agarose gel, the results analysis demonstrated that all samples have a CGG trinucleotide repeat number less than 50 repeats.In conclusion even though our sample number is small, with the percentage reported FMR1 gene mutation seems to not play a major role in the etiology of Autism in Western Saudi Arabia. There is a much lower prevalence of FXS. We may attribute this to a larger role of recessive causes, especially if considering parental consanguinity, though there may be other reasons as well.",2011
 c haracterisation of putative autism susceptibility genes: t ranslating genome wide analysis to causation,P09.035,"G. Kenny, R.

Establishing a functional consequence of association is required to determine a causal link between marker and disease.  In a recent GWA of autism we identified a strong association within the gene MACROD2 (1). Very little is known about the function of MACROD2. This project is structured to examine the biological role of MACROD2, with the hypothesis that disruption of MACROD2 will impact on the structure and/or function of the neuron.ResultsMACROD2 is expressed almost ubiquitously across human tissues, including brain, kidney, placenta, skeletal muscle, testis and thyroid gland. Promoter mapping constructs were examined in SHSY5Y  neuroblastoma cell lines. We observed differential expression of the various promoter lengths. From this preliminary data it would appear that the promoter region of MACROD2 lies ~500bp upstream from exon 1.DiscussionGWA offer potential insight into the biology of disease. The biological characterisation of observed candidate genes must follow GWA to best take advantage of these data.This preliminary work is part of a wider comprehensive study of MACROD2 which will include both in silico and in vitro techniques.The authors acknowledge grant support from the HRB.References1.

Many rare Copy Number Variants (CNVs) that harbor  small genomic deletions and insertions have been described in the autism spectrum disorders (ASD). To identify these likely functional elements, we combined three previously published large cohorts of autistic patients with a large number of controls to analyze over 25K unrelated individuals. After stringent quality control measures, we compared 3K cases to over 19K ethnically matched controls in a two stage genome wide association design. In all, we uncovered 275 statistically significant distinct copy number variable regions. The 60 genes nearest these robust CNVRs are most enriched in gene networks impacting neurological disease, behavior and developmental disorder. A more focused analysis of a subset of 87 CNVRs that are predicted to disrupt 26 genes highlights GABA receptor signaling, and methionine/glutathione trans sulfuration as the most significant canonical pathways disrupted in ASD. Furthermore, we used available family members to characterize CNVRs into inherited vs de novo and used ethnicity information to characterize their effects in different ethnic populations. Taken together, the CNVRs we have identified impact multiple novel genes and signaling pathways, including genes involved in GABA receptor signaling, that may be important for new  personalized therapeutic development.",2011

To explore the hypothesis that rare highly penetrant mutations in different genes specific to single families are involved in these diseases, we have resequenced X linked synaptic  genes in a cohort of 285 AUT and SCZ individuals and identified truncating mutations in IL1RAPL1 and MAOB genes (Piton A, Mol. Psy., 2010). We wanted to evaluate if, besides these two mutations, some of the rare variants could have such a drastic effect at the protein level by affecting the mRNA splicing. We used an in silico approach (using Human Splicing Finder, Nnsplice, SpliceView, ESEfinder, Rescue ESE) to detect which of the rare variants could create/disrupt an acceptor site, a donor site or an exonic splicing enhancer (ESE). Fourteen variants with the best prediction scores were tested in vitro  using a minigene system in the vector SPL3B. We showed that four of these variants (28%), in GABRQ, GABRA3, HDAC6 and NXF5 genes, affect the normal splicing and are predicted to lead to truncated proteins. Our results illustrate the importance of analyzing the effect of mutations at the mRNA level and have led to the identification of new genes associated with AUT. Interestingly, although it has been considered since a long time that impairments in GABA pathways play a role in AUT etiology, it is the first time that truncating mutations in GABA receptors genes are identified in patients.",2011
 Gene ontology enrichment analysis in two independent family based samples of over 2100 families highlights biologically plausible processes for autism spectrum disorders,P09.038,"R. J. L. Anney1, E.

Consortium2","1Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, 2Autism Genome Project, Consortium,  United Kingdom","There is growing evidence to support the role of rare structural and  sequence variation in the aetiology of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). However, genome wide association studies (GWAS) of ASDs have yielded only modest evidence to support common variation in the aetiology of disorder. GWAS rely upon statistically robust genome  wide significant associations to identify genes and loci of risk. There are considerable modest association signals that do not meet stringent genome wide significance thresholds. These signals may conceal underlying patterns that are important to understanding the aetiology Complex traits and polygenic disorders275 of disease. We have developed a robust method, pedSNP ratio test  (pedSRT) to examine association enrichment in biologically linked gene sets for family based association studies. Using a two stage approach we explore association enrichment in GWA data from more than 2100 families from the Autism Genome Project. Based on estimates  from study sensitive simulation we identify excess of observed and replicated association enrichment. We highlight enrichment for sets of genes involved in diverse biological processes including pyruvate metabolism, transcription factor activation and cell signalling. Many of the genes and processes that show enrichment have previously been examined in autistic disorders and offer biologically plausibility to these findings. Moreover, our data supports the hypothesis, that in part, common variation is important in the aetiology of ASDs. This work is presented on behalf of the Autism Genome Project Consortium.",2011

In recent years, several genome wide association studies (GWAS) of ASD were published. Methods: We have carried out a bioinformatics analysis using Ingenuity and a systematic literature analysis of 200 genes from five  published GWAS that yielded association with ASD through single nucleotide polymorphisms at P < 0.0001, and we used the results from a sixth published GWAS to validate our findings. We also searched for overlap between the identified candidate genes and genes located in copy number variations (CNVs) in people with ASD and we identified microRNAs that downregulate gene expression of ASD candidate genes and are deregulated in ASD.Results: A total of 120 of the 200 ASD candidate genes encode proteins that fit into three signalling networks regulating steroidogenesis,  neurite outgrowth and synaptic function, and we were able to place 50 other ASD candidate genes in the identified networks. The proteins encoded by 11 ASD linked AKAP (A kinase anchor protein) genes functionally integrate signalling cascades within and between these networks. Lastly, we found that 70 of the 200 ASD candidate genes were found in CNVs in people with ASD and 100 of these genes were downregulated by ASD implicated microRNAs.ConclusionsWe have identified three signalling networks for ASD that contribute to our understanding of the molecular basis of the disorder and that are functionally integrated by the AKAPs, âdruggableâ proteins that need to be further investigated as possible targets for psychopharmacological treatments of ASD.",2011

By  exploiting the unique genetic signatures underpinning domestication and breed formation we can use genome wide association to identify disease genes, which may also have roles in human disease. Autoinflammatory diseases have no known pathogenic or autoimmune cause and are  characterised by recurrent episodes of fever and inflammation. Several genes have been implicated in human disease, however the majority of cases remain unexplained. The Shar Pei breed suffers a similar autoinflammatory disease and has coincidently undergone selection for a distinctive wrinkled skin. Using genome wide SNP analyses, the strongest signal of a breed specific selective sweep co localized with the fever susceptibility locus on chromosome 13. Re sequencing identified two partially overlapping duplications, which were unique to Shar Pei and located upstream of Hyaluronic Acid Synthase 2 (HAS2). HAS2 encodes  the rate limiting enzyme synthesizing hyaluronan (HA), a major component of the skin. HAS2 is up regulated and HA accumulates in the skin of Shar Pei. A high copy number of the 16.1kb duplication was associated with increased HAS2 expression and disease (p < 0.0001). Fragmented HA can act as a trigger of the innate immune system and stimulate sterile fever and inflammation. The strong selection for the skin phenotype appears to enrich for a pleiotropic mutation predisposing these dogs to disease. HAS2 was not previously associated with autoinflammation and preliminary results indicate that this glycosaminoglycan may be involved in human periodic fevers. Further inroads into the significance of this pathway for disease will be discussed.",2011
 Genetic and epigenetic alterations in patients with Balkan endemic nephropathy,P09.041,"R. G. Staneva1, I. I. Dimova1, P. Dimitrov2, D. Toncheva1","1Department of Medical Genetics, Medical University, Sofia, Bulgaria, 2National  Center of Public Health Protection, Sofia, Bulgaria","BACKGROUND: Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN) represents a chronic progressive interstitial nephritis in striking correlation with uroepithelial tumors of the upper urinary tract. The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries. The so far conducted investigations of environmental factors  as an ethological factor proved to be futile. The family and genetic studies were inconclusive.Epigenetic changes encompass an array of molecular modifications to both DNA and chromatin. Epigenetic tests can elucidate the intricate pathogenetic mechanisms of BEN and can prove to be the bridge between environmental factors and genetic background in BEN development.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Weâve collected blood and tumor samples. Weâve adopted genome wide strategy (methylated DNA  immunoprecipitation (MeDIP) and whole genome array analysis. We will perform pool analysis to identify significant methylation status differences by comparing four cohorts: (1) affected by BEN individuals with at least one affected parent; (2) healthy individuals from endemic regions with at least one affected parent; (3) healthy controls form endemic regions with no BEN family history; (4) healthy controls from non endemic regions.RESULTS: Our previous experiments showed that in BEN patients the 3q25 band was most frequently involved in chromosomal aberrations. In superficial (pTa) BEN tumor the genome instability was extremely high. Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) showed genetic gains at 1q, 3q, 7p, 7q, 15q, and 19q in BEN tumors analysed.CONCLUSIONS: The data gleaned from own experiments have  disclosed a strong impact of genetic factors to the development of BEN and BEN associated urothelial tumors.Complex traits and polygenic disorders276",2011

Variations of FTO gene contribute to common  forms of human obesity, and to BMI change across the life course. No study has investigated the joint effect of the FTO  risk variant and  emotional problems on BMI change across the life course. We aimed  to investigate whether the effect of emotional problems on BMI change through adulthood is modified by the polymorphism of FTO gene. We used data from a British 1946 birth cohort. We analyzed FTO  rs9939609 (1238 men and 1233 women), which was previously associated with BMI in this cohort, in those with adolescent emotional problems and in those without. We tested for the interaction effect between FTO and affective status on BMI at ages 20, 26, 36, 43 and  53 years and on BMI change over a period of 33 years using multilevel models. We showed that emotional problems were associated with lower BMI at age 20 (p,0.009), 26 (p,0.02) and 36 (p,0.005) years in FTO A  allele carriers, but not in TT homozygotes. A significant interaction between FTO and affective status in relation to BMI was observed at  age 20 (p,0.055) and 36 (p,0.008). Among A allele carriers, but not among TT homozygotes, those with adolescent emotional problems had faster rates of BMI increase across adulthood.The relationship between emotional problems and BMI varies by FTO   genotype. This finding has implications for predicting which people with emotional problems are at higher risk of weight gain.",2011

The focus of this study was to investigate whether genetic variation of antioxidant defense enzymes (ADE) genes plays a role in the development of BA depending on the exposure to tobacco smoking. A total 429  DNA samples (214 asthmatics and 215 controls) from adult Russian population (Central Russia) were genotyped for polymorphisms of ADE genes: catalase ( 262C>T, CAT ), superoxide dismutase (Ala16Val,  SOD2) and glutamate cysteine ligase ( 588C>T, GCLM) genes through PCR RFLP assays. It has been found that a genotype  588CT was associated with increased risk of nonallergic asthma (odds ratio 2.03 95% CI 1.05 3.90). No associations with BA were found for either the CAT or SOD2 polymorphisms.

The novel variant in the minimal promoter of SCN4B was detected in an asymptomatic young individual with a family history of SCD and a father clinically diagnosed as BrS. Detection of the variant within the family and control population is ongoing. In conclusion, these novel variants and polymorphisms in the beta subunits of sodium channel genes may have a direct or modifier effect on developing BrS, but these results need to be validated by further large scale and functional studies.",2011

We describe a family where brother and sister show mild intellectual disability, behavior abnormalities and epilepsy, with normal brain imaging and no major dysmorphic features. Karyotype is normal, as well FMR1 analysis in the male patient. Their mother, who died of cancer at 48 years of age, and a maternal aunt are both reported  to have behavioral abnormalities, mild intellectual disability, but no seizures. Two maternal uncles are healthy.In both patients, array CGH analysis revealed a 250 kb deletion of chromosome 7q31.32 encompassing one single gene, CADPS2. The father does not carry the deletion, indicating likely maternal inheritance. The deletion was excluded in one of the maternal uncles.CADPS2 is a calcium binding protein that regulates the exocytosis of synaptic and dense core vesicles in neurons and neuroendocrine cells. CADPS2 is a candidate gene for autistic disorders, since it maps in the  autism susceptibility region AUTS1 on chromosome 7q31.32, which alsocorresponds to a candidate region for mood disorders. Knock out mice show an autistic like phenotype and some ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorders) patients show a possible defect in CADPS2 splicing. We performed, therefore, a mutation screening in 46 individuals with ASD and in 34 patients with intellectual disability who did not carry any genomic rearrangement as far as array CGH analysis could detect. Two novel variants were identified in two unrelated ASD individuals, in exon 6 and exon 13 respectively. None of these changes was detected in 140 healthy individuals and functional analysis of these variants is currently ongoing. Detailed results will be presented.",2011

Congenital anomalies of the kidney and urinary tract (CAKUT) affect 1  in 500 children worldwide and are a leading cause of childhood end stage renal disease. The two most common CAKUT diagnoses are the renal dysplasia and hypoplasia. The genetic background of these anomalies is still largely unknown. Several genes involved in urinary  tract development have been implicated   HNF1b, PAX2, SIX2, etc. The molecular defects identified so far do not account for all the cases and cannot explain the great variability of phenotypes observed, which warrants further investigations.In the present study we focused on two genes most commonly affected in CAKUT   TCF2 (HNF1b) and PAX2, which code for transcription factors with essential role for renal development. Defects in TCF2, most commonly large deletions, are shown to cause renal cysts, kidney dysplasia and sometimes renal agenesis, often in combination  with diabetes mellitus. Point mutations in PAX2 cause renal hypoplasia and eye pathologies.We report here on the introduction of TCF2 and PAX2 mutation screening for CAKUT patients in Bulgaria. Altogether 15 families were involved in the present study. Each of the affected individuals was tested for the presence of deletions or point mutations by means of MLPA analysis and sequencing of the coding sequences of TCF2 and PAX2. The identification of mutations in each of the affected families will facilitate the genetic counseling. Further screening for mutations in genes essential for genitourinary system development will be performed in those cases where no defects were found in TCF2 and PAX2.",2011

Deciphering and reversing complex morbidity mechanisms will require identifying the genetic polymorphisms that eventually contribute to systemic arterial hypertension. The genetic  basis of arterial stiffness in humans, for example, has been extensively investigated through genome wide association studies (GWAS), and this has helped identify groups of relevant genes unrelated to previously suspected mechanisms.In parallel, comparative pathophysiology between humans and animal models has been proved relevant. In particular, the dog is unique to map loci underlying complex traits. To improve the current knowledge on the functional network underlying variations in ABP, we decided to focus on the molecular basis of physiological variations of this variable  in healthy dogs. Eighty nine dogs (age: 3.4Â±1.2 years, range: 1.4 5.7) were prospectively recruited. Three breeds were represented (Labrador, n,30; Doberman, n,31; Belgian Shepherd, n,28). Dogs were considered healthy on the basis of a complete clinical, biochemical and echocardiographic and Doppler examination. Using high definition oscillometry, we showed that systolic, diastolic and mean ABP in Dobermans was significantly higher than in Belgian Shepherds and Labradors (P<0.0001). ABP was also significantly higher in Belgian Shepherds than in Labradors (P<0.0001). DNA from these dogs was Complex traits and polygenic disorders279 extracted and GWAS analyses to map blood pressure loci will be  conducted as part of the European LUPA project (www.eurolupa.org).

Increased expression of this gene has also been reported in the Alzheimerâs disease (AD) brain. Loss of this gene, on the other hand, has recently been reported to be associated with neruodegeneration. We have recently reported a  polymorphic purine complex at the 1.5kb upstream sequence of the gene with GGAA and GAAA motifs. In this study we compared the homozygote haplotype compartment across the region in groups of late onset AD (n,240), MS (n,246), and control (n,610) subjects. Nineteen haplotypes were found to be homozygous in the patients, and not in the control pool (p<0.000001). The homozygote haplotypes ranged from 86 bp to 142 bp in the patients, whereas this range was between 106 bp to 122 bp in the controls. Six overlapping homozygote haplotypes were observed between AD and MS patients,  strengthening the role of this region as a common etiological factor in the pathophysiology of neurodegenerative disorders, possibly through inflammatory mechanisms. The CAV1 purine complex GGAA  and GAAA motifs contain binding sites for numerous inflammatory transcription factors including the Ets, STAT, and IRF family members.

Zadeh Vakili,"Research Institute for endocrine sciences, Shaheed Beheshti University of Medical Sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Introduction: The CD36 gene encodes for a membrane receptor that  facilitates fatty acid uptake and utilization. Genetic variants of CD36 gene have been associated with the metabolic syndrome (MetS). We aimed to evaluate the association between the rs10499859 and rs13246513 polymorphisms and MetS components. Methods: For this case control study, 140 MetS and 187 normal subjects were randomly selected from Tehran lipid and Glucose Study participants. Biochemical and anthropometrical variables were measured. Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP.Results: Participantsâ mean age was 69 years and 56.3% were male. Case and control groups were not different in allele and genotype frequencies for these SNPs. However, the presence of T allele in rs13246513 C>T was significantly associated with increased levels of HDL C (p 0.016) using a dominant model; this association was  no longer statistically significant after adjustment for sex and age (p 0.751). The association of rs10499859 with diastolic blood pressure was significant (p 0.021), but disappeared after adjustment for sex and age, using recessive model (p 0.133). Association between this SNP and BMI was significant after adjustment for MetS under the dominant model (p 0.009, Î² 2,0.68). With regard to other MetS parameters, no  significant difference was observed between genotype groups. Conclusion: We found no difference in allele frequencies of rs10499859  and rs13246513 polymorphisms between case and control groups, indicating possibly no association between these polymorphisms and MetS. However, based on our results, these polymorphisms do affect  HDL C level and BMI, although the effect may be slight and restricted specifically to an environment genotype.",2011

In the present study, we identified 3 patients with at least one TACI allele mutated out of a small cohort of 18 antibody deficiency patients, yielding a more precise estimate of 16.6%. None of these  mutations were present in 20 healthy subjects. This study suggests that additional genetic and environmental factors might have effective role in causing CVID.

In the meantime, our findings have neither been replicated nor rejected by independent studies, probably due to technical difficulties of differentiating copy number states of more than  four copies.In order to check the relevance of the association finding for psoriasis, we performed extensive methodological comparisons and an independent replication study. We observed satisfying correlation coefficients between three methods used: R 2 , 0.92 for MLPA and  classical PRT (n,159), R2 , 0.93 for classical and new PRT (n,68)).  Furthermore, copy numbers obtained by a high resolution SNP array Complex traits and polygenic disorders283 (Affymetrix 6.0) were compared with PRT copy numbers in 600  individuals. No correlation was observed indicating that the array technique is not a suitable method to detect smaller copy number differences at loci with highly variable copy numbers.We then re evaluated findings in the German case control cohort  as published in Hollox et al. (Nat Genet 2008) and confirmed the association with a p , 1.22E 05 (Mann Whitney test for unrounded copy number data). For the replication study we genotyped 1315 psoriasis patients and 593 control individuals. Statistical analyses of unrounded copy number data replicated the association with higher copy number in psoriasis (p , 3.46E 03). A combination of previous and replication datasets (obtained with purified DNAs only) resulted in a p value of 9.94E 07.

CNVs have been detected in phenotypically normal individuals as well as associated with diseases and human malformations. Over the years it has been shown that the etiology of cleft lip and/or palate (CL/P)  may be related to sequence mutations in specific genes, but also to copy number abnormalities such as deletions or duplications. The purpose of this study was to determine the role of CNVs in a group of CL/P patients (syndromic and nonsyndromic) composed by 23 proband parents trio. To screen the CNVs, we used the Genome Wide Human SNP Array 6.0 (Affymetrix). The analysis was performed using the Affymetrix Genotyping Console software and 20 in house control samples was the reference set. By focusing on large events (>100 kbp), we observed an excess of 325 CNVs in patients (CNV  average number per patient was 14). Of these, 126 were de novo CNVs. Duplications were more frequent than deletions. Approximately 150 CNVs involved known genes, including OMIM referenced genes.Among more interesting findings there are CNVs in regions known to be associated to CL/P phenotype such as a deletion (560kb) within the 1p36.33 microdeletion syndrome region, a deletion (300kb) within the 22q11.2 deletion syndrome critical region and a patient with syndromic cleft palate with 8p23.1 duplication (3.8Mb) and 15q25 q26 duplication (17Mb).

Major risk factors of CAD are hypertension, diabetes mellitus, hyperlipidemia, smoking, family history and obesity. Mutations in ACE gene can also cause CAD. Thus, the aim of this study was to investigate  the effects of major risk factors and ACE gene polymorphisms on CAD. m ethods: 205 consecutive patients with angiographically proven early  onset CAD and also 140 control subjects with no significant coronary  obstruction angiographically were recruited to the study. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and ACE gene polymorphisms were investigated with PCR.Results: The DD polymorphism was found statistically higher in patients than controls. Also ID polymorphism was found statistically high in patients, who have hyperlipidemia and smoking habits. c onclusion : Many studies showed that the ID and DD polymorphism  is strongly associated with the increased plasma or serum ACE levels.  Thus the ID and DD polymorphism favors high ACE expression and activity, hence may predispose individuals to CAD and its complications. Although it has been suggested that hyperlipidemia is an independent risk factor for CAD, our findings showed a relationship between ID genotype and hyperlipidemia therefore the severity of CAD may be associated with hyperlipidemia. Also according to our results  we consider that the combination of ID polymorphism with smoking habit may increase the development of CAD.",2011

Very little is known about the variability of plasma levels of Cripto in humans: only one study described higher levels of Cripto in patients with colon and breast carcinomas.  Nevertheless the genetic contribution underlying this variability remains still unknown.We measured the Cripto plasma levels in three isolated villages from Cilento area in South Italy (N,2026). The estimated heritability was very high (0.90). To identify genetic variants influencing the levels of Cripto, we performed both linkage and genome wide association analyses. Through the linkage analysis a strong signal on chromosome 3p21.33 was detected (LOD,6.11). This locus exactly corresponds to the location of the Cripto gene. This result was supported by the  genome wide association analysis: in fact, several SNPs in this region were strongly associated with Cripto. The most associated SNP, located 1.5 kb upstream the Cripto gene has a p value,6.9e 74; the C allele is associated with higher levels of Cripto (CC, 673.8Â±29.0 pg/ml; CT, 310.5Â±6.9 pg/ml; TT, 46.7Â±4.4 pg/ml).

The etiology and molecular  pathogenesis of CD is unknown but causes include genetic and environmental factors leading to defects in immunity and oxidative stress. Mitochondria produce large amounts of free radicals and have a low antioxidative status, therefore, mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) is at high risk of oxidative damage. Furthermore, mitochondria play a crucial role in the autoimmune response, apoptosis and autophagy, all of which are implicated in the pathogenesis of CD. The aim of the study is to compare the common 4977bp deletion and fragmentation of mtDNA in CD patients and controls. We hypothesize that the frequency of the  mtDNA deletion and fragmentation depends on patientâs genotype.

The polymorphic expression of cytochrome P4502C19 (CYP2C19) is known to be one of the determinants responsible for the pronounced interethnic and interindividual  differences in response and disposition of clinically important drugs such as citaloperam .On the basis of their ability to metabolize (S) mephenytoin or other CYP2C19 substrates, individuals can be classified as extensive metabolizers (EMs) or poor metabolizers (PMs). CYP2C19*2 and CYP2C19*3 have been shown as the main polymorphisms contributing to the PM phenotype. This study aimed evaluating the CYP2C19 polymorphism and antidepressant response to Citaloperam in Iranian major depressive population m ethods: 77 patients with major depression were selected according  to Hamilton test and then Citaloperam treatment was started. CYP2C19  polymorphism analyses were performed using a Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) method.Results and  c onclusion: Eight individuals carried two mutated  alleles, being homozygous for CYP2C19*2, and thus could be classified as poor metabolizers.

Two enzymes which can cause  vascular oxidative stress   the ecNOS and ACE   may have important roles in DR.The objective of this study was to identify possible associations between DR and NOS3 (T 786C and 4a/4b) and ACE (I/D) polymorphisms.  137 DM patients from the Azores were investigated: 76 DM patients with DR were compared with 61 DM controls without DR. ACE I/D polymorphism was typed by PCR RFLP. NOS3 polymorphisms 4a/4b  and T786C were typed by PCR and PCR RFLP, respectively. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) between NOS3 polymorphisms was analyzed  using Arlequin 3.1. Allelic frequencies for the NOS3 and ACE polymorphisms did not differ between both groups. All polymorphisms were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium with the exception of ACE I/D polymorphism in diabetic men (without DR). This HW disequilibrium suggests an association of I/D polymorphism to DM. One NOS3 haplotype (bbCC) was statistically significant associated to DR (p,0,03;OR,3,625). These polymorphisms were not in LD.This study identified a clear association of NOS3 to DR. After testing  this association, in a larger sample, this susceptibility haplotype can be used as a molecular marker for DR in DM patients. The sex specific association of ACE to DM needs to be further investigated.",2011

Mutations in the currently known DCM genes are only found in a small number of DCM patients and the clinical phenotype in families with a known DCM mutation varies considerably. Cardiotrophic viruses and/or  inflammation also play an important role in DCM and could explain interindivuals clinical variability. We assessed the presence of genetic variants and cardiac viruses/ inflammation in a group of 30 patients with an idiopathic DCM. m ethods: genetic analysis was performed on DNA through  CardioCHIP analysis, a CHIP based high throughput resequencing  platform, simultaneously analysing 34 genes involved in inherited cardiomyopathies. The presence of cardiotrophic viruses and/or inflammation was assessed on cardiac biopsies.Results: 16 of the 30 patients (52%) had genetic variations at CardioCHIP analyses. Cardiac biopsy in these 30 patients revealed ParvoB19 virus infection (>500 copies per mcg isolated DNA) in 7 patients, inflammation (>14 CD45 cells/mm 2) in 4 patients and active  myocarditis in 1 patient. Of these 12 patients with viral infection and/ or inflammation (12/30,40%), 6 patients also had genetic alterations (6/12,50%) on cardioCHIP analysis. Family history was positive for sudden death in 3 of these 6 patients. We are currently performing  DNA analysis combined with cardiac biopsies in additional patients. c onclusion : although based on small numbers, these data  demonstrate that viral or inflammatory components as a cause for DCM do not exclude a genetic component and vice versa.

Using a pooling strategy, 100 dyslectics of Finnish origin were combined into 10 equal pools. In addition, we used three HapMap DNA samples for methodological quality control. Target regions, including protein coding  exons surrounded by at least 50bp intronic sequence, and UTRs were enriched using the Halo Genomics selector probe technology with average design coverage of 95.9% and amplicon size of 420kb for all regions. Each pool was indexed with a unique barcode whereas the HapMap samples were indexed individually before paired end sequencing on a SOLiD 4 platform, at Science for Life Laboratory, Stockholm, Sweden.This approach allowed us to perform deep sequencing in order to detect novel variants with an estimated theoretical coverage of 30 300X per base.

Many studies have suggested a correlation between elevated EBV nuclear antigen 1 IgG (EBNA 1) level, MS and its disease activity. However, scarce data are available on the regulation of EBNA 1 level after EBV  infection.Hence, we decided to follow annual changes of EBNA 1 level in hereditary angioedema patients (as annual control samples of these patients were available for the last seven years). EBNA 1 level was also measured in healthy (N,182) and MS individuals (N,96) in order to analyze its correlation with exon 1 polymorphisms of the mannose binding lectin (MBL) gene. EBNA 1 level was determined by ELISA; A/0 polymorphisms of MBL were genotyped by real time PCR.For the studied period EBNA 1 IgG levels were almost constant in each  individual. Lower EBNA 1 IgG level was found in each studied group in carriers of a genotype (0/0) causing functional deficiency of MBL.

The purpose of our research was to find genetic factors of autoimmune  arthropathies. During this research comparative genotyping of two Russian cohorts was performed, both of which combine HLA B27 positive individuals.Among a large number of MHC genes it was the HLA B27, which was  strongly associated with autoimmune arthropathies. Also few other candidate genes were involved in the development of pathogenesis. Most of those genes take part in various immunological processes such as differentiation and antigen presentation. In this research we study variability of candidate gene   ERAP1 specially in Russian Caucasian population.We analyzed an association of several most associated with AS coding region SNPs in the ERAP1 gene. Was genotyped 5 ERAP1 SNPs (rs2287987, rs30187, rs10050860, rs17482078, rs27044) in  70 AS patients and 83 HLA B27 positive healthy controls from the Russian Caucasian population by SSP PCR.Considerable differences in alleleâs frequencies within patients vs control cohort were shown for 3 of 5 SNPs under investigation. Using the EM algorhitm we reconstructed 3 marker haplotypes that distinguish with high probability two cohorts due to differences in the haplotypes frequencies. In such a way both the sensitive, CCT, haplotype and the protective, TTC, one were predicted. To verify the calculation we determined genuine frequencies of 5 marker haplotypes in AS cohort by haplotyping of individual cDNA samples.

Factor VII (FVII) is one of the central proteins in the coagulation  cascade. High plasma levels of coagulation FVII have been suggested to be the predictors of death due to coronary artery disease. Since polymorphisms in the FVII gene contribute to variations in FVII levels and such polymorphisms may be associated with the risk of myocardial  infarction(MI), which is precipitated by thrombosis. We studied a total of 319 patients, 152 of whom had severe angiographically documented for coronary atherosclerosis and no documentation of a previous MI. As a control group, 167 patients with normal coronary arteriograms were also included as healthy controls. We measured the levels of activated FVII and assessed three polymorphisms in the FVII gene, one involving the promoter (A1and A2 alleles), one involving  the catalytic region (R353Q), and one involving intron 7. Each of the polymorphisms influenced the FVII levels. To emphasize the  contribution of genetic factors, we studied patients with a family history of thrombosis. Patients with the A2A2 and QQ genotypes had the  lowest levels of activated FVII (56% and 70 % lower, than the levels in patients with the wild type genotypes). In the patient group, there were significantly more heterozygotes and homozygotes for the A2 and Q  alleles among those who had not had a MI than among those who had an infarction (P,0.007) for the presence of the promoter polymorphism and P,0.01 for the presence of the R353Q polymorphism.

SAGE Labs has created targeted, homozygous knockouts of Lrrk2,  Park2 (Parkin), Park6 (Pink1) and park7 (DJ 1) in rats. The Lrrk2 gene encodes the leucine rich repeat kinase 2. Lrrk2 mutations account for 5 6% of familial Parkinsonâs dieases and 1 3% in sporadic PD. Collectively, these mutations result in the most common cause of PD.  The Park2 gene, Parkinson disease (autosomal recessive, juvenile) 2, encodes the protein Parkin that localizes to the cytoplasm of neurons and mediates the degradation of improperly folded proteins. Roughly 20% of patients with Parkinsonâs disease onset before age 40 have mutations within Park2. Park7 (Parkinson disease [autosomal recessive, early onset] 7) gene, synonym DJ 1, belongs to the peptidase C56 family of proteins. In humans, loss of function of Park7 leads to a form of early onset Parkinsonâs disease. Pink1 (PTEN induced putative kinase 1) specifies a serine/threonine protein kinase.  Mutations in Pink1 are implicated in early onset Parkinsonâs disease. The Pink1 model is being developed in collaboration with the Michael J. Fox Foundation.The targeted genomic editing for all theses genes was performed using the Zinc Finger Nuclease (ZFN) technology. The availability of genetically modified rat models for Parkinsonâs disease has opened up new avenues for researchers to better understand the pathophysiology of the disease and explore novel therapeutic avenues for its treatment.Complex traits and polygenic disorders289",2011

The number of GAA repeats on the smaller FXN allele (GAA1) only accounts  for a portion of the observed variability in cardiac phenotype.  Genetic modifying factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the Renin Angiotensin Aldosterone system (RAAS), may contribute to phenotype variability. This study investigated variability in the angiotensin II type 1 receptor (AGTR1), angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE), and ACE2 genes as cardiac phenotype modifying  factors in FRDA.Methods: Review of the AGTR1, ACE and ACE2 genes identified  twelve haplotype tagging SNPs. Correlation of these SNPs with left ventricular septal wall thickness (SWT), relative wall thickness, left  ventricular end diastolic volume index and left ventricular mass index (LVMI) was examined in a large Australian FRDA cohort (n,79) with adjustments performed for GAA1, sex and systolic blood pressure.Results: The AGTR1 polymorphism rs5186 was more common in  FRDA patients than in a control population (minor allele frequency: 0.35Â±0.04 versus 0.22Â±0.02; p,0.002). Using a recessive model of inheritance, the C allele of rs5186 showed a significant trend with increased SWT (AA+AC,10.7Â±2.1mm, CC,11.7Â±2.8mm; p,0.005) and LVMI (AA+AC,99.7Â±28.6g/m 2, CC,119.6Â±34.0g/m2; p,0.001).  rs5186 increases expression of AGTR1 by altering the binding site for  miR 155, a regulatory microRNA. No associations were observed for the remaining RAAS polymorphisms.Conclusions: rs5186 had an increased frequency in a large FRDA  population and associated with increased SWT and LVMI. This study  supports the role of RAAS polymorphisms as modifiers of cardiac phenotype in FRDA.",2011

We investigated epidemiological parameters that may affect the performance of this risk stratification strategy.Methods: Using simulated data, we assessed sensitivity, specificity,  positive and negative predictive value for all possible thresholds of the risk model and investigated how these measures depend on the frequency of disease in the population, the frequency of the high risk group, and the discriminative accuracy of the risk model, assessed by the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). We modeled genetic risk scores of 50 genes with equal odds ratios and genotype frequencies, which were varied across scenarios.Results: We show that when the frequency of the high risk group was lower than the disease frequency, positive predictive value increased  with the AUC but sensitivity remained low. When the frequency of the high risk group was higher than the disease frequency, sensitivity was high but positive predictive value remained low. When both frequencies were equal, both positive predictive value and sensitivity increased with increasing AUC, but higher AUC was needed to maximize both measures.Conclusion:  The performance of risk stratification is strongly  determined by the frequency of the high risk group relative to the frequency of disease in the population. The identification of high risk groups with appreciable combinations of sensitivity and positive predictive value requires higher AUC.Complex traits and polygenic disorders290",2011
" t wo novel loci, E m L4/ c OX7A2L/K c NG3 and IRF4/EXOC2, were identified to be associated with Gravesâ Disease in Han Chinese",P09.097,"J. Wu1, F. Tsai2, C. Yang1, C. Chang2, R. Chen2, C.

Gravesâs disease (GD) is a common autoimmune thyroid disease and displays a strong female predominance. To identify new susceptibility genes that increase the risk of GD in a Han Chinese population, we conducted a genome wide association study for GD in 596 patients and 804 controls. We found two loci associated with GD, EML4/ COX7A2L/KCNG3  (P , 3.21 Ã 10 â6; odds ratio [OR] , 1.59, 95%  confidence interval [CI] ,1.31 1.93) and IRF4/EXOC2 (P , 1.1 Ã 10â5;  allelic OR , 1.44, 95% CI , 1.22 1.69). Within these loci are biological  candidate genes that influence self tolerance and the response to estrogen, which may provide a partial explanation as to why women are predisposed to GD. We also confirmed that HLA loci (P , 2.75 Ã  10 â11; OR , 2.02, 95% CI , 1.64 2.78) and TSHR (P , 1.77 Ã 10â6; OR ,  1.48, 95% CI , 1.26 1.74) were associated with GD risk. In the present study, the HLA DQB1*0202, HLA DRB1*0701, HLA DRB1*1202, and HLA DRB1*1602 were associated with GD; these HLA alleles were not previously reported to be associated with GD in other Asian or  Caucasian populations. Our results may lead to a better understanding of the underlying mechanisms of GD pathogenesis and female biased autoimmunity.",2011

The most informative genotypes in vascular dementia were  AGT*235TT (22.83% vs. 6.08%, p<0.001) that showed a protective effect, IL6* 573GG (29.70% vs. 68.29%, p<0.001) and IL6R*1510AA (25.74% vs. 45.12%, p<0.001).

Increased levels of IL6 and his receptor IL6R increase the recruitment of monocytes and macrophages to the lesion prone sites contributing to the formation of the plate of atheroma.The potential of other related markers for increased risk to develop atherogenesis associated with lipid metabolism, hypertension or thrombosis, must to be reconsidered when are compared with the  high informative capacity showed by genes related with inflammation response.",2011

Glaucoma is characterized by loss of retinal ganglion cells, damage of the optic nerve and by elevation of the intraocular pressure. Both primary and secondary glaucoma  are diagnosed in both species, primary being considered a hereditary complex disease with multiple susceptibility genes combined with environmental factors. No canine glaucoma genes have been identified although the disease affects several breeds including Dandie Dinmont Terrier (DDT). In DDT primary glaucoma develops slowly affecting middle aged dogs and presents abnormalities in the iridocorneal angle. To map the glaucoma locus, we genotyped 23 affected and 23 control DDTs using canine SNP arrays. The average age of onset in affected dogs was 7 years. Control dogs had been confirmed healthy over the age of 10 years. Association analysis mapped a single locus on CFA8 (P raw,1.6*10 7, Pgenome ,0.001) spanning a region of ~10 Mb.  Fine mapping with 146 additional samples and 111 additional SNPs on  100 kb average spacing narrowed the association to a 2 Mb haplotype with p value of 1.63*10  10. The identified locus is syntenic with a region  associated with human glaucoma, although no genes within the region have implicated. Targeted re sequencing of the 2 Mb region revealed several possible candidate variants that are may be causal for glaucoma in DDTs. Further analysis of the re sequencing data  will likely identify a novel candidate gene for human glaucoma and establish an important late onset glaucoma model in a large animal model.",2011

Mutations in the MYOC gene were associated  with primary open angle glaucoma (POAG) and juvenile onset open angle glaucoma (JOAG). In the Brazilian population, the C433R is the most common mutation related to POAG and JOAG. Some authors have suggested the participation of CYP1B1 gene as a modifier of  POAG phenotype in case/control studies. The objective of this study was to evaluate the association between variants of the CYP1B1 gene and C433R mutation in the MYOC gene in modulating glaucomatous phenotype in a family based approach. The individuals of two Brazilian families with JOAG and POAG, harboring the C433R mutation in the  MYOC gene with incomplete penetrance were clinically assessed and  the coding regions of the CYP1B1 gene were screened. The R48G, A119S, V432L, D449D, and N453S polymorphisms were observed in members from both families. The genotype/phenotype correlation was performed, but the relationship of these polymorphisms with age of onset, IOP and cup to disc ratio was not considered statistically significant.

We present three cases of âsevere late onset Î² thalassemiaâ in  three independent subjects, all presenting with the mild phenotype of beta thalassemia minor up to adult age and developing a severe transfusion dependent phenotype in the third and fourth decade of life when a presumed homozygosity for the Î² thalassemia mutation is  observed. In all three cases molecular analysis shows sequences in which homozygosity for the beta thalassemia mutation occurs in the presence of a small but consistent wildtype signal in DNA extracted Complex traits and polygenic disorders291 from peripheral blood, from buccal mucose and from erythroid  cultures. Loss of heterozygosity due to a deletion of one allele was excluded by MLPA analysis. Affymetrix SNP array analysis reveals homozygosity for a large number of SNPâs in a region on the short arm of chromosome 11 containing the beta globin gene with a low  background of wildtype SNPâs, indicating mosaicism for a partial uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 11p.Clonal selection for hematopoietic stem cells containing the uniparental isodisomy for the mutant beta globin gene during life may account for the progressive development of the disease. A similar observation for a single case was made by Chang et al. (Haematologica 2008, 93(6):913 916), who found this in a single patient with late onset Î² thalassemia Major. Our study demonstrates that uniparental isodisomy of chromosome 11p15 is apparently more frequently  associated with late onset transfusion dependent Î² thalassemia in presumed carriers at birth, representing a novel mechanism leading to this special form of beta thalassemia and in other late onset genetic diseases.",2011

Kennedy2, J. J. Callanan1","1University College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland, 2University of Manchester,  Manchester, United Kingdom","Neuroinflammation is common in humans and often has important  and devastating consequences. In recent years there has been increased focus on the fact that neuroinflammation may underlie many neurodegenerative disorders such as Alzheimerâs disease and Parkinsonâs disease. Furthermore, the predisposition of certain  families to neuroinflammatory disorders such as Viliuisk encephalitis, Rasmussenâs encephalitis and multiple sclerosis, highlights the potential of genetic predisposition to neuroinflammation.We have recently identified a unique breed associated encephalitis in young greyhounds. Although the underlying cause is unknown, the early onset and high frequency of disease in siblings makes a genetic predisposition likely. This disorder is invariably fatal and the unique pattern of distribution of inflammation within brain tissue made it possible to accurately phenotype this condition and allowed for the  collection of diseased siblings, healthy siblings, parents and unrelated control tissues.In preliminary studies, Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) Dog Leukocyte Antigen (DLA) three locus class II haplotypes were determined in 39 diseased dogs with post mortem confirmed disease, and 111 unrelated healthy controls. A significant association was detected between the DLA DRB1*01802/DQA1*00101/DQB1*00802 haplotype and the development of disease, observed in 38.5% cases in contrast to 11.7% controls (OR,4.7, Chi2,11.9, p<0.0006).A genome wide association study (GWAS) was performed using 25 unrelated diseased animals and 24 unrelated controls. No regions achieved genome wide significance but results from a larger cohort are pending. The absence of a strong association in the GWAS study suggests this disease is not monogenic.

We used Birdseed v2 to perform genotype calling over a cluster containing all individuals and successively applied standard quality filters to each sample and marker. We then performed three Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS): two for MS and T1D respectively, and one for shared loci using all available cases. Quality filters were re applied to each specific data set, leading to a minimum of 471,016 markers available for association. For T1D, only the HLA locus reached genome wide significance (p,4x10 108), but other known genes were confirmed at lower p values, including IL2RA and  CTLA4.

Some breeds, such as the giant schnauzer, show an extraordinary high prevalence of naturally occurring hypothyroidism.

The aim of this project was to analyze whether gender, body mass index and dietary factors modulate the effect of R230C on HDL C  levels. The study included 3630 adults (1173 men and 2457 women) from a nationwide survey conducted by the Stateâs Employees Social Security and Social Services Institute in Mexico (ISSSTE). Genotyping was perfoemd using Taqman probes. The overall risk allele frequency was 9.2%, showing a north to south increasing gradient, consistent with the higher contribution of the Native American gene pool to the populations of Southern Mexico. As expected, the C variant showed a highly significant association with lower HDL C levels (mean TT:45.5 mg/dL; CT:41.9 mg/dL; CC:39.9 mg/dL; p,9.2x10  13).

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital malformation of the  hindgut produced by a disruption in neural crest cell migration during embryonic development. HSCR has a complex genetic aetiology with several genes involved in its pathogenesis. PHOX2B plays a key  function in the development of neural crest derivatives, which has  made it an excellent candidate gene for human neurocristopathies. In fact several mutations at this locus cause some syndromic forms of HSCR, as Congenital Central Hypoventilation Syndrome (CCHS) or neuroblastoma (NB). In contrast, to date no mutations had been associated to isolated HSCR and only the common variant g.1364A>G seems to have a predisposing effect in a Chinese series of patients. We sought to determine if PHOX2B plays any role in the pathogenesis of isolated HSCR, by both a mutational screening in our series, and the evaluation of its polymorphisms/haplotypes as modifier factors. No  association was detected for the common variants tested, including g.1364A>G, which suggests that its association to HSCR is restricted to Chinese population. Our most relevant finding was the identification of a de novo and novel deletion (c.393_411del18) in a HSCR patient without any feature of NB or CCHS. Absence of this variant in 150 normal controls and results of in silico and functional assays support its pathogenic effect related to HSCR. This is the first time that a PHOX2B mutation is detected in an isolated HSCR patient, which represents a new perspective of the PHOX2B role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",2011

Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital malformation of the  hindgut produced by a disruption in the neural crest cells migration during embryonic development. This disorder results in an absence of intramural ganglion cells in the submucosal and myenteric plexuses producing a functional intestinal obstruction. HSCR presents an  estimated incidence of 1/5000 live births with sex dependent penetrance and male predominance of 4:1. RET is the major gene associated to  HSCR with differential contributions of its rare and common, coding and noncoding mutations to the multifactorial nature of this pathology. In the present study, we have performed a comprehensive study of our HSCR series evaluating the involvement of both RET rare variants (RVs) and common variants (CVs) in the context of the disease. RVs were identified by dHPLC and direct sequencing whereas studies of  CVs, including the main CV associated to HSCR, the enhancer variant of intron 1 (rs2435357), were performed by Taqman technology. Our results confirm the strongest association to HSCR for the enhancer variant, and demonstrate a significantly higher impact of it in male versus female patients. Integration of the RET RVs and CVs analysis showed that in 91.66% of cases with both kinds of mutational events, the enhancer allele is in trans with the allele bearing the RET RV. Thus, RET CVs and RVs seem to act in a synergistic way leading to HSCR phenotype. Furthermore, our results show the existence of a gender  effect on both the transmission and distribution of rare coding and common HSCR causing mutations.",2011

Disturbances appearing during theses processes have been demonstrated to affect the proper formation and/or function of the ENS, leading to severe intestinal dysfunctions such as  HirschsprungÂ´s disease (HSCR). Recently, the prokineticin receptor 1 (PROKR1) pathway has been identified to work co ordinately with the RET/GDNF pathway in the development of mice ENS. In this sense, human ENS progenitors were isolated and characterized from the ganglionic gut obtained from childrens diagnosed with and without HSCR, using full thickness gut resection specimens or gut biopsy samples, respectively. The expression of both prokineticin receptors, PROKR1 and PROKR2, was then examined. In addition, we also performed a mutational analysis of PROKR1, PROKR2 and their  ligands , PROK1 and PROK2, in a cohort of HSCR patients, evaluating  them for the first time as susceptibility genes for the disease .  Immunocytochemical analysis showed that the majority of the ENS progenitors isolated and grown like neurosphere were multipotent and neural crest cells in origin. Furthermore, we demonstrated that not only PROKR1, but also PROKR2 might mediate a complementary signalling to the RET/GFRÎ±1/GDNF pathway supporting proliferation/survival and differentiation of precursor cells during ENS development. These results, together with the detection of sequence variants in PROKR1, PROK1 and PROKR2 genes associated to HSCR and usually in combination with RET or GDNF mutations, provide the first evidence to consider them as susceptibility genes for HSCR.",2011

 c haracterisation of HLA DQB1 expression demonstrates highly variable expression regulated by s NPs associated with Leprosy susceptibility,P09.114,"K. Plant, B. P. Fairfax, S. Makino, J. C. Knight","Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom","The HLA DQ1 heterodimer is composed of DQA1 and DQB1 proteins  that together form an antigen presentation molecule expressed on most antigen presenting cells. DQA and DQB alleles are strongly associated with susceptibility to multiple diseases, most notably autoimmune conditions including coeliac disease and rheumatoid  arthritis. Much of the genetic variation between DQ alleles leads to coding changes resultant in varying abilities to bind and present certain peptides. In addition to structural variation between DQA1 and DQB1 alleles, it has become increasingly apparent that alleles vary in terms of quantitative expression. The highly polymorphic nature of these genes can confound microarray based expression quantitative trait (eQTL) analysis by interference with probe hybridization. With this in mind we performed eQTL analysis of these genes in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from 288 healthy Caucasians  using quantitative PCR. Subjects were genotyped at 731,442 markers (Illumina HumanOmniExpress) with subsequent imputation analysis. We identified a haplotype associated with a 5 fold increase in baseline HLA DQB1 expression (rs9273440, p 3.2*10 66). Whilst this haplotype does not appear to be associated with autoimmune disease, it includes risk alleles for the mycobacterial disease Leprosy. Further analysis of Leprosy associated SNPs demonstrate that in tandem with increased susceptibility noted with increased HLA DQB1 expression, SNPs associated with reduced HLA DQB1 expression are protective against Leprosy. These associations were not seen with HLA DQA1 or HLA DRB1 expression. This analysis advances our understanding of the strong genetic association of Leprosy with the MHC class II region and provides functional insights into mechanisms of Leprosy susceptibility.",2011

The overall aim was to evaluate MTHFR C677T gene polymorphism in ischemic stroke (IS) and acute  myocardial infarction (AMI) patients and correlate these with Hcy level.In a study group of 54 patients (43% male) with confirmed IS, 38 patients with AMI (87% male) and 56 healthy volunteers (50% male), MTHFR polymorphism was detected by SNP extention assay and determined by ELISA (Prontodiagnostic), and total plasma Hcy was measured  by ELISA (Axis Shield). Significant increase of Hcy was detected in patients with IS (19,18+/ 1,49 micromol/L) and AMI (15,59+/ 1,76 micromol/L) compared to controls (10,01+/ 0,86 micromol/L).

Bau","Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil","Alcohol dependence, a common and clinically heterogeneous disease,  is frequently comorbid with many other mental illnesses and influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Animal and human studies have suggested that the serotonergic system plays an important role in alcohol consumption and abuse, mainly due to the serotonin receptor  1B (5 HT1B) function in the mesolimbic reward pathway. Association studies between the HTR1B gene variants and alcoholism have found significant results. There is also evidence for a complex balancing regulation of this gene by two functional variants in its promoter region (T 261G and A 161T), which are in linkage disequilibrium. The aim of this study is to investigate the role of the most relevant variants of the HTR1B gene (T 261G, A 161T, G861C and A1997G) in the susceptibility to alcohol dependence. The sample comprised 136 Brazilian alcoholics of European descendent and 237 controls. The  results suggest an association between a functional variant of the gene (T 261G) and alcohol dependence (p,0.001). The haplotype analysis, Complex traits and polygenic disorders295 comprising all studied HTR1B polymorphisms, has shown a different  distribution pattern between patients and controls (p<0.0001), which is consistent with the role of the two functional variants of the promoter region. In conclusion, our findings point to an association between functional variants in the promoter region of the HTR1B gene and  alcohol dependence, supporting previous neurobiological evidences of the involvement of HTR1B variations in alcohol related phenotypes.",2011

In previous studies, hypospadias was associated with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in SRD5A2 , ESR1,  ESR2, and ATF3. However, we were unable to replicate these associations in a Dutch study. Therefore, we examined whether this  lack of replication could be due to dissimilar environmental exposures, by exploring whether the associations differed when mothers were or were not exposed to exogenous estrogens, suffering from placental insufficiency, or having high estradiol levels. For ATF3, we also  included occurrence of an infection and/or inflammation and smoking during pregnancy. We genotyped 712 hypospadias cases and their parents, obtained environmental data from postal questionnaires, and tested the presence of gene environment interactions using the log linear approach. Gene environment interactions were identified  between rs523349 in SRD5A2  and maternal estrogen exposure and  between rs11119982 in ATF3 and the occurrence of an infection and/or inflammation. The SNP in SRD5A2  only increased the risk of  hypospadias when the mother was exposed to exogenous estrogens. This could explain why we were unable to confirm the associations  found in a Chinese and a Swedish study. Possibly, Chinese and Swedish women experience higher exposures to phytoestrogens than Dutch mothers, because they consume more soy products, rye bread,  and berries. The previously reported decreased risk for rs11119982 could not be confirmed, as we found an increased risk of hypospadias when the mother had an infection and/or inflammation and no effect when the mother did not.

We aimed to investigate the genetic  polymorphisms of interleukin 1B (IL 1B) and interleukin 1 receptor antagonist gene (IL 1RN) in children not responding to hepatitis B vaccination, and to determine whether vaccine efficacy is influenced by these gene polymorphisms.Material and Method: A total of 200 children whose anti HBs antibody levels lower than 10 IU/L after vaccination against hepatitis B according to a standardized schedule were included in this study as non responder group. One hundred healthy children who had anti HBs antibody levels higher than 10 IU/L after vaccination against hepatitis B  were included as responder group. IL 1B  511(C/T) and IL 1RN VNTR gene polymorphism were determined using PCR RLFP and PCR agarose gel based techniques, respectively.Results: Frequencies of the genotypes and alleles of IL 1B  511(C/T) polymorphism were similar in both group. Genotype frequencies of IL 1RN VNTR polymorphism were not significantly different between responders and non responders group. The frequency of allele 2 of IL 1RN VNTR polymorphism was higher in non responders than responders group (respectively; r, 0,17, r,0,09, p,0,029). The allele 1 and allele 3 frequencies were not different in both group (respectively; p,0,86, p,0,48).Conclusion: Our results suggest that, allele 2 of IL 1RN gene VNTR polymorphism might be associated with not responding to hepatitis B  vaccination.",2011
 Analysis of copy number variants ( c NV) distribution in high scoring impulsive disinhibited subjects,P09.127,"M. Laplana1, A. Aluja2, L. F. Garcia3, J.

The genetic of personality traits has been evaluated in relation to microsatellites and SNPs. Nevertheless, the contribution of CNV is not known. CNVs  produces an increase or decrease in the number of copies of one or several genes, which can affect their expression and regulation. We hypothesize that CNV may be part of the genetic component of the impulsivity/disinhibition trait. To test this hypothesis we have performed a comparative genome hybridization (CGH) analysis with the Agilent 2X400K CGH array in a group of subjects whose scores in impulsivity/disinhibition questionnaires were the highest. DNA from each high scoring subject was compared with a pool of DNA obtained from low scoring controls. We used the ADAM2 statistical algorithm to  identify CNVs and CNV regions (CNVR) with statistical threshold of 6 and a minimum of 4 probes by using Agilent Genomic Workbench. With these stringent conditions we detected 3310 CNVRs in a subset of 16 subjects that passed array QC. CNVR were distributed according to chromosome size. A total of 4430 GO annotated genes were mapped to 2825 (86%) CNVRs. An overrepresentation of GO:0005488 binding category genes was observed (3200 genes, 72%). In addition,  genes included in the GO categories synapse (120 genes, 2,7%) and  reproduction (315 genes, 7.1%) were detected with strong statistically significance.

The mechanism by which these SNPs contribute to the disease pathogenesis and which genes and proteins they affect is not  yet clear. Using method of linking SNP genotype to the level of gene expression (expression quantitative trait loci   eQTL) we wanted to explore the feasibility of eQTL analysis for linking non coding disease associated SNPs to genes they regulate. Initially we analyzed locus from which non coding SNP rs3087243 (CTLA4_CT60) showed functional relevance and has been associated with the disease. We further applied our approach to IBD5 region where SNPs are in high linkage disequilibrium and the main contributor from this region is still unknown. We measured expression of genes from selected regions in  peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and colon tissue biopsies of 632 Slovenian IBD patients and in PBL of 312 controls and genotyped all patients and controls for selected SNPs. We showed that non coding SNP rs3087243 affect expression of soluble isoform of CTLA4 gene. Our eQTL analysis of IBD5 region suggested SLC22A5 as a main gene in that region contributing to the IBD pathogenesis where decreased expression of SLC22A5 gene for disease susceptible genotype of SNPs rs1050152 and rs2631372 was detected. Our results suggest genotype/gene expression studies are good approach in linking most significantly disease associated SNPs in non coding regions with genes they regulate.,2011
 Genome wide screen for context dependant associations reveals an interaction between a locus at 4p15 and waist to hip ratio on total cholesterol,P09.129,"A. Isaacs1,2, I. Surakka3,4, C.

A large scale (>100,000 individuals) genome wide association study  recently described numerous loci affecting lipid levels. These common variants explain ~25% of the heritability of these phenotypes. A number of hypotheses have been proposed speculating on the sources of such âmissing heritabilityâ, including context dependant genetic effects  due to interactions. In the current analyses, the role of interactions influencing lipids was explored in meta analysis of genome wide data from 19 population based cohorts (n>32,000). Studied lipids were total (TC), high density lipoprotein, and low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides. The interacting variables, chosen for their prior associations with lipids, were alcohol consumption, smoking, sex, waist to hip ratio (WHR), and body mass index. Eight in silico replication cohorts (n>14,000) were available. Interactions were tested using linear regression models including both main effects and  a SNP*context interaction term. After meta analyzing the discovery and replication samples, rs6448771, near the protocadherin 7 gene (PCDH7), showed genome wide significant interaction with WHR on TC (P value,9.08e 9). A 10% increase in WHR elevated TC by 0.14 mmol/L (95% CI:0.10 0.18) for the AA genotype, 0.20 mmol/L (CI:0.16 0.24) for AG, and 0.22 mmol/L (CI:0.15 0.29) for GG. The SNP alone did not affect either WHR (P value,0.46) or TC (P value,0.51). No other genome wide associations were observed. Inclusion of suggestive SNP*context interactions in polygenic models marginally improved Complex traits and polygenic disorders298 the proportion of explained variance. In conclusion, rs6448771  represents the first SNP identified by a genome wide search for SNP* risk factor interactions affecting lipids. It is unlikely that large effect size interactions between common variants and the tested interacting contexts explain a high proportion of âmissing heritabilityâ.",2011

Studies of the equivalent disease in dogs offer a relevant animal model to investigate the genetics underlying the phenotype. The predisposition  to intervertebral disc disease in Dachshund is caused by an early degenerative process resulting in disc calcification. In Dachshund the number of calcified discs at two years of age determined by a radiographic evaluation is a good indicator of the severity of disc degeneration and thus serves as a measure for the risk of developing intervertebral disc herniation. Since the assessment of disc degeneration in humans often is performed by magnetic resonance imaging where it is difficult to evaluate disc calcifications, it is not possible to make a direct comparison between the etiology of the  disease in the two species. However, elucidation of the biological processes involved in disc degeneration in dogs will undoubtedly also shed light on the pathways relevant for the human condition. Based on stringent radiographic examinations 48 affected dogs with â¥6 disc calcifications or surgically treated for disc herniation and 46 unaffected dogs with 0 1 disc calcifications were identified. Genome wide association using the Illumina CanineHD BeadChip identified a locus on chromosome 12 from 36.8Mb 38.6Mb with 36 markers reaching genome wide significance with p values of 1.0x10  5 0.026 (p values  corrected for multiple testing). These results suggest that a major  locus affecting the development of intervertebral disc calcification is present on chromosome 12.",2011

We tested the hypothesis that the FXIIIV34L polymorphism is  associated with hematoma growth (HG) in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage (ICH). m ethods: We studied patients with spontaneous ICH within the first  6 hours after the onset of symptoms. HG was defined as an increase  >33% in the volume of hematoma on the computed tomography (CT) obtained 24 to 72 hours after the onset of symptoms in comparison with the CT at admission. We used Chi Squared test to compare  frequencies and the risk of HG was assessed as an odds ratio (OR) with a 95 % CI using logistic regression (adjustments for: age, sex, volume haemorrhage at baseline, onset to the first CT, blood glucose, blood pressure, Glasgow score). The FXIIIV34L, Factor V Leiden and F2G20210A were genotyped.Results: We included 90 patients (mean age 71Â± 10.8y.), 61% were  men. HG was observed in 35 (39%) of the patients. The frequency of HG was higher among patients who carried the L34 allele than patients with the V34 allele (51.6% vs 31.6% p,0.072). If patient who carried Factor V Leiden or F2G20210A  were not included, the difference was  significant (53.3% vs 29.6 %, p, 0.039). Carriers of L34allele showed a higher risk of HG (OR, 3.96; 95 % CI:1.4 11.2). Moreover, we found that every year of age increased 5% the risk of HG (OR, 1.05).conclusion : The L34 allele increases almost 4 times the risk of  developing HG in patients with acute intracerebral haemorrhage.

Background and Purpose    Previous GWA studies have identified 5 loci  with strong association (posterior probability of association  PPA>0.5)  and further 14 loci with suggestive association (0.1<PPA<0.5) to intracranial aneurysm (IA). However, the pathomechanism by which these loci increase the risk of IA formation remains mostly unknown.  Hypertension is one of the strongest traditional risk factors of IA known to date. We hypothesized that some of the loci with strong or suggestive association to IA convey their effect through elevating blood pressure. We further hypothesized that this effect is more likely detectable in a genetically more homogenous population.Methods   We performed a meta analysis of four previously described Finnish cohorts consisting of 12,152 individuals. We used a two tier approach; one discovery cohort and three replication cohorts.Results   We found that the suggestive IA locus at 5q23.2 in PRDM6 is  strongly associated with systolic blood pressure (SBP) (p, 0.00016). The risk allele of IA was associated to higher SBP. PRDM6 encodes a protein playing a key role in vascular smooth muscle cell homeostasis. We hypothesize that common variants in PRDM6 may contribute to altered vascular wall structure hence increasing SBP, and predispose to IA.Conclusions    To our knowledge, this is the first study unambiguously  demonstrating replication of a complex disease locus (IA), with its common risk factor (SBP). Further validation is needed to show the significance of this association in other populations.",2011

Juvenile idiopathic arthritis (JIA) is a group of chronic arthropathies in  children, caused by aberrant immune reactions, with predominance of Th1  over Th2 driven responses. It has been shown that Th1 chemokine receptor CCR5 is important in the recruitment of T helper cells of children with JIA to the synovium, where they secrete pro  inflammatory cytokines and cause the inflammation. TNF alpha is one of the major pro inflammatory cytokines and it plays a key role in pathogenesis of JIA. Anti TNF therapy has proved to be highly successful in controlling inflammation and is now widely used to Complex traits and polygenic disorders299 treat JIA. However, large percentage of patients is refractory to anti  TNF treatment. We investigated contribution of TNF alpha  308 G/A polymorphism (up regulation of TNF alpha production) and Th1 chemokine receptor CCR5 delta32 polymorphism (non functional receptor) on response to infliximab (a monoclonal antibody against  TNF alpha) in patients with JIA. We genotyped the two polymorphisms in 75 Russian patients with JIA and found that TNFA G allele frequency was significantly lower in infliximab responders versus non responders (83,3%; 96,7%, respectively, p,0,013). The proportion of minor A allele was significantly higher in responders vs. non responders (33,3% and 6,7%, respectively, p,0,008). Frequency of CCR5 delta32 was significantly lower in infliximab responders (1,4% versus 10,0% in the group of refractory patients; p,0,028).

Not much is known about the origin of CAKUT. Alterations in genes expressed during nephrogenesis are considered to be important, with the final phenotypic outcome depending on additional modifying genetic and environmental factors. The aim of this study is to identify new genetic factors involved in CAKUT aetiology.

Mutation analysis of two novel CAKUT candidate genes  was performed and revealed interesting genetic variants that were functionally characterized in vitro. Genome wide exome sequencing in CAKUT families identified variants possibly involved in CAKUT aetiology. In addition, linkage analysis of a large CAKUT family demonstrated suggestive linkage for a locus on chromosome 4.

These associations may be explained by common genetic variants that cause lower nephron endowment and smaller kidneys and subsequent increased blood pressure or impaired  kidney function. Therefore, the aim of our study was to assess the associations of common genetic variants which have previously shown to be related to adult kidney function and disease (30 common variants, P value < 5.0*10 8), and blood pressure (23 common variants, P value < 1.0*10 7), with kidney volume at the age of 6 years. This study was embedded in a population based prospective cohort study among 1233 children aged 6 years. Genotyping was done using the Illumina Human 610 Quad Arrays. If needed, imputation was performed using MACH. Two of the common variants (in/near STC1, C18orf1) reached the nominal significance threshold (P<0.05) and showed the expected  direction of the effect (i.e. lower kidney volume for a SNP previously associated to lower glomerular filtration rate in adults). However, when taking into account multiple testing, none of the common variants were associated with kidney volume at the age of 6 years.Our results suggest that the underlying mechanisms in which common variants affect kidney function and blood pressure do not include  altered kidney growth and development in early life.",2011

Presence of low expressed KIR3DL1*005 and KIR3DL1*007 alleles was also detected.The frequency of KIR3DS1 allele was found to be higher (30.7% vs 18.7%, p < 0.01, OR , 1.93) and the frequency of KIR3DL1 allele was found to be lower (69.3% vs 81.3%, p < 0.01, OR , 0.52) in the  AS cohort. Also it was found that the KIR3DL1*004 allele frequency are near equal in both cohorts, and the decrease of KIR3DL1 allele frequency in the AS cohort is due to the KIR3DL1*F but not KIR3DL1*004 frequencies. Likewise the frequencies of genotypes carrying KIR3DL1*004 was found to be near equal in both cohorts. 9 from 17 KIR3DL1*F/KIR3DL1*F AS patients carry at least one of low expressed allele.These findings support the hypothesis that KIR3DL1 is not simply a passive counterpart of the segregating KIR3DS1 allele product but play a protective role, although the presence of activating KIR3DS1 allele is more important for AS susceptibility. However individuals carrying two high level expressed inhibitory KIR3DL1*F alleles can be affected by AS.",2011

Leishmaniasis affecting humans and dogs constitute a public health  and veterinary problem. Leishmaniasis development upon infection from Leishmania  depends partly on host genetic factors. Genetic  based diagnosis would be a useful tool and therefore we sought to predict affection status in dogs using genomic selection from genome  wide SNP data.Affection status was defined as healthy infected (>4 years and prior infection, n,115) or affected (diagnosed before 4 years, n,104).  Samples were from Boxer dogs, a breed with higher susceptibility to leishmaniasis. Samples were genotyped with the Illuminaâs CanineHD and 99,997 SNPs were left for analysis after data cleaning. A modified BayesB method was used under three different models varying on whether covariates were fitted. This produced estimates of markers and covariates effects which were used to calculate predictions for the  affection status.First, the correlation (r) between predictions and actual phenotypes was used as measure of predictive power. It was higher in the unpermuted Complex traits and polygenic disorders300 dataset than in any of 10 permuted sets regardless of the model. When  predictions from five cross validation sets were combined, the highest r was obtained for Model 3 and it was greater than for Models 1 2. Second, the area under the ROC curve (AUC) was used to compare sensitivity and specificity, with Model 3 performing better than Models  1 2.

Eight SNPs within BAT1 promoter (rs2523504, p,2.5E 06); exon 3 of NFKBIL1 (rs2230365, p,1.9E 08); LTA 13kb upstream (rs13192469,  p,7.2E 07); LTA promoter (rs36221459, p,1.7E 05); TNF intron1 (rs1800610, p,2.8E 4); TNF LTB downstream (rs769178, p,5.8E 05) and BTNL2 DRA interval (rs3135365, p,4.6E 24 and rs7773756, p,3.3E 18) were significantly associated even after adjustment with sex and the boneferroni correction for multiple testing. In addition to find the role of previously unidentified genes, BAT1 and BTNL2, we also established the functional status of the SNPs in in vitro reporter assays. Further, an assessment of an interaction of multiple genes in unison within the studied region provided a graded risk to leprosy depending on the combination of genotypes for the significantly associated functional SNPs. These observations dissect the role and help in better understanding of HLA loci involved in disease pathogenesis.",2011

To elucidate potential novel pathways behind low HDL C, we have employed 3 different high throughput omics: genomics, transcriptomics, and lipidomics. We have performed GWAS on 450 Finnish individuals with low or high HDL C (10th and 90th population percentiles). Out of subset of these individuals (n,54), we obtained subcutaneous fat biopsies for genome wide expression analysis, and isolated plasma HDL particles for lipidomics analysis with MS technology.We first performed gene network analysis for genetic loci associated with low HDL C observing that SNPs within four inflammatory pathways (e.g. antigen presentation) were enriched among the low HDL cholesterol associated genes (p,10^ 5). Also, these inflammatory pathways were over expressed in the adipose tissue of low HDL subjects. We then calculated genetic risk scores based on low HDL cholesterol associating SNPs from these pathways, observing that high risk score resulted in not only decreased HDL cholesterol levels but also increased expression of these inflammatory pathways. Moreover, individual genes of these pathways (e.g. HLA DRB1) exhibited allele specific expression, inversely correlating with HDL C levels.Consistent with enrichment of inflammatory processes in association and expression analyses, the inflammatory nature of the HDL particle  itself was evident in the lipidomics analysis. For instance, ceramides with well established pro inflammatory function were elevated in HDL particles from subjects with low HDL C, and anti oxidative ether bond containing plasmalogens down regulated.Our findings imply that genetic variation influences the molecular alterations associated with low HDL cholesterol on both expression and metabolite levels, suggesting a more inflammatory and less vasoprotective role for HDL particles in subjects with low HDL C.",2011

Monogenic forms of PD account for only a small percentage of the affected population (<10%). The majority of PD cases are considered to be caused by the interaction of genetic and  environmental factors, and susceptibility variants of genes involved in monogenic forms of PD have been identified in sporadic PD in several populations. Recently, mutations in the LRRK2 gene have been implicated in familial dominant and sporadic cases of PD. The G2019S mutation in the LRRK2 gene has been identified in approximatelly 5 6% of familial forms of PD and about 1 2.5% of sporadic cases, and constitutes the most frequent genetic cause of PD known to date. In this study, 6 mutations in the LRRK2 gene were determined in 326 patients with PD and 135 control subjects. The mutations analyzed  were G2019S, R1441C/G/H, I2020T and Y1699C. Eleven of 326 patients with PD carrying the G2019S mutation (3.4%). None of the other LRRK2 mutations were found in the remaining patients. The phenotype of the 11 G2019S mutation carriers were similar to those of typical PD. The age of onset was variable, ranged from 37 to 80 years. In conclusion, the G2019S mutation frequency in PD patients was similar to that reported in other European countries, and this mutation was not identified in controls. The R1441C/G/H, I2020T and Y1699C mutations were not found in any of the PD patients or controls.",2011

PEX is sometimes accompanied by glaucoma, and is considered Complex traits and polygenic disorders301 the most common cause of secondary glaucoma. Pseudoexfoliation  glaucoma (PEXG) may be caused by hindrance of drainage of aqueous humor caused by PEX material. PEX deposits consist of complex cross linked fibrils including components of elastic microfibrils such as fibrillin1 and Latent TGFÎ² Binding Protein 2 (LTBP2). The genetic  basis of PEX remains largely unknown. An association between PEX and a few nucleotide variations in the LOXL1 gene coding lysyl oxidase like 1 have been reported in some populations. However, the data on LOXL1 from different populations are not all consistent and the role of the gene with respect to PEX is unclear.LTBP2 was recently identified as a primary congenital glaucoma causing gene. The protein product of the gene may have structural and non structural functions. As glaucoma often occurs along with PEX, and as LTBP2 is a component of PEX deposits, we queried  the possibility that mutations in LTBP2 may cause or predispose individuals to PEX.Exonic regions of LTBP2 were sequenced in 47 PEX affected individuals. In addition to several previously reported sequence variations, five novel coding variations that cause amino acid changes were observed in the DNA of the patients. At least one of the variations that affects a proline residue is quite likely to be associated with the PEXG phenotype.",2011

Major depressive disorder (MDD) ranks among the top ten causes of  global burden of disease. To our knowledge, only one systematic CNV screening of patients with MDD has been carried out. We performed a genome wide analysis of CNVs in 575 German patients with a DSM IV diagnosis of MDD and 1,618 controls. We genotyped all individuals  using either Illuminaâs HumanHap550, Human610 or Human660W arrays. To identify potential CNVs, we analyzed each individualâs SNP chip information with QuantiSNP and PennCNV. To minimize the number of false positive CNV calls, we developed a stringent quality protocol, requiring CNVs to have a minimum of 30 consecutive SNPs and a confidence value of at least 30. The two datasets generated by QuantiSNP and PennCNV were analyzed separately. Only those regions for which both programs generated nominal significant P values were included in further analyses. We discovered a significant overrepresentation of CNVs in four different chromosomal regions (7p21, 15q26, 16p11.2, 18p11) in patients compared to controls. To our knowledge, CNVs in 7p21, 15q26, and 18p11 have not been described in MDD or other psychiatric disorders. The finding on chromosome 16p11.2 is of particular interest as CNVs in this region are associated with autism and schizophrenia. In our sample we observed three rare CNVs in 16p11.2 (one microdeletion, two microduplications) in patients and none in controls (P , 0.0178).Our study provides evidence for an involvement of CNVs in the development of MDD and indicates an extension of the phenotype  associated with CNVs in 16p11.2.",2011

Alterations in immune system have been implicated in the onset and development of MDD and PD. We studied the relationship between single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) of IKBKE (inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase epsilon) gene from chromosomal region 1q32 and MDD and PD. The association study design was used: 17 SNPs covering the IKBKE gene were analyzed in 581 unrelated patients and in 389 healthy control subjects. All subjects were individuals of Caucasian origin living in Estonia. Patients were divided into two groups according to diagnosis: comparison of allelic and haplotypic frequencies was performed between control group and MDD patients (n,391), PD patients (n,190), and the whole patient group (n,581).  Both MDD and PD groups included âpureâ phenotypes as well as phenotypes comorbid to other mood and anxiety disorders. SNPlex Genotyping System was applied for genotyping, following association and haplotype analyses with Haploview program. Association analysis revealed the most prominent relationship between MDD patient group and SNPs rs1930437 and rs2274902 (allelic p values 0.0007, 0.0013, respectively). Statistically significant differences occurred in the panic and whole group as well. Haplotype analysis revealed five haplotype blocks in all tested groups of patients compared to healthy controls. Significant haplotypic associations confirmed allelic associations in MDD group. These results suggest that IKBKE gene from 1q32 chromosomal region may possibly be related to mood and anxiety disorders.",2011
 Variants associated with mammographic density are also associated with breast cancer,P09.144,J. S. Varghese,"Centre for Genetic Epidemiology, Department of Public Health and Primary Care, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","introduction: Mammographic density (MD), is one of the strongest  breast cancer risk factors. However, the mechanism by which this  risk is mediated is unclear. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have demonstrated that a variant in ZNF365 is associated with both breast cancer risk and MD 1;2. We investigated if other SNPs  showing evidence for association with MD in the meta GWAS were associated, in aggregate, with breast cancer risk. m ethod: The SNPs associated with MD were identified through meta  analysis of 5 GWAS(n,4877). For each SNP, Z statistic for combined  effect over all studies was computed and converted into per allele effect size estimate (Î² k ). Effect of each SNP on breast cancer risk  was then assessed using data from UK2 GWAS study (3628/5190).  The combined effect of multiple SNPs was evaluated by multiplying signed MD beta value(Î² k) for each of N SNPs over given significance  threshold in MD meta GWAS by their number of effect alleles at that SNP, G ik(0, 1 or 2), and summing over all N SNPs to create the  individualâs score(Zi). N Zi,â Î²k Gik k,1 Logistic regression was then used to examine if the individualâs score was predictive of breast case control status. Results: The top 5% of density SNPs significantly predicted breast  cancer case control status in the UK2 GWAS(P,0.005 & P,0.009 genotyped & imputed SNPs respectively). This predictive effect was  not seen when only top 1% of density SNPs were used(P,0.3 & P,0.5 using genotyped & imputed SNPs respectively). c onclusions: These results suggest that many SNPs associated with  MD are also associated with breast cancer.Complex traits and polygenic disorders302",2011

Low intelligence, mental retardation, is thought to have a heritable cause in about 50%. Association studies have identified some loci and genomic variants associated with variation in intelligence in the normal range. High IQ is thought to be caused  by the additive effect of the same genomic variants, but experimental evidence for this hypothesis is lacking. For mental retardation however, known genetic causes are rare and monogenetic.Aim: We set out to test whether the SNAP25 gene that was previously linked to intelligence in the normal range, is also linked to variation in intelligence at both the lower (mental retardation) and the upper range (high IQ).Methods: We genotyped two SNPâs in SNAP 25 (rs363039 and rs363050), previously linked to variation in normal intelligence (Gosso,  et.al. 2006), in a cohort of 644 children with mental retardation and a cohort of 360 participants of the Amsterdam growth and health study, which all were following the highest level of education at the time of recruitment.Results: We found a significant (p>0.05) lower allele frequency of the allele associated with an higher IQ (gosso et. al. ) for both SNPâs (rs363039 and rs363050) in SNAP25 in the MR cohort compared to the high IQ cohort.

Their dysregulation leads to common endocrine disorders. Despite being relatively highly heritable (65% and 40% respectively), genetic loci so far identified only account for a small proportion of the estimated genetic variation. To identify  additional associated regions, we carried out a meta analysis of up to 12 GWAS using ~2.5 million directly genotyped or imputed autosomal SNPs, corresponding to 18,538 and 13,590 euthyroid subjects of European ancestry for TSH and FT4, respectively. Standard quality filters were applied to each study, and single marker association estimates were combined using inverse variance weights. For TSH, we confirmed association at PDE8B (rs1382879 p,1.28x10 32) and CAPZB (rs10799824, p,1.0x10 16), and observed 7 novel loci at chr6q27, chr2q35, chr4q31.23, chr9q34.2, chr16q23.2, chr6p21.1  and chr15q26.1 (p<5x10 8).

Dyslipidemia, hypertension, insulin resistance, and measurements of  obesity are key components in definition of the metabolic syndrome (MetS). Genome wide association studies (GWASs) have identified several susceptibility loci for these MetS component traits, but there is little evidence for genes contributing to the syndrome as an entity  rather than to individual component traits.We conducted a GWAS on MetS and its component traits in four Finnish cohorts (2,637 MetS cases and 7,927controls), and followed the top loci in an independent sample with transcriptome and NMR based metabolome data. Furthermore, we tested for loci associated with multiple MetS component traits using factor analysis and built a genetic risk score for MetS risk.A previously known lipid locus, APOA1/C3/A4/A5 gene cluster region,  was associated with MetS in all four study samples (meta analysis  P,7.23x10  9). Primary source of the association was the SNPs effect  on triglyceride (TG) (P,2.59x10 31) and high density lipoprotein (HDL)  levels (P,5.83x10 8), which was further supported by serum metabolite  analysis, where rs964184  associated with various VLDL, TG, and  HDL metabolites (P,0.024 1.88x10 5). 22 previously identified loci  for individual MetS component traits were replicated in our GWAS  but none of these loci significantly associated with two or more uncorrelated traits. A genetic risk score (GRS), calculating the number of alleles in loci associated with individual MetS traits, was strongly  associated with MetS status.Our findings suggest that MetS does not have a common genetic background but is likely to result from complex interactions between lifestyle and multiple genetic variants which in combination may predispose to MetS.",2011

V.A. Almazov, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. Metabolic syndrome (MS) is a cluster of metabolic and genetic  entities closely associated with the development of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and diabetes mellitus type II (DM2). Male sex is an important factor in the pathogenesis, risk, and prognosis of many known diseases. Therefore, the aim of this study was to investigate  the most significant cluster of cardiovascular risk factors specific to males. Patients and methods. The MS patient group consisted of 176 males with abdominal obesity, having at least two of the CVD risk factors (average age 61.7ÃÂ±1.0). Among them, 89 patients had DM2, 20 patients had DM2 and survived after myocardial infarction, and 67 patients survived after myocardial infarction but did not have DM2. The control group consisted of 115 males without CVD and DM2 (average age 40.0ÃÂ±0.5). Polymorphisms of genes APOA1 G 75A and C+83T, APOC3 Sst1, APOE, APOA5 T 1131C and S19W, ADRB3  W64R, and ACE I/D were studied. Statistical analysis included logistic regression method. Results. We have found cardiovascular risk factors associated with manifestation of MS in males. Factors that increased the probability of MS in males were moderate and severe obesity, and the 19W allele of the gene APOA5. The normal level of triglycerides appeared to have protective effect. Conclusion. It is evident from the  study that the normal triglyceride levels are protective against MS and CVD in males. And the 19W allele APOA5 that was previously shown  to associate with elevated triglyceride levels is the MS risk factor.",2011

Background: New onset type 2 diabetes (DM2) is a frequent  complitation among transplanted patients treated with the immunosuppressor tacrolimus (Tac). Several gene variants associated with the risk DM2 in the general population would also increase the risk of posttransplant DM2 (NODAT). Common mitochondrial DNA variants  (haplogroups) were also associated with DM2. We investigated the effect of nine mtDNA polymorphisms on NODAT among heart or kidney transplanted patients treated with Tac. m ethods: The nine mtDNA SNPs that define the common European  haplogroups, and the 310 polyC and T16189C SNPs were determined  in 120 NODAT and 200 patients who remained non diabetics (no NODAT) from the same region (Asturias, Northern Spain).Results: Mitochondrial haplogroup H (7028C) was significantly more  frequent in the NODAT group (56% vs. 35%; p,0.001; OR,2.38, 95%CI,1.48 3.72). The mtDNA 16189 SNP was not associated with NODAT risk. The NODAT group had a higher frequency of D310 >7 C repeats (70% vs. 60%; p,0.012). Haplotype 7028 C/D310  7C would have a protective effect against the development of NODAT. Sequencing of the mt HVI region from blood leukocytes showed that this haplotype was linked to a lower D310 polyC heteroplasmy compared to the other haplotypes. c onclusion:  Common mtDNA variants were associated with the risk  of NODAT. This effect could be due to the higher instability of mtDNA  replication among individuals with at risk haplotypes, and this could affect mitochondrial function in beta pancreatic cells in response to Tac increasing the risk for DM2.Complex traits and polygenic disorders304",2011

Mitochondrial diseases are a clinically heterogeneous group of disorders that arise in young and adult patients at any age, as a result of dysfunction of the mitochondrial respiratory chain. Mitochondrial dysfunction frequently affects the heart and may cause both hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy. The cardiomyopathy is  usually a part of a multisystem involvement and may rarely be isolated. In fact, it can be associated with others disorders, such as hearing loss. The state may be stable for many years, but rapid deterioration may occur and often lead to congestive heart failure.We described a newborn girl with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and profound hearing loss. The mtDNA mutational analysis revealed the presence of known polymorphisms associated to cardiomyopathy and/or hearing loss, and 2 novel heteroplasmic mutations: m.3395A > G (Y30C) occurring in a highly conserved aminoacid of the ND1  gene and the m.4316A > G located in the residue A54 of the tRNAIle gene. These 2 novel variations were absent in 150 controls. All these variants may act synergistically and exert a cumulative negative effect on heart function to generate the cardiomyopathy.",2011

The disease also has a high prevalence in dogs, especially in Cavalier King Charles Spaniels (CKCS), of which, nearly all are affected at the age of 10 years. In affected individuals the mitral valves become enlarged, lose  flexibility and eventually protrude into the left atrium, resulting in mitral regurgitation (MR). Since dog breeds are much more homogeneous than the human population it is more feasible to indentify genetic components underlying complex diseases in dogs. Thus, dogs provide good models for human diseases. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) in CKCS to identify the genes underlying MMVD. Cases and controls were selected using stringent criteria: cases were dogs with early onset of MMVD i.e. murmur â¥1 and MR jet >20% at <4.5 years, or with clinical signs of heart failure; controls  were dogs with late onset i.e. murmur â¤2 and MR jet <50% at >8 years. A total of 139 cases and 102 controls were genotyped with the 170k CanineHD BeadChip (Illumina). Genome wide association analysis using PLINK was performed, and the resulting p values were adjusted  for multiple testing. The GWAS revealed two statistically significant regions on canine chromosomes 13 and 14 (p values: 4.0â10  5   4.7â10  2 and 7.9â10 4   1.7â10 2, respectively).

Tibboel, A. de Klein","Erasmus MC Sophia, Rotterdam, Netherlands","The occurrence of phenotypic differences between monozygotic (MZ)  twins is commonly attributed to environmental factors, assuming that MZ twins have a 100% identical genetic make up. Yet, recently several lines of evidence showed that both genetic and epigenetic factors could play a role in phenotypic discordance after all. One report suggested a  high occurrence of low mosaic CNVs within MZ twin pairs discordant for Parkinson disease, thereby stressing on the importance of post zygotic mutations as disease predisposing events.In this study, we analyzed the prevalence of discrepant somatic CNVs in discordant MZ twins of the Esophageal Atresia and Congenital Diaphragmatic Hernia cohort in Rotterdam. We used high resolution SNP arrays on blood  derived DNA from 11 (4 CDH and 7 EA) pairs of MZ twins. Paired analysis was executed with specific attention to isolated allelic imbalances as a marker for low mosaic CNVs. In this  way, we showed that somatic CNVs are not the cause of phenotypic discordance in this cohort of MZ twins. In addition, bead chip genotyping showed no evidence for pathologic SNP differences within each MZ pair either. To exclude the possibility of somatic mutations restricted to the affected tissues, we screened for CNVs in proximal pouch  and diaphragm tissue of a separate group of patients as well. In line with the twin data, no target tissue specific CNVs were revealed in  DNA from 12 pouch  and 13 diaphragm biopsies. Yet, recurrent, germ line chromosome 22q11 13 were discovered. In conclusion, post zygotic structural mutations are not a common cause of OA and CDH.",2011

But most of the results are contradictory including both case  control and parametric linkage studies. In this study, we aimed to analyze the sequence variations of MSX1 to determine MSX1 mutations that might be etiological to patients with NSCL/P in Turkish population.Material and Methods: 100 controls and 100 patients without any family history of NS CL/P were recruited to the study. Mutation analyses of the MSX1 gene was carried out by PCR  SSCP  Sequencing methodology. Results: According to the SSCP and sequencing analyses, we couldnât detect any sequence variations in patients and control groups.Conclusion: Our study was based on population  based and case  control design, not case  parent design because of having no information about MSX1 gene alterations in Turkish population. MSX1 gene variants were linked to the NS CL/P formation in some populations but the same results couldnât be obtained for other populations. In order to clarify the role of MSX1 gene, different population  based studies are needed. Due to our results, MSX1 gene seems not to have target role in NS CL/P formation, at least alone.

This is consistent with the idea that differences in gene expression might explain a significant part of the genetic risk for common diseases. It is also believed that the genetic background  differs for different subcategories of complex phenotypes. Taken together, this led us to test two hypotheses: First, many common expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) are collectively associated with MI. Second, the effects of these loci are not equal for two subtypes of MI, namely ST segment elevation MI (STEMI) and non ST segment elevation MI (NSTEMI).We performed a GWAS in a sample consisting of acute coronary syndrome patients and healthy controls (n,3373). We selected 20,092 SNPâs annotated as eQTLâs in a public database and compared them  with SNPâs randomly selected from the dataset by permutation.The set of eQTL SNPâs is associated with MI (p<0.001). This effect is significantly stronger for NSTEMI (p<0.001) as it is not seen in STEMI (p,0.616). The difference is driven by eQTL SNPâs at the HLA locus on 6p21.3. Exclusion of this locus abolishes the difference between NSTEMI and STEMI but not the association of the remaining SNPâs with MI.Our results add to the notion that common differences in gene expression influence the risk for developing MI. We show that the risk conferred by eQTLâs is conditional on a clinically relevant classification of MI and identify a locus contributing to this difference.",2011

To assess the role of the human ortholog VANGL2 in the complex etiology of NTDs in humans, we resequenced this gene in a large multi ethnic cohort of 673 NTD patients. We identified  six novel heterozygous missense mutations in seven patients, that could be pathogenic based on genetic and initial validation data. Four of these mutations, p.Arg135Trp, p.Arg177His, p. Leu242Val, p.Arg270His, were predicted to be damaging to protein function using bioinformaticsâ tools, and two others, p.Thr247Met and p.Arg482His, affect highly conserved residues across evolution. Five mutations were identified in patients affected with closed spinal NTDs, suggesting that VANGL2 mutations may predispose to thys type of NTDs. Our findings strongly implicate VANGL2 in the genetic causation of spinal NTDs in a subset of patients and provide additional evidence for a pathogenic role of PCP signaling in these malformations.",2011
 s ex modulates the effect of DRD2/ANKK1 polymorphisms in smoking,P09.166,"N. R. Mota, V. Contini, E. R. Polina, E. S. Vitola, F. A. Picon, E. H. Grevet, P.  Belmonte de Abreu, C. H. D. Bau","Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul, Porto Alegre, Brazil","Several publications, have addressed the relationship between  smoking behavior and the DRD2 gene, especially focusing on the  Taq1A polymorphism (which in fact, belongs to a DRD2  neighbor gene,  named ANKK1). However, strong heterogeneity among studies has  been reported by meta analysis. Here we analyze the potential role of  Taq1A and other three neighbor polymorphisms (rs6277, rs2283265 and rs2734849) in relation to smoking status. Our sample is composed of 463 adult patients with ADHD and 608 non ADHD adults, totalizing 1071 subjects. Smoking is more common among patients with than without ADHD (43% vs. 18%, respectively; p<0001) but this is not influenced by sex. Logistic Regression analysis, controlling for ADHD status and sex, showed a significant interaction between Taq1A X gender on smoking status (p,0.016). A similar result was observed for the SNP rs6277 in exon 7 of DRD2  (p,0.076 for interaction). Results  of both polymorphisms are suggestive of opposite effects in men and  women, with trends towards predisposition in men and protection in women. We did not observe any significant main effect or interaction of the other two polymorphisms studied. Therefore, our results support the hypothesis that the association of the Taq1A and smoking may be modulated by sex, which would help explain the heterogeneity in findings on the Taq1A/smoking association of the last several years. This also seems to be the case involving the rs6277 polymorphism, although further studies are needed to sustain this hypothesis.",2011

The published data suggest that the FGF signalling pathway may contribute to as much as 3% 5% of non syndromic CLP (NSCLP) and will be a consideration in  the clinical management of CLP.The aim of the study was to confirm the role of FGF1 gene in development of NSCLP.Subjects and Methods: Thirty five SNPs in the FGF1 gene were genotyped using APEX 2 technology for allelic association with NSCLP. The data set consisted of 108 non syndromic cleft lip and/or cleft palate patients samples and 182 unrelated non affected and randomly selected individuals from Latvia as control population. Out of the 108 cleft cases, 79 had CLP and 29 had CL. Association analyses  of cases and controls were performed using PLINK software version 1.07.Results: Genotype distributions among study groups were in a Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. We found very strong evidence that the FGF1 gene plays a significant role in the development of non syndromic orofacial clefts. Three markers in the FGF1 gene were strongly associated with non syndromic cleft lip and/or cleft palate (rs33992, p,0.001, OR,1.68, 95% CI,0.051 0.556; rs34010, p,0.0002, OR,0.48, 95% CI, 0.332 0.707; and rs2070715, p,0.025, OR,0.67, 95% CI, 0.465 0.951).Conclusions: The results show that FGF1 gene contains genetic variations contributing to formation to clefts but additional studies should be made to clarify the possible involvement of these polymorphisms in  the etiology of NSCLP.Complex traits and polygenic disorders308",2011

 Genetic polymorphisms in PXR associated with alcohol consumption and side effect of methadone maintenance treatment,P09.169,"H. Tsai, Y. Liu, J. Tian, O. Chang","National Health Research Institutes, Miaoli County, Taiwan","Objective: Methadone, a synthetic opioid, is well known as  a maintenance drug to prevent heroin addicted patients from experiencing withdrawal symptoms. In addition, nuclear receptor pregnane X receptor (PXR) is a xenobiotic nuclear receptor that binds ligands with different structures and is implicated in diverse functions.  In this study, we tested whether PXR genetic polymorphisms are  associated with alcohol consumption and side effect of methadone maintenance treatment. m ethods: A total of 366 heroin addicts undergoing methadone  maintenance treatment were recruited in this study. Data were collected  using interviewer administered assessments, including Treatment Outcomes Profile (TOP), and Treatment Emergent Symptoms Scale (TESS). Twenty five single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of PXR  were genotyped. After adjusting covariates, regression analyses were  performed to identify individual association of PXR with side effect of methadone maintenance treatment, and joint association of PXR and  ALDH2  with alcohol consumption. Permutation based approach was  applied to correct for multiple testing.Results: We found that 11 PXR SNPs were significantly associated with TESS, and 6 PXR SNPs were significantly associated with alcohol consumption after multiple testing correction (P corrected < 0.05). In  addition, haplotype combination of ârs1523130 rs6785049 rs6438550â  was significantly associated with average of alcohol consumption after multiple testing correction (P corrected < 0.05). Furthermore, We found  rs6438550 of PXR was interacted with rs671 of ALDH2  on alcohol  use (P < 10 4). c onclusion:  PXR genetic polymorphisms may have impact on the  side effect of methadone treatment, moreover influence alcohol consumption through interacting with ALDH2  gene in heroin addicts.",2011

The aim of this study was to define the most characteristic clinical, genetic, anthropometric and laboratory findings in childhood obesity in an attempt to find the most efficient way to  diagnose a genetic cause of obesity. Subjects and Methods: All cases were subjected to full history taking, and full clinical examination including dysmorphology and pubertal assessment. Endocrinal causes were excluded. Serum leptin and insulin where estimated whenever a monogenic cause of obesity was suspected. Conventional and high resolution chromosomal analysis, FISH and molecular studies where done in selected cases. Results: This study included 30 obese children and adolescents. Among the 30 studied cases, 17 had syndromic obesity (56.67%), 7 had simple obesity (23.33%) and  6 had monogenic obesity (20%). Within the 6 diagnosed cases with monogenic obesity, we detect one novel missense mutation in the leptin LEP gene (N103K) and another novel nonsense mutation in the leptin LEP gene (W121X) as well as missense mutation in the Leptin receptor gene LEPR (P316T).Conclusion: Although genetic causes of obesity are rare autosomal recessive disorders, high consanguinity rate in our society will lead to the discovery of a high number of monogenic and pleiotropic obesity.

Independently of the BMI of the individuals, common variations in LEP and LEPR genes were associated with specific eating patterns, mainly with respect to timing of eating. The  LEP +19A/G polymorphism served as an independent predictor for BMI, percentage of body fat and skinfold thickness and significantly affected the time structure of the daily energy intake. The POMC Rsa I polymorphism was associated with percentage of body fat. The ADIPOQ +45T/G polymorphism was associated with the thickness of the subscapular skinfold.

The SNPs might directly influence MC4R function/expression, or they are on a haplotype that predisposes to obesity or  includes functionally relevant genetic variation (synthetic association). MC4R is an ideal model to explore synthetic association.Methodology/Principal Findings: We analyzed a genomic region (364.9 kb) encompassing the MC4R in GWAS data of 424 obesity trios (extremely obese child/adolescent and both parents). SNP rs12970134 showed the lowest p value (p , 0.004); conditional analyses on this SNP revealed that 7 of 78 analyzed SNPs provided independent signals. These 8 SNPs were used to derive two marker haplotypes. The confirmed (363 independent obesity trios) obesity effect haplotype  comprises the MC4R. Including MC4R coding variants in a joint model had almost no impact on the effect size estimators expected under synthetic association. Haplotype analyses were also conducted for the 31 additional GWAS derived SNPs; 2 haplotypes revealed better results than the single SNPs, confirmation is ongoing.Conclusions/Significance: A haplotype reaching from 5â of the MC4R to at least 150 kb from the 3â end of the gene showed a stronger association to obesity than single SNPs. Synthetic association analyses revealed that MC4R coding variants had almost no impact on the association signal.

We evaluated two frequent polymorphisms of MTHFR gene C677T and A1298C in 65 Slovak patients with nonsyndromic orofacial clefts (OFC) (38 males, 27 females); 53 of all had cleft lip or cleft lip and palate (CLP) and 12 had isolated cleft palate (CP). The control group consisted of 290  healthy newborns (147 males, 143 females). The results revealed significantly higher proportion of T allele in C677T polymorphism in the whole OFC patientsÂ´ group (p,0.043) as well as in the CLP group 0.037) compared to the controls. Genotype analysis, however, did not show significant prevalence of mutant genotypes (OFC p,0.398, CLP p,0.697), only of heterozygotes (OFC p,0.014, CLP p,0.002).

To assess effectiveness of steroid osteoporosis prevention by antiresorptive agents (ARA   calcium, vitamin D, bisphosphonates,  calcitonin) in patients with IPF with different genetic predisposition to osteoporosis. s ubjects. 84 Caucasian patients with IPF, 16 men and 68 women, age  56.5Â±10.9 years, treated with GCS and ARA. m ethods. Bone mineral density (BMD) measuring by DEXA,  patientsâ questionnaires and genotyping approaches were used.  We investigated 5 SNPs by PCR RFLP analysis: 2 sites in vitamin D receptor gene (VDR BsmI and VDR FokI), rs1801197 in calcitonin receptor gene, rs1800012 in collagen type1 alpha1 gene and HindIII  polymorphism in osteocalcin gene.Results. Frequencies of minor alleles were 0.375 (VDR BsmI), 0.411 (VDR FokI), 0.185 (COL1A1), 0.280 (CALCR), 0.179 (BGLAP). Associations between VDR FokI and BGLAP genotypes and BMD Complex traits and polygenic disorders311 (p,0.02 and p,0.05, respectively), between GCS doses and bone  fractures occurrence (p,0.01) were found. Multiple regression analysis showed significant influence of polymorphisms VDR FokI, COL1A1, CALCR and BGLAP on BMD (p<0.01) but only minor fraction of susceptibility can be explained by these polymorphisms (adjusted  R 2,0.238). Environmental factors, firstly ARA intake, seems to have  stronger influence on BMD and bone fractures occurrence than  genetic predisposition.Conclusion. ARA administration is an essential way to prevent and treat steroid osteoporosis in patients with IPF, including individuals with  genotypes associated with increased risk of osteoporosis progression.Genetic analysis is recommended to reveal subjects with increased risk of osteoporosis.",2011

Cytokine gene polymorphisms, determining the response to infection, may play an important role in multifactorial etiology of this frequent childhood disease. The  objective of this study was to investigate the role of specific cytokines gene polymorphisms in OM prone children, as well as significance of association of cytokine gene polymorphisms and environmental risk factors (frequent respiratory infections, passive smoke exposure, day care attendance and breast feeding practice) in children with recurrent episodes of otitis media. A total of 132 (OM prone and controls), both sex children were enrolled in the study. Single nucleotide polymorphism of IL2, IL6, IL10 and TNFÎ± genes (TaqMan predesigned Genotyping SNP assay) and presence of environmental risk factors, were studied for  all children. Results: Explicit bimodal distribution of OM susceptibility appearance, indicate that early childhood and preschool age plays important role in development of OM prone status. Out of 5 examined gene polymorphisms involved in regulation of inflammatory response, significant contribution to genetic predisposition to OM in Montenegro children was found for IL10  1082 (GâA) gene.

Also it is suggested that oxidative stress contribute to the development of various diseases including coronary artery disease (CAD). Inactivation of reactive oxygen species is performed by antioxidative enzymes. In this study we genotyped  5 SNPs in 4 genes for antioxidative enzymes (CAT, SOD2, PON1, GPX1) in four groups: patients with CAD (n,172), long livers   above 90 years (n,210), people with early death (before 55 years) from cardiovascular diseases (n,94) and Russian population as control group (n,412). In particular, polymorphism in GPX1 Pro198Leu (rs  1050450) has shown differences between the groups. The genotype distribution in control group was in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. We have found significant higher allele T frequency in men with CAD    34.84%  (Ï 2,5.228, p,0.022; OR,1.46) and in men with early death from cardiovascular diseases    38.16% (Ï2,6.461, p,0.011; OR,1.69)  compared with control men   26.8%.

The pathogenesis of AAA is multifactorial with a strong genetic component. Previous studies show that polymorphisms in genes involved in homocysteine metabolism may contribute to risk for  AAA developing. However up to now there are very few appropriately powered association studies considered the role of specific genetic variants.We determined relationship between three functional polymorphisms in paraoxonase 1 (PON1) gene:  108C>T (rs705379), L55M (162T>A; rs854560), Q192R (575A>G, rs662) and AAA occurrence in Poland. PON1 is an antioxidant enzyme, which detoxify homocysteine thiolactone in vascular vessels. The study was conducted in groups of 525 AAA cases, 425 controls and in random population sample of  220 subjects. Polymorphisms were studied by PCR RFLP method. Haploview was used for haplotype analysis.Coding region polymorphisms L55M and Q192R were in strong linkage disequilibrium (Dâ,0,76), which results in relatively low frequency of 55M 192R haplotype in Polish population (0,023). The frequency of this rare haplotype in patients (0,008) was significantly lower as compared to that in controls (0,018, p,0,04). The 5,3 fold higher risk of AAA was noted in homozygotes of 55L 192R haplotype (subjects with  108CT/55LL/192RR genotype; p,0,003). The distribution of 55 192 haplotypes in Polish cohort of AAA patients corresponds to that observed by Giusti et all (2008) in Italian population.In conclusion, our results confirm observations that functional variants of PON1 gene influence AAA risk.

It is caused by selective degradation of dopaminergic neurons in substantia nigra pars compacta. Etiology of Parkinson disease can be explained by number of factors, including effect of nuclear genes  and mitochondrial DNA variation. The first evidence that mitochondrial polymorphisms could be implicated in etiology of PD came from study of T4366C associated with increased risk of Parkinson disease in Europe. Abnormality of function of mitochondrial electron transfer chain has been reported in many PD cases. Beside haplogroup determining SNPs, may mitochondrial haplotypes and haplogroups share polymorphisms modulating ,,coupling efficiencyâ of mitochondrion with protective or pathological effect in PD expression.

Mutations in the Leucine Reach Repeat Kinase 2 (LRRK2) gene  are the most frequent cause of familial Parkinsonâs disease (PD). Although the precise physiological and pathological role of LRRK2 is unclear, direct link between mutant LRRK2 and apoptosis has been suggested. Earlier we found the increased FAS mRNA level in patients  with LRRK2 associated PD compared to controls (persons without neurological disorders). The aim of our present work was to examine the same patients with LRRK2 associated PD over the three year period and evaluate FAS mRNA level in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) after 1h, 24h, 48h of incubation (37Â°C, 5% CO2). FAS mRNA levels were estimated in PBL of four patients with LRRK2 associated PD (n,3 G2019S; n,1 V1613A, mean age 65Â±10) and of nine controls (mean age 61Â±7). At 1h, 24h, 48h PBLs were harvested, total mRNA extracted and cDNA synthesized. FAS mRNA levels were estimated by  means of quantitative real time PCR with TagMan probes. The level of G protein (GNB2L1) mRNA was used as internal control. At 24h mRNA levels were slightly increased compared to 1h in both groups but this difference was not statistically significant. FAS mRNA level was higher in patients with LRRK2 associated PD compared to controls at 1h (p<0.03) and at 24h (p<0.05). Our results suggest LRRK2 mutations may lead to the activation of FAS expression in PBL of patients with LRRK2 associated PD and this induction in stable over time.",2011

Exon 7 rearrangements in PINK1 gene were studied  in a mixed group of 214 patients with familial and early onset sporadic PD. Rearrangements in exons 4 6 of the SNCA gene were studied in 61 patients with autosomal dominant PD. All the patients were from Russia. The frequency of EOPD and LOPD patients carrying these mutations in PARK2 gene was 12.4 and 3.8%, respectively. The most frequent rearrangements were detected in exons 3 and 4. The odds ratio for EOPD in individuals carrying PARK2 gene exon deletions and duplications was 3.54 (0.95% CI, 1.465 8.569; P , 0.006). We also found a correlation between exon rearrangements in PARK2  gene and some clinical features of PD. Exon 7 deletion in PINK1 gene was found in 5 patients. The analysis of the SNCA gene revealed no increase in the exon dosage. The results of our study let us conclude that exon rearrangements in PARK2 gene have a significant role in the pathogenesis of sporadic PD in patients from Russia. The role of exon deletions in PINK1 gene remains to be elucidated and multiplications of the SNCA gene play insignificant part in the pathogenesis of autosomal dominant PD in Russia.",2011

Metabolic and hormonal measurements, oral glucose tolerance tests (oGTT) and a specialised hirsutism score (modified Ferriman Gallwey method) were determined.Genotype frequencies of the F13A1 SNP did not deviate from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and were equivalent in PCOS and controls. In the dominant genotype model, in all PCOS patients and especially in  overweight/obese PCOS patients (BMI â¥ 25), the G allele of F13A1 was associated with significantly higher levels of free testosterone and DHEAS as well as decreased levels of SHBG in the overweight/obese group, which was only seen as a trend in all patients. The G allele was additionally associated with insulin metabolism in lean PCOS patients (BMI < 25) since the AUC of insulin was significantly lower compared to the A allele.We demonstrate an association of F13A1 gene variants with androgen levels in PCOS patients with increased BMI as well as metabolic parameters in lean patients.

However, a significant subset of patients does not respond for reasons that are unknown, and there is currently no means of identifying these patients. Objective: We aimed to identify genetic factors predicting anti TNF treatment outcome in patient with RA using a genome wide association approach. m ethods: We selected RA patients treated with anti TNF agents from  the Dutch Rheumatoid Arthritis Monitoring (DREAM) registry. Disease  activity scores (DAS28) at baseline and after 14 weeks was available of 508 patients. Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) markers were genotyped using the Illumina HumanHap550 Duo BeadChip  or the Human660W Quad. Association analysis using the relative DAS28 change as outcome was performed using the whole genome association analysis toolset PLINK.Results: 511.499 SNPs and 502 patients passed quality control. 75  SNPs showed suggestive association (uncorrected p value<10  4) with  relative DAS change. Candidate genes, among the top ten associated  SNPs, that can be linked to anti TNF or RA are ASPH (p,1.36*10 6), a  gene  involved in calcium homeostasis and regulated by STAT4 , one of the confirmed risk factors for RA and the genes TIAM1 (p,2.79*10 6)  and UBE2E2 (p,1.21*10 5), both play a role in cell death, one of the  working mechanisms of anti TNF therapy. c onclusions: The identified genes may serve as new biomarkers  predicting anti TNF response.

Genotyping arrays used for genome wide association (GWA) studies, which are designed to capture most of the common variation in the human genome, may not  be adequate for pharmacogenomics studies. To address this, Illumina has designed the absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) Core Panel, a fixed content panel of 184 pharmacogenomic related markers in 34 genes. Because these variants are rare and difficult to assay, there is a lack of reference data in the literature or reference populations such as the International HapMap Project. There is also little data on how well the ADME Core Panel performs.As a pilot study, we genotyped 320 European Americans prescribed 5 or more unique drugs from BioVU, a de identified clinical population from  Vanderbilt University, to see if certain pharmacogenomic variants may be unequally distributed in patients who received many medications. We also genotyped HapMap samples as well. We abstracted allele frequencies from public repositories as well as the literature for markers targeted by ADME.

We hypothesized that polymorphisms in this gene may affect susceptibility to Autoimmune Addison`s disease and Type 1 Diabetes. The aim of this study was to analyse the associations of six NLRP1 SNPs (Single  Nucleotide Polymorphisms) with AAD and T1D within a Polish cohort. The study comprised 101 AAD, 221 T1D patients and 254 healthy control individuals. Genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP and PCR SSCP methods. The minor allele of the coding SNP rs12150220 appeared significantly more frequently in AAD compared to healthy individuals (OR,1.5, 95% CI:  1.08 2.08, p,0.015). The distribution of genotypes also demonstrated significant differences. The frequency of high risk genotype AA of rs12150220 SNP was significantly increased among AAD subjects vs. controls (P,0.006) yielding an OR of 2.96 (95%CI 1.34 6.55).

AÎ² is highly correlated with hippocampal atrophy, a biomarker for early stages of late onset Alzheimerâs disease (AD). The aim of this study was to find genetic variants associated with plasma AÎ² levels. The study included 126 nondemented hypertensive subjects 55 to 75  years old from the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study. Multipoint variance component linkage analysis was performed for non fasting plasma AÎ² levels (AÎ²40, AÎ²42, and truncated forms AÎ²n40 and AÎ²n42) in MERLIN. Regions with at least suggestive evidence of linkage were followed up with association analysis using FASTA approximation to linear mixed model in GenABEL. All analyses were adjusted for age and sex. Two regions showed LOD scores >1.9, both for AÎ²40: 1q32.3 1q42.13 (LOD , 2.07 at 1q41) and 11q14 11q21 (LOD,2.97 at 11q14.3). At 1q42.13, strongest association was observed at a variant  flanking the PSEN2 gene (p value 2.5x10  4). Suggestive association  was also observed at 11q14.3 (p value,4.8x10 3) at a variant near  the Melatonin Receptor 1B (MTNR1B) gene.

Serotonin (5HT) plays roles as a neurotransmitter and a  neuromodulator with functions in brain and peripheral tissues. Serotonin receptor subtypes are related to depression and also have been shown to be present in certain cells of the immune system. Psoriasis is a hyperprolifrative inflammatory disease. The aim of this  study is evaluation of 5HT3a gene expression in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) of psoriatic patients in comparison with normal individuals By Real time PCR.The PBMC was separated from whole blood by Ficoll hypaque. The total cellular RNA was extracted and the cDNA was synthesized. This process was followed by real time PCR using primer pairs specific for 5HT(3a) serotonin receptor mRNA and beta actin as internal control. Results reveal that relative expression of 5HT(3a) has significant decrease in psoriasis. Considering these results the present study has  shown that there is a change in serotonin receptor gene expression in PBMC of psoriatic patients in comparison with healthy individuals. In conclusion, 5HT3a significant decrease may be an important role of this receptor in pathogenesis of psoriasis.Complex traits and polygenic disorders316",2011

Estivill","Centre for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barcelona, Spain","Many recent publications have shown that DNA enrichment in  combination with high throughput sequencing can be successfully applied for the identification of causative genetic variants underlying both rare and common disorders. Psoriasis is a hyperproliferative inflammatory disease that presents several clinical forms and  affects the skin, scalp, nails and joints. It is a life long disease with a prevalence of 2 3% in the general population. The importance of the genetic factors for the susceptibility to psoriasis is supported by the high heritability of the disease, and also by several genome wide linkage analyses and association studies that have identified multiple loci associated to the susceptibility for psoriasis. However, not all the genetic variants of these regions have been analysed with the same detail.Therefore, we have re sequenced six psoriasis candidate genomic  regions on ten unrelated patients. The regions of interest were captured with the SureSelect (Agilent) target enrichment technology and sequenced using the Illumina GAII platform. The resulting reads were aligned to the reference sequence. After variant calling, we applied a combination of filters based on frequency and function to discard any variation that is not linked to the disease, and to define a set of candidate protein altering variants to be associated to psoriasis. This analysis has allowed us to detect more than 300 hundred SNPs and InDels (both novel and known) in 78 different genes. The potential involvement of these variants in psoriasis is currently being evaluated through association studies in additional patients.",2011

If this were the case, alterations of brain structure should also be present in healthy individuals carrying genetic risk factors for such disorders.

Structural MRI brain images are available from scans at 1.5 or 3 Tesla. FSL FIRST is used to assess volumes of specific brain structures. Genotyping of several candidate genes and genome wide genotyping (Affymetrix 6.0, n,1000) was performed.Hypothesis driven testing of candidates for neuropsychiatric disorders lead (among others) to the following findings: By gene wide (set  based) testing of the Alzheimerâs disease (AD) gene SORL1 we found a significant association with hippocampus volume, one of the first structure affected by AD, in a discovery sample of 446 BIG participants (p,0.0432) and replication in 490 additional subjects (p,0.0093).Preliminary GWAS of amygdala volume in 600 samples resulted in association findings for several suspected psychiatric risk genes, such as CDH13, featuring among the GWAS top findings for ADHD, addiction and schizophrenia.In conclusion, risk factors for neuropsychiatric disorders indeed affect brain structure in healthy individuals suggesting that altered brain structure is cause rather  than consequence of disease. In addition, healthy brain structure seems a powerful intermediate phenotype for gene discovery in neuropsychiatric disorders.",2011

In view of the mounting evidence on the  genetic overlap in the psychiatric spectrum, we investigated this gene in a spectrum of patients afflicted with schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder and major affective disorder. We found that a unique mutation at nucleotide  220 from the transcription start site, located at a conserved genomic block in the promoter region of the gene, co occurs with the spectrum of psychoses (p<0.005). This mutation reverts the human promoter sequence to the ancestral types observed in chimpanzee, mouse, and several other species, implying that the genomic block harboring nucleotide  220 may be involved in the  evolution of human specific higher order functions of the brain (e.g. language, conceptual thinking, and judgment), that are ubiquitously impaired in psychoses.

Approximately 70% of patients with the familial form of PAH have a mutation in the gene encoding bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR II). However, there  is variable phenotypic expression of PAH among carriers of mutated BMPR II gene. Likely related to a second hit caused by environmental and/or genetic modifiers. Studies have implicated serotonin, the serotonin transporter, endothelin, nitric oxide sintase, and others.Vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, along with prolonged overexpression of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin (ET 1) or serotonin (5 HT), not only affect vascular tone but also promote vascular remodelling. All of them have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. NO is an endothelial derived relaxing factor that is synthesized from L arginine by nitric oxide synthase. NOS2 is the major source of NO production and polymorphisms in the NOS2 gene promoter are thought to regulate its transcription activity.The mitogenic and co mitogenic effects of 5 HT require internalization through the serotonin transporter 5 HTT (SERT).The aim of this work was to investigate the association between polymorphisms in the genes ET 1, NOS2, SERT and BMPR II (by PCR Sequencing) and the susceptibility to PAH.We found 15% of sequence variations in the BMPR II gene in the HAP patients.

Here we report an allele of a copy number variant (CNV) which is  protective against RA, with an odds ratio of 2.3.This CNV involves part of a large ancient tandem duplication, located within an RA susceptibility region. We assessed copy number in a Swedish RA cohort (cases , 2403, control , 1269), and revealed that a 129 kb deletion within this region occurs at a significantly higher frequency in control samples compared to cases (p , 0.001, OR , 2.3 (95% CI 1.4   3.9)), indicating a role protective against RA for this variant. This was replicated in a UK cohort (p , 0.036, OR , 1.90 (95% CI 0.93 3.82)).Genes within this tandem duplication are involved in important biological processes including the immune response and embryogenesis. Altered expression of these genes has also been implicated in the progression of diseases such as cancer and Alzheimerâs Disease.

Association studies in various populations have reported a number of genetic variations affecting the individual susceptibility to RA. The strongest association has been reported from genes within the HLA region,  particularly the HLA DRB1 gene.The rs2476601 SNP of PTPN22 (protein tyrosine phosphatase nonreceptor 22) gene can be named as the second polymorphism that has been repeatedly reported to be associated with RA. Allelic frequency of 14   15% has been reported for A allele (the risk causing allele) in this SNP in Caucasian population. To investigate the possible association of this SNP with RA in Iranian population, we designed a family based (parents child trios) and a population based case control association studies. In total 872 blood samples were collected from 405 confirmed RA patients and 467 healthy controls. 115 trios were included in the total samples. DNA was extracted and genotyping was performed by PCR RFLP method using RsaI restriction enzyme. All samples were genotyped as homozygous GG. Genotyping was repeated for 30% of samples by using XcmI enzyme and for 10% of samples by sequencing. Again all samples showed homozygous GG genotype.This study strongly suggest that there is no A allele in the gene pool of Iranian population. Therefore it does not play a role in susceptibility to RA and other autoimmune disorders in Iranian population.",2011

Gene expression studies have shown that gene regulatory elements might be located within the risk interval.The knock out mice lacking the CAD locus interval in chromosome 4 shows that this region is critically required for the normal cardiac expression of two neighbouring cyclin dependent kinase inhibiting genes, Cdkn2a/b.It is known that CDKN2A/B control cell proliferation by preventing entry to the S phase of the cell cycle. As the development of human  atherosclerotic lesions is characterised by an increase in the rate of replication and death of all mitotic cells in response to injury, it is conceivable that the decreased expression of CDKN2A/B may be associated with altered cell replication, and the start and progression of atherosclerosis.We investigated the influence of the 9p21.3 variant rs1333040 on CDKN2A/B expression in 30 human coronary atherosclerotic plaques obtained by means of coronary atherectomy from patients with ischemic heart disease.

Schizophrenia is a severe chronic mental disorder that affects most  of the higher brain functions. Its prevalence is estimated on about 1% worldwide. The classical symptoms also occur in several other psychiatric disorders, which makes difficult the exact diagnostics. The etiology of schizophrenia remains to be elucidated. It is thought to be  a result of a complex interaction between genetic and environmental factors. Schizophrenia is a serious social and economic burden to healthcare systems. Currently, there is no etiological treatment. Until now there isnât any proven molecular marker as an objective diagnostic parameter for schizophrenia.Materials and methods: We have analyzed serum samples from schizophrenic patients at different phases of the disease   before and after treatment, comparing them to a cohort of normal sera. We applied several methods for protein alterationsâ screening: DSC (Differential  scanning calorimetry), protein profiling methods: 2D SDS PAGE, HPLC techniques. The differences in the profiles were analyzed by mass spectrometric techniques.Results: Initially we analyzed sera samples with DSC method to detect distinguishing serum profiles. We observed significant differences in the fractions of the more abundant serum proteins  albumin and immunoglobulin. We distinguished different protein profiles: before and after treatment of the patients; according to the medication. We also found considerable concordance between therapy response and protein profiles   normalization in case of remission and marked alterations in non responders. Because of these differences we proceeded with analyzing serum proteins by more sensitive and precise methods to find a potential marker for drug therapy and  disease progression.",2011

The wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical variability in SCZ suggests a complex genetic etiology, which is consistent with the numerous loci thus far identified by family linkage, copy number variation (CNV)  and association studies. While SCZ heritability may be as high as ~80% the genes responsible for much of this heritability remain to be identified. Using high throughput sequencing technologies, we sequenced the exome of 14 patients with schizophrenia and their parents. Each proband had a standardized SCZ diagnostic and every parent was carefully excluded of any psychiatric disorder. A list of high quality variant was validated using traditional Sanger sequencing. We identified 14 DNMs in 8 probands, which is significantly more than expected considering the previously reported DNM rate. Beside, 4 of  the 14 identified DNMs are nonsense mutation, suggesting a causal role for those variants. Our study supports the notion that DNMs play a major role in sporadic SCZ while providing a list of genes possibly involved in disease pathogenesis.

While only a very small number of loci yield genome wide significance for association, the vast majority of the genetic contribution to disease susceptibility remains uncovered. It is likely to be overrepresented in non significant top SNPs of large scale GWAS results. In order to uncover potential interesting candidates, we selected the top 6,000 SNPs with significance threshold at p<0.001 from the international PGC meta analysis consisting of some 9,000 cases and 12,000 controls and examined their possible involvement in schizophrenia  using gene expression data from whole blood.

To analyze whether this effect is mediated by the iron regulator hepcidin, we measured serum hepcidin levels in 1657 genotyped individuals from an Italian  cohort, the Val Borbera (VB) population. Hepcidin levels showed age and sex dependent variations that correlated with ferritin but not with serum iron or transferrin saturation. We replicated the observation that common variants of the HFE (rs1800562, C282Y) and TMPRSS6  (rs855791,V736A) genes are associated with serum iron and transferrin saturation, but no association was found with hepcidin. Both variants showed a modest effect on the hepcidin/ferritin ratio, and the association was enhanced once iron deficient and inflammation positive samples were excluded from the analysis. Interestingly, in such a subset of samples, HFE C282Y was associated to ferritin at genome wide significance and the association was further enhanced after adjusting for hepcidin levels. Our results suggest that the main effect of HFE C282Y variant is to increase cell iron uptake through  increased transferrin saturation. The effect is in part counterbalanced by impaired hepcidin levels which favor cell iron release, especially from macrophages, in this way likely reducing, serum ferritin levels. Finally we show that the effect of HFE and TMPRSS6 variants on  erythroid traits is mainly mediated by variations of iron parameters, but  not by variations of hepcidin.",2011

The major psychotic illnesses   schizophrenia and bipolar disorder,  are among the most common debilitating mental conditions that constitute some of the leading causes of disability and pose significant economic burden to society. Although genetic factors make substantial contributions to their etiology, the identification of specific susceptibility  genes for both disorders has not been straightforward. In recent years new molecular genetic findings have implicated risk factors for these disorders, thus allowing the possibility of a genetic relationship between them to be directly explored. Findings from genome wide association studies suggest a partial overlap in the genes that contribute to the susceptibility to schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. To test this statement we have compared our results from genome wide association studies on bipolar disorder and schizophrenia conducted in 188 BAD patients, 188 schizophrenia subjects and 376  healthy Bulgarians. The analysis of top 100 polymorphisms revealed no genetic overlap between two conditions in our population. The strongest finding in bipolar disorder was not among the top findings after GWAS on schizophrenia. An SNP which revealed the most significant association with schizophrenia did not show any association with bipolar disease. Interestingly, the genome wide scan on schizophrenia has detected a variant in a gene, which has already been reported as the strongest finding in previous genome wide association scan on bipolar disorder. Although no genetic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar disease has been detected in Bulgarian population, this finding supports the hypothesis that common genetic factors may be involved in the etiology of both conditions.Complex traits and polygenic disorders321",2011

Prednisolone improved the ataxia and was associated with cessation of seizures  and exercise induced dystonia. At the time, no diagnosis could be made. Over the last years, the clinical spectrum of SLC2A1 (GLUT1) mutations has been expanding. Apart from the classical phenotype which consists of drug resistant seizures, mild to severe developmental delay, and complex movement disorders, such as ataxia and dystonia several non classical presentations have been described as well. Recently, a child with episodes of hemiplegia was found to have a mutation in the SLC2A1  gene (Rotstein, Neurology  2009). The combination of mental retardation, atypical absences,  movement disorders with exercise induced dystonia and alternating hemiplegia in this patient directed us to the possibility of an SLC2A1 mutation. Mutation analysis of all 10 exons of the SLC2A1 gene  revealed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in exon 2. The parents did not carry the mutation, indicating that Gly18Arg is a de novo mutation. False paternity was excluded by genetic, multimarker analysis. Screening of 150 subjects from the general Dutch population was performed by sequence analysis of exon 2 and was negative. The Gly18Arg mutation is located in the first transmembrane segment of GLUT1 and is likely to cause disruption of the glucose transport across the aqueous central channel. The Gly18Arg mutation is therefore likely to be pathogenic. This patient presented with symptoms that all have been described in patients with GLUT1 deficiency before, but  to the best of our knowledge the combination of a moderate learning disability, epilepsy, ataxia, exercise induced dystonia , and alternating  hemiplegia has not been associated with SLC2A1  mutations before.

Three  polymorphisms have been described in relationship with differences in bitter taste perception of phenyl thiocarbamide (PTC). It was hypothesized that taster status is related to smoking, as individuals who perceive PTC as bitter may find the taste of cigarettes aversive,  and thus, present a reduced risk to become smokers and nicotine dependent, as compared to non tasters.In 226 middle aged (median age: 41 years) Caucasians (53.53 % males, 46.47 % females), we have followed the relationship between the bitter tasting phenotype and genotype (rs713598), respectively, and tobacco dependence as assessed by the NDSS (Nicotine Dependence Syndrome Score), HSI (Heaviness of Smoking Index) and FagerstrÃ¶m Test for Nicotine Dependence.As compared to a group of non smokers (n , 112), the percentage of  smokers who could taste PTC was lower (57.96 %), and the inability to taste associated with an increased risk for smoking (chi 2 , 3.56, p <  0.05). In smokers, overall scores in the three systems of dependency presented significant association with the TAS2R38 polymorphism  (p < 0.01); out of the various traits of tobacco dependence (drive, priority, tolerance, continuity, stereotypy), drive presented a significant correlation with the ability to taste PTC ( t , 2.46, 95%CI: 0.14 1.17, p , 0.01).In conclusion, PTC non tasters may become more frequently smokers not avoiding the unpleasant taste of cigarettes; however, in those who become smokers, a preference for bitter taste may contribute to the development of dependency.",2011

 Analysis of association of GR gene haplotype and suicidal behavior in population from Bashkortostan (Russia),P09.224,"A. Zainullina , D. Zakirov, A. Ishmukhametova, E. Khusnutdinova","Institute of Biochemistry and Genetics, Ufa Scientific Center of Russian  Academy of Sciences, Ufa, Russian Federation","Suicidal behaviour (SB) is a complex trait for which the underlying  pathophysiology has yet to be fully explained. Hyperactivity of the hypothalamic pituitary adrenal axis, leading to increased cortisol levels, has been suggested to play a role in the development of SB. The effects of cortisol, the most important glucocorticoid (GC) in humans  are mainly mediated by the GC receptor (GR). Several polymorphisms in the GR gene that alter the GC sensitivity are known. The aim of this study was to study the role of these GR polymorphisms in SB. Three SNPs (9beta, BclI and N363S) in the GR gene were genotyped and haplotypes were constructed. We investigated a total sample of 636 subjects. Cases were 288 persons   hospitalized in the Clinical Republic Hospital (Ufa, Russia) after suicide attempt. Suicide attempts were classified as violent   hanging (4.2%), jumping from a high place or under a vehicle (6.3%), cutting (8.5%), or nonviolent   drug  overdose (81%). Forty seven patients (31.3%) admitted to previous suicide attempts. The most common primary diagnoses in the sample were: personality disorders (29.3%), depressive disorders (17.3%), substance dependence (16%), schizophrenia spectrum disorders (14.7%). Other diagnoses were: bipolar affective disorder (2%); posttraumatic stress disorder (1.33%). The control group consisted of 348 volunteers   without a personal or familial (first degree) history Complex traits and polygenic disorders322 of neuropsychiatric disorders and SB. The AGA haplotype (P,0.006,  OR,1.50) was associated with increased risk of SB. This seems to result from the presence of BclI, and not from the 9beta and N363S polymorphisms.",2011

Disturbances of estrogen  metabolism and decreased androgen levels were found in SLE, however the influence of hormone receptor genetic polymorphisms on the disease progress are still not clarified. m ethods: A total of 109 women with SLE and 47 female controls  were genotyped for ERÎ± polymorphisms PvuII T/C and XbaI A/G by  RFLP analysis. The absence of PvuII and XbaI restriction sites were indicated by âPâ and âXâ and presence by âpâ and âxâ, respectively. The CAG repeat length in AR was also investigated by fluorescence based fragment analysis on an automatic DNA sequencer. Shorter allele (SA), longer allele (LA) and biallelic mean (BM) were determined. SLE disease activity index (SLEDAI) and SLICC/ACR damage index were  also calculated and relationships with the genetic parameters were investigated.Results: No differences were found between the ERÎ± alleles  distribution in patients and controls. The CAG repeat lengths in the SA, LA and BM were also similar. The (CAG)n number of LA but not SA was inversely related to SLICC index (r, 0.207, p,0.031). In patients with PPXX genotype SLEDAI index was significantly lower than in PpXx patients (p,0.016) but not different in comparison to patients with ppxx (p>0.05). c onclusions: Our preliminary results showed that AR and ERÎ±  polymorphisms are not crucial for the development of SLE but probably  modulate the activity of the disease and chronic damages in patients.The study was financially supported by research grant 26/2010, MU   Sofi",2011

 t hrombosis in young men homozygous for Leiden mutation,J09.06,M. M. Litvinova,First Moscow State I,"M. Sechenov Medical University, Moscow, Russian  Federation. Hereditary thrombophilia is one of the most important medical and  social problems. It is characterized by activation of coagulation system and lead to the propensity to develop thrombosis. It is known that factor V Leiden is one of the main members of coagulation pathway. Factor V Leiden thrombophilia is characterized by a poor anticoagulant  response to activated protein C and an increased risk for venous thromboembolism. Mutation G1691A (rs6025) of F5 gene also called  as Leiden mutation is responsible for such condition. In European countries allele 1691A frequency is around 2%. Homozygous genotype for Leiden mutation is very rear.We report three cases of thrombosis in young male patients homozygous for Leiden mutation. Beside Leiden mutation in F5 all three patients were genotyped for SNPs in F2 (G20210A or rs1799963), MTHFR (C677T or rs1801133 and A1298C or rs1801131), MTRR (A66G or  rs1801394), and MTR (A2756G or rs1805087). Data on patients is shown in the table 1.It is important to mention that in all three cases additional exogenous factors as smoking and long hiking together with exposure to cold were presented. Thus thrombosis can occur in very young patients with combination of genetic risk factors of thrombophilia. It is important to detect such predisposition as early as possible to be able to prevent thrombotic complications.

Background: Currently little is known from the literature about a relationship between severe asthma (SA) in children and cystic fibrosis (CF). We hypothesized that children with severe asthma may carry a Â«mildÂ» and/or a Â«severeÂ» mutations of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator gene. Objective: To detect sixteen CFTR gene  mutations most common to Russian populations in children with severe asthma. Patients and methods: SA group included 59 children aged 4   17 years old (43 boys and 16 girls) with severe asthma. CF group included 29 children aged 5   16 years old with a primary diagnosis of CF confirmed by CFTR genotyping (15 boys and 14 girls). Genotyping of CFTR gene was confirmed by experts Laboratory Ottâs Institute of Obstetrics & Gynecology. We used two kits developed by Center for Molecular Genetics (Moscow): âCF   5â kit (G542X, W1282X, N1303K, 3849+10kbC>T, R334W) and âCF   11â kit (del21 kb, F508del, I507del,  1677delTA, 2143delT, 2184insA, 394delTT, 3821delT, L138ins, 604insA, 3944delTG).

 What a role vitamin D receptor and its gene polymorphism can play in the development of axial myopia in children?,J09.08,"R. Bannour, A. N. Voytovich, V. V. Brzhevskii, V. I. Larionova",St,"Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation. The axial myopia in children caused by the eyeball overgrowth  in the anteroposterior direction is an actual problem of pediatric ophthalmology today. The aim of this study was to investigate a probable association of TaqI polymorphism of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene with the development and severity of axial myopia in children to  identify its possible role and the role of its protein product in the eye tissues development. We examined 84 children (168 eyes) aged 4 to 17 yo with emmetropia and axial myopia of various degree. The results of echo biometric evaluation of the axial length, anterior chamber depth (ACD), lens thickness, and vitreous chamber depth of each eye were compared according to the TaqI genotypes polymorphism detected by PCR RFLP method. We have found a relationship between the TaqI polymorphism of the VDR gene and the size of the ACD that correlated with the axial length of the eyeball. ACD for tt genotype carriers was  3.73 ÃÂ± 0.04 mm, and ACD for b/T allele carriers was 3.44 ÃÂ± 0.05 mm, (p < 0,001). TaqI polymorphism affects the vitamin D binding domain of the receptor. Therefore we hypothesize that VDR gene polymorphism in combination with external factors such as vitamin D and/or ultraviolet deficiency might be a cause of axial myopia in children. Undoubtedly, further studies addressed to the identification of a role of vitamin D receptor and its gene, as well as an implication of vitamin D and ultraviolet exposures, in the development of axial myopia in children are required.",2011

The role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene polymorphism in various renal disorders has been investigated. We have evaluated the frequency of ACE polymorphisms and their impact on the clinical course of INS in  children in a romanian county hospital.This study comprised 20 pediatric patients with nephrotic syndrome, 11 males (55%) and 9 females (45%). Forty children without previous renal diseases and negative proteinuria were enrolled as a control group (50% males and 50% females). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was performed on genomic DNA isolated from peripheric blood leucocytes. The distribution of ACE DD, ID, and II genotypes in NS patients were 20; 70 and 10%, respectively; the corresponding numbers for the  control group were 47,5; 42,5 and 10%, respectively. Angiotensin converting enzyme genotypes were no significantly different between patients and control groups (p>0.05).The study groups consisted of 14 (70%) with steroid sensitive nephrotic syndrome (SNSS) and 6 (30%) with steroid resistant nephrotic syndrome (SRNS).

Vlagtwedde/Vlaardingen is a general population based cohort with a  follow up of 25 years (1965 90) with medical surveys every 3 years. We genotyped four ADAM33 SNPs (S_1, S_2, T_2, Q_1) in 1,390 subjects participating in the last survey. We performed Cox regression  to estimate the risk of the SNPs in relation to mortality, with adjustment for gender, age, FEV 1, height, place of residence and packyears of  smoking. In addition, stratified analyses according to gender and  smoking habits were performed.Results: At December 31 st, 2008, 284 (20.4%) of the included subjects  had died (107 due to CVD and 20 due to COPD). Homozygous mutants for SNP T_2 had an increased risk of total and CVD mortality compared to wild types [HR,3.6 (95% CI 2.0  6.7) and 3.4 (1.2 9.5) respectively]. Individuals homozygous for the minor allele of S_1, S_2,  T_2 or Q_1 had a significantly increased risk of COPD mortality.

Basu2","1Indian Statistical Institute, Kolkata, India, 2National Institute of Biomedical  Genomics, Kalyani, India","Whereas the vast majority of DNA sequence level variation evolves neutrally and is maintained by a balance between the mutation process and random drift, some parts of the human genome have been subjected to natural selection. Admixed populations are unique in that they represent the sudden confluence of geographically diverged  genomes with novel environmental challenges. Thus, genomes from each ancestral population were presented with new challenges. This kind of selection pressure may be quite different from that faced by stationary populations, in which the local environmental changes may occur gradually, allowing for rare advantageous alleles to increase in frequency. Admixed populations therefore offer special opportunities for studying recent selection.In this study, we propose a method for estimating the âageâ of an admixed population. Using Kimuraâs (1955) solution of a process of  random genetic drift, we developed a novel method of determining the time of a past admixture event based on genetic data comprising of both correlated and independent markers. An extension of the work has been identification of markers exposed to natural selection followed by proposition of a revised time estimator for the admixture event.Using simulated datasets generated under different assumptions, we have shown that the estimators we propose are robust to fluctuations in the time of the admixture event, proportion of mixing and the genetic divergence between the ancestral populations. However increase in population size and number of markers attributed to a remarkable improvement in the efficiency of the estimators, even under the scenario of natural selection.",2011

We further analyzed one of those SNPs in in our  DNA bank of 2235 people specific for Turkish Population, There were significant associations with this genotype and hypertension, physical activity in the whole group. Gender specific analyses showed that there was an association with ApoA1 levels and physical activity after exclusion of drug usage in women. In men, however, hypertension, physical activity as well as fasting glucose levels, after exclusion of drug usage, were found to be associated.These is the first study to show that ApoD might play a role in cardiovascular and metabolic event. ApoD protein analyses can be performed and investigated, if this protein can be specified as a biomarker.",2011
 Autosomal recessive disorders in the s outh m editerranean Region: An overview from North Africa,P10.08,"O. MHAMDI1, W. KELMEMI1, M. KHARRAT1, R. MRAD1,2, H. CHAABOUNI  BOUHAMED1,2",1Department of Human Genetics,"University Tunis El Manar, Faculty of  Medicine, Tunis, Tunisia, 2Department of congenital and Hereditary diseases;  Charles Nicolle hospital, Tunis, Tunisia. Hereditary diseases and congenital abnormalities have been reported  to affect 2   5 % of all live births. Actual data suggest that genetics disorders are common also in countries of the North Africa. This population  is made of a mosaic of communities. This heterogeneity  with the same social and economic structure has contributed to  increase the rate of endogamy and consanguineous unions. These practices lead to the emergence of autosomal recessive.Aim: The aim of this study was to report the genetics spectrum of autosomal recessive disorders and analysed their prevalence in North Africa. m ethods: An exhaustive electronic and library research of the recent  publications was carried on the biomedical databases Pubmed and  OMIM using Keywords âautosomal recessive diseasesâ, âNorth African patientsâ, âFounder effectâ. Results: The distribution of the autosomal recessive disorders was not uniform and some traits are common. Some examples are: Familial Mediterranean Fever, Ãthalassemias, cystic fibrosis. The relative homogeneity of populations from North Africa has often been underlined, and several founder mutations have already been suggested. A number of rare diseases described from North Africa have now been few recognised in other countries; this result suggests that the private syndrome does exist such as Andermann Syndrome,  Hutchinston Gilford syndrome and Anderson disease. For theses reasons, our region will continue to be a source of new informationâs about genetic disorders for the whole world. With the special religious and cultural backgrounds, more work should be given in planning and research ways of prevention and treatment of genetic disorders.",2011

The analysed datasets included frequency data   190 populations and 69,229 individuals   and genotype data   43 populations and 11,181 individuals.Inter population comparisons indicate a significant level of population structure, with a global FST value of 4.3 5.0% for both datasets, thus in  agreement with levels inferred in non forensic studies. This agreement further extends to the pattern of within population diversity, which shows a decrease from sub Saharan African to American populations, in accordance with the recent African origin of modern humans. Actually, the geographic distance to East Africa explains 55% of the decrease in genotype diversity, a pattern that could be explained by a series of founder effects during the expansions out of Africa.Our results show that extensive datasets from forensics can be used to address population geneticsâ questions, and the statistical methods used provide reliable results as they account for the particularities and limitations of those markers.",2011

 Genetic basis of Bombay Blood group,P10.12,"P. Taskar , M. Barath, A. Kanugovi",Dr,"D.Y Patil University, Department of Biotechnology and Bioinformatics, Navi  Mumbai, India. The Bombay Blood phenotype was first discovered in Bombay by  Dr.Y.M Bhende, present in about 0.0004% of the world population and in some populations like Mumbai, the occurrance can be as high as 0.01% of inhabitants. This blood group is identified by reverse grouping. The antigens determined by the human ABO blood group  locus are oligosaccharide molecules constructed by the sequential action of specific glycosyltransferases, the final step being catalyzed by allelic glycosyltransferases encoded by the ABO locus. These enzymes require an oligosaccharide substrate known as the H blood group antigen, constructed by Î± (1,2) fucosyltransferase; GDP L fucose Î²D galactoside 2 Î± L fucosyltransferase, whose expression is determined by H and Secretor (SE) blood group loci known as FUTI and FUT2 genes respectively. Erythrocytes from individuals with rare Bombay and para Bombay blood group phenotypes are deficient in H  determinants, and thus A and B determinants, as a consequence of apparent homozygosity for null alleles at the H locus (h,h) . FUT1 and FUT2 sharing a high degree of sequence homology, are located within a 100 kb region in chromosome 19q13.3 suggesting their common origin. Occurrence of the phenotype among unrelated individuals indicates spontaneous mutations in the gene. A T725G mutation in the coding region of FUT1 and a gene deletion of FUT2 cause classical Indian Bombay phenotype. In para  Bombay blood phenotype (secretor positive), the expression of this variation is due to a missense point mutation at codon 164 in the FUT1 gene. Prior to blood transfusion, people with blood group O should be tested for Bombay phenotype.",2011

The annual incidence of breast cancer in this region is approximately 300 cases. This is the first study investigating the contribution of the cancer susceptibility gene BRCA1 in this population. Patients and Methods: Patients were identified from the Tumor Registry. Inclusion criteria were a) all breast (BC) and/or ovarian cancer (OC) patients diagnosed in the year 2002, b) BC patients diagnosed age â¤50 between 1998 and 2001 and c) all OC patients diagnosed between 1998 and 2001. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and direct sequencing of all exons and exon/intron boundaries was performed.Results: In total 153 patients were analyzed. We identified two deleterious mutations (c.1687C>T; c.4183C>T) in two BC and one OC  patients; both of them non sense mutations leading to a premature stop codon and previously reported in the BIC database. The missense variation c.83T>C was found in one BC/OC patient. We report a novel germline mutation c.5539_5544del6 in exon 24 in a BC patient. This mutation leads to an in frame deletion of two amino acids in the highly conserved BRCT domain and to the best of our knowledge has not been documented before. All of the mutation carriers had a positive family history.Conclusion: The BRCA1 mutation frequency of 3.3% in unselected breast/ovarian cancer patients from South Tyrol is comparable to that of other European populations. To determine if the newly identified mutation is a founder mutation, further analyses are needed.",2011

There is much evidence that ancient Persians believed in the equal contribution of women and men towards producing a child, and its hereditary characteristics.The Greek philosophers believed that manâs water (Semen) contains  all human characteristics, and the female uterus is only responsible for nurturing and development of fetus.After detection of the ovum Malpigy proposed the preformation theory (ovist) which means there is a miniature human inside ovum, that grows after Semen has entered the uterus and grow into a well developed fetus. This hypothesis was later delegated to spermatozoa. These contradictory and inappropriate beliefs were subject to dicussions and dispute; until C.E.Wolf demonstrated that the embryo is a product of the fertilization of ovum by spermatozoa. 800 years prior the sage Ferdowsi explains nicely the equal participation of man and woman in the production and transmission of characters.After the renaissance and especially in recent years tremendous achievements have been made in unraveling biological secrets of reproduction.

Comparative genomics is an intensive and fruitful field of research that  seeks to unravel the main mechanisms underlying the evolution of the different species. Comparisons between the chimpanzee genome and the human genome have already given huge insights to understand adaptive processes that have taken place after the separation of the  two species. In 2005 the first draft genome of a Western chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes verus) was assembled using a whole genome shotgun approach using Sanger technology and an effective coverage of 3.6x was reached. However, the draft nature of the assembly precludes deeper analyses, and still the genome contained gaps in the sequence every 15.7 KbpsWe are planning to upgrade the chimpanzee assembly by integrating 640 finished BAC clones, making 49.000 contig joins, improving N50 contig length from 26 kbps to 39 kbps and finishing chromosome 7  entirely in BAC clones. We have also sequenced the same individual at a much higher coverage (40x) using the Illumina technology with read length of 100 bp to help gap closure. We have performed an extensive study of the new assembled chimpanzee genome and we have compared it with the human genome (NCBI 37, hg19). We will put special emphasis to detect and resolve spurious indels or SNP variants, and to identify improperly represented duplicated regions using read depth and paired end mapping methodologies. Moreover, we will reanalyze some of the main statements in the initial study such as a detail characterization of the main differences that separate humans from chimpanzees including indels and structural variation.We believe that this update will be useful for most of the scientific community working in the genomics field and that by comparing the  new assembled chimpanzee genome with the human genome/s, we will improve our understanding of human specific genomic features.",2011

Common psychiatric and neurological disorders including schizophrenia, Alzheimerâs diseases (AD), and Parkinsonâs disease (PD) are now the subject of intensive genome wide association  studies (GWAS). The aim of this study was to estimate the variability of genetic markers strongly associated with neurological and mental diseases across the multiple Eurasian populations. We selected 55 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) reported in recent GWAS as highly significantly associated with AD, PD, schizophrenia and cognitive performance, and investigated the population variability of these markers in 8 populations representing Eastern Europe, Central Asia, North Asia and Siberia. Considerable between population variability in allele frequencies was found. The average range of risk  allele frequency for 55 SNPs was 24.3%. Population differentiation measured by Fst varied widely across the loci studied (from 0,006 to 0,146). Mean Fst for all 55 SNPs was 0,045. Mean Fst for AD (0,029) proved to be substantially lower than population differentiation for PD (0,044), schizophrenia (0,054) and cognitive performance (0,049). Allele frequencies tend to correlate between populations according their geographical locations. Our data indicate that wide inter population variation in the frequency of alleles associated with common diseases exists even on a sub continental level.

Molecular genetic diagnostic strategies of cystic fibrosis  (CF) are dependent of the mutation distribution of the analyzed population. The goal of our study was to establish the mutational spectrum of 40 clinically diagnosed severe CF patients in Eastern Hungary. Materials and methods. For the mutation testing, a multiplex commercially available diagnostic assay was used together with a specific PCR assay for the detection of the CFTRdele2,3(21kb) enabling to detect 30 CFTR mutations. In patients having mutations not included in this panel, the entire coding region of the CFTR gene was sequenced. Large alterations were analyzed using MLPA.Results. Using the mutation detection kit only, the detection rate was 81%. Integrating the CFTRdele2,3(21kb) mutation to the panel increased the detection rate to 86%.

Apart from approaches using smaller amplicons which have significantly increased the possibility of obtaining DNA profiles from highly degraded DNA samples, amplification of low copy  number (LCN) DNA samples and reduction of inhibitory effects are attainable with our recently reported whole genome amplification (WGA) method named KI PEP PCR. Implementation of this improved degenerate 15 mer primer extension preamplification PCR on the DNA isolated from 44 skeletal remains of Iranian war (1980 1987) victims was followed by specific amplification with specific primers and Real time PCR. DNA from fresh blood and a mixture of bone and blood DNA samples were also concomitantly examined.Subsequent to the amplification by KI PEP PCR, partial DNA profiles  were obtained from 15 samples with both Identifiler and minifiler Kits and no superior results were generated in comparison to DNA profiling without prior amplification. These results demonstrated that despite increasing the low quantity of DNA and relieving inhibitors by the utility of KI PEP PCR, no significant improvement can be achieved in DNA profiling of old skeletal remains on account of the presence of too many degraded DNA and the overall size reduction of DNA by the method.Keywords : DNA Profiling, Whole genome amplification, Improved  primer extension preamplification PCR, Skeletal remai",2011

Genetic polymorphisms in DNA repair genes might influence the repair activities of the enzymes predisposing individuals to cancer risk. Owing to the presence of these genetic variants, inter individual and ethnic differences in DNA repair  capacity have been observed in various populations. The present study aimed to determine the allele and genotype frequencies of five non synonymous SNPs, XRCC1 Arg194Trp (C>T, rs1799782), XRCC1 Arg280His (A>G, rs25489) XRCC1 Arg399Gln (A>G, rs25487), XRCC3 Thr241Met (G>A, rs861539), and XPD Lys751Gln (T>G, rs13181) in Tunisian population and to compare them with HapMap populations. The variant alleles of these SNPs have been found to be positively associated with different forms of cancer in several genetic epidemiological studies in other populations. To the  best of our knowledge, this is the first report of these DNA repair gene polymorphisms in Tunisians. The basic prevalence of these polymorphisms in the general population must be known to evaluate their significance in risk assessment in cancer and other phenotypes.  DNA was isolated from the peripheral blood sample of 154 healthy and unrelated individuals and the genotypes were determined by PCR RFLP. The allele and genotype frequency distribution at the five SNPs among Tunisians revealed a characteristic pattern may be  explained by the fact that the Tunisian population is a mix of ethnic groups. This could assist in high risk screening of humans exposed to environmental carcinogens and cancer predisposition in Tunisian population.",2011

The study included all cases of DS  born alive or prenatally diagnosed in 1970 2009, except for twins, both parentally derived trisomy 21 and trisomy 21 suspected to be parentally derived (recurrent cases in the same family). It was found that 2590 DS cases were unevenly distributed throughout the study area. We have identified 253 cases of a multiple occurrence of unrelated DS at the same dwelling, including 223 clusters of two DS, 23 clusters of three DS, 5 clusters of 4 DS, and two clusters of five DS. Clusters of two DS cases were estimated as a chance coincidence predominantly. Analysis of 30 clusters of 3 to 5 DS showed a highly significant excess  over expected figures (one case in 714.6 flats) for 16 of them. Mothers of DS individuals from 16 clusters (n,50) were younger compared to mothers of DS from outside the clusters (n,2409): 28.8 vs. 30.8 yo, proportion of mothers aged 35 and older 20% vs. 35.9%, p,0.02. Only 14% of dwelling units inside 16 clusters were located at the ground floor which makes the effect of radon exposure as a major cause of clustering quite improbable.

The frequency of the diseases is high   1:3500 newborns (male). The DMD gene mutations cause in Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) a complete absence of dystrophin synthesis. Method. 28 patients were analysed and genomic DNA was extracted from blood samples using QIAamp DNA Blood Mini Kit. Samples were collected from DMD patients with clinical diagnosis of DMD, from their relatives and in one case amniotic fluid was collected for prenatal molecular diagnosis. Isolated genomic DNA was analyzed by MLPA technique, which can identify extensive deletions or duplications of gene fragments. The results which were obtained by capillary electrophoresis on AbiPrism 3130XL were quantified and interpreted using Coffalyser program. Results. In 13 patients were identified extensive deletions (59.1%) and duplications only in two patients (9.1%). 6 female patients with heterozygous genotypes confirmed the previously identified mutations in male patients. In one case prenatal diagnosis was performed on a patient having a child with DMD, confirmed by molecular diagnosis. In 6 patients (27.27%) no deletions or duplications were identified.ConclusionsOur results confirm literature data that indicate a higher frequency of large deletions and a lower frequency of duplications, the two types together representing over 68% of mutations identified in patients with clinical diagnosis of DMD.

The prevalence rate of all HDs varied in the investigated populations from 1.34 to 9.78 per 1000 persons. Simultaneously with medical genetic study the population genetic study was performed. Correlation analysis between prevalence rates of AD and AR HDs and random inbreeding F st as well as index endogamy was carried out. It was proposed that the genetic drift is probable one of the factor which determined genetic  differentiation of populations by the prevalence of autosomal (AD and AR) HDs.

Direct typing of HLA alleles can provide insights into complex associations among genomic structure, SNP variation and variation at respective  alleles. However, the excessive cost has compelled researchers to adopt more economical approaches, such as SNP based tagging and allele prediction algorithms. In this study, we modified a statistical methodology developed by Leslie et al. (2008) and applied it to predict alleles at 6 classical HLA loci (HLA A,  B,  C,  DPB1,  DQB1 and  DRB1) by using commercially available SNP data including Illumina HumanHap550K, Affymetrix 500K SNP, Affymetrix SNP 6.0 genotypes alone and combinations of them within the MHC region for the sample of 437 unrelated Han Chinese individuals residing in Taiwan. Our results  indicated that overall, a single panel of ~160 SNPs typed across the region was sufficient for predicting HLA alleles at 6 loci with up to 98% accuracy at 4 digit resolution. In conclusion, the effective prediction algorithm provides a low cost alternative to direct typing of HLA alleles and sheds light on building a representative estimation background of HLA allele genotypes in the Han Chinese population.

Molecular genetic analysis is available since 1997 in our Institute in Hungary. Until the end of 2010 we genotyped 319 subjects originating from 195 families. Amongst  them 149 people were tested positive with a repeat length ranging from 40 to 90 CAG repeats (46.7% of all tests). 32 subjects carried an intermediate allele (10.0% of tests), with CAG repeat ranging from 26 to 36.Epidemiological studies report a wide variation of HD prevalence. Molecular studies suggested that different prevalence rates could be due to differences in other genetic factors responsible for the disease. In this respect, we analysed the CCG length polymorphism that is adjacent to the CAG region and compared our results to those  of other European studies. The CCG7 allele was overrepresented among affected chromosomes (94.6%), while we found a low percent of the CCG10 allele (5.38%); this result is in accordance with studies performed previously on other European populations. Since the origin of Hungarian population differs from other European Caucasian ethnical groups, as founders of the ancient Hungarian state were from the eastern side of the Ural Mountains, we might expect different frequencies of the intragenic polymorphisms compared to populations of Western European ancestry. The fact that we found similar frequencies suggests that the founder mutation of HD in Hungary is of Western European and not of Asian origin.",2011

The frequencies of HD are different in ethnic groups (0,6 100:1000000). The highest ones are found in countries of European origin.To investigate the HTT gene expansion allelesâ origin and possible  ways of evolution in Ukrainian population the analysis of allelic of CGG repeats and âdel2642â polymorphisms of HTT gene was conducted in a group of HD patients with CAG expansions (40 52 CAG repeats) and their relatives from Ukraine. CAG expansion was found in chromosomes 4 marked by different CCG allele variants (7, 8, 10, 12 CCG repeats). Linkage disequilibrium between expanded CAG alleles and the major (CGG) 7 allele (83%) has been displayed.  We also found that the frequency of 2642 deletion of HTT gene is  significantly higher in the group of HD patients than in controls. Its may  be due to âWestern Europe founderâ effect of HD chromosomes with (CCG) 7 del2642 haplotypes. High frequency of (CGG)10 allele in HD  chromosomes (12%) may be a result of migration from populations in which the HD chromosomes are predominantly marked by this CCG variant (Asia, ets.). Minor CCG alleles ((CCG) 8 and (CCG)12) may  appear due to step by step mutations of major alleles. We also studied instable intermediate CAG alleles (27 CAG repeats of HTT gene). It has been shown that these chromosomes (5% of normal ones) have (CCG) 7 del2642 haplotypes (single origin). Our findings suggest that  HD mutation in Ukraine has a recurrent origin.

Only one published study evaluated the incidence of severe HP at 1/100,000 in Canada 53 years ago. Moderate forms of hypophosphatasia (mHP), including HP with moderate bone features  and the mildest form odontohypophosphatasia, reflect both recessive and dominant inheritance, and are therefore expected to be more frequent than severe forms. Here we estimated both the prevalences of severe and mHP in European populations. The prevalence of severe  HP was estimated at 1/300,000 on the basis of the number of cases tested in our laboratory and originating from France during the period 2000 2009. We observed a significant discrepancy between North and West Europe where the prevalence was similar to France (1/340,000), and South and East Europe where the value was significantly lower (1/1,360,000). This difference may be due to several factors among which no request of mutation analysis and molecular testing in other laboratories than ours, but also to particular recurrent mutations in North and West Europe reflecting founder effects. The prevalence of mHP was then estimated by using the proportion of dominant mutations among severe alleles and by estimating the penetrance of the disease in heterozygotes for dominant mutations. According to a genetic model with 4 alleles resulting in 10 distinct genotypes, the prevalence of  dominant mHP in the European population was estimated at 1/6370, pointing out that mHP is much more frequent than severe HP.",2011

Among various genes contributing in IBD susceptibility, Intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM) 1 and its polymorphisms are of concern. ICAM 1  gene is located on chromosome 19p13 and plays a pivotal role in  the  inflammatory processes. There are two single base polymorphisms of  ICAM 1 gene (G241R and K469E). In this study, we examined the association between G241R and K469E, and IBD in Iranian patients. m aterial and  m ethod: In this case control designed study, 156 IBD  patients (110 UC and 46 CD patients) and 131controls were enrolled.  The study was performed in Shaheed Beheshti University during 2006   2009. The polymorphisms (G241R and K469E) were assessed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) followed by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP).Results: The mutant allele of R241G was more frequent in CD patients  compared to controls (33.7% vs. 22.9%; p,0.042; OR,1.71; 95%CI: 1.02 2.88) and K469E mutant allele frequency was significantly higher in CD patients compared to controls (55.4%vs. 40.5%; p,0.013;  OR,0.546; 95%CI: 0.34 0.88). No difference was observed among UC patients compared to controls. c onclusion : Our findings suggest that both mutations of ICAM1 gene  may probably participate in pathogenesis of Crohnâs disease in Ir",2011

The promoter polymorphisms of  308G/A in TNF Î± gene as well as  954G/C and CCTTT repeat polymorphism of iNOS gene were studied in this  research. Due to similar conditions of TNF Î± and iNOS production, the polymorphisms of these genes were studied in both Iranian Turk and Mazandarani ethnic groups. In addition, the expression of iNOS gene in transcriptional level has analyzed in comparison with iNOS polymorphism genotypes.To identify the genetic polymorphisms, the PCR RFLP and sequencing based method were used. The expression of iNOS gene was  measured by real time PCR. The results revealed that allele frequency of polymorphic  308A allele of TNF Î± in Turk and Mazandarani ethnic  groups was 15.5% and 16.3% respectively. The polymorphic  954C allele of iNOS gene was not observed in both ethnic groups. The most  prevalent CCTTT repeat number in promoter region of iNOS gene in both groups was shown as 14 repeats. The transcriptional expression of iNOS was higher in presence of 15 repeats of CCTTT rather than  14 repeats. Moreover, it was shown that the presence of A allele at  308 position of TNF Î± gene is associated with lower expression of iNOS in transcriptional level (p <0.001). In conclusion, the results of  this study suggest the effect of TNF Î± gene polymorphism on iNOS gene expression and this can be modified the inflammation process in the cell.",2011

 Possible functional differences of the two mitochondrial DNA polymerase gamma (POLG) gene haplogroups,P10.50,"B. Malyarchuk, M. Perkova, M.

However little is known about the haplotypic structure of this gene. Here we have  sequenced POLG1 gene 5â promotor region and analyzed distribution  of this gene haplotypes in two North Eurasian populations   in Russians (n,63) and Buryats (n,90). Only one polymorphic locus, namely rs2856268, was revealed in the 5â promoter region studied. Comparison with our previous haplotypic data has shown that the alleles Evolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology 338339 Evolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology 339 rs2856268 G and  A are strongly associated with haplogroups A and  B of the POLG1 gene. Interestingly that association of the rs2856268 variants with diabetic polyneuropathy (DPN) in type 1 diabetes mellitus has been recently reported in Russians (Spitsina et al. 2009). It was found that the carriers of G allele and GG genotype had higher risk  of DPN development than the carriers of A allele and AA genotype. One may suggest that the polymorphism in the 5â promotor region can differentially modulate expression of the whole POLG1 gene, pointing to a higher possibility for G allele to determine a lower level both of the POLG1 gene expression and the mtDNA repair. In addition, taking  into account that haplogroups A and B could evolve separately for a long time (about 1.5 millions of years), it is important that possibly more accurate form of enzyme is associated with younger and more frequent in humans haplogroup B.

For studying mechanisms of human evolution, discovering genes involved in complex diseases and quality management, the determination of the mtDNA haplogroup is a critical  requirement. However, despite the availability of Phylotree, a regularly updated classification tree of global mtDNA variation, the process of haplogroup classification is still time consuming and error prone, as researchers have to manually compare the polymorphisms found in a population sample to those summarized in Phylotree, polymorphism by polymorphism, sample by sample.Results: To eliminate these shortcomings we designed HaploGrep, a fast and reliable algorithm to determine the haplogroup affiliation of thousands of mtDNA profiles genotyped for the entire mtDNA or  any part of it. HaploGrep is implemented as a freely available web application, uses open source technologies and scales well in time and space. For every input sample the top 10 results and the phylogenetic position of the respective haplogroups are displayed, thus providing a detailed explanation of how and why a haplogroup was ranked best. Furthermore, numerous export possibilities are given and all results are visualized in a tree structure, showing the current position in Phylotree with hints for further refinement of the actual haplogroup status and potential errors in the classification process.Conclusions: HaploGrep uses the latest version of Phylotree and offers an all in one solution for quality assessment of mtDNA profiles in clinical genetics, population genetics and forensics.

The best studied class of PRRs, Toll like receptors (TLRs) recognize specific pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) from various microorganisms. Genetic variation in  TLRs may influence susceptibility to infections. We studied genetic variation of TLR2 in various populations and whether this variation may be due to genetic drift or natural selection.MATHERIAL AND METHODS: We have recruited a total of 776 individuals from different populations classified according to geographic and ethnic criteria into 7 groups: Romanians, Vlax Roma, Dutch (European populations), Han Chinese (East Asia), Dogon, Fulani (Africa), and Trio Indians (America). We genotyped three  non synonymous TLR2 polymorphisms: 1892C>A, 2029C>T and 2258G>A. To avoid false possitive results for 2029C>T we have also sequenced the TLR2 non coding exon 3 duplication.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: The 2029C>T seems to be absent among both European and non European populations, with the exception of the Vlax Roma, suggesting that this polymorphisms most likely aroused in Indo Aryan people after migration into South Asia. Due to very low frequency of the minor allele (1.3%), it was difficult to identify enough individuals bearing this mutation, in order to perform  experiments on its functional effects. 1892C>A was found exclusively in European populations, but not in Asian, African or American volunteers, probably occurred in Proto Indo Europeans. Interestingly, 2258G>A was present only in Europeans, but not in Vlax Roma. The differential pattern of the various TLR2 polymorphisms in various populations may explain some of the differences in susceptibility to infections between these populations.",2011

The  results showed that the health status in elderly is sharply discriminated by PIN3 (+16bp) genotypes: carriers of A1A2 or A2A2 genotype more frequently have cardiovascular diseases (CVD), osteoporosis, risk for undernutrition (weight loss, diarrhea), and they also recently suffered from stress or acute illness. In contrast, for the carriers of A1A1 genotype none disadvantageous condition could be detected. The Arg72Pro polymorphism differentiated the study participants as follows: ArgArg carriers showed more frequently CVD while ArgPro and ProPro carriers had lower body mass index and they more frequently suffered  from stress or acute illness. Further analysis showed that the most frequent haplotype ArgArg_A1A1 (48.9% of all haplotypes), although very advantageous for many traits is characterized by increased fasting glucose levels or/and diabetes. The remaining two A1A1 haplotypes (ProPro_A1A1 and ArgPro_A1A1) have lower frequency of CVD and CVD risk factors as well as of osteoporosis; the only disadvantageous characteristic being an increased risk for undernutrition. The present preliminary study exposes A1A1 genotype as the most advantageous TP53 genotype while A2 allele (A1A2 and A2A2 genotypes) bears substantial risk for various health related traits and it is so irrespective of codon72 status.Evolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology 342",2011

Peroxiredoxin 5 (PRDX5) is a mitochondrial antioxidant enzyme that neutralizes reactive oxygen species (ROS). According to the free radical theory of aging, an accumulation of oxidative damages as a result of ROS attack is probably a reason of aging and age related pathology. PRDX5 gene polymorphism may cause a different activity  of peroxiredoxin 5 and thus may play a role in human longevity. The purpose of our study was to reveal associations of PRDX5 gene polymorphism with human lifespan.We analysed 2 SNPs in PRDX5 gene ( 540A>C, rs 28364831 and 1955C>T, rs 627425) in two groups of unrelated persons from St Petersburg: young (4 17 years old, n,123) and elderly (80 106 years old, n,173), including long livers (90 106 years old, n,85). Genotyping was carried out by PCR RFLP analysis. Linkage disequilibrium and haplotype frequencies were estimated by EH program. Allele and  genotype frequencies were compared by using Chi square test, Fisherâs exact test.We have revealed linkage disequilibrium between SNPs (D , 0,12) and only 3 alleles (haplotypes).

Genotype calling was performed with Birdseed v2, considering all samples as a unique cluster to avoid batch effects. Subsequently, we applied standard filters for samples and SNP quality, and used IBD sharing to detect, and discard, hidden relatives. Using principal component analysis, we identified outliers and reassigned each individual accordingly. An analysis of molecular variance indicated that only 0.21% of the variability could be attributable to inter population variation (Fst,0.002), confirming a lack of large scale substructure. We thus considered the Sardinians  as a unique sample. Compared to HapMap3 populations, as expected, higher similarity was observed with Tuscany and CEPH samples (Fst,0.005 and 0.010, respectively).

Hamilton, Williams and Medawar pointed out numerous shortcomings of these theories in their original papers and subsequent comments, yet since their publication little has  been attempted to directly address these issues.The criticisms levelled at these theories include an inability to explain prolonged post reproductive survival, the evolution of menopause and early infant mortality, the existence of ânegativeâ and ânegligibleâ senescence, positive selection for cellular suicide, and an apparent tautology in defining the likelihood of death. All of these valid criticisms can be addressed using a simple modification of Hamiltonâs equations.The Eueler Lotka equation and the Malthusian parameter form the definitional basis of fitness for Williams and Hamilton. Yet these  equations carry an implicit and incorrect assumption: that the production of offspring is the measure of fitness for an individual. This assumption creates a situation where fitness must always be a positive, declining vector.By the simple introduction of an indirect fitness term, and the removal of the dx variable, the traditional equations of Hamilton become more accurate measures of fitness and can account for all of the above phenomena.",2011

Although a genetic component in risk of VF in MI is recognized, underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown. ECG parameters predict risk of sudden  death; and recent genome wide association studies(GWAS) have revealed common single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs) associated with variation in ECG indices of conduction and repolarization. In this study we investigated the effect of these SNPs in modulating risk of VF in acute MI.Methods: Patients studied were from the Arrhythmia Genetics  in the NEtherlands  s tudy (AGNE s ), which consists of Dutch  Caucasian patients with a first acute MI, with those suffering VF classified as cases(n,515) and those not suffering VF classified  as controls(n,457).

Genotypes were obtained either by  direct genotyping(Illumina610) or were imputed using HapMap build 36. Logistic regression was used to test for association with VF.Results: Besides previously reported  rs6795970 in SCN10A , two  SNPs, rs11897119 and rs17779747 were found to modulate risk of  VF during MI. rs11897119 (OR:1.23, 95%CI:1.03 1.49) is located in MEIS1, and was previously shown to be associated with PR interval in the general population. rs17779747 (OR:1.28, 95%CI:1.05 1.54) is located 600 kb far from KCNJ2, and was previously associated with QT interval in the general population.Conclusions: SNPs impacting cardiac conduction and repolarization may modulate risk of sudden cardiac death during acute MI.",2011

This disease is prominently present in the non  Ashkenazi Jews, Arabs, Turks and Armenian people.Considering the geographic location of North West of Iran and its  neighborhood with two high risk regions i.e. Armenia and Turkey, the high prevalence of FMF in this area is expected.Aim  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the number of carriers of MEFV common mutations in healthy controls. The result can be of help in estimating the prevalence of Familial Mediterranean Fever disease and awareness raising to avoid potential Amiloidosis.Methods  200 healthy controls who were not suffering from FMF were selected randomly from North West area. After obtaining their consent and blood sampling, their DNA was extracted. Then through PCR  RFLP and PCR ARMS techniques, the mutation was studied.Findings  Out of 400 studied alleles, 44 mutant alleles for E148Q mutation and 7 mutant alleles for V726A mutation were found. In the other 3 mutations, no mutant allele was found. The frequency of general alleles for these 5 common mutations is 0.1325. The carriers rat was 23.4%.Conclusions  The result with 23.4% of carriers indicates that FMF is significantly prevalent in North West of the Iran.This high number suggests that North West of Iran, like other high risk areas, is susceptible to Familial Mediterranean Fever. Like other studies carried out in other countries, this study also suggests that E148Q has reduced influence in the patients of North West area.",2011

Statistical data were obtained using the program GENEPOP (Version 4.0). The allele frequency was 0.936 for  238G, and 0.0640 for  238A, corresponding to that observed in European populations (0.068 and  0.932 respectively, NCBI, 2010). In dengue patients the presence of this mutant allele 238A is associated with protection (Oliveira 2004). In this study, no association was found (p> 0.05).  308G allele had a frequency of 0.878 and  308A of 0.122, similar to described for African American (0.123 and 0.877 respectively, NCBI, 2010), confirming the ethnic heterogeneity of the study population.

Brain development occurs primarily in utero and early infancy, but the role of maternal vitamin B12 levels during pregnancy on offspring cognitive function is unclear. In this study we examined the relationship between vitamin B12 status in pregnant women from the  UK ALSPAC birth cohort and the cognitive ability of their offspring. First, we conducted an observational study of maternal vitamin B12 dietary intake during pregnancy and childâs IQ at 8 years of age. There was a positive observational association between maternal vitamin B12 intake and childâs IQ that was attenuated somewhat after adjustment for potential confounders, but remained. We then employed a Mendelian randomization strategy that assessed the association of maternal genotype at SNPs in the genes FUT2 (rs492602) and TCN2 (rs1801198), which have been previously found to be reliably related  to serum vitamin B12 in genomewide and candidate gene association studies, with childâs IQ. This approach allows us to evaluate the causal relationship between exposure and outcome without confounding from lifestyle and environmental risk factors. In this case, maternal alleles associated with an increase in serum vitamin B12 were also associated with higher IQ scores in children. These associations were present after adjustment for the equivalent offspring SNP and population stratification. Our findings support the hypothesis that low vitamin B12 levels in utero adversely impact childrenâs cognitive function.",2011

Vitamin D (25(OH)VitD) plays an important role in many areas of  health and disease. Prospective studies showed associations between low vitamin D and mortality. Vitamin D insufficiency affects as many as half of otherwise healthy adults in developed countries. The vitamin D binding protein gene GC (âgroup specific componentâ) contains an  A>C polymorphism, whereby the GG genotype has been associated with an increased risk for vitamin D insufficiency. We investigated the potential role of this GC polymorphism for bone mineral density and bone fractures.GC genotypes were determined in two independent cohorts, 370 elderly otherwise healthy and in 970 nursing home subjects. Genotypes were related to 25(OH)VitD and fractures in both groups and with bone mineral density (BMD) in healthy elderly subjects.Mean vitamin D levels were within the lower normal range in the healthy  elderly cohort (32,8Â±13,2 ng/ml) and very low in the nursing home patients (9,3Â±6,8 ng/ml). The GG genotype was highly associated with lower 25(OH)VitD values (p<0,001). Age adjusted measurements of BMD expressed as Z scores (n,356) at the lumbar spine, the total hip and femoral neck were not associated with the GC polymorphism. GC frequencies were not statistically different between persons with fractures (n,583, GG: 8,2%, GT: 42,7% TT: 49,1%) and persons without fractures (n,744, GG: 3,6%, GT: 41,1% TT: 52,3%).We conclude that the GC polymorphism is a determinant for raised risk of Vitamin D insufficiency but not for bone mineral density and fracture risk, at least in our highly deficient 25(OH)VitD nursing home cohort.",2011

The position of Bulgarians among other populations was visualized by Principal Component (PC) analysis.About 80% of the total genetic variation in Bulgarians falls within haplogroups E M35, I M170, J M172, R M17 and R M269. This finding shows that the Bulgarian haplogroup profile is congruent with those described for most European populations. Among the prehistoric events marked by the observed haplogroups, the greatest contribution comes from the range expansion of local Mesolithic foragers triggered by adoption of agriculture introduced by a cadre of Near Eastern farmers. The Bulgarian Y chromosome gene pool also bears signals of the recolonization from different glacial refugia, the spread of agriculture from the Near East and the expansion of early farmers along the Central and East European river basins.As for the interpopulation analysis, similarly to mtDNA, Bulgarians belong to the cluster of European populations, still being slightly distant from them. Bulgarians are distant from Turks (despite geographical proximity), Arabic and Caucasus populations and Indians. These trends in the PCA graph likely reflect not only prehistoric, but also more recent demographic events that have shaped the Y chromosome structure of  modern Bulgarians.",2011

Body homeostasis and circadian rhythm are though to interact to regulate these phenotypes, but little is known about the molecular mechanism behind it. We thus investigated 7 European populations  in relation to their sleep duration habits and genome wide variability. Meta analysing the independent genome wide association results, we identified a variant (P , 3.99 x 10  8) in the ABCC9 gene that  explains â 5 % of the variation in sleep duration. We found supportive  evidence for this association in a subgroup of an independent de novo  replication cohort, which we selected based on gene environment (time of year) and sleep timing interactions. To investigate the functional  relevance of our findings, we knocked down a homologue of the gene in Drosophila, which resulted in a night sleep duration reduction of 3  h. Our study shows that ABCC9 modulates epidemiological variation  in human sleep duration, which is also influenced by inter individual differences in sleep timing and seasonality (seasonal differences in entrainment of the biological clock). Therefore, scanning only for main effects on sleep duration, one might miss important genetic variants specific to subgroups of the population. ABCC9 is involved with energy  homeostasis, and the susceptibility to overweight and cardiovascular  disease, which correlate with sleep duration. The relation of these genes to metabolism and disease indicates a common mechanism for the regulation of these phenotypes and sleep duration.",2011

Translocation breakpoints, located at 1q11.1 (a non containing gene region) and 17q23.1.q23.2, did not present genomic imbalances. It has been shown that around 30% of cases with apparently balanced reciprocal translocations and abnormal phenotype present genomic rearrangements in other chromosomes. We, therefore, hypothesis that the atypical deletion of 16p11.2, present in our patient and previously reported in two cases with intellectual disabilities, may have a pathogenic effect, either as a primary cause or as a contributing factor to the phenotype. Further investigations to rule out the possibility of gene disruption within 17q23 region and characterization of additional cases with 16p11.2 deletions are needed to fully understand the role of this rearrangement.",2011
 s tudy of the A c VR1 gene expression and regulation: the 5âU t R and the promoter region,P11.002,"F. Giacopelli1, S. Cappato2, M. Mura2, R. Ravazzolo1,2, R. Bocciardi1","1University of Genoa and CEBR, Genova, Italy, 2G","Gaslini Institute Laboratory  of Molecular Genetics, Genova, Italy. ACVR1 encodes a BMP type I receptor mutated in Fibrodysplasia  Ossificans Progressiva, a severe form of heterotopic ossification. Mechanisms regulating ACVR1 expression are still unknown. According to our analysis, the 5â genomic region of ACVR1 is subjected to alternative splicing generating several transcripts in which different  5âUTR exons are combined to a common coding sequence, with different expression profiles according to cell type. As assessed by cell transfection with different full length cDNA constructs and western blot analysis, we observed that different splicing isoforms correlated with different quantitative expression of the protein.Moreover, with the aim to identify regulatory elements involved in the transcriptional control of ACVR1 expression, we focused on a genomic region spanning around 2.9 kb, from position  2.893 to +32 upstream of transcription start site (tss, +1). This region is highly conserved and  particularly rich in GC nucleotides. A functional characterization of the ACVR1 promoter was obtained by subcloning the whole fragment and a series of derived deletion segments in a Luciferase expression vector and transfection in different cell lines. The strongest promoter activity was displayed by a 700 bp fragment upstream of tss, but a residual and quite significant activity was still present in a 100 bp fragment. Our data suggest that besides the transcriptional control of ACVR1  expression operated by the promoter region, other mechanisms involving the 5âUTR region, in particular translational regulation, can take place.

Total of 2194 alpha2 and 1244 alpha1 globin DNA sequencing assays were performed. In cases of absence of nucleotide change, the sequences were analyzed by CodonCode aligner software (V. 3.7.1), to exclude frame shifts and none sense mutations. Other variations were checked by Polyphen online software to identify whether the mutation is damaging or not.Seven new mutations have been identified, of which 2 located in alpha2 loci (Cd 83 T>G, Cd43 C>A) and 5 in alpha1 loci (Cd99 A>T,  Cd34 T>C, IVSI 4 A>G, Cd44 insC and Cd109 delC). Among alpha1 globin mutations, the Cd99 was nonsense, Cd44 and Cd109 were frameshifts, and the Cd34 was considered as possibly damaging by Polyphen but the role of IVSI 4 needs to be further analyzed.This study remarks the importance of point mutations in alpha globin gene cluster, and can identify their role in microcytic anemia. Besides, there were plenty of nucleotide variations identified as polymorphisms. Locating these positions and studying their relations with damaging mutations enables us to perform a population study for discovering the origin of the mutations.",2011

Mutations in the COL4A5 gene causes X linked Alport syndrome. Mutations in COL4A4  and COL4A3 genes have been reported in both autosomal recessive  and autosominal dominant Alport syndrome. The conventional  mutation screening, performed by DHPLC and/or Sanger sequencing, is time consuming and has relatively high costs due to the absence of hot spots and to the high number of exons per gene: 51 (COL4A5), 48  (COL4A4), and 52 (COL4A3). Usually, several months are necessary to complete the diagnosis, especially in cases with less informative pedigrees. To overcome these limitations, we designed a next generation sequencing protocol enabling simultaneous detection of all possible variants in the three genes. We used a method coupling selective amplification to the 454 Roche DNA sequencing platform  (GS junior). The application of this technology allowed to identify the second mutation in two Alport patients (p.S1147F in COL4A3 and  p.R1682W in COL4A4) and to exclude the diagnosis of Alport in a third patient.

More than 400 mutations have been reported in the literature to date and this allelic heterogeneity is also reflected by a phenotypic heterogeneity. Genotype phenotype correlation remains elusive, although recent analyses have shown that missense mutations (of  which the majority are glycine substitutions) give a better prognosis than other types of mutations. A genotype phenotype correlation was examined with regards to age at onset of ESRD and: (i) distance of mutation from closest natural interruption, (ii) location of mutation along the gene, (iii) change in number of side chain carbon atoms caused by the mutation, and (iv) change in charge and hydrophobicity caused by the mutation. Trends were evident for all statistical analyses and a statistically significant (p value: 0.0017) correlation (R square: 0.1362) could be found, with age at onset of ESRD decreasing with increasing number of carbon atoms found in the side chain of the substituting amino acid. We also examined the possibility of interruptions representing subtle mutational hotspots and although a trend could be seen with having less mutations within interruptions, no statistical significance could be reached. Hence, the size of the side chain of the substituting amino acid is an important factor in determining the disease phenotype with regards to age at onset of ESRD. This can be explained by the fact that any other aminoacid substituting glycine is  larger and therefore cannot be accommodated where the three chains meet in the collagenous triple helix.",2011

As each gene accounts for only a small fraction of cases, it is crucial to develop an efficient tool for investigating all genes simultaneously. Here we present a very fast and  cost efficient targeted re sequencing approach to screen for all known ALS / FTD and genes associated with neurodegeneration and potential candidate genes simultaneously. We expect to identify major genetic risk factors in a significantly larger proportion of cases as compared to the cases identified with the conventional sequencing method. In addition, careful collection of all clinically relevant information will allow us to investigate how the genotype determines the phenotype in the different subsets of neurodegenerative diseases.Methods: Genomic DNA is enriched using a custom made Agilent  SureSelect in solution kit. Sequencing of 50 genes (360kb in total) is performed using barcoded libraries on one oct (1/8 slide) on the SOLiD 4 platform generating approximately 5 Million mappable 50 basepair reads per patient. The basic data analysis is performed with Bioscope v1.2. Additionally, we developed a diagnostic pipeline. All variants are then re sequenced by the gold standard Sanger sequencing or quantitative PCR, respectively.Results and Conclusion: We introduce a fast and highly efficient screening tool for variants in genes associated with movement disorders and neurodegenerative diseases.

This study show an extensive search for genomic rearrangements by  microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) in patients with epilepsy of unknown etiology.Two sets of 279 patients with unexplained epilepsy and 246 controls were screened by using a 44K CGH array. CNVs overlapping >50%  with those reported in the Database of Genomic Variant were not followed up. Validation was performed by FISH, higher density array CGH, or quantitative PCR. GeneCodis2.0 software was used to explore the biological function of genes included within the identified CNVs.Rare CNVs occurred in twenty six (9.3%) patients and in sixteen (6.5%) controls (p,0.26). CNVs identified in patients were larger (p,0.027) and showed higher gene content (p,0.021) than controls. CNVs sized >1Mb (p,0.002) and including >10 genes (p,0.005)  occurred more frequently in patients than controls. Conversely, the two groups did not differ for CNVs smaller than 1Mb (p,0.051) and involving 10 or less genes (p,0.547). Nine (34.6%) patients among those harboring rare CNVs showed rearrangements associated with emerging microdeletion/microduplication syndromes. Mental retardation and neuropsychiatric features were associated with rare CNVs (p,0.004) whereas epilepsy type did not. Significant enrichment of genes involved in ion transport was observed within CNVs identified in patients. Patients with epilepsy have a significantly increased burden of large, rare, gene rich CNVs, particularly when associated to mental retardation or other neuropsychiatric features. Therefore, we suggest that CNVs screening should be routinely performed for diagnostic purposes only in such patients. Moreover, the implementation of very  high resolution screening in clinical practice deserves caution.",2011

This work builds on and integrates with recently launched international initiatives to i) extend and adapt the  existing DOI infrastructure for identifying, locating and citing online datasets (DataCite: http://www.datacite.org), and ii) create a global registry of unique identifiers for authors and other contributors (ORCID: http://www.orcid.org).The technical approach we are exploring in this pilot project utilizes this emerging global data citation and contributor identification framework, in order to allow published datasets to be discovered, cited in a scholarly context and unambiguously attributed.

However, current methods of data analysis of gene environment interactions using traditional approaches are inefficient. High throughput methods of analysis in large scale epidemiological studies including thousands of subjects and hundreds  of SNPs and environmental factors should be implemented. We developed an integrative computer tool, HUGETOOL (HUman Gene Environmental inTeraction tOOL), for large scale analysis of gene  environment interactions, in human studies of complex diseases including a large number of subjects, SNPs, as well as environmental factors. That resource uses standard statistical packages to build and fit the gene environment interaction models by means of syntax scripts in predicting one or more continuous or dichotomic phenotypes. Codominant, dominant and recessive genetic interaction models including control for covariates are automatically created for each SNP in order to test the best model. Environment variables can be used both as continuous and as categorical. From the standard outputs, HUGETOOL extracts a selected set of parameters (regression coefficients, p values, adjusted means, etc.), and groups them in a single MS Excel Spreadsheet. The tool allows editing the set of filter parameters, filtering the selected results depending on p values, as well as plotting the selected gene environment interactions to check  consistency. We implemented our tool in real data obtained in two standard cardiovascular studies carried out in the Mediterranean population, and demonstrated the excellent performance of this tool.

As CNV calls made from each of these approaches can be subject to appreciable false positive rates, detected variants of interest are generally corroborated by an independent method. The method of choice for CNV confirmation has primarily been real time qPCR. Here we report the evalution of a novel CNV assay based on the NanoString nCounter Analysis System. The nCounter system uses a hybridization based single molecule capture approach not requiring amplification of input DNA. Invidual tripartite complexes of the target molecule, a  biotin labeled probe and a fluorescently labeled (âbarcodedâ) probe are directly counted. We compared the performance of the nCounter system at 30 putative CNV loci in a set of 96 human samples, all of which have data at these same loci from ABI Taqman CNV assays. A subset of samples also have data available from Agilent aCGH 244k custom and Illumina 1M Infinium arrays. Preliminary results show that the Nanostring method exibits 86% agreement with the Taqman CNV assays across all studied loci and individuals.

Consequently, comparing different studies is difficult, and it is impossible to examine a full and unbiased picture of all the data that exist. To address this deficit, GWAS Central (www.gwascentral.org) (previously HGVbaseG2P) was constructed   representing a free and open access resource for the interrogation of summary level GWAS data, ultimately combining the features of a database and a scientific journal.GWAS Central employs powerful graphical and text based data presentation methods for discovery, visualisation and co examination of many studies, at genome wide and region specific levels. Studies of interest can be identified using chromosomal regions/genes and  markers. There is also the facility for researchers to securely view their own uploaded datasets alongside many published studies.Current content includes top p values from collections; supplementary data; direct researcher submissions; and publicly available data. Consequently, the database now hosts >21 million p values and 708 studies (vs 3,948 p values and 798 studies in the NHGRI GWAS catalog), representing an estimated ~5% of all such data yet produced.A version of GWAS Central will soon be released for research groups to install on their own servers allowing them to manage, analyse and control access to their own data.

The aim of this work is to present a fully âin silicoâ approach for the  identification of genes that might be involved in the susceptibility for non disjunction diseases and their regulation by methylation processes. We have carried out a strategy based on the use of online available bioinformatics databases. Among these the most relevant ones used were OMIM, HUGO, GeneOntology and PubMed. Bioinformatics programs were used to select, retrieve and analyse the genes and their promoters to identify regions susceptible of being methylated, and thus  identify those genes susceptible of being epigenetically regulated.As result we have obtained 34 putative susceptibility genes regulated by methylation processes. We were neither on the need of developing new software nor carrying out clinical laboratory experiments for the identification of these genes. So it would be interesting to analyze the methylation patterns of these genes in the mothers of children with Down syndrome (cases) to compare it with the one of mothers of sound children. MSP (Methylation Specific PCR) is a good method to analyze it. We consider that this âin silicoâ methodology is robust enough to  provide candidate genes that must be checked âin vivoâ due to the clinical relevance of non disjunction diseases with the aim of providing new tools and criteria for their diagnosis.

Manual annotation is supplemented by automated gene predictions from Ensembl to produce the GENCODE gene set, the default annotation in  the Ensembl browser. A catalogue of variants in protein coding genes predicted to result in Loss of Function (LOF), based on 1000 genomes data, were identified by investigating the intersection of SNPs and indels from the three pilot phases, together with GENCODE gene models. We have manually analysed 885 SNPs/indels that introduce premature termination codons or splice site disruptions, firstly to validate and ensure completeness of the gene models on which LOF calls are based. One third of all variants investigated were miscalled due to errors in genome sequence or computational gene predictions.  Secondly, we have assessed whether the exon containing a LOF variant is constitutive or alternatively spliced, and finally we predict the functional impact of the variant. Of the valid calls, 36% affected exons that showed transcriptional evidence of being skipped in splice variants. Furthermore, 17% are predicted to effect changes in the protein product that may not result in LOF; producing for example small CDS truncations. We will describe how high quality annotation of gene models are essential to accurately predict the consequences of a SNP, and we propose a model whereby LOF may be considered at the level of the transcript and not the overall locus.",2011

Choosing the right subjects for a genome wide  association study implies, among other things, obtaining a sample with little or ideally no population structure. Even though efficient methods correcting for stratification now exist, these may fail when cases and controls come from entirely different populations. Subject recruitment  is often based only on self reported information about ethnic origin, but how well does this strategy deal with population structure issues?Aim.  Here, we evaluate self reported ethnicity as a predictor of genetic identity with respect to more objective information, such as patient/ parent/ grandparent place of birth in three Australian breast cancer studies.Methods.  A total of 412 subjects from the (i) Australian Breast Cancer Family Study; (ii) Multiple Case Breast Cancer Families; and (iii) Australian Mammographic Density of Twins and Sisters were  considered. Genotypes for 552,131 SNPs were determined with the InfiniumÂ® HD Human610 Quad BeadChip. Major population clusters were defined by means of principal component analysis (PCA) using EIGENSOFT. A naÃ¯ve Bayes (NB) classifier was developed using self reported ethnicity and place of birth as attributes and PCA clusters as the target value. Accuracy measures were used for the evaluation of the classification.Results.  The sample showed a considerable level of stratification. PCA also revealed several inconsistencies, mostly concerning self reported ethnicity, whereas the NB classifier indicated grandparent place of birth as the best predictor of genetic identity.Conclusion.  Self reported ethnicity, as opposed to grandparent place of birth, may not be the best guide for subject recruitment in  epidemiological studies.Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 352P11.023 Loss of Function Exomic Analysis in the identification of predisposition genes E. Ruark, K. Snape, S. Hanks, J. Douglas, N. Rahman;   Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom. Exome sequencing has proved to be a powerful approach in the  identification of causative variants underlying several Mendelian disorders. Two of the challenges that currently limit the widespread application of exome sequencing in disease gene identification are 1) the requirement for extensive, experienced statistical and bioinformatic  infrastructure for sequence analysis and 2) the identification of insertion deletion variants in short read data which impedes the ability to detect one of the commonest types of pathogenic mutation in human disease. We have been developing strategies to address these challenges. To address the first challenge we have been utilising and optimising a commercially available software, known as NextGENe, which uses a Burrows Wheeler alignment algorithm to align short read data. We have analysed over 75 exomes from individuals with a variety of genetic conditions and to address the second challenge  we have optimised indel calling and we have undertaken validation experiments. These showed that 48/54 (89%) insertion deletion variants chosen randomly across our sample series were real. We have also developed a loss of function (LOF) script which identifies all variants predicted to result in premature protein truncation and have applied the script to all of the exomes. This has led to the identification of six truncating mutations that are pathogenic and several others that we are currently investigating. Our scripts allow the accurate detection and prioritisation of variants in exome sequencing that are most likely to be pathogenic and may be of value to other groups.",2011

We aimed at identifying differential methylation patterns between breast cancers and other breast lesions to establish a DNA methylation signature for breast cancer diagnosis. 117 fresh frozen breast specimens including  cancer, benign, normal appearing breast tissue from patients and healthy individuals were analysed. Candidate genomic loci were isolated from DNA following bisulfite treatment and were hybridised to specialised oligonucleotide microarrays. A DNA methylation signature was identified by unsupervised analysis on the screening set, and its performance was assessed through bisulfite pyrosequencing in an independent validation set. The DNA methylation signature discriminates breast cancers from other samples in the screening set (10 12< adjusted p<10 6) (n,52) and is validated against an  independent set of breast tissue samples (adjusted p<1.92e 07) (n,65). High sensitivity and specificity of the signature to detect breast cancer is demonstrated by Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves and the corresponding area under the curve (AUC) analysis (AUC> 0.90). This signature is constituted of 12 CpG sites associated with SFRP2 and GHSR genes, and show significant hypermethylation in cancers. Strikingly, the normal appearing breast tissues from cancer patients are also methylated in these loci but at lower extent.

Complete genome sequencing is used to derive germline copy number variation (CNVs) and cancer copy number aberrations (CNAs) but its genomic resolution is limited by the extent of sequencing. Targeted resequencing  (sequence capture) provides an option to increase the resolution and sensitivity of CNV and CNA analysis in a highly accurate and cost effective manner. For cancer genome analysis, targeted resequencing substantially increased the fold coverage over regions of interest, which is useful in more sensitive applications like CNA discrimination in complex tumor normal tissue mixtures.We have developed an experimental and statistical algorithmic solution to derive copy number variation from targeted resequencing on the scale of gene subsets up to whole exomes. We focused on  four cancer samples with matched normal tumor pairs including breast adenocarcinoma, colorectal carcinoma and lymphoma. To minimize experimental variance from the sequencing process, we used a novel indexing approach where matched tumor normal pairs are sequenced together in a single sequencing lane. We enriched either gene subsets or whole exomes from these cancer samples. We then developed a statistical approach that incorporates absolute depth of coverage to provide a confidence in the tumor normal read ratio. Using these combined procedures, we not only were able to confirm CNVs on the resolution of exons but also could discriminate indels smaller than 150 bases. Overall, our approach for CNV and CNA analysis on exome and exon subsets is robust and straightforward to implement.",2011

We recently reported that the large CDK5R1 3âUTR contains some regulatory elements affecting transcript stability. Precisely, a 138 bp region was shown to be the most destabilizing region within the 3âUTR.

Riva1","1Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, University of Milan,  Milan, Italy, 2Department of Biology, University of Milan, Milan, Italy","Cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) have a higher incidence in  patients with NF1 microdeletion syndrome, compared to classical NF1 patients (18% vs 2%), presumably owing to haploinsufficiency of genes lying in the deletion interval and important for cardiac morphogenesis. One of the possible candidate genes for CVMs onset  inside the deletion, CENTA2, was found, by WISH (Whole mount In Situ Hybridization) on mouse embryos, to be turned on in heart at 9 9.5 dpc, when the heart tube is looping and the valves and septa are forming, suggesting a role in heart development. In order to provide further evidence on a possible role of CENTA2 in cardiac development, we employed zebrafish as a model system. Zebrafish is a useful model that allows a detailed cardio vascular analysis even in embryos with severe defects that would be lethal in other organisms. We performed loss of function experiments injecting a morpholino that is able to block  the mRNA translation of the zebrafish CENTA2 orthologue, centa2 like. At 2 dpf the injected embryos displayed in vivo circulatory and  cardiac defects, such as blood stases in the head and caudal region,  block of circulation and heart shape defects. A preliminary molecular characterization on morphants at 2 dpf showed that the injection of the centa2 like  morpholino caused heart looping defects, in particular  the formation of a tubular heart or an inverted heart looping. WISH analysis on morpholino injected embryos at different developmental  stages with different cardiac markers will allow further investigation of the role of centa2 like during zebrafish cardiac morphogenesis.",2011

The dog has emerged as an excellent model for complex disease genetics in human. Therefore, we analyzed a female boxer (Canis familiaris) genome for complexity and integration pattern of canine endogenous  retroviruses (CfERV) to gain further insights into comparative evolution regarding the human genome. Intriguingly, we could only identify 407 CfERVs constituting 0.15% of the dog genome, compared to six times more ERVs identified in the human genome. Primates and canines have likely different mechanisms to purge, restrict and protect their genomes against retroviruses. The CfERV integration landscape showed a non uniform intra  and inter chromosomal distribution in agreement with distinct selective pressures at different loci. Evidence for selection against CfERVs in sense orientation relative to  chromosomal genes was supported by a majority of CfERVs integrated in antisense orientation within 100 kb from annotated protein coding genes. Finally, a novel group of gammaretrovirus like CfERVs with high similarity to HERV Fc1 was found to have potential for active retrotransposition and possibly result from lateral transmissions between dog and human as a consequence of at least 10.000 years of close interactions. In conclusion, this ERV analysis of the first sequenced carnivorous species supports the notion that different mammals interact distinctively with endogenous retroviruses and suggests that retroviral lateral transmissions have occurred between dogs and.

Cilia are multifunctional cell organelles whose dysfunctions cause  ciliopathies   an emerging group of human genetic diseases. Understanding molecular biology of cilia requires genome wide identification of proteins involved in biogenesis and function of this organelle. Here, we explored the human ciliome by constructing gene  coexpression networks in 10 public microarray datasets from 3 tissues containing cells with motile cilia (airways, fallopian tubes and brain). The network analysis identified a cilia related module of coordinately expressed genes shared by the tissues. This transcriptomic signature recapitulated 294 known ciliary genes (including ciliopathy genes DNAH11, DPCD, HYDIN, LCA5, MDM1, RSPH4A, RSPH9) and identified 77 novel genes with expression patterns specific to ciliated cells. We used data from the Protein Atlas project to validate their expression at the protein level: for 138 proteins we found an increased  staining in the ciliary subcellular compartment or the apical region of the cytoplasm. We finally searched for genes with differences in expression between the ciliated tissues and found SLC47A2 as a gene highly expressed in ciliated cells in brain only. SLC47A2 represents one of the few known examples of differences between ciliated cells across tissues. This protein belongs to multidrug and toxin extrusion transporters (MATE) and may play a role in efflux of metabolites and xenobiotics from brain. Our analysis provides novel insights into the human ciliome and illustrates how combinations of open access transcriptomic and proteomic resources can be utilized to annotate protein function at a genome wide scale.

Gheldof","Center for Integrative Genomics, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland","The functional consequences of structural variation in the human  genome range from adaptation, to phenotypic variation, to predisposition to diseases. We, and others, have previously shown that alteration in copy number of a given genomic region influences the expression of genes mapping within, but also on its flanks. To assess  the possible mechanism(s) behind this neighboring effect, we gauged the histone modification status by ChIP seq in human lymphoblastoid cell lines from patients affected by Williams Beuren, Williams Beuren region duplication, Smith Magenis or DiGeorge Syndrome and control individuals. We monitored monomethylation of histone H4 K20 and trimethylation of histone H3 K27, as proxies for open and condensed chromatin, respectively.Sequences were mapped using Bowtie, while SICER and DESeq were used to define regions with modified histones. Upon comparison  between samples we observed that the rearranged regions (22q11.2, 17p11.2 and 7q11.23) were significantly modified in their chromatin structure. Consistent with the changes in expression levels of multiple genes mapping on the entire length of the chromosomes affected by structural variants, we also detected regions with modified histone status between samples, up  and downstream from the critical  regions, up to the end of the rearranged chromosome. Coherently, we pinpointed alteration of chromosomal looping interactions between  affected gene loci and the rearranged interval using an unbiased variant of chromosome conformation capture (3C seq).We conclude that large genomic rearrangements can lead to changes in the state of the chromatin spreading far away from the critical region, thus possibly affecting expression globally.",2011
A practical method for high resolution c NV estimation and validation using digital P c R,P11.038,"J. Regan, P. Belgrader, B. Hindson, S. Saxonov","QuantaLife, Pleasanton, CA, United States","Digital PCR (dPCR) is a practical solution for validating copy number  variations identified by next generation sequencers and microarrays. The dPCR method we developed empowers one person to screen hundreds of samples for CNV analysis in a single work shift. The dPCR workflow involves using restriction enzymes to separate tandem  copies of a target gene prior to assembling a duplex TaqMan assay that includes reagents to detect both the target gene and a single copy reference gene. The reaction mixture is then partitioned into 20,000 nanoliter droplets that are thermo cycled to end point before being analyzed in a two color reader. The fraction of positive counted droplets enables the absolute concentrations for the target and reference genes to be measured, from which, a relative copy number is determined. 20,000 PCR replicates per well provide the statistical power to resolve higher order copy number differences. This low cost method reliably  generates copy number measurements that cluster near integer values without overlap with adjacent copy number states allowing consistent discrimination between four and five copies at 95% confidence level. Lastly, to our knowledge, this technology is the first to be capable of phasing copy number variants, as we can easily determine whether all copies of a target locus are on the same or different chromosomes. Applications of this technology include: validation of CNV discoveries from GWAS, follow ups to next generation sequencing experiments, cytogenetic analyses, copy number alterations in cancer, and CNV phasing.",2011

Gunduz","Medical School, Izmir, Turkey","Sulforaphone (SFN), a compound derived from cruciferous vegetables  like broccoli, is reported to inhibit HDAC activity in prostate cancer cells. Aberrant activity of HDACs has been documented in several types of cancers and HDAC inhibitors (HDACi) have been employed for therapeutic purposes. CoREST, a subunit of HDAC1, HDAC2 and  LSD1, plays a role in blocking the expression of key target genes. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of sulforaphane on the transcriptional repression of CoREST in prostate cancer cell lines PC3 and V CAP, by chromatin immunopresipitation method (ChIP) and gene expression analysis. The cytotoxicity (IC50) of sulforaphane was found as 31.95 and 27.5 Î¼g/ml in V CAP and PC3 respectively, by XTT method. The CoREST ChIP relative ratios in control and IC50 dose groups were 19.08 and 9.87 in PC 3, while it was 17.37 and 6.28 in V CAP cell lines. The gene expression analysis of CoREST in control  and IC50 dose group was found as 0.0036 and 0.0028 in PC 3 cell line and 0.00026 and 0.00022 in V CAP cell line. The transcriptional repression of CoREST was decreased by 51.74% and 36.16% and gene expression was decreased by 79.3% and 84.90% in PC 3 and V CAP cell lines.The HDAC inhibitor effect of Sulforaphane may depend on the decrease of the CoREST gene expression in PC 3 and V CAP cells, and additional studies with a wide range of cell lines are needed to evaluate this compound as a new approach for the treatment of prostate cancer.Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 356P11.040 Molecular Profiling of Human Sporadic Craniosynostosis C.

Craniosynostoses (CRS), the premature fusion of cranial sutures, are the more prevalent human craniofacial malformation, often associated to brain abnormalities, mental retardation and relevant morbidity. The molecular pathogenesis of CRS is still largely unknown. This study attempted to clarify the molecular mechanisms underlying  the premature ossification of calvarial sutures. Ten sporadic non syndromic CRS patients were enrolled in the study upon obtaining informed consent and excluding known mutations in the FGFRs and TWIST genes. Calvarial cells (CC) were isolated from prematurely fused and normal unfused suture surgical specimens. CC displayed a homogenous mesenchymal IP (CD29+,CD44 +,CD105 +,CD73 +,CD34 . CC morphological features and in vitro osteogenic potential, along with the expression of osteospecific genes was analyzed comparatively in fused and unfused suture samples. CC isolated from  pathological sutures showed a premature osteogenic commitment along with the augmented expression of upstream osteogenic genes (LMP, RUNX2, NELL 1 and OC). Moreover, genome wide expression profiling was performed at the exon level using microarray analysis on total RNA isolated from matched suture specimens of each patient. Up regulated genes included ADAM21, involved in cell cell/cell matrix interactions during tissue development; CLCF1, a potent neurotrophic factor implicated in structural head and spine abnormalities. Interestingly, FGFR1, FGFR2, FGFR3 and TWIST1 were among significantly alternatively spliced genes. This suggested that possible post transcriptional regulation of gene expression occurring at the somatic level could be one possible pathogenic mechanism in sporadic CRS. The identification of genes, whose function is impaired at the  somatic level in CRS, would help the future development of targeted molecular therapy.",2011
 Identification of cRSS with close structural similarity to RSS of i g and tc R genes in the human genome,P11.041,"A. Y. Gubsky1, V. G. Zinkovsky2",1Odessa National I,"I. Mechnikov University, Odessa, Ukraine, 2University of  Opole, Opole, Poland. Cryptic recombination signal sequences (cRSS) are motives that  potentially can mediate instability of mammalian genome, when V(D)J recombination system gets out of control. It is known that there are a lot of cRSS in the human genome outside the Ig and TCR loci. However, at present no information is available about origin, quantity  and genomic location of cRSS with close structural similarity to RSS of functional V, D, J segments of Ig and TCR genes (fRSS).Using specially developed program algorithms we found that there are 580 cRSS in the human genome (Build 37.1), which have close structural similarity to fRSS. Only 67 of these cRSS were found in duplicated V, D segments of Ig and TCR genes. Appearance of 32 % cRSS in the genome may be explained by random nucleotide combinations. We observed that 27, 14, 3, 3 and about 1 % cRSS are structural elements of non LTR retrotransposons (AluJb, L1MDa,  etc.), endogenous retroviruses and LTR retrotransposons (ERVL E int, MER65B, etc.), simple repeats ((CA)n, (CAGA)n, etc.), DNA transposons (Charlie25, MER5B, etc.) and other repeats respectively. In 85 % cases the nucleotide sequences of motives are fully localized inside repeats. 195 (34 %) cRSS were found in 189 (0,8 %) protein coding genes (GRIP1, PDE8A, etc.).Our study shows that cRSS with close structural similarity to fRSS can be found in many human protein coding genes. Their appearance in the human genome can be explained by duplications of Ig and TCR gene fragments, spread of repeats and random nucleotide combinations.",2011

The CT47 cancer testis antigen array on human Xq24 consists of 4.8kb large units and the CT47 gene encoded in each unit is expressed in testis and in certain types of cancer, but  not in non malignant somatic tissue. We studied CT47 for possible correlations between copy number variation, epigenetic regulation and transcriptional activity in normal and malignant cells. In lymphoblastoid cell lines and in primary fibroblasts CT47 transcripts were absent, corroborating the observed heterochromatic structure and DNA hypermethylation of the CT47 promoter. Heterochromatinization of CT47 occurs early in human embryonic stem cells showing high levels of DNA methylation and repressive chromatin modifications in the absence of CT47 expression. In small cell lung carcinoma cell lines  showing low levels of CT47 transcripts we observed reduced levels of H3K9me3 and H3K27me3 without increase in euchromatic histone modifications. DNA methylation levels in the CT47 promoter region are also significantly reduced in these cells. Apparently during oncogenic transformation there is a relative loss of repressive markers resulting in leaky expression of CT47. Comparing the epigenetic regulation of CT47 with other published MSR like the autosomal MSRs TAF11 Like, PRR20, ZAV and D4Z4 which is involved in facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, a model emerges in which some MSR seem to be governed by common regulatory mechanisms with their abundant expression mostly being restricted to the germ line.",2011

 Assessing DNA copy numbers in large scale studies using genomic arrays,P11.044,I. Ruczinski,"Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore, MD, United States","Oligonucleotide based arrays are commonly used to assess genotype phenotype association on a genomic scale, and studies involving DNA copy numbers are becoming more common. While genotyping algorithms are largely concordant when for example assessed on HapMap samples, methods to assess DNA copy number alterations  often yield discordant results. One explanation for the discordance is that DNA copy number estimates are particularly susceptible to systematic differences that arise across batches of samples that were processed at different times or by different labs. Analysis algorithms that do not account for such systematic biases are more prone to spurious findings that will not replicate in other studies. This presentation describes statistical methods and software for the locus level estimation of DNA copy number that specifically adjust for batch effects. We illustrate a workflow for copy number analysis using  HapMap Phase 3 data, including normalization, genotyping, adjusting for batch effects in copy number estimation, visualizations to inform downstream processing, and smoothing point estimates as a function of physical position via segmentation and hidden Markov models.

Using cells from ICF (Immunodeficiency, Centromeric instability and Facial anomalies) patients, we investigated how a DNA methylation defect  affects DNA replication in human cells. ICF is a rare autosomal recessive disorder resulting from impairment of the DNMT3B protein, a de novo DNA methylating enzyme. ICF patients suffer from a severe immunodeficiency and are characterized by loss of DNA methylation in repetitive sequences and decondensation of constitutive heterochromatin and chromosome instability. Previously, we showed that heterochromatic genes undergo hypomethylation and escape silencing in ICF cells. DNA hypomethylation was generalized to all the heterochromatic genes and to all the ICF cell  lines, whereas gene expression was restricted to some genes, every patient having his own group of activated genes. Herein, we showed that heterochromatic genes replicate earlier in the S phase in ICF compared to control cell lines. The change in the replication timing was not correlated with gene activation. Next, to investigate further the effect of DNA hypomethylation on DNA replication, we measured fork speed by molecular combing and S phase length by flow cytometry. Replication fork speed was higher and the S phase was shorter in ICF cells suggesting that the alteration of DNA replication is not restricted to heterochromatin but is generalized to the whole genome.

The main DNA damage caused by ultraviolet radiation  (UV) are base changes that cause bending of DNA molecules. They include cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, pyrimidine (6 4) pyrimidone photoproducts and its Dewar isomers. Two dimensional electrophoresis, a method that can separate bent DNA from normal  DNA, was used to analyse DNA lesions in complex DNA samples and cell cultures after UV radiation.Methods. Human genomic DNA was digested with MboI and radiated with UVB (312 nm, 5 30 J/cm2) in a droplet on a Petri dish. HeLa cell culture was radiated with UVB (15 45 J/cm2), the DNA isolated and digested with MboI. The samples were analysed using Two Dimensional Strandness Dependent Electrophoresis (2D SDE) and Two Dimensional Conformation Dependent Electrophoresis (2D CDE). AvaI digested lambda DNA was UVA radiated (44 J/cm2)  and analyzed in the same manner.Results. DNA induced by UVB migrated in front of normal DNA on 2D CDE gel, due to bending caused by the DNA lesions. UVA radiation of lambda DNA also caused migration of DNA in front of normal DNA with 2D SDE. Surprisingly, 2D SDE analysis of DNA radiated with UVB revealed formation of a DNA arc behind normal DNA. The ratio of this arc increased with increased UVB dosage up to 43%. The same effect was detected in DNA from UVB induced cell culture.Conclusions. 2D SDE and 2D CDE can be used to assess DNA lesions associated with UV radiation. The DNA arc caused by UVB radiation may be explained by cross links or formation of A helix DNA due to either base lesions or deoxyribose oxidation to ribose.",2011

Given its collaborative nature, LUPA has leveraged on a network of veterinarians for diagnosis and sample collection, a centralized high throughput genotyping facility, and geneticists and computational biologists for data analyses. Since 2008, with ~10,000 samples genotyped, a number of associated loci have been identified for various diseases, including a region on CFA 5 for cardiovascular, DLA class II alleles for immunological and CCDC39  for respiratory  disorders.

Hundreds of genetic diseases have been identified in dogs, many of which are similar to human diseases and are likely to have a similar genetic background. CNVs are expected to play a role in several disease conditions in dogs and contribute to breed specific characters. This study aims to map and catalogue CNVs in 50 dogs from 17 breeds (2 10 dogs/breed) and 3 wolves by comparative genome hybridization (aCGH) using Nimblegenâs arrays with 2.1 million probes giving a high resolution of approximately 1 kb  median probe spacing across the canine genome. This density gives considerably higher resolution than previously published studies. A Finnish Boxer DNA was used as a reference for other breeds. The results of this high resolution analysis of the CNVs in a large number of breeds provide important discoveries likely to contribute to several phenotypes in dogs and are being followed up in many cohorts available in the European canine genomics effort, LUPA consortium.

The transcription factor MEIS1 marks a megakaryocyte specific alternative promoter of the DN m 3 locus at the position of a GWA s sequence variant for platelet volume,P11.050,S. NÃ¼rnberg,"University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","We recently identified 12 quantitative trait loci for mean platelet volume  and three for platelets count by a Genome Wide Association Study (GWAS). One of the association single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), rs10914144, lies in intron 2 of the DNM3 gene on chromosome 1q24.3. We set out to elucidate the mechanism by which sequence variation in the DNM3 locus exerts its effect on platelet volume.First we reproduced the GWAS association in platelets from two groups of 19 healthy individuals each, who were homozygous for the major and minor alleles of the association SNP (P<0.05, unpaired t test). We then measured DNM3 transcript abundance and observed significant differences between the groups. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) with massive parallel sequencing for the MK specific transcription factor MEIS1 in the MK like cell line CHRF  288 11 identified four MEIS1 binding sites within the DNM3 locus. One site in intron 2 of DNM3 harbours a SNP (rs2038479) 10,600 bp downstream of the original association SNP, with which it is in strong linkage disequilibrium (r2,0.941). Sequencing of MK mRNA and 5â RACE identified a novel, alternative DNM3 transcript that lacks the first two exons and instead contains a novel exon, named 2B, which is located in intron 2. Real time qPCR analysis demonstrated that in MKs transcript 2B is predominant whilst being virtually absent from neuronal cells. Promoter studies identified an alternative promoter upstream of exon 2B which is only active in MKs but not in neuronal cells. Studies are currently underway to assess DNM3 protein function in megakaryopoiesis and platelet formation.",2011

The loss of E cadherin expression, and consequently of cellular adhesion, is a key event in this phenomena. Cancerous cells undergoing EMT, exhibit a mesenchymal like phenotype with  concomitant polarity loss, increased invasibility and apoptosis resistance, enabling metastization. Many proteins have been proved to induce EMT and others to be modulated by EMT, but nothing has been explores in terms of intronic transcription modulation during this process.To better understand the role of intronic based transcription during EMT, we have reproduced this process in vitro by treating a normal mouse mammary cell line with TGF Î²1. DNAse treated RNA extracted at distinct EMT timepoints was then subjected to RNA sequencing.  We confirmed the occurrence of EMT via analysis of the differential transcription of epithelial and mesenchymal markers and the activation of the TGF beta pathway underlying EMT. Moreover, we were able to identify both differential and constantly transcriptionally active intronic areas within cadherin genes, which putatively underlie novel cis regulatory elements. In addition we have detected a differential rate of transcription from within introns and exons of both CDH1 and CDH2 genes, both hallmarks of epithelial and mesenchymal states of EMT.These observations point out a specific role for CDH1 and CDH2 intronic transcription in EMT.",2011

Epigenetic alterations like, in particular, methylation  changes in some imprinted genes may play a role in the teratogenic effects of alcohol. The aim of our study was to evaluate the possible effects of alcohol administration in pregnant mice on the methylation pattern of 5 imprinted genes (H19, Gtl2, Peg1, Snrpn and Peg3)  in the tail, liver, skeletal muscle, hippocampus and sperm DNAs of the male offspring over 2 generations. The effect observed on the imprinted genes was a small (3 %) but highly significant decrease in the number of methylated CpGs of H19, in the F1 generation. The effect disappeared in the F2 generation. The prenatal exposure also induced a decrease (26%) in the mean sperm concentration of the F1 that was not detected anymore in the F2 offspring. The CpGs of the H19 CTCF binding site 2, were analyzed. A correct methylation of H19 CTCF binding sites is indeed known to be important for the production  of mitogen factors controlling fetal growth. The 1 st, 2nd and 6th CpGs  exhibited significant methylation percentage losses in alcohol exposed  offspring as compared to the same positions in control mice whereas the 3 th, 4th and 5th CpG methylation patterns were unaffected. A link can  be hypothesized between the hypomethylation of a fraction of the H19 CpGs and the decreased spermatogenesis observed in the alcohol administered female offspring.",2011

Skryabin, I. N. Lebedev","Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation","Initiation of tissue specific differentiation in the early ontogeny is  considered as a result of global epigenetic modifications. Studies in model mammals have shown a clear difference in the DNA methylation level between embryonic ectoderm and mesoderm in comparison with primitive endoderm and trophoblast. However, there  is sparse information about the mode of epigenetic reprogramming during human development because of tissues unavailability after implantation. The first accessible samples can be obtained from early miscarriages only. We have performed genome wide DNA methylation analysis of the cytotrophoblast (CT) and extraembryonic mesoderm (EM) from 2 induced abortions, 5 miscarriages with normal karyotype and 6 spontaneous abortions with diploid aneuploid mosaicism using HumanMethylation27 BeadChip (Illumina, USA) covering 27,578 CpG sites of 14,495 genes. All samples regardless the karyotype  and developmental results were clearly separated by two clusters specific to the studied tissues. This finding can be explained by higher methylation of CpG sites in EM (16,450) vs. CT (10,138). Differentially methylated CpGs were observed in 4,898 genes (FDR<0.01, P<0.01). To determine the biological relevance of these genes a Gene Set Enrichment Analysis using hypergeometric testing for KEGG pathways and Gene Ontology categories was performed. The selected genes were related to cytokine cytokine receptor interactions (120 genes, P,0.0003), neuroactive ligand receptor interactions (116 genes, P,0.0005), cell cell signaling  (275 genes, P,0.0002), cellular  homeostasis  (275 genes, P<0.0001), and others.

In adipose tissue, basal  transcription is in part driven by promoter I.4. We sought to determine whether methylation of CpG sites within this region is associated with aromatase RNA expression. Methods: Omental and subcutaneous adipose tissue samples were  taken from 31 obese subjects undergoing bariatric surgery. DNA and RNA were extracted from purified mature adipocytes. Methylation status of CpG sites was determined using quantitative pyrosequencing (QIAGEN Pyromark Q24 at  350 (I.4.1) and  316 (I.4.2) bases  upstream of the transcription start site (TSS) of promoter I.4 and +152 (I.4.3) bases downstream of the TSS within an SP1 binding site. Total aromatase expression was determined using qRT PCR, with primers binding to the coding region.Results: There were no differences in methylation at I.4.1 and I.4.3 in either omental or subcutaneous tissue with mean values between 75.8% and 79.2% (range 2.0   98.0%). I.4.2 methylation was significantly lower with mean values between 21.9% and 36.8% (range 3.0   96.0%).

The study of discordant MZ twins is an attractive model to investigate epigenetic mechanisms in disease. Discordance in this context can be interpreted as a result of external factors that shape the epigenetic profile and thereby the susceptibility for disease through altered gene expression. We isolated different lymphocyte subpopulations and studied single cell types (CD4+ and CD8+) to overcome the issue of epigenetic heterogeneity in whole blood. In order to detect gene specific DNA methylation differences, we used the 27K Infinium methylation  assay (Illumina). To integrate the analysis of global methylation status and gene expression of approximately all associated genes we used HumanHT gene expression assays (Illumina). Analysis of these data identified genes where differences in DNA methylation between twins were correlated with gene expression in CD4+ cells, thus identification of genes where DNA methylation has a functional role in development of psoriasis. We also present preliminary data on genome wide DNA methylation (RRBS) and ChIP.To our knowledge this is the first study using MZ twins discordant for psoriasis in order to reveal epigenetic alterations which potentially contributes to the development of disease.",2011

The incidence of these conditions varies from 1:30,000 for BE, 1:100,000 for epispadias, to 1:300,000 for CE. Although rare,  treatment for these birth defects requires numerous surgeries over the first years of life that can be traumatic and costly. The majority of cases are sporadic, nonsyndromic, with a normal karyotype, and unknown etiology. Although most genetic studies failed to identify specific genes defects that underlie the disorder, there is evidence of strong genetic component. We used array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) to find submicroscopic regions of chromosome gains or losses in BEEC.

However, it is unclear how often sample mix ups occur in genome wide studies, as there are no post hoc methods that can identify these mix ups in unrelated samples. We have therefore developed an algorithm (MixupMapper) that can both detect and correct sample mix ups in genome wide studies by looking at gene expression levels. Our method utilizes the principle that some genetic variants strongly affect expression phenotypes, permitting us to check for every sample whether its phenotypic measurements correspond to the genetic variants that affect these phenotypes.We show that sample mix ups are common in genome wide studies by applying our method to five publicly available human datasets on the  genetics of gene expression. On average, 3% of all analyzed samples had been assigned incorrect expression phenotypes; in one of the datasets 23% of the samples had incorrect expression phenotypes. The consequences of these sample mix ups are substantial: when we corrected these sample mix ups, we identified on average 15% more significant cis expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). In one dataset, we identified three times as many significant cis eQTLs after correction.Through simulations we show that a low percentage of sample mix ups may lead to an underestimation of the explained heritability of complex traits in genome wide datasets as well. Sample mix ups should therefore call for serious attention in past and future genome wide studies.",2011

In this presentation we discuss three whole exome sequencing strategies for disease gene identification in rare and sporadic disorders where classical genetic approaches do not  apply.1) Rare sporadic disorders lack large pedigrees due to reduced fecundity. For this we hypothesize that de novo mutations in a single gene are the underlying genetic cause. We resolved the genetic cause in two of such disorders (Schinzel Giedion syndrome and Bohring syndrome) by identifying rare coding variants that affect the same gene in multiple patients.2) In case of more frequent (genetically heterogeneous) sporadic disorders, the underlying cause might be attributed to single de novo  mutations in a large mutational target. The amount of patients required to find an overlap however increases exponentially with the amount of disease loci. By sequencing a patient as well as the unaffected parents we identified de novo mutations in 6 out of 10 patients as the potential cause for mental retardation. 3) When dealing with a rare recessive monogenic disorder the identification of the disease gene is intrinsically easier because the search is for two independent events in a single gene. We have shown  for patients with Sensenbrenner syndrome that a single patient and a sufficient amount of control data can suffice to determine the cause of the disease.We conclude that exome sequencing allows robust and unbiased disease gene identification in both rare and common genetic disorders.",2011

We have developed the LIPOchipÂ® tool, a DNA array that detects point  mutations and CNVs simultaneously and has been used to diagnose more than 5,000 index cases. LIPOchipÂ® current versions detect more than 80% of the Spanish, Dutch, Italian and British mutations but, due to the LDLR heterogeneity and the lack of frequency studies, LIPOchipÂ® is not viable worldwide.Two technical approaches have been tested to produce a new, rapid, economic and universal FH genetic diagnosis tool: the Affymetrix resequencing chip and the Next Generation Sequencing Genome  Sequencer Roche GS Junior.

Mutations in 15 genes have been shown to cause FA. Since FA patients require special treatment, and syndromes with overlapping clinical symptoms exist, molecular  diagnosis is required. The current screening approach is neither time  nor cost effective and may miss various aberrations, such as large deletions. Here we evaluate the use of a multiplexed targeted next generation sequencing (NGS) approach in the diagnosis of FA.Methods: We selected samples from 12 FA patients with various hetero /homozygous variations including large deletions and small deletions/insertions. For one sample, only one pathogenic mutation had been found by Sanger sequencing. We used a custom Agilent in solution SureSelect kit to enrich for the known FA genes. The 12  resulting sequence libraries were tagged with a unique barcode and pooled before sequencing 74 cycles paired end in one lane on the Illumina GAIIx platform. An in house variation detection pipeline, including a tool for large deletion detection, was used to score for relevant mutations.Results: An average of 2.8 million unique reads were obtained per sample, resulting in a median coverage of ~100 fold. All disease causing mutations have been detected in our validation panel. In addition, a novel large deletion mutation in an unresolved case has been detected and validated through conventional sequencing.Conclusion: Multiplexed targeted NGS offers a fast and reliable method for moleculardiagnosis, without the need for preselection by complementation  studies.",2011

The aim of this study is to determine the behavior of all FA genes during the cell cycle combined with an in silico  analysis of their promoter elements. We could separate the pathway genes into two groups based on their mRNA expression during the cell cycle and/or response to serum in the human glioblastoma cell line T98G.

The non responsive group consist of the subcomplex  partners of FANCA,  G, of FANCB,  L, of FANCE,  C and  F, and of BRCA2, PALB2. The promoters of each group were analyzed to  identify common transcription factor models with Genomatix. For both groups, models containing homeodomain TF families, known to be involved in development were identified. The responsive genes are furthermore characterized by SP1 and E2F sites in the vicinity of their transcription start sites.The responsive genes contain Nuclear Localization Signals (NLSs) encoding sequences, suggesting that these constitute the driving forces for nuclear import when necessary during DNA replication.",2011

We previously developed several methylation specific and direct triplet primed PCR based assays for analysis of the FMR1 CGG repeat structure and expansion.

Melting peak profiles from 5â anchored and 3â anchored triplet primed PCRs were evaluated. For 3â anchored  triplet primed PCRs, the melt peak profiles or normal and expanded alleles were distinctly different. In contrast, 5â anchored triplet primed PCRs produced similar melting peak morphologies from normal and expanded alleles, although melting peak temperatures from expanded alleles were slightly increased compared with normal alleles. Therefore, 3â anchored triplet primed PCRs are more sensitive compared with 5â anchored triplet primed PCRs in distinguishing normal from expanded alleles by melting curve analysis. This difference likely stems from the position(s) of the AGG interruption(s) in most expanded alleles.

Methylation status was correlated in both cell lines, 55 65% methylated and 75 85% methylated groups in these two analysis.The results indicated the importance of determining individual genetic differences by using both qMS PCR and MS HRM analysis for inactivation of MGMT is indispensible.",2011
 Whole transcriptome expression microarray profiling of cancerous and adjacent normal total RNA,P11.066,"A. Bergstrom Lucas, B. Mullinax, J. Venneri, E. Lin, V. Kulkarni, M. Janis, J.  Ghosh, J. Gao, E. Leproust, S. Fulmer Smentek","Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, United States","Whole transcriptome expression profiling by microarray analysis is an  important tool for classifying tissue and tumor types and understanding biological mechanisms. This profiling measures the alternative splicing of exons from RNA leading to the translation of different proteins. To address the need for whole transcriptome expression profiling we  have developed an exon workflow which includes catalog and custom microarrays, a whole transcript labeling method, and data analysis software. The Low Input Quick Amp Whole Transcriptome Labeling Kit employs a mixture of random nucleotide and oligo dT based T7 promoter primers resulting in high cRNA yields and Cy labeled specific activities from nanogram amounts of RNA. The probes on the SurePrint G3 microarrays were designed from the high quality content of public databases including RefSeq and Ensembl. Exon arrays were analyzed for gene level and exon level expression using GeneSpring  GX 11.5 software, thus enabling whole transcript profile comparisons within two days. Comparisons of technical replicate samples demonstrate high reproducibility with wide dynamic range across a broad range of RNA input. High correlations were also demonstrated in comparisons to orthogonal expression measurement techniques including RNA Seq. The whole transcriptome workflow was used to detect alternative splicing of exons between cancerous and normal cells resulting in gene and exon expression profiles consistent with the current literature. SurePrint G3 microarrays were also used to assess differential expression of non coding RNAs (lincRNAs) in these samples. The combined results demonstrate the value of identifying known exons and showcase the importance of including non coding RNA profiling in cancer research.",2011

" Genomic imprinting of canine MAS1, a component of the renin angiotensin system",P11.068,"C. M. Nolan , S. OâBoyle, R. E. Shiel, J. J. Callanan","University College Dublin, Belfield, Dublin 4, Ireland","Genomic imprinting occurs in mammals and refers to parent of origin  specific epigenetic modifications of genes. The consequence of these modifications is that the two alleles of imprinted genes are differentially expressed. Although few in number, the function of imprinted genes is essential for normal growth and development, and they also regulate  aspects of adult behaviour. Aberrant regulation of imprinted genes contributes to a variety of clinical conditions in humans, including somatic undergrowth and overgrowth, behavioural disorders and cancer.Imprinted genes have mostly been studied in mice and humans. For comparative purposes, and because the dog is now considered an excellent model of human disease, we examined genomic imprinting in the canine. For canine orthologs of three well characterized imprinted genes (IGF2, H19 and IGF2R), we have shown parent of  origin specific effects on expression. Imprinted genes usually occur  in genomic clusters that are co regulated by a common imprint. The MAS1 gene lies upstream of IGF2R in mammals and its imprint status in humans is somewhat controversial. Here we report that canine MAS1 is imprinted, with expression of the maternally derived allele in several fetal tissues and in neonatal umbilical cord. The protein encoded by MAS1 is a component of the renin angiotensin system, a complex regulatory network that is essential for normal human physiology and is altered in several disease states. If MAS1 (or other RAS components)  is imprinted in humans, this could have implications  for human health and disease. We suggest that the imprint status of human MAS1 should be re evaluated.",2011

Most PHP types are caused by defects in GNAS, an imprinted gene locus consisting of maternal, paternal and biallelic transcripts. PHPIb patients have  isolated PTH resistance and GNAS epidefects while PHPIa presents with hormonal resistance and characteristic physical features such as mental problems, brachydactyly, shortness, round face and subcutaneous ossifications, jointly termed as having Albrightâs Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO) due to maternally inherited GNAS mutations. PPHP patients have AHO without hormone resistance and paternally inherited GNAS mutations. This classification of PHP was made years ago but was recently questioned since GNAS epidefects were also identified in PHPIa. Our present study further complicates  this (epi)genotype/phenotype relation as we found for the first time GNAS epidefects in PPHP. We quantified 3 differentially methylated regions in GNAS: NESP (2 regions of 13 and 20 CpGs), XL (24 CpGs) and exon A/B (20 CpGs) methylation via the Sequenom EpiTYPER in 3 PPHP patients with variable degree of AHO (shortness, brachydactyly, behavior problems, round face) but no GNAS coding mutation. These patients showed significant hypermethylation of preferential CpGs in NESP and XL (Z test, p<0,05) and one patient also had significant A/B hypermethylation. This is a novel imprint pattern that has not been described since PHPIb/PHPIa epidefects are characterized by A/B and XL hypomethylation and NESP hypermethylation. Further studies are needed to unravel this novel methylation pattern in relation to an AHO phenotype by including more patients.",2011

To offer this service as widely as possible, it is necessary to develop faster and less expensive methods. New high throughput genotyping technologies give high quality sequence data with quick turnaround  and low cost. We evaluated Roche 454 technology for genetic diagnosis.Sixty four familial breast cancer cases were analyzed by amplicon pyrosequencing and Sanger dideoxy sequencing, plus 14 by pryosequencing only.Pyrosequencing was validated for up to 97 % of amplicons in each of four standard runs of 16 cases, and up to 98 % using Titanium chemistry. A minimum coverage depth of 40 reads was required to validate an amplicon as âanalysedâ. All variants detected by dideoxy  sequencing were also detected by pyrosequencing, including eleven deleterious mutations.Six of the 84 amplicons contained homopolymer tracts in the coding sequence systematically misread by the Amplicon Variant Analysis software. Development of in house software for the reanalysis of homopolymer data showed that most misread sequences were the result of intermediate pyrosequencing signals: histograms of read data aided the analysis considerably and allowed validation of the majority of homopolymers.This pilot study on the BRCA genes indicated that pyrosequencing was as sensitive as dideoxy sequencing, and the effort and cost involved were comparable.

Acetylation of 9th lysine residue in histone H3 (AcH3K9) is an  epigenetic modification of human genome involved in gene regulation  and generally associated with transcriptionally active, or potentially active, chromatin.We aimed at analysis of acetylated histone H3 distribution in metaphase  chromosomes from PHA stimulated fetal cord blood lymphocytes compared to that from adult lymphocytes. Study was performed on 79 metaphases from 3 embryos (20 24 weeks gestation) and 60 metaphases from 5 adults fixed with 2% acetic acid in ethanol.Distribution of AcH3K9 on metaphase chromosomes was studied by indirect immunofluorescence with specific monoclonal antibodies against AcH3K9 (Abcam, USA). Chromosomes were identified by centromeric index and DAPI banding. Immunostaining of metaphase chromosomes revealed regions of different fluorescence intensity,  with most bright fluorescence in R bands and absence of signal in pericentromeric heterochromatin.Signal distribution in chromosomes from fetal lymphocytes demonstrated difference in fluorescence intensity between homologous chromosomes in bands 1p36.3, 2p23, 2q33, 10p11.2, 11p15. These differences may be determined by genomic imprinting.Five bands   5p13, 5p15, 9q13,16p13,18p11.32   showed differences in AcH3K9 level between fetal and adult chromosomes. Bands 5p13, 5p15and16p13 were hypoacetylated; bands 9q13and18p11.32 demonstrated higher acetylation level in fetuses compared to adults.Thus, pattern of AcH3K9 distribution along metaphase chromosomes of both fetal and adult lymphocytes corresponds to a band specific manner, resembling R banding. Differences in AcH3K9 of some bands  between fetal homologous chromosomes as well as between fetal and adult chromosomes might be attributed to stage specific epigenetic patterns in the same cell types of humans.Supported by RFBR and S.C.02.740.11.0698.",2011

Substantial progress has recently been  made in this field, however the exact mechanism remains elusive. Using a combination of clinical research coupled with basic research using state of the art technologies generated data and knowledge that addresses parts of this intricate mechanism. A unique and large Maltese family with elevated levels of HbF was identified through the National Screening Program conducted in Malta. An extensive molecular study revealed a novel mutation in the human EKLF/KLF1 transcription factor that was responsible for an overall dominant HbF increase in this family from Malta. Gene expression array analysis  delivered a list of KLF1 target genes that might also be implicated in the globin biosynthesis pathway. The same study showed how BCL11A is developmentally regulated by KLF1 and that diminished levels of BCL11A as a result of KLF1 haploinsufficiency resulted in higher HbF levels. A different Maltese family carrying the same mutations has recently been identified, but these individuals displayed much lower foetal haemoglobin levels. This suggested the presence of modifier genes strongly affecting the Hereditary Persistence of Foetal Haemoglobin (HPFH) phenotype in conjunction with the KLF1 mutations and therefore we device methods at the genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic levels to identify these modifier genes acting in conjuction with KLF1.",2011

Immunodeficiency, centromeric instability and facial anomalies  syndrome (ICF; MIM 242860) is an autosomal recessive immune disorder that is characterized by recurrent, often fatal, respiratory and gastrointestinal infections due to greatly reduced serum immunoglobulin levels. About 50% of ICF patients (ICF1) carry mutations in the DNA  methyltransferase 3B (DNMT3B) gene rendering specific repetitive DNA sequences in their genome hypomethylated. The remaining patients carry unknown genetic defects (ICF2), but share with ICF1 patients similar immunological and epigenetic features including hypomethylation of juxtacentromeric heterochromatin regions. By homozygosity mapping and whole exome sequencing we identified nonsense mutations in the zinc finger and BTB domain containing 24 (ZBTB24) gene in four consanguineous ICF2 patients, in an affected sibling pair and in one patient of whom consanguineous descent was  unknown.ZBTB24 belongs to a large family of transcriptional repressors including members with regulatory roles in hematopoietic development and malignancy. By the combinatorial use of FACS analysis and quantitative RT PCR we demonstrated that ZBTB24 is ubiquitously expressed in human tissues and cell lines and that the highest ZBTB24 mRNA levels are observed in human peripheral blood B cell subpopulations, especially in naive B cells. Altogether this argues that ZBTB24 is not only involved in the methylation of juxtacentromeric heterochromatic regions, but that it also regulates the development and/or differentiation of B cells.",2011
 i mplicit conceptual links in the literature: a large untapped reservoir of gene discovery,P11.083,H. van Haagen,"LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands","The published literature and bioinformatic data are growing faster than  individual researchers can track. Text  and data mining tools have been developed to retrieve explicit links between pairs of concepts (e.g. genes and disease). However, in addition to explicit links, text also contains a complex network of indirect (implied) links containing  useful information. We applied concept profiling to probe this vast network of implied information. In a retrospective analysis of 18 gene disease relationships, implicit information alone could prioritize the causative gene on average within the top 13 out of 200 genes located in a specified linkage interval, at least one year before publication of the landmark paper. The concepts shared between gene and disease enabled the evaluation of the plausibility of the inferred relationship. Of the 40,404,412 possible gene disease pairs, 120,246 (47%, p < 0.003) arose exclusively from implicit relations.

Typically, the progressive symptoms developed after upper tract infection in a child  with normal developmental milestones until 9 18 months.In this study, next generation  sequencing together with homozygosity  mapping identified the disease causing mutation in effected individuals in a Turkish family with spinocerebellar ataxia. Homozygous missense mutation c.1366C>G (L456V) in C10orf2  gene encoding  the Twinkle protein was identified as the disease causing mutation. The open reading frame of C10orf2  spans five exons and encodes  684 amino acids Twinkle protein, which is a helicase responsible for the replication and maintenance of mitochondrial DNA in mammalian  cells. While recessive mutations in the C10orf2 gene result in IOSCA  and hepatocellular encephalopathy syndrome accompanied by mitochondrial depletion, autosomal dominant mutations in the gene cause autosomal dominant progressive external ophthalmoplegia (adPEO) mainly manifesting itself in adulthood.Pathogenic effect of this amino acid change (L456V) was supported by several lines of evidence. Firstly, c.1366C>G nucleotide change was not detected in 150 Turkish individuals and has not been reported in dbSNP. Secondly, the ClustalW alignment of the amino acid sequence indicated that L456V homozygous missense mutation was at highly conserved position in C10orf2  shown by comparison to the  corresponding sequence of six vertabrates.

It can be caused by either submicroscopic deletions of 9qter or intragenic loss of function mutations in the EHMT1 gene. Until now, routine DNA diagnostic  testing for Kleefstra syndrome comprised direct sequencing and  MLPA (Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification) analysis of the coding region of transcript NM_024757.3. Remarkably, in three patients with a clinical suspicion of Kleefstra syndrome, molecular cytogenetic analysis revealed a submicroscopic interstitial 9q deletion proximal to this transcript. Furthermore, by RT PCR of the transcript in two of these patients, we found mono allelic expression of EHMT1.in agreement with haploinsuffciency of the gene. We therefore hypothesized that a deletion of regulatory elements or so far unknown coding sequences in the 5â region of the EHMT1 gene might result in  a phenotype compatible with Kleefstra syndrome. Based on in silico   data, it appeared that the N terminus of the EHMT1 gene was recently  updated with an extra exon, and that the first untranslated exon of the old transcript is now coding exon 2 (NM_024757.4).

Current knowledge regarding myocardial expression of Lamin A/C protein and quantitative expression of mutated LMNA in myocardium and  peripheral blood is very limited. If significant differences in quantitative expression profile exist amongst DCM patients with mutated LMNA  (DCM LMNA Mut), DCM patients with wild type LMNA (DCM LMNA  WT), and normal control individuals (CTRL), this could be important in diagnostic work up of cardiolaminopathies.Methods: We performed immunohistochemistry on myocardial samples from 25 DCM LMNA Mut patients and on endomyocardial biopsies from 20 normal donor hearts, with anti Lamin A/C antibodies. Mutated LMNA mRNA levels in 20 myocardial and 67 blood samples  from DCM LMNA Mut patients were determined. We examined wild  type LMNA mRNA levels in 20 myocardial and 96 blood samples  from DCM LMNA WT patients, and 115 blood samples from CTRL individuals.Results: Myocardial samples from DCM LMNA Mut patients have variable loss of protein expression at the nuclear membrane of cardiac myocytes versus DCM LMNA WT and CTRL samples. LMNA was  significantly under expressed in myocardial samples from DCM LMNA Mut versus DCM LMNA WT patients. In mRNA from peripheral blood, LMNA was significantly under expressed in   DCM LMNA Mut versus  DCM LMNA WT and CTRL individuals, with most under expression in splice site, out of frame and premature termination codon mutations, followed by missense and in frame insertion/deletion mutations.   Conclusions: Loss of protein expression of myocyte nuclei, and  decreased gene expression in myocardial and peripheral blood mRNA of DCM LMNA Mut patients, reveal that immunohistochemistry and gene expression could supplement diagnostic work up for cardiolaminopathies.",2011
 Genotype instability observed in the long term subculture of L c L samples,P11.089,"J. OH, Y. Kim, J. Lee, Y.

Although peripheral blood mononuclear (PBMC) is a major resource to collect genomic DNA for genotyping, the Epstein Barr  Virus (EBV) transformed lymphoblastoid cell line (LCL) is a promising alternative choice to overcome the insufficiency of PBMC. To gain insight into the fidelity of SNP array genotyping in using DNA extracted from LCL, we tested genotype stability of LCL at different propagation stages in terms of cell passages. We genotyped PBMC and LCLs of 20 different individuals using Affymetrix SNP 500k genotyping chips. Six LCL samples for each individual were generated from long term subcultures up to a passage number of 160. We extensively monitored the genotype concordance for overall SNPs by comparing identity  by state (IBS) between PMBC and LCL at each propagation stage, by which we were able to profile mismatch rate by chromosome at different propagation stages. Although little difference in genotypes Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 368between PBMC and LCL samples has been reported previously,  this study detects slightly decreased concordance between PBMC and LCL samples in old passages. These results suggest that DNA isolated from old passage LCL samples (older than passage number 41) should be avoided for microarray based genotyping.",2011

This study used diverse HRM methods to compare three HRM capable platforms. m ethods: A suite of assays highlighting different HRM techniques,  mutation scanning, small amplicon genotyping (SAG) and unlabeled  probe genotyping, were optimized on three HRM platforms: the LightScanner Â® (Idaho Technology, Inc.) / Eppendorf MasterCycler  Realplex2 (Eppendorf), the LightCyclerÂ® 480 (Roche), and the 7500  Fast DX (ABI). The assays used LightScanner mastermix and High  Sensitivity mastermix that include the double stranded DNA dye LCGreen Â®Plus (Idaho Technology, Inc.). Results: All platforms were able to differentiate the mutations in  the LIPC (Scanning) and Human THO1 (SAG) assays and detected down to 10% allele fractions in the ADH4 (LunaProbe) assay. All three platforms were able to distinguish between heterozygous and  homozygous samples in the CPS1 (SAG) class 4 SNP assay. The LightScanner was also able to differentiate the two homozygous samples. The LightScanner correctly grouped all three genotypes of the OTC class 4 SNP (LunaProbe) assay while the other instruments could not group the heterozygous samples.

LMX1B protein is a member of the LIM homeodomain family of  transcription factors, containing two zinc finger LIM domains and a homeodomain. It is encoded by LMX1B gene (MIM 602575), responsible for Nail patella syndrome (NPS, MIM#161200), a rare autosomal dominant disorder characterized by a classic clinical tetrad  of changes in the nails, knees, elbows, iliac horns and in 40% of cases renal involvement.A major problem in studying the human LMX1B gene is its scarce or null expression in adult tissues. We were able to detect expression of LMX1B in the cells of hair follicle and urine cells pelleted.Our previous work demonstrated the presence of two isoforms of LMX1B, differing for seven aminoacids, due to alternative splicing in exon 7. Here we present analysis of different cell types in human and mouse, showing difference of expression of the two isoforms, that  could be due to cell specific difference in the mecchanism of splicing and could reflect their differential functional roles. In order to investigate on the biological role of isoforms, we have  investigated difference in cellular localization and evaluated their effect on regulation of trasciptional activity by measure of the luciferase reporter gene, controlled by regulatory sequences of different LMX1B putative target genes, like Podocin, WNT4, PXO2A, PHOX2B, and ACVR1 that we have chosen considering the role of LMX1B in development of  kidney, some districts of the central nervous system, and limb.

Because of their highly polymorphic nature, MSR represent an extreme example of copy number variation, but their structure and function is largely understudied. This study comprises  the genetic analysis of six autosomal and two X chromosomal MSR of HapMap individuals representing Caucasian, Asian and African populations. Tandem repeat copy number variation and stability of the autosomal macrosatellite repeats RS447 (chromosome 4p), MSR5p (5p), FLJ40296 (13q), RNU2 (17q) and D4Z4 (4q and 10q) and X chromosomal CT47 and DXZ4 were investigated. Repeat array size distributions show that these MSR are highly polymorphic with the highest genetic variation among Africans and the least genetic variation among Asians. A mitotic mutation rate of 0.4 1.5%  was observed, explaining the high size variability found for MSR. Multimodal distribution patterns show that MSR are organized in a higher order structure. This study extends our knowledge about MSR  regarding array size variation and behavior at the population level. Considering that MSR are large repeat arrays, highly polymorphic and can cover large regions of the genome, it is imperative to get a better understanding of their structure and function. Indeed, this extreme form of copy number variation may well explain some of the missing heritability observed in genome wide association studies.",2011

We have developed an efficient experimental and bioinformatics platform to systematically analyze de novo and inherited structural variation by using genome wide long mate pair sequencing in  families, which include offspring with severe congenital abnormalities. The resolution for detection of structural variation allows reconstruction of chromosomal rearrangements at nucleotide precision. We identified and characterized simple de novo structural changes as well as complex series of inter  and intra chromosomal rearrangements consisting of multiple breakpoints involving different chromosomes. Detailed inspection of breakpoint regions for complex rearrangements indicated that in some cases series of simultaneous double stranded DNA breaks caused local shattering of chromosomes. Fusion of the  resulting chromosomal fragments involved non homologous end joining since junctions displayed limited or no sequence homology and small insertions and deletions. The pattern of random joining of shattered chromosomal fragments that we observed for some de novo rearrangements, strongly resembles the somatic rearrangement patterns   termed chromothripsis   that have recently been described in deranged cancer cells.

Their common clinical features include developmental delay with delayed or absent speech and micro  and/or brachycephaly.In patients 1 through 3, de novo deletions of 1.76 Mb, 1.3 Mb, and  2.8 Mb, respectively, in 9q33.3 q34.11 have been detected. Patient 4 has a maternally inherited deletion of ~432 kb spanning 9q33.3. Her mother is reported to have mild intellectual disability.The smallest region of overlap of the deletions is defined by the deletion of patient 4 and her mother and includes only three RefSeq genes. Interestingly, the three larger deletions in patients 1, 2, and 3 have 27 genes in common including STXBP1, which is predominantly expressed in brain and plays a role in synaptic transmission. STXBP1 loss of function mutations and deletions have been associated  with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy (EIEE, or Ohtahara syndrome), and were identified in patients with intellectual disability and non syndromic epilepsy. Neither patient 1 nor 2 presented with seizures, although an EEG of patient 2 gave pathological results. Thus, the seizure phenotype appears to be incompletely penetrant. Notably, patient 4 presented with epilepsy, although her deletion excludes STXBP1. Thus, the involvement of STXBP1 and/or possibly other genes due to deletion of long range regulatory elements cannot be ruled out.We suggest that deletions of this region on chromosome 9q may cause epilepsy of incomplete penetrance and a clinical spectrum including developmental delay concerning especially speech, micro  and / or brachycephaly, and mild dysmorphisms.",2011

We report the implementation in clinical routine of a custom genome wide high resolution oligonucleotide aCGH platform, previously validated (KaryoArrayÂ® v3.0), for the study of patients  with psychomotor development delay and/or mild to severe mental retardation. m ethods: A prospective study of 100 strictly selected patients with  psychomotor development delay and/or deficit cognitive were carried  out. Patients with one or more of the following associated findings: structural defects (heart, kidney); facial dysmorphic features; hypo/over growth disorders; macro/microcephaly; family history of mental retardation. In addition these patients had: karyotype, molecular study  of FRAXA and MLPA of subtelomere regions and recurrent genomic disorders done previously, with normal results. To end this, we selected 60 mer oligonucleotide features from Agilentâs eArray_v4.0 probe library in a custom format of 8x60K (KaryoArrayÂ®), covering more than 350 microdeleciÃ³n/microduplicaciÃ³n syndromes, as well as telomeric/centromeric regions with a resolution from 1 kb in the regions Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 370of interest, with an average density of 7 Kb.

In mammalian cells methylation is catalysed by DNA methyltransferase and covalent binding of the methyl group to cytidine is most common. Usually it is the cytosine residue situated 5â in relation to guanosine in  CpG dinucleotides that undergoes methylation. Methylation appears also in mitochondrial genome. Due to unique twin genetics, group of twins has been studied as an ideal subject for observations of epigenetic changes. Still, so far no wide range analysis of mtDNA in twins has been reported. In this study the analysis of mitochondrial DNA D loop in group of newborn twins was performed. Level of DNA methylation in collected samples was estimated using sodium bisulphite assay which leads to a change of 5mC>C and C>U, followed by a PCR reaction and pyrosequencing using PyroQ CpGT software. Using this approach  quantitative analysis was possible and revealed differences in DNA methylation of CpG in mtDNA D loop. Different levels of methylation were observed within dizygotic and also monozygotic twins pairs and seems to be related to heteroplasmy of mitochondrial genome. In most cases methylation was not observed.This work was supported by the grant N N303 457238 from the Ministry of Science and Higher Educatio",2011
 ms s NuPE as a diagnostic tool for the detection of aberrant methylation patterns in growth retarded patients,P11.099,"M. Begemann, I. Leisten, T. Eggermann, S. Spengler","Institute of Human Genetics, RWTH University Hospital Aachen, Aachen, Germany","In the last decade the crucial role of imprinted genes in human growth  and development has become evident. A number of diseases have been found to be directly linked to aberrant methylation of specific loci including Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM).  A considerable fraction of SRS, BWS and TNDM patients shows aberrant methylation at other than the disease specific loci (multilocus methylation defects   MLMD). To identify epigenetic changes a number of methods have been described. MS MLPA and MS PCR as well as MS pyrosequencing and bisulfite sequencing are meanwhile well established methods. However, they are either time consuming and/or labor intensive or complex to establish. It is therefore necessary to have simply adjustable assays to analyze different loci with the possibility of direct quantification in single tube reaction formats available.  Based on the AB PrismÂ® SNaPhot technology we established MS SNuPE (methylation specific single nucleotide primer extension) approaches to analyze the methylation status of several imprinted loci and to elucidate applicability of MS SNuPE in research and routine diagnostic. We chose the loci of GRB10, MEST, IGF2R, H19, LIT1, DLK1/GTL2 (chromosomes 6, 7, 11, 14) because methylation of these differentially methylated regions is frequently disturbed in MLMD. The method was validated by screening a cohort of probands with (epi)genetic disturbances identified in previous analyses by other  techniques. In all cases, the aberrant methylation was confirmed by the newly developed MS SNuPE approaches.",2011

After MI, innate immunity is activated leading to an acute inflammatory reaction. An intensive inflammatory reaction might contribute to the  development of ventricular rupture (VR), as well as some microRNAs have influence on the innate immune response. Based on this knowledge, we further analyzed microRNAs in MI patients with and without VR. There were 60 patients with MI and 10 healthy adults. Using microarrays, microRNAs expression was analyzed on human MI compared to healthy adult hearts. Results were validated using qPCR. MicroRNAs target prediction was performed in silico  (TargetScan,  miRanda), and further subjected to functional classification (DAVID). Of 719 microRNAs analyzed, 57 were confidently dysregulated; many  of them were not previously related to cardiovascular disease. For 5 microRNAs 37 target genes were predicted, some of them have been already shown to be involved in microRNAs network. qPCR analysis confirmed dysregulation of miR 150, miR 186, miR 210, miR 451 ,  miR 34a, miR 146a, miR 155, miR 1, miR 133a/b, and miR 208 .

However, little is known about the changes of miRNA expression before and after adulthood. The aim of the study is to investigate whether there are differential expression in miRNAs between infants and adults, and then  explore the possible biological functions of these miRNAs. We profiled the expression of 365 miRNAs in peripheral blood mononuclear cells from preterm infants (n,30) and adults (n,60, age ranging from 21 to 60) using real time RT PCR analysis. This genome wide assessment of miRNA expression revealed that the majority of differentially expressed miRNAs increased in adults. Among 365 miRNAs, 228 (62.5%) were detectable in the more than half of the peripheral mononuclear cells in the samples of either adults or preterm infants. Among these miRNAs, there were 22 miRNAs expressed in the  adultsâ group only, and one (has miR 325) is specific to the preterm infants.

Pastinen1","1McGill University and Genome Quebec Innovation Centre, Montreal, QC,  Canada, 2University of Liege, Liege, Belgium","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nucleotide long noncoding RNAs that  regulate the expression and function of eukaryotic genomes by acting as adaptors to specifically recognize and degrade targeted mRNAs. Candidate studies suggest that genetic polymorphisms in miRNA target sites (poly miRTS) are associated with various disorders like  Touretteâs syndrome, hypertension, or the risk to develop breast cancer. We aim to create a genome wide catalogue of poly miRTS to provide the fundamental basis for the characterization of miRNA related genetic alterations with an impact on human traits and disease, and to unravel the mechanisms of action of some causal poly miRTS.To identify poly miRTS in a genome wide scale, we will monitor RNA levels and differences in allelic expression (AE) with and without active miRNA gene regulation. To shutdown miRNA mediated gene regulation we interfere with the miRNA processing machinery by  silencing Drosha, DGCR8, and/or Exportin 5. Importantly, interference with any of these genes is not expected to prevent siRNA processing. Our present results show that silencing any single gene within the miRNA machinery does not substantially inhibit the level of mature miRNAs. However, successful silencing of Drosha and Exportin 5 leads to a 50% reduction of mature miRNAs. Initial RNA sequencing and SNP genotyping experiments are underway. To circumvent off target effects in assessing the global impact of silencing miRNA expression we will monitor genome wide differences in allelic rather than total gene expression. We anticipate that this effectively eliminates non specific effects and allows focusing on interaction of miRNA binding and genetic variants at binding sites.",2011

Background:  The identification of mitochondrial disorders due to  mutations mtDNA is difficult because the lack of phenotype genotype correlation and mutation hot spots in the mitochondrial genome. To verify an mtDNA disease the whole mtDNA should have been analyzed.Methods: Ten patients with neurological and psychiatric symptoms  have been investigated. The whole mtDNA was resequenced by MitoChip 2.0 (Affymetrix) according to the manufacturerâs instruction. The doubtful SNPs detected by the MitoChip were controlled by bidirectional sequencing with ABI Prism 3100 sequencing machine.Result: In 1 case a pathogenic heteroplasmic mtDNA substitution A12770G (Glu145Gly) was detected in the ND5 gene. In the other 9 cases many synonym and non synonym mutations were present .We found 7 unclassified variants in 5 cases. In 2 patients with psychiatric symptoms, axonal neuropathy a unique SNP combination was found  which was described previously predisposing for breast cancer and AMD. The haplotype of these patients were: T2, J1c2. These haplogroups harbor substitutions capable of modifying the phenotype of LHON. One of our patients with epilepsy and schizophrenia had haplogroup D4j containing SNPs previously associated with hypoacusis, schizophrenia, LHON. Six of our patients had the typical Hungarian haplogroups (H5, H4, H1, R0, U4).

Neurodegeneration with Brain Iron Accumulation (NBIA) comprises  a group of neurodegenerative disorders characterized by brain iron deposition and presence of axonal spheroids. Pantothenate Kinase Associated Neurodegeneration (PKAN) and Infantile Neuroaxonal Dystrophy (INAD) are the most frequent forms of the disease and are  due to mutations in PANK2, coding for Pantothenate Kinase 2, and PLA2G6, coding for a calcium independent phospholipase. Recently, mutations in an additional gene dubbed FA2H and coding for a Fatty Acid 2 Hydroxylase were found in two families with symptoms resembling NBIA.Several findings indicate that PANK2 and PLA2G6 are localized into mitochondria, although it is not completely clear in which compartment.In addition, although the putative localization of FA2H was reported to be into the Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER), software prediction for this  protein scores high for mitochondrial localization.Objective of this work is to establish the PANK2 and PLA2G6 sub mitochondrial localization and to test the hypothesis that the FA2H protein could also be located in this organelle.We here demonstrated that the three known proteins involved in NBIA are indeed located into mitochondria with the FA2H being present also in the ER. These data indicate that communication between mitochondria and ER is crucial during the transfer of essential lipids and underline the important role of these organelles and lipids metabolism in causing the disease.Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 373374",2011

For validation of the multiplex PCR based method we compared these results with traditional Sanger sequencing and MLPA analysis. One big challange with the multiplex PCR approach is the formation of spurious PCR products due to primer dimerization. For removal of primer dimers  or short failed PCR products we used the size selective solid phase reversible immobilization (SPRI) purification technology. After primer dimer removal, about 95% of all reads are within the specific 300   400bp range.The evaluation of the NGS data as well as the Sanger sequence and MLPA analysis was performed with the Sequence Pilot software (JSI medical systems). For the detection of CNVs, dosage quotients were calculated using control fragments and target fragments for patient and control samples.All deletions or duplications in the 4 candidate genes, which were known from MLPA analysis, could be detected by NGS.

We were interested in detecting non annotated junctions sequences (JS) at DNA or RNA level. There are several bioinformatic tools (tophat; MMES; gmap; GSNAP) that can do that. However they generally suggest a huge amount JSs that have to be verified. A first validation step can be conducted in silico generating all the sequences corresponding to a JS. If several reads map on a JS, then we have a first indication that the JS suggested by the bioinformatic tools is likely to be a true JS. Therefore we developed a computer program able to generate all possible JSs using genomic coordinates (chromosome  name, start and stop positions) of a reference sequence. This tool has now been used to create in silico all possible annotated isoforms for a given gene to check if some unmapped short reads might map on JSs of a specific isoform. This tool can be also used to get an individual sequence from a genome reference sequence by indicating the genomic coordinates of the multiple fragments of interest.

However, library preparation and enrichment of multiple samples has now become a limiting step for high throughput genomic analysis. To  address this, we developed an efficient strategy for enriching pools of pre barcoded samples using both microarray based as well as solution based approaches. We have optimized custom protocols and pipelines for probe design, library preparation, enrichment and variant analysis and prioritization. The multiplexed enrichment protocol is highly efficient and provides the experimental flexibility that meets the needs of various types of variant discovery projects, ranging from small families to population studies, while screening small sets of candidate genes or large genomic intervals. We found that performance for pools  between 3 and up to 96 samples is similar in comparison to non multiplexed samples.Here, we focus on detection of causal variants using X chromosome exome sequencing in families with an X linked inheritance pattern. We designed a custom enrichment array for all protein and RNA coding genes on human chromosome X with a densely tiled probe overlap, which resulted in a very even coverage distribution (>99% of all positions covered by at least 1 read). Using this array, it is possible to enrich approximately 30 individuals from different families in a single assay, which fits the capacity of a single SOLiD sequencing run and provides a flexible strategy for high throughput variant detection with significantly lowered costs and efforts.",2011

Together with genetic heterogeneity adding another level  of complexity to clinical diagnosis, diagnostic yield remains overall relatively low. Targeted Next Generation Sequencing approaches allows rapid and affordable analysis of genetic variation in multiple loci in parallel. This has been of enormous value in recent disease gene  identification studies, especially when expanded to the exome. In a recent family based exome sequencing study we showed that rare de novo mutations can be reliably identified and may explain the majority of cases with mental retardation (Vissers et al, 2010). These results demonstrate that exome sequencing is becoming a robust approach for identification of genetic variation and can be implemented in a diagnostic setting, even for genetically heterogeneous and largely unexplained common disorders like mental retardation.In this presentation we will describe the development and validation  of a diagnostic workflow for exome sequencing in genetically heterogeneous disorders such as hereditary blindness, hereditary deafness, mitochondrial diseases, movement disorders and mental retardation.

While  every base of the DNA template is interrogated twice using two base encoded probes, ECC performs an additional inspection of the template using a new, four base encoded probe set that is carefully designed to complement two base encoding and jointly form a redundant  error correction code. This strategy allows for error detection and correction without the use of a reference sequence. We demonstrate the performance of ECC in the sequencing of human genomes and compare the performance to that of two base encoding in the absence of ECC. ECC increases overall throughput including over 60% more reads with zero mismatches compared to the reference sequence. We use ECC to detect SNPs and structural variations in these human genomes and demonstrate that the more accurate reads translate to improved variant detection. Using human genomes with 10 14x  coverage, we detect 5% more SNPs with ECC and 30% to 100% more small indels (deletions up to size 11 and insertions up to size 3) without loss of specificity using a split read approach. ECC chemistry also enables the optimization of sample preparation techniques to reduce errors in these steps.

Lancet1","1The Weizmann Instiute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, 2University of Chicago,  Chicago, IL, United States","Humans are highly variable in their olfactory sensitivity and odor  quality perception. This is partially attributed to genetic variations in the olfactory receptor (OR) coding regions. Specifically deleterious variations, such as frame disrupting single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) or copy number variation (CNV) with deletion alleles, are  excellent candidates to underlie this phenomenon. One example is a significant association which we have discovered between  nonsense SNP in OR11H7P and sensitivity for isovaleric acid. To provide a genomic infrastructure for associating OR genotypes to olfactory phenotypes we applied in silico data mining, combined with Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) to the OR sub genome and transcriptome sequences. Scrutinizing dbSNP, the 1000 Genomes Project (1000GP), and several published individual genomes, we identified 285 deleterious variations in 210 ORs. Using the recently published CopySeq algorithm, applied to the low coverage 1000GP data we obtained 72 OR genes with deletion allele. Altogether, we find that ~60% of the OR genes segregate in the human population between an intact and disrupted allele, indicating huge functional variability and suggesting that each human on the planet has a different nose. NGS transcriptome analysis of human olfactory epithelium unravels novel mutation targets, including 412 genes that are X10 overexpressed compared to control tissues. In addition, we successfully assembled  from the data 452 novel transcripts that are in the OR gene territories uncovering yet uncharacterized untranslated exons in ORs and in olfactory transduction genes (targets for general olfactory sensitivity phenotypes).

Weâve detected 496 CpG s in 379 genes hyper  and 373 CpG s in 335 genes and pseudogenes hypomethylated in NSCLC. All the methylation differences were identified with FDR corrected p<0.05 and â¥0.136 mean difference in methylation level. Analysis with Ingenuity Pathway Analysis (IPA) software (Ingenuity Systems, Redwood City, CA, USA) showed that the top functions of these genes were cell to cell signaling and interaction, hematological system development and function, immune cell trafficking, cellular growth and proliferation, cell death, cancer, inflammatory response etc. The most prominently represented gene network was related to tumor necrosis factor (TNF). Comparing methylation data with gene expression data, we found form the hypermethylated genes 41 downregulated and from the  hypomethylated genes 12 upregulated. Many of these hypermethylated and downregulated genes havenât been reported yet to be involved with lung cancer but some of them (RASSF1, AXUD1) are known or proposed to be tumor suppressors in lung cancer progression. From the hypomethylated and upregulated genes the most interesting finding was SERPINB5 (Maspin).",2011
Distal gene regulatory elements have an average size of a nucleosome,P11.130,"O. Wallerman, M. Bysani, M. Wadelius, C. Wadelius","IGP, Uppsala, Sweden","Nucleosomes consists of 147 bp of DNA wrapped around eight histone  proteins, with a normal distance of 20 30 bp between the nucleosome ends. Transcription factors (TFs) bind to promoters and distal regulatory elements and regulate the activity of nearby genes. Promoters located upstream of genes are well known but distal regulatory elements are  poorly defined as to location and size. Using 200 million aligned reads from MNase I digested HepG2 chromatin, we created genome wide nucleosome profiles. These were correlated to ChIP seq results for the TFs HNF4a and FOXA2, which bind to distal regulatory elements. The patterns suggest that one nucleosome is displaced at the regulatory elements. Footprints of nucleosomes around public ENCODE data of DNase I hypersensitivity sites at distal locations also suggests that in general, a single nucleosome is removed by the TF complexes.To apply the strategy to a gene of medical interest, we studied SNPs  identified in GWAS studies for dose requirement of the drug warfarin, which is commonly used to prevent thrombosis. These studies have identified several SNPs in high linkage disequilibrium in and around the VKORC1 gene, but the functional one has not been identified. We  used several chromatin signals and FAIRE DNA as a measure of open chromatin to prioritize among VKORC1 SNPs and found that most of them are located in chromatin without regulatory potential. Out of 22 tested VKORC1 SNPs, 7 are located in nucleosome free regions as  determined by MNase seq and qPCR of FAIRE DNA, which indicates that they may be functional.",2011

We previously mapped the genomic regions bound by TCF7L2 using ChIP seq. The list of genes bound by TCF7L2 harbor a highly significant over representation of loci uncovered in GWAS of T2D. Further support for our conclusions came from a subsequent VDR  ChIP seq study that gave a similar enrichment of GWAS discovered genes. Therefore, it is our hypothesis that a substantial portion of the reminder of genes bound by TCF7L2 on our list, not previously implicated in disease, also harbor genetic variants associated with T2D. We aimed at distilling down genes bound by TCF7L2 that encode Genomics, Genomic technology including bioinformatics methods, gene  structure and gene product function and Epigenetics 378proteins that would be considered attractive drug targets. We analyzed  the overlap of loci between our TCF7L2 ChiP seq gene list and the published open chromatin map for pancreatic islets in order to get an indirect measure of relevant sites in this key tissue. We found that 94 genes overlapped, and interestingly, 36% of the gene products fall in  to drug target classes. Attempting to distill this gene list further, we also carried out ChIP seq in HepG2 cells where TCF7L2 is abundantly expressed. 24 genes remained of which 7 encode what would be considered druggable targets. In summary, we have distilled down loci that are both bound by TCF7L2 across two cell lines and coincide with open chromatin in human pancreatic islets, of which a number encode potentially attractive drug targets that are also likely candidates to be genetically validated when sequenced in a T2D cohort.",2011

Using phenotypic data for human CNV diseases (HPO), as well as zebrafish (ZFIN, Oregon) and mouse phenotypes (MGI, Jackson Laboratory, Cambridge and Bar Harbor), we have developed novel strategies for computational interspecies comparisons and applied these phenotypic similarity algorithms to identify the disease causing genes in recurrent human copy number variation disorders (CNV  disorders).

With their high turnover, TEs play a strong role in genomes evolution and adaptation. They directly regulate the expression of nearby genes both transcriptionally and post transcriptionally. For instance, TEs are known to donate a wide  variety of gene regulatory sequences to the human genome, which exert diversifying effects on the expression patterns of adjacent genes. Here we report their role in shaping the repertoire of a transcription factor, the pleiotropic master regulator p53. The multiple copies of En SpmN6_DR non autonomous DNA transposon are mapping throughout the genome of zebrafish (Danio rerio), mainly upstream or in the introns (less frequently just downstream) of genes, like trim8.1,  whose human orthologs are annotated as putative p53 targets. We thus assessed if the p53 transcription regulator was able to bind members of this family of TEs, through a putative p53 responsive elements (RE) mapping within the EnSpm N6_DR transposons. By luciferase assay, we showed that this well conserved p53 binding site can be directly associated with p53 dependent transcriptional activation of multiple zebrafish orthologs, including trim8.1 and spred2 .  Our data strongly support the hypothesis that the EnSpm N6_DR class of mobile genetic element promoted the spreading of p53RE  within Danio rerioâs genome, potentially illustrating a remarkable case  of convergent evolution.",2011

Progressive intrahepatic cholestasis type 3 associated with complete  absence of biliary phosphatidylcholine (PC) results in liver failure at pediatric age.This phenotype is caused by 2 ABCB4 alleles which encode a protein without floppase activity across the canalicular membrane of the  hepatocyte.Liver failure associated with absence of biliary PC was originally described in mice knockout for the orthologous ABCB4 gene whereas no detectable pathology was then reported in mice with a single mutant allele.Molecular analysis of the ABCB4 by sequencing the 27 coding exons was carried out in three siblings, a 45 year old man and two women, 41 and 47 years old.All had experienced recurring symptomatic cholelithiasis, the younger  sister has also presented an episode of cholangitis and pruritus in pregnancy.In these siblings we identified the new mutation c.1442T>G (absent in 110 controls), in the heterozygous state, which leads to an amino acid change (p.L481R) in the Nucleotide Binding Domain; the family history suggests paternal lineage of the mutation: their father with a history of cholelithiasis died at the age of 56 years with biliary cirrhosis.This family includes others 12 siblings, 4 with symptomatic cholelithiasis (their DNA is not currently available). Although it is plausible that additional genetic loci (and environmental factors) with modifier effect may be involved, the analysis of segregation in 3 siblings suggests that a single mutant allele of the ABCB4 can be a critical factor for susceptibility to the manifestation of cholelithiasis or progressive liver  disease in adulthood.",2011

Autosomal recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa (arRP) has recently been associated with mutations in a novel gene, EYS, which is a major gene for this disease. All published mutations  so far are based upon conventional PCR and are not adequate to identify mid sized DNA rearrangements. The purpose of this study was to establish the prevalence of Copy Number Variations (CNVs) in the EYS gene, using a novel EYS specific MLPA kit, in a cohort of arRP patients, including individuals in whom only one pathogenic change was detected by PCR based sequencing. Here we report the identification of 6 pathogenic CNVs and confirm the presence of mid sized rearrangements as the second mutated allele in a ~15% of families that were carriers of another EYS mutation. Our results  also suggest that mid sized genomic rearrangements in EYS gene would be a common event in the appearance of RP phenotype with an estimated frequency of ~4% (3/71) of total arRP cases with unknown mutation. We have demonstrated an efficient and cost effective strategy validating a novel MLPA Kit as a complementary diagnostic method for EYS pathogenic evaluation.",2011

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited  disorders primarily affecting rods with secondary cone degeneration. It is the most common inherited form of potentially severe retinal degeneration and blindness, with a frequency of about 1 in 4000 births. Inheritance of RP can be either autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant or X chromosomal with also rare cases of mitochondrial transmission. Recessive and isolated cases account for 50 60% of all forms of RP. Recently, we have identified a new gene, EYS,  corresponding to the RP25 locus, as a commonly mutated gene  in arRP. Spanning over 2 Mb within RP25, EYS is the largest eye  specific gene identified so far. Population studies in cohorts of  different origins have been performed, resulting in the identification of more than 70 mutations so far. Among them, 3 pathogenic variants have been recurrently reported in Spanish and Dutch populations: p.I2239SfsX17, p.W2640X and p.Y3135X. In this study, we performed the haplotype analysis in the non related families bearing those mutations with the aim of elucidating their recurrent or founder origin.  For that purpose, we used both microsatellite and SNPs genotyping covering EYS and the specific mutations regions, respectively. EYS  flanking microsatellite haplotypes were different among families in all the mutation groups, suggesting a recurrent origin of the variants. However, SNPs genotyping of the mutation intervals allowed a higher resolution haplotyping. According to these data, we can confirm that mutations p.W2640X and p.Y3135X have an ancestral origin, each of them transmitted by a common founder, whereas p.I2239SfsX17 is recurrent.",2011

However, for the usage of NGS in diagnostics several additional performance  parameters have to be met: high quality, high throughput, low costs. Here we describe the design and validation of an NGS approach for the diagnostics of inherited retinal dystrophy. We developed a 12 plex Nimblegen sequence capture array to enrich exons, splice junctions and UTRs of 111 known retinal dystrophy genes. This array was used to enrich the determined gene package in 100 previously unsolved patients with isolated or autosomal recessive RP. DNAs of 12 RP patients carrying 24 known disease causing variants served as controls. All 112 samples were sequenced on a Roche454 GS FLX  Titanium. Stringent bioinformatic data analysis and variant detection on average resulted in 4 variants per sample which were validated using conventional Sanger sequencing and subsequently tested for segregation within the family. Preliminary data on the confirmation and segregation analysis revealed the likely pathogenic mutations in at least 35 probands. These results show that our approach is operational, e.g. that the coverage obtained allows for reliable identification of the disease causing variations. Targeted NGS combined with stringent bioinformatic data analysis holds the promise to optimize cost effectiveness in molecular diagnostics for genetically heterogeneous disorders like RP, and we are convinced that this approach is an important step towards the successful implementation of NGS in diagnostics.",2011

Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a heterogeneous group of inherited retinal  dystrophies characterised ultimately by the loss of photoreceptor cells. RP is the leading cause of visual loss in individuals younger than 60 years, with a prevalence of about 1 in 4000. The molecular genetic diagnosis of autosomal recessive RP (arRP) is challenging due to  the large genetic and clinical heterogeneity. Traditional methods for sequencing arRP genes are often laborious and not easily available and a screening technique that enables the rapid detection of the genetic cause would be very helpful in the clinical practice. The goal of this study was to develop and apply microarray based resequencing technology capable of detecting both known and novel mutations on a single high throughput platform. Hence, the coding regions and exon/intron boundaries of 16 arRP genes were resequenced using Affymetrix microarrays in 103 Spanish patients with clinical diagnosis of arRP.  All the detected variations were confirmed by direct sequencing and potential pathogenicity was assessed by functional predictions and frequency in controls. For validation purposes 7 positive controls for variants consisting of previously identified changes were hybridized on the array. As a result of the resequencing screening, we detected 36 variants, of which 17 are very likely pathogenic. They consist of 1 nonsense mutation, 3 splicing mutations, 1 5â UTR variant and 12 missense mutations.

We present RNA Seq data of the cochlea, ampulla, saccule, utricle, and total vestibular regions of the human inner ear derived from fresh surgically resected tissue from four donor patients. Tissue was  collected from non diseased regions during an operation to remove a tumor located near the inner ear. Libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument with an average of 127 million quality filtered, 104bp paired end reads per sample. We performed mapping with TopHat to human GRCh37 and quantitation with Cufflinks. In the three sequenced cochleas, we measured expression from 20655 genes that produce 89066 total transcripts. In vestibular regions we find 21501 expressed genes with 92377 unique transcripts. Comparisons between cochlea and vestibular regions showed 1567 genes unique  to the cochlea and 2413 genes unique to vestibular tissue. In total we find 23068 genes expressed in the inner ear along with 98837 total transcripts, an average ratio of >4 transcript variants per gene. Of note, Aquaporin 1 is expressed 25 times higher, FOS is 18.5 times higher, and Otospiralin is expressed 40 times higher in cochlea versus vestibular samples. Otogelin is expressed 65 fold higher in vestibular tissue over cochlea replicating previous expression studies in the mouse. These data represent one of the first high resolution transcriptome maps of the human inner ear and may prove useful as a resource for prioritization of candidate genes for the study of hearing loss.",2011
 RNA seq uncovers the influence of structural variants on transcriptome diversity,P11.144,"E. Ait Yahya Graison, A. Reymond","Center for Integrative Genomics, Lausanne, Switzerland","Structural variation (SV) of DNA segments has been identified as a  major source of genetic diversity, but a comprehensive understanding of the phenotypic effect of these variants is only beginning to emerge. Our group and others established extensive maps of SVs in wild mice and inbred strains, covering ~11% of their autosomal genomes. SVs  shape tissue transcriptomes on a global scale and thus represent a substantial source for within species phenotypic variation. The recently described RNA seq method has brought transcriptome analysis to a new level, as it addresses gene expression at nucleotide resolution and alternative splicing events simultaneously. We used these advantages to unravel the effects of SVs on expression. We generated by ultra high throughput sequencing on Illumina Genome Analyzer II >450 millions RNA seq reads from brain and liver of three mouse inbred strains (129S2, DBA/2J and C57BL/6J) to monitor  expression changes of transcripts that map within and outside SVs. We used TopHat and Cufflinks to map, assemble and estimate the abundance of the different isoforms. Results show that SVs impact gene expression and splicing diversity of genes lying within, but also that of genes which present structural variation in their 5â and/or 3â regions. SV related genes are enriched among isoforms differentially expressed between strains (p val , 5e 08 and 8e 04 in 129S2 and DBA/2J respectively).This study provides a unique opportunity to extensively gauge the influence of structural variants on the transcriptome complexity and regulation.",2011

In humans, the largest SERPIN cluster is located at 14q32.1 region and includes the gene coding for the archetypical SERPIN, SERPINA1, and a highly  homologous sequence, SERPINA2, which was originally thought to be a pseudogene. However, several lines of evidence collected in our work have identified SERPINA2 as a polymorphic gene, probably encoding a functional protein with unknown inhibitory activity. Previously, we have found that SERPINA2 could carry a 2kb deletion leading to an inactive SERPINA2 that is likely to be associated with a signature of positive selection in Africa. To further evaluate SERPINA2 functionality we performed several molecular assays in cell lines stably expressing different SERPINA2 and SERPINA1 variants. In contrast to SERPINA1  recombinants, which were found at both intra  and extra cellular levels, SERPINA2 was detected only inside the cells. These results differ from the expected patterns of Clade A SERPINs, which are normally secreted and retained in the cells, within the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER), in case of abnormal folding. Still, assays of proteosome and fagosome inhibition resulted in similar patterns for SERPINA2 and SERPINA1, suggesting that both recombinants expression is down regulated by post translation mechanisms mainly involving ER associated degradation. Although enzymatic assays are still needed to determine the inhibitory properties of SERPINA2, our findings provide the first in vitro evidence for SERPINA2 expression and suggest an activity distinct from its closest homologue, SERPINA1.",2011

Sirtuins are becoming increasingly recognized as important epigenetic  drug targets in aging and several metabolic diseases. The first sirtuin identified was silent mating type information regulation 2 homolog (SIRT1), considered a longevity gene. Resveratrol, a polyphenol found in red wine, is known to activate SIRT1. Various studies have  demonstrated that resveratrol extends the life span of diverse species through activation of SIRT1. On the other hand, some studies have  reported that alcohol intake can also increase SIRT1 expression.  Our aim was to investigate the effects of a dietary intervention with red wine (resveratrol+alcohol), dealcoholized red wine (resveratrol) and gin (alcohol) on the expression of SIRT1 in humans. 73 men  (60+/ 8 years) were enrolled in a crossover study in which three dietary interventions (28 days each) were randomized. During these interventions the same subjects must take 100 ml of gin (or 272 ml of  red wine or 272 ml of dealcoholized red wine per day. We analyzed SIRT1 expression in 66 subjects who completed the trial. Total RNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC). RNA levels were measured with real time PCR and normalized using the Ct method of relative quantification. We checked 31 housekeeping genes, and GADPH was used. We observed that the dietary intervention with red wine, dealcoholized red wine and gin statistically increased SIRT1  gene expression (about a 11%) compared to baseline levels (1.14+/ 0.5 vs 1.03+/ 0.03; P,0.008).

Response to drugs varies amongst different populations. We hypothesized that these differences in drug response are influenced by Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) that are highly differentiated amongst the different populations. We thus examined the SNP architecture and patterns of population differentiation (F ST)  of SNPs in genes of drug response pathways (DRP) in the human genome using a gene based âfunctional region directed approach. A total of 500,000 SNPs were found to localize to 715 genes of 66 DRPs. The 5â/3âUTRs of genes in most DRPs exhibit significantly higher SNP  density than the average genome SNP density while the coding region showed the reverse trend suggesting that the UTRs of DRP genes are more polymorphic while the coding regions are more constrained and highlighting that differences in drug response may be more likely due to differences in the expression of these genes and not to differences in the protein structure/function. Significantly, non synonymous coding SNPs of 2 DRPs of drugs involved in vasoconstriction and ischemic heart diseases were found to be significantly population differentiated suggesting that population differences in response to these drugs may  be due to population differences in SNPs of these pathways. Notably, SNPs in most regions, except promoter and 3âUTR, of the genes involved in drugs affecting the Sympathetic Nerve Pathway (SNPy) exhibit significant population differentiation suggesting that there may be population differences in response to drugs targeting this SNPy pathway. Hence this study highlights potential population differences in the response to drugs that target specific pathways with high F ST.",2011

These disorders pose a challenge to the clinician to diagnose. In a consanguineous union, the offspring has various runs of homozygosity (ROHs), identifiable by single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) array technology. We hypothesized that an evaluation tool that identifies all genes associated with OMIM annotated AR conditions in ROHs of a patient will allow the clinician to compare the patientâs clinical features with the phenotypes of these autosomal recessive (AR) conditions, making a SNP array the preferred diagnostic approach.Approach/Results.We developed a Perl CGI online evaluation tool that allows the clinician to identify genes associated with OMIM annotated AR conditions in ROHs obtained from SNP array. It incorporates the OMIM database  and other genetic databases, providing the user with a summary of genes and pertinent genetic information mapping to the query ROHs. The scale of gene search on the query ROHs can be adjusted. We have tested this tool using cases from our clinical practice. In this manner we diagnosed known AR conditions that had remained unrecognized until employment of this tool.Conclusions.SNP array can be employed to determine the ROHs in the setting of consanguinity. These ROHs can be evaluated for OMIM annotated AR conditions. We have developed a genomic SNP array evaluation tool allowing the clinician to evaluate for these AR conditions.

It is capable of analyzing several samples simultaneously and provide a list of variants and their carriers.PEM is used for the identification of four types of SV: insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations. Read pairs with a phred based quality score over 35 are classified into four categories: (1) correct order and orientation (insertions, deletions and normal); (2) wrong orientation (inversions); (3) mapping to different chromosomes  (translocations); and (4) unpaired or unmapped. The empirical distribution of the insert size is calculated from the first category, and used to define cut off sizes to discriminate read pairs supporting insertions or deletions. Then, a clustering procedure to group read pairs pointing to the same SV is performed. Breakpoints of presumed SV are predicted from each cluster containing at least two read pairs.Further support for identified variants is obtained by DOC analysis. The genome is fragmented into non overlapping 100 nt intervals. The number of sequences mapping to each fragment is counted and normalized based on GC content. This values are fed into a segmentation algorithm. In addition, sequences from the 4th category mapping around the breakpoints of the predicted SV are checked for split reads using GEM.",2011

These are referred to as identical or monozygotic  twins, and are considered to be genetically the same. Based on this assumption, twin studies have been considered a powerful tool for determining the contribution of genetic versus environmental factors to specific phenotypes.In recent years there have been reports suggesting that genetic differences within twin pairs due to somatic mosaicism may have been underestimated.

In total 26 28 genes are located in the commonly deleted region on chromosome 7q11.23 that is 1.5 Mb in size. The study of atypical deletions and mouse models with deletions  of individual genes has enabled limited unravelling of the relationship of the individual genes to each of the clinical features. Three genes are believed responsible for the Williams Beuren syndrome cognitive profile, including LIMK1, CLIP2 and GTF2I(RD1/2) , yet no specific deletions or mutations in any of these 3 individual genes have been described. A major role for the CLIP2 gene in the cognitive characteristics of WBS has been suggested in reports of patients with partial deletions of the WBS region not including CLIP2 , that displayed only mild or no visual spatial impairment. We describe here two patients with deletions taking away exon 3 15 of the CLIP2 gene in two sibs. Specific deletions of the CLIP2 gene have not been reported before. Cognitive testing of both sibs revealed an intelligence in the normal range and showed no evidence for deficits in visual spatial construction. These data make it highly unlikely that haploinsufficiency of CLIP2 on its own causes the cognitive disabilities associated with this syndrome. The cognitive profile in the Williams Beuren syndrome can therefore not be explained by dissecting the contribution of individual genes but has to be considered the consequence of the interaction between several genes within the deleted region.",2011

Introduction. The quality and reproducibility of microarray expression  experiments within and between laboratories are compromised by the complexity of the samples and procedures. We used Two Dimensional Strandness Dependent Electrophoresis (2D SDE) to investigate the quality and reproducibility of the cDNA synthesis. 2D SDE can  measure double stranded cDNA the essential template for T7 RNA polymerase.Material and Methods. SuperScript III reverse transcriptase was used to synthesize cDNA from Universal Human Reference RNA (Stratagene) using T7(dt) primer. The samples were synthesized both according to kit protocol and according to our improved methodology. The amount of dsDNA was mesured with 2D SDE. The cDNA was transcribed with T7 RNA Polymerase and the labeled aRNA hybridized to Agilent microarray containing probes from 230 genes. Each gene  was represented by 10 probes and each probe was replicated six times to estimate the variability of the experiments. Results were analyzed using the R software.Results. The amount of double stranded cDNA after synthesizing the same RNA samples six times was very variable ranging between 0 and 73%. Microarray experiments showed that the higher the dsDNA percentage the fewer probes had significant variability between samples. Approximately 15% of probes showed variability (p , 0,05) between samples when the dsDNA percentage was between 12% and 35%. In contrast, only 3% of probes showed variability between samples when the dsDNA percentage was 69% and 73%.Conclusions. Our results indicate that an important component in imprecision in T7 RNA polymerase based microarray expression  analysis can be explained by the amount of double stranded cDNA synthesized.",2011

Despite the emergence of ultra high throughput DNA analysis platforms,  it is probable that the need for low cost and simple/automated methods that robustly assay specific fragments of DNA will remain. Examples include DNA diagnostics of infectious disease, Mendelian disease, certain cancer situations, environmental monitoring, and forensics.  In such cases, microarrays offer a convenient and flexible way of analysing DNA, but suffer from imperfect fidelity if hybridisations are conducted at a single stringency. Arrays can, however, fully resolve all short DNA sequence variations in all sequence contexts if hybridisation and/or washing entails a dynamically changing temperature range with real time signal monitoring.This âDynamic Allele Specific Hybridisationâ (DASH) principal requires interpretation of surface phase melt curves, enabling DNA fragments to be re sequenced with high precision compared to standard arrays,  in both a quantitative and sensitive manner (alleles detectable at a few percent of the input DNA).Current work fuses the original plate based DASH approach, with the semi automated HybLive microarray platform (Genewave) and on slide oligo synthesis using the FlexArrayer (FlexGen). Single base variants, small indels, and microsatellites are resolved with melting temperature differences of up to ~10Â°C. âArray DASHâ is now being assessed for real world diagnostics applications involving re sequencing, multiplexed mutation scoring, regional scanning for mutations, and combinations of the above   providing a single, generic platform for convenient analysis of clinical and other DNA samples in  a multitude of scenarios.This research received funding from the European Communityâs Seventh Framework Programme (FP7/2007 2013) under grant agreement 201418, entitled READNA.",2011

Rare inherited Mendelian disorders of platelets may be associated with impaired platelet function, abnormal platelet numbers and/or volume and some of these disorders are associated with a propensity of bleeding.Studying the transcriptome of platelets is challenging given that platelets survive only nine days on average and their mRNA degrades rapidly.

High resolution array CGH has been widely used to investigate DNA  copy number variation (CNV) associated with complex disorders. Disease association studies have become increasingly focused on CNVs, and several recent reports show links between CNVs and schizophrenia, autism, and cancer, among others. However, many  copy neutral events undetected by conventional array CGH, including copy neutral loss of heterozygosity (LOH) and uniparental disomy (UPD), also contribute to disease phenotypes. Regions of the genome absent of heterozygosity are usually determined through the detection of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for which each parent has contributed a different allele.Until recently, cytogenetic research needing both high resolution, high quality copy number analysis and LOH detection required two separate array platforms. At Roche NimbleGen we have developed  a combination array CGH/LOH detection platform by adding probes that respond to SNPs to existing array CGH designs. Two probes detect each SNP location, including a perfect match probe (A allele) and a mismatch probe (B allele) similar to our comparative genomic sequencing platform. Using our patented probe design strategy, the detection of over 600,000 common SNPs (MAF >0.4) was tested to ensure the best responding SNP probes were added to the array CGH designs.

 i nvestigating the effect of single nucleotide polymorphisms at 7 & 138 positions on m GP gene promoter activity,J11.01,"M. Taghizadeh, P. Ahmadi, M. Keramatipour","Tehran University of Medical Sciences, School of Medicine, Department of Medical Genetics, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","The matrix Gla protein (MGP) is an important inhibitor of vessel and  cartilage calcification that is strongly expressed in human calcified,  atherosclerotic plaques. Two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)  at  7 &  138 positions on MGP gene have been suggested to play a role in susceptibility towards Coronary Artery Disease (CAD). Such a role is possibly due to the effect of these SNPs on the level of gene  expression. The aim of this study was to investigate the possible effect of  7 and  138 SNPs on MGP gene promoter activity in vitro.To achieve this aim, four appropriate vectors that express GFP under the control of different haplotypes of MGP promoter have been constructed. To assess the effects of haplotypes on promoter activity, vectors were transfected into the Hek293 cells and relative expression of GFP was quantified. Analysis of data using Studentâs T test, revealed that G 7A SNP has a significant effect on promoter activity in cultured cells. Presence of nucleotide A in  7 position resulted in  12% increase in promoter activity (p<0.002). T 138C SNP did not show a significant change in promoter activity (p>0.7). The maximum difference in promoter activity is seen between vector containing A C and G T haplotypes (p<0.0005). Less significant differences in promoter activity were shown between A T and G T haplotypes as well as A T and G C haplotypes (p<0.05).",2011

A biochip allows to analyze a spectrum of allelic variants in two different genes such as HTR2A (rs6311, rs6313, rs6314 and rs7997012) and HTTLPR (rs28914832). To estimate the accuracy of the method we examined 120 DNA samples of healthy individuals in Russian population. The results of hybridization on biochip showed 100% coincidence with direct sequencing. The genotype distributions  were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium. The frequencies of serotonergic system gene alleles in healthy individuals are compared with allele frequencies in patients with schizophrenia to find out susceptibility allelic variants of the disease in Russians.The work was supported by Federal Task Programme for Scientific and Technical Research (grants ## 02.740.11.0869 and 02.527.11.0006).",2011

We present genome scale computational analyses of the 120 bp immediate upstream sequences to the +1 transcription start sites (TSSs) of 10,117 human protein coding genes, and unravel exceptional genes in respect with the core  promoter nucleotide composition. Our data reveal that while in 99% of the genes the absolute purine/pyrimidine ratio ranges between 0.2   2.5, certain genes show exceptional skew in this balance (e.g. ratios of 82.3 in VWA3A, 61.5 in Sox5, and 24.0 in BRWD3), and consist of islands of purines or pyrimidines. Furthermore, while over  95% of the genes lack more than one short tandem repeat (STR) in their core promoters, certain gene promoters are exceptionally rich in multiple STRs (e.g. eight consecutive STRs in UBE2QL1, and six STRs in GRIA2). We found sequence bias for the majority of those promoters across species, supporting functional roles for them in gene expression. Genes downstream to those promoters were also found to be of ontologic importance (i.e. we were able to track the majority of those genes to the lower species such as S. Cerevisiae and C. elegans). The exceptional promoters presented in this study lack the conventional motifs for the TATA, and TATA less promoters, hence offering novel mechanisms for gene expression. They may also provide potential mechanisms for inter individual variations in gene  expression, and complex traits/disorders.",2011

Cancer immunization using the epitopes derived from the processing of proteins that are preferentially expressed on tumor cells appears to be a reasonable approach to induce antitumor immunity aimed at achieving therapeutic advantage. It would be  beneficial to use T cell epitopes from more than one tumor Ag to increase disease coverage and prevent the emergence of tumor escape variants. In current study, the related sequences of HLA restricted immunogenic epitopes for some cancer/testis antigens which are highly overexpressed in cancers were obtained from Genbank. Two chimeric sequences were constructed by fusing the selected epitopes   using hydrophobic amino acid linkers. The in silico gene analysis and  multi parameter gene optimization of the synthetic chimer genes were performed using Stand alone softwares. The mRNA and recombinant  protein secondary structures were predicted and 3D structural stability of the synthetic proteins were analyzed. The VaxiJen server was used to predict the immunogenecity of the whole antigens. Finally the desired properties were verified by Gen Script (NJ, USA) and the multimeric genes were synthesized. Monocytes derived dendritic cells (DCs) of a healthy donor were electroporated with synthesized chimeric genes. T cells were primed with transfected DCs and lytic effects of the generated CTL were measured with Cytotoxicity assay. Based on in silico  and primary ex vivo results, this is promising that  the structural models for chimeric genes from antigenic epitopes of CTAs which are presented may define accessibility, solubility and immunogenicity for applications in cancer immuno genetherapy.

The 22q11 deletion syndrome, also called the DiGeorge syndrome (OMIM 188400) is the most common chromosomal deletion syndrome in humans with an incidence of 1 in 2 4000 live births. Although the clinical presentation of 22q11 syndrome is variable, the major clinical characteristics of the syndrome are the intellectual disability, congenital  heart anomalies, velopharyngeal abnormalities and characteristic facial appearance. Also these patients are at significant risk for psychiatric disorders. In addition, to the variability amongst patients with the âtypicalâ phenotypic features, occasionally (about 1/100) 22q11 deletion carriers present atypical malformations. Despite intensive studies it remains unclear what causes this phenotypic variability of patients with the same deletion. We hypothesize that the distinct rare features are caused by unmasking a recessive allele which occurs at low frequency in the general population. In our study we focused on 24 patients with 22q11 deletion and  one of the phenotypic features outside the traditional 22q11 spectrum, like anorectal malformation, arthrogryposis, polymicrogyria, eye anomalies, inner ear malformations and laryngeal web. For identification of the functional role of genes within the common deletion we captured coding parts of the remaining 22q11 region using custom designed Nimblegen capture arrays, and re sequenced the enriched samples with 454 GS FLX Titanium chemistry. Analysis was performed based on comparison of variants present in patients with the same phenotypic feature against variants found in patients without that characteristic.

Surprisingly, screening three more hematuric families from Greek mainland for G624D, were found positive for this mutation. The data support previous findings that certain mutations are associated with milder phenotypes, such as TBMN and familial microscopic hematuria. G624D may explain a lot of familial hematuria cases in Greece. We are designing a Greek genetic epidemiological  study in order to find the exact frequency of the mutation in hematuric patients.

ALMS1 is a novel gene which is comprised  of 23 exons encoding a protein of 4169 amino acids that does not  share significant sequence homology with any other known genes. The ALMS1 protein is ubiquitously expressed and localizes to centrosomes and basal bodies of ciliated cells, perhaps playing an important role in cilia function and intraflagellar transport. RNA interference knockdown experiments indicate that a total lack of ALMS1 impairs cilia formation. To date, more than 100 mutations, mostly nonsense and frameshift type, in ALMS1 have been reported in AlstrÃ¶m syndrome.

Five mutations were found in 193 probands.Two previously identied TAAD genes, MYH11 en ACTA2, encode respectively the SMC specific isoform of actin and myosin heavy chain,  while MYLK encodes the MCLK protein. This kinase phosphorylates regulatory light chain (RLC), a protein that regulates the actin and myosin activities and actin myosin II cytoskeleton mediated functions inside the smooth muscle cells of aortic wall. These processes are important in maintaining the aortic wall, which is subject to biomechanical forces throughout life.Methods: We studied the MYLK gene in 95 probands from TAAD families by high resolution melting curve analysis, followed by sequencing of aberrant fragments. All patients had negative test  results for sequencing of the genes FBN1, TGFBR1, TGFBR2, MYH11 and ACTA2.Results: Two missense mutations were identified in the MYLK gene: c.2183G>A (p.Arg728His) and c.4565C>T (p.Val1522Ala). Both mutations were not detected in 120 ethnically matched healthy controls. The mutations involve highly conserved amino acids, 100% conserved down to Tetraodon, in highly conserved domains. However, there is only a small difference in properties of the variant amino acids.Conclusion: We identified 2 missense mutations in 95 (2.1%) families with TAAD. This finding is in agreement with the result of the previous study. However, to assess clinical significance of the identified mutations, further studies, such as functional analysis of missense mutations, are needed.",2011

Her 4 years old son is healthy as is her non consanguineous 28 years old husband, also of Austrian extraction. Because of an elevated risk (1:38) for fetal  Down syndrome based on combined test results, an amniocentesis in the 16th week of an otherwise thus far uneventful pregnancy was performed, revealing normal cytogenetic and biochemical (AFP) results. However during midtrimester targeted fetal organ screening in the 22th week a complete absence of fetal movements (akinesia) and further fetal anomalies were recognized, leading to the diagnosis of congenital arthrogryposis multiplex with some similiarities to Pena Shokeir syndrome, a heterogeneous autosomal recessive disease. Because of the bad prognosis parents decided to derminate the  pregnancy and further genetic analyses as well as fetal autopsy were performed. A 60k Agilent array CGH analysis of fetal DNA showed a 855 kb microduplication of 17q12 in the fetus and his mother. Because one of the chromosomal breakpoints is quite likely to affect the ACCN1 gene, we consecutively performed DNA sequencing of this gene from fetal DNA. The heterozygous missense mutation c.137G>T[p.R46L] was identified, and this rare mutation was found to be of paternal 389 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders390 origin.

The most common LRRK2  p.G2019S mutation, laying in exon 41,  has been reported to account for 5 6% of familial PD and 1.6% of sporadic PD in Europe. Three different LRRK2 haplotypes have been  associated with this point mutation: haplotype 1, characteristic of North  African, Arabs and western European subjects; haplotype 2, typical of American European descent individuals; haplotype 3, identified in Japanese families. The p.G2019S mutation seems to be occurred independently at least twice in humans: once on the haplotype 1 and once in the phylogenetically related haplotype 2 and 3.A total of 2261 unrelated consecutive PD patients (Parkinson Institute Biobank of Milan   http://parkinson.it/dnabank.htlm) has been screened and 35 subjects were found to carry exon 41  LRRK2 variants: 30 p.Gly2019Ser heterozygotes (of which one was also heterozygote  carrier of IVS41+30 A>G)1 p.Gly2019Ser homozygote1 p.Ile2020Leu heterozygote1 p.Pro2036Arg heterozygote1 p.Tyr2018Tyr heterozygote1 p.Pro2007Pro heterozygoteIn addition, 5 subjects were found to be carrier of intronic variants (2 IVS40 39 A>G heterozygotes, 1 IVS40 103 T>C heterozygote; 1 IVS41+30 A>G heterozygote; 1 IVS40 47 A>G heterozygote).Ten LRRK2 SNP markers, spanning from exon 8 to 43, have been  directly sequenced in the 31 p.G2019S carriers.

Recent studies have shown that the development of Parkinsonâs  disease (PD) may be affected by the increase in the alpha synuclein gene (SNCA) copy number (duplications and triplications). We have assessed the frequency of SNCA rearrangements in 39 patients  (average age 58.4Â±10.4, average age at disease onset 44.4Â±11.9)  with autosomal dominant PD form. Alpha synuclein gene dosage analysis was carried out using Real time PCR on an ABI 7000 genetic analyzer (Applied Biosystems) with Taqman probes. Beta globin gene was amplified in one tube with exon 3 of SNCA as an internal control.  All samples were tested in triplicates. To assess the SNCA gene copy  number we compared the values of the threshold cycle of alpha synuclein with those of beta globin. Ratios from 0.8 to 1.2 indicated a normal gene dosage; from 1.3 to 1.7   a heterozygous duplication; and from 1.8 to 2.2   a triplication or a homozygous duplication. For  all samples we obtained values which were in the range 0.8 to 1.2. These results did not reveal multiplications of the SNCA gene in the examined patients and allowed to suggest that SNCA duplications and  triplications are a rare cause of autosomal dominant PD in Russia.",2011

LINGO1 gene codes for a nervous system specific transmembrane protein. Its expression is increased in the substantia  nigra of some PD patients, thus suggesting that LINGO1 may be involved in PD pathophysiology. In this study, we performed a case control analysis in an Italian population to assess the role of the LINGO1 gene in PD patients.A total of 567 patients with PD and 468 control subjects were enrolled in Central Southern Italy. Genotyping of LINGO1 SNPs (rs9652490 and rs11856808) was performed by TaqMan pre designed assays using an ABI 7900 HT SDS system.No significant differences were found in allele or genotype frequency  distribution of rs9652490 between patients and controls (P>0.05).

Mutations in the PINK1 gene are associated with both familial recessive  and sporadic early onset Parkinsonâs disease (EOPD).Data on Italian EOPD patients show mutations in a relatively high percentage (8 9%). Heterozygous or compound heterozygous mutations were also reported in a small number of late onset PD  patients (LOPD). In this study, we aimed at assessing the frequency and possibly the pathogenic role of PINK1 mutations in familial and sporadic patients with EOPD and LOPD coming from Southern Italy.We selected 115 patients, including 102 cases with EOPD, 9 of which had a positive family history, and 13 familial cases with LOPD. All the eight PINK1 exons were analyzed by PCR and sequencing. The MLPA method was used in the heterozygous patients in order to detect exon dosage changes, caused by genomic rearrangements, of the known PD genes. Four already know different mutations (three homozygous:  Q126P, W437X , Q456X and one heterozygous: E476K) and one novel heterozygous mutation (R207Q) were found in five patients (4.3%). In particular, 4 out of 103 EOPD patients (3.9%) carried PINK1 mutations. This frequency is lower than previous studies on Italian EOPD have suggested. Furthermore, a frequency of 1 out 13 (7.7%) in familial LOPD patient was found, thus confirming a certain influence of the PINK1 gene also in LOPD as observed in other studies. In conclusion, our study confirms the role played by the PINK1 gene mutations both in heterozygous and homozygous condition in PD development.Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders 390P12.015 cAA interrupted sc A2 alleles of 38 repeats jointly several sc A8  expansions segregate from a late onset parkinsonism index case J.

Several Spinocerebellar Ataxia genes (SCAs) SCAs1 3, SCAs6 8,  SCA12 and SCA17 have been cloned, generally sharing a CAG (CAG/ CTG in SCA8) repeat expansion mutations which usually encodes a polyglutamine tract. In our Spanish casuistic, SCA2 was found in 45 index cases over 408 familial cases with ataxia (25.47 % Â± 3.90).  No SCA mutation was found in any of 1,089 sporadic and idiopathic cases. Is generally known that SCA2 expanded alleles without CAA interruptions are associated with pathological development of the disease and that the interruptions would prevent elongation of the expanded sequence. In this study we present one pedigree showing SCA2 expanded alleles with CAA interruptions coexisting with SCA8 expanded alleles in several members. The index and founder case shows a SCA2 interrupted expanded allele of 38 CAG repeats coexisting with an SCA8 allele of 89 repeats. He presents late onset  essential tremor and cerebellar atrophy. No mutations were found in  LRRK2  and Parkin genes associated with Parkinsonâs disease as his  aetiology. One of his sons and two of his grandchildâs share the same expanded interrupted SCA2 allele, coexisting with SCA8 expansions from 78 to 84 repeats, and all of them remain asymptomatic. In conclusion, SCA2 expanded alleles in pathological range with CAA interruptions could be associated with late onset Parkinsonism with uncertain penetrance. The role of SCA8 expansion coexisting with SCA2 expanded alleles remains unknown.",2011

Despite the different distribution, they show a similar subcellular localization relative to transmitter release sites, and use common transducing pathways.We recently described the Grm1 crv4 mouse mutant carrying a  spontaneous inactivating mutation of the mGlu1 receptor. Homozygous  Grm1crv4/crv4 mice exhibit a complex phenotype with ataxia. To better  define the pathophysiological mechanisms of ataxia in these mice, we evaluated expression and function of the other member of group I mGlus, the mGlu5 receptor, in Grm1 crv4 mouse cerebellar and brain  cortices. Western blot and immunofluorescence analyses show mGlu5 receptor overexpression in the homozygous Grm1 crv4/crv4 mice.  Real time quantitative RT PCR results indicate that up regulation is already evident at RNA level, suggesting a cellular compensatory mechanism due to the absence of active mGlu1 receptor molecules. Finally, functional studies confirm an enhanced glutamate release from  cortical cerebellar and brain synaptosomes as respect to wild type, that is abolished by mGlu5 receptor specific inhibitors.Mechanisms that affect glutamate bioavailability and glutamatergic transmission at the synaptic level may contribute to the development and/or to the rescue of the affected phenotype.Supported by RFPS 4 631972 grant, Italian Ministry of Health.",2011

Spinocerebellar ataxias (SCAs) represent a group of dominantly  inherited neurological disorders characterized by variable degeneration in the cerebellum, spinocerebellar tracts, and brain stem. The SCAs present with gait ataxia, dysarthria, oculomotor abnormalities and may have additional symptoms. Recently, missense  mutations in prodynorphin (PDYN), the precursor protein for several opioid neuropeptides have been reported as the cause of SCA23. In order to investigate the contribution of this new SCA gene in Spanish patients we studied 335 individuals with clinical diagnosis of SCA and negative for SCA 1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12, 17 and DRPLA. A positive family history was present in 43% of cases, 28% were sporadic and for the reminding cases family history was unclear or unknown. All exons and exon intron boundaries of PDYN (NM_024411.4) were sequenced on an ABI3730 analyzer and sequence analysis was performed with the  Staden package.

PDYN is the precursor protein for the opioid neuropeptides,  Î± neoendorphin, and dynorphins A and B (Dyn A and B). PDYN peptides regulate pain processing and modulate the rewarding effects of addictive substances. Three mutations are located in Dyn A, a peptide with opioid activities, as well as non opioid neurodegenerative actions, while a fourth mutation is in the non opioid PDYN domain. The mutations stabilize Dyn A by restricting its conversion to shorter enkephalins. In addition, two of the mutant Dyn A peptides induced toxicity above that of wild type Dyn A in cultured striatal neurons. The mutation in the non opioid domain was associated with altered  expression of components of the opioid and glutamate system as evident from analysis of SCA23 autopsy tissue. In line with our findings, Dyn A was already found to be upregulated in aging rodent brain contributing to age related impairment of spatial learning and memory and additionally in the prefrontal cortex of Alzheimer disease patients, elevated Dyn A levels correlated with neuritic plaque density. Thus, alterations in Dyn A activities and/or impairment of secretory pathways by mutant PDYN may lead to glutamate neurotoxicity which underlies Purkinje cell degeneration and ataxia.",2011

SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7, 12 and 17 are produced by CAG repeats and SCA8 and10 by CTG and ATTCT repeats, respectively. Expanded repeats in SCA1, 2, 3, 6, 7 and 17  and the SCA8 coding strand code for polyglutamine tracts. Previous studies have shown variable results concerning the correlation between numbers of triplet repeats in these genes and the age of onset in patients. m aterials and  m ethods: 52 patients with clinical features resembling  SCA were analysed. DNA was extracted and PCR performed for the  region of the genes containing the triplet repeat. The PCR products were electrophoresed in polyacrylamide gels. repeat numbers were scored and the data analysed using SPSS software. Results: There was no significant correlation between triplet repeat  numbers in two alleles of all genes analysed and age of onset in all SCA suspected patients. A non significant correlation was observed between the number of triplet repeats in the ATXN7 and ATXN8OS genes and age at onset. In other genes a non significant inverse correlation was observed.Discussion: Our hypothesis was that triplet repeat numbers in some of  the analysed genes and age of onset would be significantly correlated, but our results did not support this. We conclude that in the Iranian population, expansion in triplet numbers does not correlate with age of onset. However, the small number of patients studied or errors in the remembered age of onset could also cause this result.",2011

Although the detail mechanism of pathogenesis  is yet to be defined, neurotoxin, especially reactive oxygen species (ROS), released from aggregated mutant proteins, may play a role in the pathogenic process. Previous studies also suggested that mitochondrial phosphorylated extracellular signal regulated protein kinase1/2 (p ERK1/2) was induced oxidative stress and lead to cell death. In this study, two lymphoblastoid cell lines were isolated from SCA3 patients, one contains 31 and 82 CAG repeats in ataxin 3 individual, denoted MJD07; another contains 30 and 78 CAG repeats, denoted MJD08. We investigated the crucial relationship  between the expression of p ERK1/2 and autophagy. Results found the endogenous p ERK1/2 and autophagy marker protein, Atg8 (LC3 class II) were higher in SCA3 patients. Electron micrographs showed that only the cells expressing expanded ataxin 3 contained aggregated protein and autophagic vacuoles. Based on the above observations we hypothesized that the aggregated mutant Ataxin 3 proteins may generate ROS in mitochondria, which subsequently up regulate p ERK1/2 and Atg8 expression levels and ultimately lead to autophagy and cell death.",2011

Background: Auditory neuropathy spectrum disorders (ANSD) are characterised by preserved outer hair cells function (normal otoacoustic emissions and/or cochlear microphonic potentials) but inner hair cells and/or cochlear nerve disrupted function (abnormal auditory brainstem evoked potentials). ANSD may be caused by OTOF gene mutations  (DFNB9)(so far 36 genes cause recessive form). We screened for OTOF gene mutations in belgian patients with ANSD.Methods: Patientsâ DNA was studied after family history, clinical evaluation were completed (absence for syndromic form, thyroid dysfunction, heart rhythm, kidney or inner ear malformation; mutations in GJB2, GJB6 genes were excluded). Molecular investigation on DNA double strand direct sequencing of the 46 coding exons of OTOF gene (NM_194248.2, long isoform, 1997 aa)(Dye Terminator Sequencing v3.1/ABI 3130xl) was performed. Exons 19 46 of the long isoform  correspond to exons 1 28 of the short isoform (NM_004802.3, 1230 aa). Unclassified variants (UV) refer to changes absent from Ensembl and Uniprot databases or from publications.Results: 10 unrelated patients, non consanguineous pedigree were included. None had temperature sensitive auditory neuropathy. One patient was identified homozygous for the reported c.3269C>A mutations; one for compound heterozygous c.2401G>T and c.2402A>T mutations as well as UV (c.3608A>G). Four patients were identified with UV (one patient: c.2123G>A /c.2406+9G>A) and 1 UV (three patients with UV: p.Asn727Ser, p.Cys1251Gly, p.Arg1853Gln). 4 patients did not show any substitution. Parental screening is pending.ConclusionsThese results underline OTOF gene structure complexity (numerous  mRNA isoforms and UV). Once identified, screening in parents/relatives and gene expression studies are needed to better understand their possibly pathogenic role.",2011

It has been suggested that ARCL2 is the same entity described under the denominations of wrinkly skin syndrome and gerodermia osteodysplastica. Such confusion is  caused, in part, by overlapping of the histological and clinical findings, thus nosology remains uncertain until the definitive elucidation of the molecular basis of these conditions. In the present study we analyzed three unrelated families who presented clinically with ARCL2 for mutations in three genes implicated in several forms of cutis laxa; ATP6V0A2, SCYL1BP1 , and PYCR1. No causative mutations were  identified in ATP6V0A2 and SCYL1BP1  genes. However, screening  for mutations in PYCR1 revealed two new variant by direct DNA  sequencing. Patients 1 and 2 were both homozygous for a missense  alteration replacing the triplet CAG of the codon 10 by TAG, creating a stop codon that determined the loss of 298 codons. Patient 3 showed a homozygous missense alteration (c.722C>T; Ala241Val), however it will be necessary confirm if this variant is present or not in a large cohort of control individuals. It is important highlight that PYCR1 gene performs a critical role in proline biosynthesis. The genetic changes found in this work contribute to the elucidation of the molecular basis of cutis laxa. Further studies should be conducted in individuals with other phenotypic presentation to establish the nosology of this group.",2011

Previous reports suggested that such interaction may also extend to instances  of oligogenic inheritance that defies the long held view of BBS as an autosomal recessive disease. In order to investigate the magnitude of oligogenic inheritance in BBS, we conducted a comprehensive analysis of all 14 BBS genes as well as the MGC1203 modifier gene in  a cohort of 29 BBS families, most of which are multiplex. Two in trans mutations in a BBS gene were identified in each of these families for a total of 20 mutations including 12 that are novel. In no instance did we observe two mutations in unaffected members of a given family or observe the presence of a third allele that convincingly acted as a  modifier of penetrance or even expressivity.

NOTCH1 encodes for a transmembrane protein that activates a  signaling pathway with an active role in cardiac embryogenesis,  including aortic and pulmonary valve development.We, therefore, investigated the potential relationship between mutations in regions of NOTCH1 recently reported to be associated with bicuspid aortic valve. We performed a sequencing analysis of 9 of coding exons (exons 10, 11,  12, 13, 20, 23, 29, 30, 34) of NOTCH1 gene in 47 patients with sporadic BAV. Our analyses revealed 17 NOTCH1 heterozygous variants in the analyzed patients. Nine are located within exons and 8 within intronic. Seven variants were described previously as polymorphisms. However, five coding substitutions and one silent were neither listed in public SNP databases nor in the literature and were therefore considered novel. Two novel nucleotide changes, one missense mutation c.3679 C > T located in exon 23 and one polymorphism c.7347 C > A located  in exon 34, were nonsynonymous leading to amino acid substitutions (p.P1227S, p.S2449R, respectively). Out of five patients, one had bicuspidal valve and aortic aneurysm, two   aortic aneurysm and valve calcification and two bicuspidal valve, aortic aneurysm and valve calcification.Four unique, nonsynonymous (2 novel) variants were identified in 4 (8,5%) of 47 patients with concomitant bicuspid aortic valves).The principal finding of this targeted mutation analysis of the NOTCH1  gene is the identification of one novel missense mutation among patients with BAV phenotype.

Purpose: Brugada Syndrome (BS) is an inherited cardiac disorder  caused, in 20 25% of the cases, by mutations in SCN5A gene, which  encodes for the alpha subunit of the cardiac Na+ channel.In this study, we identified two novel mutations in SCN5A in a BS  patient. m ethods: To screen for mutations, the complete SCN5A coding  region, including the intron/exon boundaries, was amplified by PCR  and performed to direct sequencing. For each variant we made a prediction of the effect of mutation based on three online softwares Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders 394(Polyphen, PMUT and SIFT). Results: Genetic analysis revealed that the proband carries two  mutations, in exon 28, in two highly conserved amino acids. The first one was a heterozygous mutation in c5068G>A, that causes the substitution D1690N in the linker between S5 S6 of the DIV of the  channel. The second variant found was a G to A substitution at position c5243 that caused the mutation G1748D, which is located in the NH3 termini part of the segment S6 of the DIV of the channel.Both mutations are predicted to affect protein function by the three softwares.The familial study showed that the proband transmitted the G1748D mutation to a daughter. This result showed that the index case carried the mutations in separate alleles. c onclusions: In this study, we described compound heterozygous  mutations D1690N and G1748D in SCN5A associated with BS.

Starting from 2007 the list of genetic variants was increased up to 8 but all those genes seems to be much less prevalent and does not explain vast of majority BrS cases.The aim of our study is to screen the coding sequence of SNTA1gene.

About 20% of patients have mutations in SCN5A resulting in a loss of functional cardiac sodium channels. Rare mutations do exist in other genes, however, the genetic origin of BrS in the majority of patients remains  unknown.We aim to determine if rare variants in the SCN5A 3âUTR region can modulate channel expression by creating novel, (or by enhancing existing), targets of microRNAs. MicroRNAs are short single stranded RNAs, which, when bound to specific targets in mRNA transcripts,  cause post transcriptional repression of protein expression. We sequenced the SCN5A 3âUTR (2384bp) in a cohort of 97 BrS patients without mutations in the SCN5A coding regions or other tested genes. Thirteen known SNPs and two new heterozygous variants were identified; c.*539A>G and c.*1677G>A, neither of which were detected in more than 150 controls.In silico analysis of the two variants was performed using on line programs predicting microRNA targeting to a given nucleotide sequence. Several microRNAs reported to be expressed in the heart were found to target the new variant 539, however we excluded the possibility that variant 1677 creates new target sites for microRNAs. We are pursuing the candidate microRNAs with in vitro studies. Itâs not known if SNPs in the 3âUTR can play a role in the regulation of SCN5A, however, we propose that these, or new variants, could cause or influence disease severity in BrS or other arrhythmias via the action of microRNAs.",2011

Monogenic inheritance is observed in one third of the idiopathic cases and mutations in the >40 known genes explain only ~25% of familial cases. In order to identify novel  DCM disease genes, we investigated two DCM families by Haplotype Sharing Test (HST) combined with exome sequencing. m ethods: To localise novel DCM genes, 250K SNP genotyping  was performed to identify regions shared between patients from  a single pedigree. The HST was applied to (I) a family with 4 DCM and 2 peripartum cardiomyopathy patients and (II) a family with 3 DCM patients and 1 patient with reduced left ventricular function. To subsequently identify the corresponding disease genes, DNA of the  index patient and an affected relative from each family were analysed by exome sequencing.Results: The HST revealed largest shared haplotypes of 71 cM  on chromosome 15 containing ~600 genes (family I) and 46 cM on chromosome 9 containing ~475 genes (family II). Exome sequencing revealed potentially pathogenic variants shared by the two affected family members in both families. Confirmation by Sanger sequencing and carriership analysis in affected family members and healthy controls is in progress. c onclusions: We identified potentially pathogenic variants in the  largest shared haplotypes in two DCM families.

Interestingly, the occurrence of a founder effect has never been  reported in Italy.Objectives: The aim of the present study was to describe a founder  effect in Tuscany caused by MYBPC3 Glu258Lys mutation. m ethods and Results: A total 401 Italian unrelated index HCM  patients underwent screening for myofilament gene mutations by  direct sequencing of 8 genes, including MYBPC3, MYH7, TNNI2, TNNI3, ACTC, TPM1, MYL2 and MYL3. In 135/401 (34%), a MYBPC3 mutation was identified. Of them, 42 were consecutive unrelated  probands born in the Mugello valley in Tuscany, who harboured the same MYBPC3 Glu258Lys pathogenic mutation. Haplotype analysis examined in 4 families using 9 intragenic SNPs or STRs, showed a unique haplotype covering a 2Mb genomic region. To confirm these results, haplotype analysis was performed all 42 index cases and 100 healthy adult subjects, born in the same geographical region of Tuscany. c onclusions: We have identified a novel founder mutation in the  MYPC3 gene (Glu258Lys) causing HCM in a Tuscan valley. The  presence of a common haplotype suggests that all affected families share the same ancestry.",2011

Background: Defects of the mitochondrial genome are responsible for  a heterogeneous group of phenotypes, including cardiomyopathies (CMPs). Several point mutations of the mitochondrial deoxyribonucleic acid (mtDNA) have been identified as a cause of hereditary CMP. The majority of pathogenic mutations are heteroplasmic, with mutated  and wild type mtDNA coexisting within the same mitochondrion. Homoplasmic mutations are challenging in terms of diagnosis and assigning pathogenicity, as human mtDNA is highly polymorphic. Hypothesis: The present study concerns a family with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (hCMP), which segregated with matrilinear transmission.Methods: Double stranded DNA products generated for denaturing gel electrophoresis (DGGE) analysis were subjected to direct sequencing using a 48 capillaries Abiprism 3730 sequencer (Applied BiosystemsÂ®)  with Big Dye terminator v3.1 sequence kit and SeqScape2.5 software for sequence analysisâ.Results: The 14 year old index male presented with hCMP, preexcitation syndrome, and severe ventricular arrhythmias. mtDNA sequencing revealed the m.4395A>G transition in the mitochondrial tRNA Gln gene, which was shown to be homoplasmic by DGGE.

Currently, mutation screening of the  four most commonly associated genes (MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2 and TNNI3) is undertaken using a high resolution melt analysis (Lightscanner TM)/ Sanger sequencing approach. To date, analysis has  been undertaken in >1300 probands; clinical sensitivity in this cohort  was ~47%.A next generation sequencing approach has the potential to increase clinical sensitivity by expanding the number of genes that can be  screened in parallel whilst also reducing reporting times for a similar cost.In collaboration with the OMGL, the Oxford Biomedical Research Centre (BRC) has validated a next generation sequencing protocol. Using the Roche 454 GS FLX platform a significant increase in clinical sensitivity was observed in a cohort of 231 patients using an expanded gene panel including TPM1, ACTC1, MYL2, MYL3, CSRP3, PRKAG2,  PLN, GLA, LAMP2, FHL1 and the mitochondrial genome in addition to those previously analysed. Implementation into the diagnostic laboratory requires stringent validation in order to meet quality and regulatory requirements.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is a very common genetic cardiac  disease and represents the most common cause of sudden cardiac death in the young. The main genes involved are MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, TNNI3, TPM1and ACTC1. HCM is characterized by a marked genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. In case of novel mutations at  splice sites or adjacent regions, analysis of mRNA is virtually unfeasible because of the lack of cardiac tissue, where sarcomeric genes are expressed. Here we report on a minigene assay used to overcome this problem in a case of an undescribed putative splicing mutation in the MYBPC3 gene. A HCM affected newborn, deceased at 15 days, was double heterozygous for two mutations of the MYBPC3 gene c.772G>A and c.2414 1G>A. The paternal mutation c.772G>A was reported as causative of HCM. The c.2414 1G>A mutation, involving a splice site was inherited from the unaffected mother and never reported in the  scientific literature. It was absent in 500 control chromosomes. As no cardiac tissue of the proband was available, mRNA could not be tested. Therefore a minigene assay was performed. Fragments corresponding to exons 25 26 of the MYBPC3 gene from the wild type and the mutant alleles were separated by TA cloning using the probandâs mother genomic DNA. The two allelic fragments were inserted into the pSPL3 eukaryotic vector. The plasmids were transfected into HeLa cells. After reverse transcription of the extracted RNA, the resulting cDNAs were  sequenced and compared. The mutant construct generated a product in which exon 26 was skipped.",2011

Beside stroke like episodes, cognitive disturbance, behavioral abnormalities and migraine with aura are common features of CADASIL. CADASIL is caused by mutations in  NOTCH3 gene and more than 150 NOTCH3 mutations have been  described so far. Majority of them are missense mutations, leading to loss or gain of cysteine and resulting in odd number of cysteine residues within one of the EGF like domains. It has been shown that almost 90% of mutations occur in exons 2 6. Therefore, as the first step in establishing molecular genetic testing for CADASIL in our country, we performed direct sequencing of those five exons of NOTCH3  gene. We analyzed DNA samples of 40 patients clinically suspected to CADASIL. DNA sequencing was performed using ABI 310 Genetic  Analyzer. Four different mutations in seven patients (one sibling pair, one sibling trio, and two single cases) were detected: Cys65Tyr (exon 2), Gly89Cys (exon 3), Arg90Cys (exon 3) and Ala319Cys (exon 6). According to our data, mutation Cys65Tyr has not yet been described in the literature.In conclusion, we have successfully started with genetic testing of CADASIL in Serbia. However, relatively low frequency of mutations in tested patients (18.92%) indicates that in the further CADASIL testing stricter clinical criteria should be introduced and also mutation analysis of the remaining NOTCH3 exons should be developed.397 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders398",2011

Transgenomic has developed very high sensitivity methods for  detecting somatic mutations notably in the discipline of cancer therapy where key genetic changes are associated with EGFR antagonistsâ effectiveness, e.g. in the genes EGFR, K RAS, PIK3CA, BRAF, p53 and NRAS. The novel techniques of Ice COLD PCR and BLOCker  Sequencing preferentially enrich mutant alleles compared to wild type alleles. These are not allele specific techniques; therefore all mutations, both known and unknown, are enriched and identified in a single reaction. Together these methods allow mutations at concentrations as low as 0.01 0.05% in background of wild type to be confirmed by sequencing. Additionally Ice COLD PCR and BLOCker Sequencing require no special equipment using only standard DNA thermocyclers and Sanger sequencing equipment. Data will be presented showing how these methods allow DNA sequencing confirmation of somatic  mutations in samples such as low tumor load biopsies, formalin fixed paraffin embedded slides, fine needle aspirates, circulating tumor cells and circulating free tumour DNA in plasma and serum. These methods can also be used to confirm low signal Pyrosequencing and next generation deep sequencing results. Using these techniques routine, rapid, simple and inexpensive detection of somatic mutations in (1) cancer patientsâ plasma or serum or; (2) samples where very limited tumour tissue is available, offers a non invasive option for cancer biomarker detection as well as monitoring remission, relapse and emergence of resistance mutations post treatment.

Thirty clinically diagnosed congenital cataract cases below 3 years of age from northern India were enrolled in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood, all coding and exon/ intron regions were amplified using PCR and direct sequencing was performed to detect any nucleotide variation. ProtScale and Discovery  Studio programs were used for insilico and structural analysis. DNA sequencing analysis of CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD and GJA8 showed total of six variations of which two were novel (CRYGC:p.R48H), (GJA8:p.L281C) and four have been previously reported (CRYAB: rs11603779T>G) (GJA8:p.L268L,), (CRYGD:p.R95R, c.T564C). Both the novel changes, in CRYGC and GJA8 genes were found in 16.6% of the patients. Previously reported nucleotide alterations (CRYGD:p.R95R, c.T564C) were found in 90% of the patients. Insilico and structural analysis data suggested that two novel non synonymous mutations altered the stability and solvent accessibility of CRYGC and GJA8 proteins which may lead to lens opacification. We observed two novel nonsynonymous variations and four reported variations in CRYAB, CRYGC, CRYGD and GJA8 genes. The p.R48H variation in Î³ crystallins C may disrupt the normal structure of lens and can cause  cataract. Cx50 is responsible for joining the lens cells into a functional syncytium and mutation (p.L281C) in this gene may lead to lens opacification resulting in cataract formation.

To address this issue we established a human cellular model for CDKL5   related disease using the recently developed technology of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). iPSCs can be expanded indefinitely and differentiated in vitro into many cell types, including neurons. These features make them the ideal tool to study disease mechanisms directly on the primarily affected neuronal cells. We successfully derived iPSCs from fibroblasts of two CDKL5 mutated female patients affected by early onset seizure variant of Rett syndrome and one male  with X linked epileptic encephalopathy. We demonstrated that our female CDKL5  mutated iPSCs maintain X chromosome inactivation  and we identified clones expressing either the mutant CDKL5  allele or  the wild type allele. These last clones represent the ideal experimental control since they are genotypically identical to those expressing the mutant allele and differ only for CDKL5 expression.

The only mutation found thus far in complement factor H related protein 5 (CFHR5) gene,  is a duplication of exons 2 3 resulting in reduced affinity for glomerular bound complement.Here we present clinical data from 16 families, some being very large, with 105 patients sharing this common mutation due to an extended  founder effect. Families originate mainly from one of two geographic regions of Cyprus. Heterozygous carriers of the duplication were detected via a simple PCR test using three specific primers. An additional gap PCR test was designed to detect probable homozygous carriers. No homozygous carrier was found. The most striking finding is the big difference between the two genders as regards progression to proteinuria, chronic renal failure (CRF) and end stage renal disease (ESRD). Proteinuria with CRF or ESRD developed on top of hematuria in 68% male patients instead of 14% female patients aged over 50 yo. Fifteen men reached ESRD compared to only three women. The disease penetrance is nearly 90%, as 10 mutation carriers were symptomless. These data stress the wide clinical spectrum of CFHR5 nephropathy, a new disease entity, characterized by high risk for renal failure especially in males.

Charcot Marie  Tooth disease (CMT) is a genetically heterogeneous  group of diseases that affect the peripheral nervous system. The most commonly used classification combines clinical findings with the inheritance pattern and either electrophysiological or anatomical pathology findings. The combination of these data allows the  identification of several main categories of CMT. The majority of cases can be classified demyelinating forms (or CMT1, characterized by a low NCV in electrophysiological studies), CMT2 (axonal form caused Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders400 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders by specific effects on the axon itself, and conserved NCV) or CMT4  (recessive and severe forms). Recently, disease variants have been described that have intermediate NCV. Each of these types can be further divided into subtypes, depending on the underlying causative molecular defect. However, it should be noted that there is not a  good genotype_phenotype correlation and that great variability exists, both within and between families, regarding the degree of clinical expression. The prevalence of CMT ranges from 10 to 30 per 100,000, depending on the geographical region of origin. The most common cause of CMT1 is CMT1A, which results from the duplication of a genomic fragment that encompasses the PMP22 gene on chromosome 17, followed by CMT1B, 1C, 1D and 1E. In the recent years, all the published studies identify CMT2A as the most common cause of CMT2 (which would account for 10  33% of cases). We  propose a diagnostic CMT algorithm including the recent molecular findings that allows the diagnosis of more than 80% of CMT1 patients and more than 40% of CMT patients.",2011

We describe the first cases of âpureâ duplications of the CNEs containing region downstream the SHOX gene in two LWS families, suggesting the duplication of the cis regulatory DNA elements as the possible cause of the LWS phenotype.The precise mechanisms of the pathogenic effect caused by the microduplication of the CNEs containing region are unclear. The disturbance of the long range regulation of gene expression, essential for producing the gene product in the proper time and place and in the correct quantity, has been proposed as the cause of a number  of diseases in which the suspected target genes appeared to be completely normal. It is possible that duplication exerts a negative effect on SHOX transcription. Recently, it has been demonstrated that the proper gene regulation depends not only on the required transcription factors and associated complexes being present but also on the integrity, chromatin conformation and nuclear positioning of the gene chromosomal segments. On the basis of the above considerations it is not unlikely that the duplication alters the three dimensional chromatin spatial organization impeding in some way the enhancer to contact the promoter, resulting in a lack of gene activation resulting in a condition of haploinsufficiency.",2011

Familial microscopic hematuria, thought to be a benign disease, seems to be a frequent  condition and COL4A3/COL4A4  mutations explain about half of  the cases. However, recent data from our laboratory subsequently confirmed by others, show that more than 50% of these patients develop chronic renal failure and even end stage renal disease. We believe that this phenotypic heterogeneity is due to different mutation types or due to modifier genes action.In order to investigate the âdifferent mutation typeâ hypothesis and find  the frequency of COL4A3/COL4A4  inherited and de novo mutations  we set up a COL4A3/COL4A4  mutation screening in a large cohort  of 122 familial and sporadic hematuria cases. The exons and flanking intronic regions of COL4A3/COL4A4  are amplified with appropriate  primers. Using SURVEYOR endonuclease for mutation detection we will have the genetics results in order to be able to investigate deeper the functional role of the collagen IV mutations. SURVEYOR digestion cleaves at mismatched base pairs in heteroduplexes. If cleavage is evident (on agarose electrophoresis), DNA re sequencing  is performed.Preliminary results of our screening are the polymorphisms COL4A3  G43R, COL4A3 IVS2+12GT, COL4A3 P74P, COL4A3 P414L and  COL4A3 E162G. Possible phenotypic contribution of these SNPs as a functional haplotype cannot be excluded.

While deficiency of complex I of the mitochondrial respiratory chain is  a frequent cause of encephalopathy in children, only a few mutations have been reported in each of its subunits. Furthermore, in the absence of families large enough for conclusive segregation analysis, and of robust functional testing, it is difficult to unequivocally demonstrate  the causality of the observed mutations and to delineate genotype phenotype correlations, making additional observations of these very rare genetic defects necessary. We observed two siblings with an early onset encephalopathy with medulla, brainstem and mesencephalon lesions on brain MRI and death before eight months of age, caused by a complex I deficiency. The parents were first cousins and unaffected. Assuming that the disease was caused by homozygosity for an ancestral mutation in a nuclear encoded gene, we used homozygosity mapping and identified 4 genomic regions that were homozygous and  concordant in the two patients, encompassing 4 complex I genes, one of which only, NDUFV1, showing a missense mutation. The mutation, p.Arg386His, affects a highly conserved residue, contiguous to a cysteine residue known to coordinate a Fe ion. Another mutation of the same codon had been reported in similarly affected patient, yielding additional strong evidence for causality. This observation adds to our understanding of complex I deficiency. It validates the important role of Arg386, and therefore supports the current molecular model of iron sulfur clusters in NDUFV1.",2011

About  95% of the CAH cases are caused by 21 hydroxylase deficiency, resulting from a defect in the CYP21A2  gene. The main aim of this  study was to screen the Jordanian population for the 8 most common small CYP21A2  mutations and introduce a prenatal and a neonatal  genetic test for CAH in Jordan. Current sample study consisted  of 37 clinically diagnosed index patients, including 20 males and 17 females. In most cases, DNA samples for family members were available, bringing the total number of samples to 140. As a screening method we implemented the amplification refractory mutation system (ARMS), identifying mutations in 33 index patients, 15 of which were heterozygotes for a single mutation, 5 were compound heterozygotes, 11 were homozygotes and 2 were compound homozygotes. Mutation 401 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders frequency was the highest for In2cs mutation at 37.8%, followed by  Q318X at 24.3% and 13.5% for 8bp deletion. Also, in 25% of CAH cases due to CYP21A2  gene defect, mutations are caused by large  gene deletions (i.e. 30 kb gene deletion). Hence, to be able to obtain a true statistical representation of CYP21A2  mutations in the Jordanian  population, our sample pool needs to be tested for the 30 kb deletion.  This will be achieved through Multiple Ligation dependant Probe Amplification (MLPA) method, utilizing a CAH MLPA kit. Once the analysis is complete, we can implement a prenatal and a neonatal testing on a national scale, hoping to reduce the overall incidence of CAH in a Jordanian population.",2011

Stahlova Hrabincova","Centre of molecular biology and gene therapy; Masaryk University Brno, Brno, Czech Republic","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) comprises a group of autosomal  recessive disorders caused by an enzymatic deficiency. Approximately 90% of all CAH cases is associated with mutations in the steroid 21 hydroxylase gene (CYP21A2 ). The CYP21A2  gene and its inactive  pseudogene (CYP21A1P) are located within the HLA region on  chromosome 6p21.3. Their intergenic recombinations are responsible for about 95% of mutations.In 267 Czech probands with 21 hydroxylase deficiency were identified 30 different CYP21A2 mutant alleles (4 of them were not described  so far). The most frequent mutation, a chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2   gene, was found in 33,7% of mutant alleles (a new type designated CH 7 was characterized). Small DNA rearrangements of the CYP21A2   gene were present in 59,2% of mutant alleles (3 novel point mutations were detected). Total deletions of CYP21A2 were detected in 4,9%  and duplications of CYP21A2  associated with a mutation on both  copies were detected in 0,4% of mutated alleles. In the set of 90 patients, we identified four types of chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2 genes. The most common type was the newly  characterized CH 7 type (21,4% of mutant alleles). We performed a detailed sequence analysis of chimeric CYP21A1P/CYP21A2  genes to  determine the breakpoints in CYP21A1P CYP21A2  conversion areas.  All chimeric genes have the CYP21A1P promotor and p.Pro30Leu mutation in exon 1 but differ in the presence of other mutations and polymorphisms.Mutations in CYP21A2  gene were determined using a long range  PCR, secondary PCR and restriction analysis, direct sequencing, and MLPA method.

 m olecular Diagnosis of c ongenital Adrenal Hyperplasia due to 21 Hydroxylase Deficiency,P12.058,"R. Cerqueira, I. Miguel, H. Gabriel, M. Teixeira, A. Palmeiro, P. Rendeiro, P.  Tavares",CGC Genetics (www,"cgcgenetics.com), Porto, Portugal. introduction:  21 hydroxylase deficiency is the most common cause  of congenital adrenal hyperplasia (90% 95% of cases), a family of  autosomal recessive disorders with highly variable phenotypical expression involving impaired synthesis of cortisol from cholesterol by the adrenal cortex. The CYP21A2 gene is located on 6p, within the  HLA complex, a region that displays a complex organization of genes with great variability in gene size and copy numbers. Approximately 30 kb from the functional gene of 21 OHD is located a nonfunctional pseudogene (CYP21A2P) that shares significant sequence homology with CYP21A2. Due to the complexity of large rearrangements that can affect CYP21A2  and its pseudogene, correct genotyping of CYP21A2   gene is difficult and requires not only the identification of CYP21A2  common mutations but also the detection of CYP21A2  deletions,  CYP21A2P/CYP21A2  chimeric genes (20% of mutant alleles,  resulting from the common 30 kb deletion) or CYP21A2  duplications  (7% of the alleles). Therefore we developed a testing approach that  combines the detection of CYP21A2 common point mutations and  large rearrangements, and allows the detection of approximately 80 98% of CYP21A2  mutations associated with CAH.  m ethod/Results: 22 samples were tested by locus specific  PCR/ multiplex minisequencing and MLPA (P050, MRC Holland): 4 had no mutations, 9 had point mutations, 2 had large deletions and 7 had a common point mutation combined with a large deletion or duplication. c onclusion: The present work stresses the importance of considering  detection of CYP21A2  point mutations and large rearrangements  (particularly CYP21A2 duplications that can be responsible for some  false positive cases), for CAH diagnosis and counselling.",2011

The autosomal  dominant form with mild to moderate etiopathology and childhood or adult onset is linked to DNM2 mutations. Specific DNM2 mutations are also associated with a peripheral neuropathy, Charcot Marie Tooth (CMT) disease, the most common inherited neurological disorder.

Genetic factors play a major role in a large proportion of cases. Studies of the underlying disease mechanisms have been hampered by the unavailability of the appropriate tissues as well as the lack of model  systems. We have established somatic cells from a patient with a DCX gene mutation resulting in lissencephaly, a neuro developmental disorder characterized by a smooth cerebral surface (pachy  or agyri), mental retardation and seizures. The disease is caused by insufficient migration of maturing neurons. Patient derived fibroblasts were reprogrammed through forced expression of four transcription factors (Oct4, Kfl4, c MYC and Sox2) and the resulting iPS cells (Liss iPSC) were characterized by RT/PCR, immunostaining, karyotyping, methylation analysis as well as embryoid body and teratoma formation  assay.

Mutations in GJB2, GJB6, GJB3, 12SrRNA, tRNASer (UCN),  SLC26A4  genes are responsible for more than half of all cases of  prelingual nonsyndromic recessive deafness in Caucasians.Method: Using a custom microarray panel (Arrays HHL   Asper Biothech) that contains 198 point mutations, identified in 8 main genes  involved on congenital deafness it is possible to identify the molecular basis of the most common forms, both syndromic and nonsyndromic. The DNA samples of 204 unrelated patientsâ non syndromic hearing loss from Bashkortostan had been analyzed.Result: In group of 204 tested patients 97 patients (47,5%) were either homozygous of compound heterozygous, 56 patients (27,5%) carried only one detected mutation. Allelic frequencies for mutations were: GJB2 (c.35delG (34%), c.35dupG (0,5%), c.167delT (2%),  c.235delC (0,74%), q. 3179G>A (1,23%), c.358_360delGAG (0,5%),  c.302A>G (0,25%), c.290_291insA (0,25%), c.299_300delAT (1%), c.333_334delAA (0,5%), c.310_325del14 (0,5%), c.312_327del14 (3%), c.101T>C (1%), c.109G>A (0,5%), c.139G>T (0,25%), c.380G>A (0,25%), c.224G>A (0,5%), c.95G>A (0,25%), c.551G>C (0,5%), c.250G>C (0,25%), c.79G>A+c.341A>G (0,25%)), 12SrRNA (m.961insC(n) (0,25%), m.961delTinsC(n) (0,74%)), tRNASer(UCN)  (m.7444G>A (0, 25%)), SLC26A5  (q. 53 2A>G) (0,25%), SLC26A4  (q.919 2A>G) (0,25%).

Moore","Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom","We have recently discovered that mutations in C20orf54  are the  principal cause of Brown Vialetto Van Laere syndrome (BVVLS), an  autosomal recessive disorder characterised by progressive ponto bulbar palsy and sensorineural deafness. The hearing loss is of insidious onset and precedes the neurological signs. The neurological  phenotype is complex and precipitated by the onset of cranial nerve palsies in a previously healthy individual, followed by anterior horn neuronopathy and long tract signs. The disease course is progressive, but the rate of decline is variable. Rapid development of diaphragmatic weakness is a frequent complication in children and cor pulmonale secondary to chronic hypoventilation in adults.There is increasing evidence that Fazio Londe disease (FLD), clinically similar to BVVLS except for the deafness, is also caused by mutations in C20orf54 and that BVVLS and FLD are effectively the same entity.  We explored the possibility that some cases of Spinal Muscular Atrophy  with respiratory distress (SMARD) may also be caused by mutations in this gene. SMARD patients present at birth with distal muscle weakness followed by sudden onset of respiratory distress secondary to diaphragmatic weakness. About 10% of SMARD patients carry mutations in IGHMBP2. We tested 95 IGHMBP2 negative patients and confirmed that 5% harboured mutations in C20orf54 . We give an overview of the clinical features of BVVLS, FLD and SMARD, provide some evidence of genotype/phenotype correlation and discuss the clinical overlap. In view of the management implications, we emphasise the importance of considering mutations in C20orf54  as  the cause of motor neuronopathy in infancy and childhood.",2011

To date,  four loci, DFNX1 4, have been mapped to the X chromosome. The gene for DFNX1, PRPS1, was identified  in 2010. The clinical phenotype in  DFNX1 is related to an inborn error of purine metabolism in which the enzyme activity of phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase (PRS)  is reduced. Mutations in PRPS1 have also been identified in Arts syndrome, X linked Charcot Marie Tooth type 5 (CMTX5) and PRS superactivity. In Arts syndrome, the enzyme levels are close to zero affecting hearing, vision and psychomotor development. In CMTX5, the level is reduced resulting in peripheral neuropathy, hearing and visual impairment. In PRS superactivity, the high enzyme activity can be associated with hearing loss, hypotonia, ataxia, urinary stones and gouty arthritis.Today, only four DFNX1 families have been published. The hearing  impairment found in the studied male family members was highly variable ranging from congenital profound to progressive postlingual hearing impairment.We present an five generation Swedish family with postlingual, progressive X linked hearing loss associated with a novel c.35A>T (p.H12L) mutation in PRPS1.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy and Becker muscular dystrophy are  X linked recessive disorders caused by mutations in dystrophin gene.DMD is more severe disease with progressive deterioration in muscle power, and most patients become confined to a wheelchair by the age of 12 and die early in their third decade of life from respiratory or  cardiac failure.BMD is a milder phenotype with age of onset around 12 years.In the majority of DMD/BMD patients, the disease is due to deletions and duplications in the dystrophin gene. Determining the exact size of deletions and duplications can help to predict frameshift and phenotype of the patients. Also, in order to choose an appropriate treatment for the patients, knowing the exact mutation is important.Here we used MLPA method to determine copy number of the exons of Dystrophin gene in 37 unrelated DMD/BMD patients in which the  deletions were not detected by multiplex PCR designed for 27 exons and the promoter of dystrophin gene. Fragment separation was performed using a 3130 ABI capillary sequencer and the raw data was analysed by Gene marker software (v1.6).MLPA enabled us to find deletions and duplications in 4 patients. Also the exact borders of deletions and duplications were determined.In conclusion the method is accurate and reliable. It makes it possible to identify deletions and duplications of all 79 exons of dystrophin gene in patients. Therefore it provides a better diagnosis compared to the most of the common techniques like multiplex PCR and real time PCR.406 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder",2011

PVRL4 encodes nectin 4,  a cell adhesion molecule relevant for cadherin based adherens junction formation.Four nectins have been described so far. Notably, PVRL1 (encoding nectin 1) mutations cause Cleft Lip/Palate Ectodermal Dysplasia Syndrome (CLPED1; OMIM#225060) also known as Zlotogora Ogur syndrome, suggesting the common term ânectinopathiesâ for this group of disorders.We have ascertained a further consanguineous family with EDSS and identified a novel missense alteration in PVRL4. Affected individuals  were homozygous for an evolutionary conserved p.Val242Met change (c.724 G>A), that was predicted to be pathogenic by computing analysis. Modelling analysis showed that the p.Val242 residue is part of a linker between the 2nd 3rd Ig like domain and suggested that the replacement with the larger Met residue imposed new nectin 4 contacts with p.Arg251 and p.Glu273, potentially affecting homo /heterophilic interactions with other Ig like molecules.This family adds to the two previously described easing the delineation of a very homogeneous phenotype resulting from PVRL4 mutations and characterized by: thick and fragile hair with pili torti, hair loss with patchy alopecia starting at childhood and affecting as well eyebrows and eyelashes, conical and abnormally spaced teeth, and partial cutaneous syndactyly of digits and toes (2 3 and 4 5).

Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC)  patients harboring EGFR mutations benefit from this specific inhibitors. Almost of all mutations are located within exons 18   21 of the EGFR gene (85 90% of the mutations occured at exons 19 and 21 in EGFR gene).The analysis of EGFR mutations was performed on DNA isolated from cytology sample and formalin fixed and paraffine embedded (FFPE) tissues from NSCLC patients.The aim was comparison of different methods and finding a sensitive, reliable, simple and fast method for routine screening of these mutations  in clinical practice, because sometimes is difficult to obtain sufficient tumor sample of patients with NSCLC. EGFR gene mutations were analysed by following methods: direct sequencing, fragment analysis (exon 19 of the EGFR gene), primer extension analysis (SNaPshot assay), real time PCR (Scorpions ARMS) and mutant enriched PCR targeting exons 19 and 21 of EGFR gene. We examined 43 tumor samples of patients with NSCLC.SNaPshot assay and mutant enriched PCR, simple and high sensitive assays, were proved as suitable methods for routine mutational analysis of EGFR gene in NSCLC patiens in our laboratory.

Patients are characterized by distinct craniofacial characteristics,  multiple congenital contractures, progressive joint and skin laxity, and multisystem fragility related manifestations. As two of six patients are consanguineous families, we hypothesized this is autosomal recessive disorder. We mapped its locus at 15q15.1 by homozygosity mapping using two consanguineous families and identified a homozygous CHST14 mutation in the two families and compound heterozygous mutations in four other sporadic cases. Transfection experiments of mutants and enzyme assays using fibroblast lysates of patients showed the loss of D4ST1 activity. CHST14 mutations altered the  glycosaminoglycan (GAG) components in patientsâ fibroblasts. Interestingly, dermatan sulfate (DS) of decorin proteoglycan, a key regulator of collagen fibril assembly, was completely lost and replaced by chondroitin sulfate (CS) in the patientsâ fibroblasts, leading to decreased flexibility of GAG chains. The loss of the decorin DS proteoglycan due to CHST14 mutations may preclude proper collagen  bundle formation or maintenance of collagen bundles while the sizes and shapes of collagen fibrils are unchanged as observed in the patientsâ dermal tissues.

Classical features include calcification of large  and medium sized arteries and marked myointimal proliferation leading to arterial stenosis. Extravascular  signs include foci or periarticular calcifications. Most affected children die in the infancy as consequence of vascular occlusion (myocardial infarction) or congestive heart failure due to pulmonary hypertension. We here describe a child diagnosed with GACI harbouring a novel mutation of the ENNP1 gene.Methods and Results. The proband was born preterm with a respiratory distress; he is a son of two consanguineous Turkish parents. Echocardiography showed increased echogenicity of the walls of pulmonary arteries, the aorta and the coronary arteries, patent  foramen and thin pulmonary valve. Additionally, calcification foci have been localised within the aortic arch, thoracic aorta and both carotids. Because of the above features the ENPP1 gene was screened. Bidirectional sequencing of the gene showed a gene re arrangement (Insertion and Deletion) within the exon 20 in the proband. Both parents were carriers of the above mutation.Conclusions. This work identified a novel mutation of the ENNP1 gene linked to the GACI disease. When in heterozygous state this mutation leads to mild clinical sign such as short stature, facial dysmporhysms and hypophosphatemic rickets. In the homozygous condition GACI features are present. The identification of a ENPP1 mutation allowed prompt biphosphonate treatment and the establishment of a causative link between the GACI syndrome and the ENPP1 gene.",2011

The disease is characterized by  intraepidermal blistering due in most cases to mutations in cytokeratin  5 (KRT5) or 14 (KRT14) genes and patients present with widely  varying severity.In order to document the molecular biology of the disease, we established an EBS biobank including biological materials from six  Canadian EBS patients (2 EBS DM and 4 EBS loc patients) and six unaffected individuals paired for the age and gender. We first characterized these patients at the genetic level and we identified six pathogenic mutations from which three are novels (I412F (K14), R125S (K14), and R559X (K5)). Then, we performed an expression microarray analysis of the EBS epidermis tissue in order to examine the broad spectrum of effects of KRT5 and KRT14 mutations âin vivoâ  and to identify potential regulatory networks and pathways altered in this disease. Expression profiling show that 28 genes are differentially  expressed in EBS patients compared to control subjects (p value <0.05 and absolute fold change >2). Nine genes (AWAT2 , DGAT2L6,  ELOVL3, THRSP, FADS2, FAR2, ACSBG1, AADACL3 , and CRAT) are  implicated in fatty acid metabolism and three other genes (SPRR2B, SPRR4, and KRT79) in epidermal keratinisation. These two biological pathways contribute both to the formation of the cell envelope barrier structure. This study demonstrates, for the first time, the relevance of metabolic cluster, specifically fatty acid metabolism in EBS biology.408 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder",2011

We report on two patients with different phenotype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (IGE) bearing microduplication and microdeletion of the 15q13.3 region, respectively, both inherited form their unaffected mothers.A 13 years old girl suffering IGE with generalized tonic clonic seizures  was analyzed by MLPA for 15q13.3 deletions/duplications (MLPA kit P297 B1). A microduplication involving only the CHRNA7 gene was found. The molecular genetic analysis of the family members showed that the mother and the sister carry this microduplication, but they did not report any history or presented symptoms of neurological disturbances. The father was healthy and negative for the microduplication. We also searched for 2 bp deletion polymorphism in the CHRFAM7A fusion gene and it was detected in both parents. The children did not carry this polymorphism. Unfortunately, at present it  was not possible to determine the exact duplication breakpoints. The role of 2 bp deletion polymorphism in the CHRFAM7A fusion gene is unclear.The second patient is a boy with idiopathic childhood absence epilepsy and mild mental retardation. MLPA analysis showed chromosome 15q13.3 deletion, covering [15q13.2   MTMR15, TRPM1, KLF13, CHRNA7   15q13.4] gene probes. The genetic defect was inherited from the patientâs mother, who did not report any past or present signs of neurological impairment.Given the fact, that other similar reports exist and that there is no definite explanation for the phenotypic variability of 15q13.3 region disruptions, one possible hypothesis could be the so called âtwo hit modelâ.

We performed linkage analysis with a 6000 SNP  array (Illumina) to identify regions linked to the light sensitivity. In the proband we performed whole exome sequencing (Agilent/SOLID). Variants under the linkage peak passing filters of being novel, functional and predicted damaging were sequenced with Sanger sequencing in the family to identify segregation patterns. Genes with variants co segregating with the phenotype are currently followed up by sequencing all exons in healthy controls and in other light sensitive patients.Results: The linkage analysis resulted in four linkage peaks with LOD  scores around 2.9. The total sequencing effort identified almost 380  exonic variants under the linkage peaks, of which around 30 were novel, and less ten than were predicted to be functional. An interesting variant was found in SCNM1, sodium channel modifier 1, and this variant was co segregating with the phenotype. Follow up of the variant, as well as other variants, is in progress. c onclusions: SCNM1 is a good positional and functional candidate  for the phenotype in this family. Follow up must shed more light on the  probability of this variant as the cause (or one of the causes) of the phenotype in this family.",2011

Two patients belong to a series of 29 patients with infantile epileptic encephalopathy selected for a sequencing of STXBP1. Identified de novo mutations were  the recurrent p.Arg406His substitution and an insertion of six bases  inducing a frameshift. The third patient was diagnosed with a deletion of STXBP1 by CGH array. All three patients had infantile spasms  associated with partial seizures that responded to antiepileptic drug therapy, severe intellectual impairment, and a striking tremor.Mutations in STXBP1 are relatively frequent in patients with infantile epileptic encephalopathies.

Bartter syndrome type 3 is caused by mutations in CLCNKB , encoding the  renal chloride channel CLC Kb. Defects of the CLCNKB  variants may  include a disturbed subcellular sorting or defective gating. Analysis of  these variants in polarized epithelial cells is a valuable tool to assess their sorting properties. Here, we present the analysis of the subcellular distribution of eleven CLC Kb missense variants in such cells.MDCK type II cells were transfected with GFP tagged CLC Kb encoding constructs and subjected to imunnofluorescence studies and confocal laser scanning microscopy. Of the eleven variants, five (S113T, A204T, M427V, G465R and R595Q) were transported to the basolateral plasma membrane, like wt CLC Kb. Five others (P124L, G164R V170M, G433E en L656P) were retained intracellularly, and  colocalized to a major extend with an endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker or vesicles (only V170M). The final variant (C626Y) showed a unexpected staining of both the nucleus and the basolateral plasma membrane.These data indicate that a subset of the CLC Kb variants is properly sorted to the basolateral plasma membrane. These variants may reflect non pathogenic variants, or pathogenic variants that are functionally impaired (i.e. defective gating). However, another subset is retained in the ER, as is common with misfolded membrane proteins, such as CFTR or AQP2. One mutant (V170M) shows a yet to be determined vesicular staining. Altogether, studying the subcellular distribution of CLC Kb variants in polarized cells is a valuable additive tool to test their pathogenicity.",2011

Diagnosis is complicated by the homologous nature of 4q  and 10q D4Z4 arrays.Bristol Genetics laboratory offers a UKGTN specialist diagnostic FSHD service for UKGTN and international laboratories and processes around 400 referrals annually for diagnostic, predictive, and prenatal testing. Molecular confirmation of FSHD1 is currently by EcoRI/BlnI/ApoI digests using probe p13E 11 (to confirm the chromosome of origin and size of the D4Z4 contraction), and distal 4qA/4qB haplotyping (4qA being associated with the pathogenic haplotype). Patients with a deletion of the p13E 11 region (~2%) can be identified using the D4Z4  1kb probe.Lemmers et al (Science 2010; 329(5999):1650 3) has recently published a unifying genetic model for FSHD. FSHD patients were reported to carry specific single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) distal to the last D4Z4 repeat, which create a polyadenylation site for transcripts derived from DUX4. Specific SNPs are suggested to result in efficient polyadenylation and increase DUX4 transcript stability thereby causing FSHD through a toxic gain of function. In FSHD1 the contraction of the D4Z4 repeat units is only pathogenic in 4 specific âpermissiveâ chromosomal backgrounds 4A161, 4A161L, 4A159 and 4A168.We present cases and data for establishing SSLP haplotype analysis as an additional diagnostic service for FSHD1.",2011

FMF is caused by MEFV gene mutations (homozygous and compound heterozygous genotypes). The frequency of the carriers of MEFV mutations is 1:3 in non FMF Armenian population.  Number of FMF and related disorders is very high in Armenians, formed as a founder population experienced genetic drift and social and geographical isolation. Clinical and molecular investigations in more than 16000 FMF patients demonstrated significant correlation between MEFV genotypes and phenotype. Familial study showed the transmission of mutations in parents and siblings. Comparing the MEFV genotypes in two generations among the families was found.Acute recurrent/chronic destructive arthritis is one of the common features of FMF and could be the first, single manifestation. We  present the peculiarities of JCA (EULAR criterion) in FMF patients with different spectrum of MEFV mutations. HLA B27 was identified in 58%.  JCA manifested first in 58% of patients; FMF joined as short term rare attacks of thoracalgia or isolated fever and/or hemorrhagic vasculitis with fever. In 42% of patients FMF developed in 2 3 years.

Since little is known about the regulation of this novel group of genes at the DNA level, we characterized the promoters of eight genes (FANCA, B, C, E, F, G, L  and M) that assemble into the FA core complex. The promoters of these genes show characteristic attributes of housekeeping genes: high GC content, rich in CpG islands, and lack of TATA boxes. They function in a monodirectional way and are, in their most active portions, comparable in strength to the SV40 promoter in the reporter plasmids. They are marked by a distinctive transcriptional start site (TSS). In the 5â region of each promoter, we identified a region that, in isolation, is able to negatively regulate promoter activity in HeLa and HEK 293 cells. The central and 3â regions of the promoter sequences harbor binding sites  for several common and rare transcription factors including STAT, SMAD, E2F, AP1 and YY1, indicating that there are cross connections to several established regulatory pathways. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays and siRNA experiments confirmed shared regulatory responses between prominent members of the TGF beta and JAK/STAT pathway and members of the FA core complex.

To assess the functional consequences of the KIAA1279 truncating mutations, degradation of the relevant transcripts by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) was tested. Finally, because of the putative localization of the protein to the mitochondria, we also studied the effect of this mutation on the mitochondrial function.We report two novel patients diagnosed with GOSHS, and homozygous truncating KIAA1279 mutations. In fibroblasts of one of the patients  and his father (heterozygous) we quantified the KIAA1279 mRNA by RT qPCR and the protein by Western blot, studied the subcellular localization by immunocytochemistry and the activities of respiratory chain complexes by spectrophotometry.KIAA1279 mRNA was barely detectable in the patientâs fibroblasts and a two fold decreased was observed in the fatherâs fibroblasts as compared to control, suggesting a NMD mechanism.

While performing electrophoretic gel analysis of PCR products of each exon of HAX1 gene, we found  an absence of PCR products corresponding to exons 4 through 7 in the proband. For detection of the deletion, a genome walking method with Universal Genome Walker Kit according to the manufacturerâs instructions (Clontech) was used. Amplified products from the nested PCR were cloned using p GEM Â® T Vector System (Promega) and  directly sequenced. We identified a homozygous gross deletion in the  HAX1 gene: NG_007369.1:g.(6484_6510)_(8526_8552)del2042. The analysis of the HAX1 gene revealed that both 5â and 3â breakpoints  were located inside Alu elements. Sequence alignment of the hybrid  intron and normal introns 3 and 7 indicated recombination between these Alu elements. Each of the unaffected parents of the patient had the same deletion in a heterozygous state. The deletion was not found in a group of 100 healthy controls. Alu element regions are known to be hot spots for recombination events. Gene rearrangements by Alu mediated recombination have been reported previously as the molecular basis of some congenital disorders; SCN may now be considered as another example.",2011

This triad of symptoms does not occur in all patients. Indeed, renal abnormalities are heterogeneous with variable penetrance. HDR syndrome is caused by mutations in the GATA3  gene that belongs to a family of dual zinc finger transcription factors that play a critical role in embryonic development. So far, various HDR associated GATA3 mutations occurring throughout the gene have been reported.Here, we report clinical and molecular findings in 2 French patients with heterozygous intragenic GATA3 mutations. The first patient is a 5 year old boy. He was diagnosed with PTH deficient hypoparathyroidism, bilateral sensorineural deafness and vesicoureteric reflux. Direct sequencing of GATA3 identified a duplication occurring in codon 145  (c.431dup), previously described. This frameshift mutation generates a premature stop codon at codon 303, and results in the loss of the nuclear localization signal of GATA3. The second patient is a 15 year old male and was born with upper eyelid agenesis. He was diagnosed as having hypoparathyroidism, bilateral sensorineural deafness and kidney hypoplasia. Sequence analysis of GATA3 demonstrated a novel deletion c. 807_812del (p.Ser271_Thr272del) in the N  terminal zinc finger1 (ZnF1) of GATA3. ZnF1 is essential to stabilize the C terminal zinc finger2 (ZnF2) DNA binding, and interacts with other zinc finger proteins, such as the friends of GATA (FOG).In conclusion, we have identified a novel deletion of the GATA3 gene,  associated with HDR syndrome, widening the spectrum of GATA3 mutations that cause this disease.",2011

DFNB1 deafness, caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene (connexin 26)  on 13q12, is the most frequent subtype of autosomal recessive non  syndromic hearing impairment. Molecular testing for GJB2 mutations is the standard diagnostic approach for subjects with this disorder. However, in 10 50% of affected subjects with GJB2 mutations, only  one mutant allele is found. Some of these unelucidated cases are just coincidental carriers of the most frequent GJB2 mutations, but a variable proportion of cases across different populations carry in trans one of four different deletions at the DFNB1 locus. The number of GJB2 heterozygotes that remain unelucidated after screening for  the known deletions indicates that still unidentified DFNB1 mutations exist. It was hypothesized that all these deletions remove a cis acting regulatory element that would control GJB2 expression in the inner ear.  Overlapping of all deletion intervals defined a 95.4 kb interval located  more than 100 kb upstream from GJB2 that must contain the regulatory element. To detect further DFNB1 deletions, we designed a multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay featuring 9 probes evenly spaced across the critical interval. By using this assay, we screened a cohort of 236 unelucidated GJB2 heterozygotes from  Spain, the Netherlands, Brazil and Poland. We just identified one Polish subject harbouring the del(GJB6 D13S1854) allele, which had not been previously tested for in the entire Polish cohort. Our results imply that other deletions at the DFNB1 locus may be rare or that such deletions would be small enough (<10 kb) to escape detection by this MLPA assay.",2011

Identified new mutations were  further evaluated by segregation with the first degree relatives.Results: Causative mutations were identified in 9 out of 10 patients,  Three of the identified mutations were previously described while 6 were being first time described here in this study. One family showed autosomal recessive inheritance with a novel homozygous mutation ,  which is a very rare condition as being only one family described in the literature before. Others all had heterozygous mutations pointing out the autosomal dominant inheritance as anticipated.

Allele specific PCR analysis demonstrated that c.1388del is the predominant mutation in lymphocytes of the index case. Haplotype analysis revealed that both mutant alleles have a common origin. The presence of these two distinct alterations might result of an incorrect repair of a larger de novo mutational event that occurred in the early stage embryo.

Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies (HNPP) is an  autosomal dominant disease. Motor and sensory nerve dysfunction due to compression at common entrapment sites is the characteristic clinical presentation of this disease, even though there is a wide clinical spectrum of presentation, including asymptomatic individuals  HNPP electrophysiological findings show a distinctive background polyneuropathy, independent of superimposed entrapment neuropathy. It is characterized by diffuse sensory nerve conduction velocity (SNCV) slowing and prolongation of distal motor latencies with relatively infrequent and minor reduction of motor nerve conduction velocities. This indicates disproportionate distal conduction slowing in the disorder.Up to 84% of HNPP are due to the 1.5 Mb deletion at 17p11.2 12 containing the PMP22 gene. This gene codifies for the membrane  glycoprotein, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22, which plays an important role in the formation and maintenance of compact myelin in the peripheral nervous system. Small deletions in PMP22 (detected with microsatellite analysis or Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification studies), point mutations in the PMP22 gene, point  mutations at MPZ have been reported to cause HNPP. In addition, mutations in connexin32 gene present as a neuropathy with intermediate NCV that could mimicry HNPP.

RET and glial cell line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) regulate cell survival, differentiation, migration and proliferation of neural crest derived cells. Many signalling mediators of RET have been characterized but the activated downstream genes at the end of the signalling cascade initiated by RET are largely unknown. Since  the molecular basis of the interaction between RET and EDNRB (endothelin receptor type B) has been characterized, we used a Caenorhabditis elegans knock out strain of nep 1, homologue of human ECE1 (endothelin converting enzyme 1) to identify new downstream genes.Transcriptome comparison between wild type and nep 1 strains identified vit 3 as a differentially expressed gene. We confirmed that Apolipoprotein b, the mammalian gene homologue of vit 3, is activated by the RET/GDNF signalling pathway in Neuro2a cells via the MAPK  P38 kinase and it is inhibited by p53. We demonstrated that RET/GDNF and EDNRB/endothelin 3 (ET 3) cooperate in inducing neuronal differentiation resulting in Apob activation. In addition, ApoB expression is downregulated in mouse embryos homozygous for the mutation ret C620R, causing HSCR in humans, whereas the heterozygous mice show a significant increase in ApoB expression and do not show any HSCR phenotype, suggesting that ApoB has a significant role in ENS development.The new finding that Apob is a downstream signalling target of RET opens up a new perspective in studying RET roles in human health and diseases.",2011

Aims: 1) To compare the somatic mosaicism of the expanded CAG of SCA2 gene in CNS. 2)  To determine the influence of somatic mosaicism on SCA2 phenotype and its relationship with CAG size and architecture and haplotype. 3) To gain insights about the dynamic of the CAG expansion in CNS of SCA2. Methods: We have analyzed CAG expansions in 12 different sites of SCA2 deceased patients with discordant phenotypes and somatic mosaicism indices, peaks number, CAG range and skewness of the CAG in each region was determined. Also, detailed clinical data using rating scales trough life with follow up using neurophysiology biomarkers were used to generate phenotypic profiles. Results:  Regions of the brain with greatest level of somatic mosaicism were motor cortex, occipital grey matter, olive, pons, and globus pallidus. While those regions more compromised in SCA2, like cerebellar cortex showed lesser somatic mosaicism. Early onset was associated with wide ranges of CAG in the CNS (with differences up to 10 17 CAG units respecting the major CAG) in contrast to delayed onsets. Sequence and STR haplotype altogether with phenotypic data are also presented. Conclusions: Our results bring data about the role of the somatic mosaicism as the major modifier of the SCA2 phenotype.",2011

Predominantly, the clinical phenotype  of FH is caused by mutations in the LDLR or APOB genes.The frequency of heterozygotes is 1/500. The frequency of homozygotes or compound heterozygotes is 1/1 000 000. The high LDL cholesterol level frequently gives rise to tendon and skin  xanthomas, arcus corneae, and accelerated atherosclerosis resulting from cholesterol deposition in the arterial wall, thereby increasing the risk of premature CHD. The identification and treatment of FH patients and their affected relatives with effective lipid lowering agents is important as this has been shown to significantly reduce both coronary morbidity and mortality.Mutations in the LDLR and APOB genes were determined using exon by exon screening methods based on individual exon amplifications, restriction analysis, DHPLC, sequencing, and MLPA.In the set of 2340 probands with the clinical diagnosis of FH, we detected 311 patients (13.3%) with the APOB mutation p.Arg3527Gln and 606 patients (25.9%) with a LDLR mutation.

These data are  comparable to those published by Cluzeau et al (2011) in a smaller group of patients from France. Involvement of WNT10A has only been established recently. The inheritance pattern of WNT10A mutations is  not clearly recessive, with some relatively severly affected individuals carrying only one mutation. We will present genotype phenotype  correlations in our group of patients and their relatives. Index cases either carry two nonsense mutations, one nonsense and one missense mutation, two missense mutations or only one missense mutation. Four missense mutations were novel. Notably, one of our patients had pili torti. It appears that a heterozygous nonsense mutation is not enough to cause WNT10A related ectodermal dysplasia, since none of the index cases carry only one nonsense mutation and relatives carrying one nonsense mutation are not or only very mildly affected. There is variable expression between relatives with the same genotype. The collection of clinical data from index cases and their heterozygous relatives is ongoing.",2011

The Ichthyosis vulgaris (IV) is one of the most common genodermatosis  with a semidominant inheritance pattern. IV is characterized by light gray to dark brown scales in extensor areas of extremities and lower abdomen. IV has an incidence of 1:250 to 1:5300 births. FLG gene is located on 1q21, and encodes for the filaggrin protein. Mutations  in FLG gene are the cause of IV, being the most frequent reported the R501X and 2282del4 mutations, both in exon 3. The aim of the present study was the molecular analysis of the FLG gene in Mexicans individuals with IV. We included 12 patients with clinical diagnosis of IV and normal activity of the steroid sulfatase (STS) enzyme from the Genodermatosis clÃ­nica of the General Hospital of Mexico. All IV patients were analyzed by PCR, RFLPs with NlaIII enzyme and DNA automated sequencing anaysis searching for the R501X and 2282del4 mutations. Based on the proposed clinical scale, 33.3% of patients  were diagnosed as mild, 41.6% as moderate and 25% as severe.

Lamellar ichthyosis (LI) is a nonsyndromic disorder of the  cornification caused, in the majority of patients, by transglutaminase 1 (TGM1) deficiency resulting from mutations in both copies of the TGM1 gene.Objectives. To study the probably common origin of c.984+1G>A  mutation in two apparently unrelated Galician families (NW Spain) carriers of c.984+1G>A at heterozygous and homozygous state. To assess the pathologic effect of the splice site mutation by bioinformatic tools and splicing assays.Materials and methods. Microsatellite and SNPs data spanning 12Mb on chromosome 14q11 were evaluated to unravel the common origin in families and 100 control individuals. The effect on splicing was assessed using bioinformatic prediction tools follow by analysis of mRNA from peripheral blood lymphocytes. Molecular modelling was  performed to investigate the effect of the variation at the protein level.Results. Both families shared a common haplotye spanning 0.93Mb no present in control population, confirming the origin from a single mutational event. c.984+1G>A lead to two alternative mRNA splice variants, that included 30 (p.Met329_Val330ins10) and 32 nucleotides (p.Val330MetfsX12) of the 5â of intron 6. This result was in accordance with the presence of two cryptic splice sites predicted by bioinformatic tools. The in frame insertion would create a new loop in the surface of the catalytic domain, which is likely to interfere with the proper folding yielding a structure more susceptible to proteolytic cleavage.Conclusion. Our results suggest that c.984+1G>A is a founder mutation for LI in the Galician population and unravels the molecular pathogenesis of this mutation.",2011

In addition,  they have a renal tubulopathy leading to potassium and magnesium loss. They have proportionate short stature and abnormalities on X rays, including epiphyseal delay, flattening of the proximal femoral, distal femoral and proximal tibial epiphyses. The two older children are maintained on oral antibiotic prophylaxia, subcutaneous immunoglobulins & potassium and magnesium supplements. The youngest child, a boy, developed pneumocytis pneumoniae & cryptosporidium positive diarrhoea. He unfortunately died following bone marrow transplantation. Runs of homozygosity (ROH) shared by  the 3 affected siblings were identified and subsequently compared to the patterns of homozygosity in 7 unaffected relatives.

The candidate loci were targeted using NimbleGenâs sequence capture technology and sequenced in 3 affected and 3 unaffected individuals. We identified 34 homozygous variants (coding regions and utrâs) in 18 different genes that segregated with the IDS phenotype. After excluding variants reported in dbSNP, 13 homozygous mutations in 11 different genes remained for further consideration as potential disease causing mutations.

The majority of IAD is caused by channelopathies and is inherited in autosomal dominant fashion. Objective: Molecular characterization of IAD in our highly  consanguineous population. Patients: 28 Saudi families with various  forms of IAD were recruited:13 with Romano Ward syndrome (RWS), 5  with Jervell and Lange Nielsen syndrome , 4 with Brugada syndrome, 2 with sick sinus syndrome, 3 with arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia, and 1 with catecholaminegric polymorphic ventricular tachycardia.  m ethods: Direct sequencing for genes (KCNQ1, KCNE1,  KCNH2, KCNE2, SCN5A, GPD1L, DSP, PKP2, DSG2, DSC2, CASQ2)  known to be implicated in IAD and, in consanguineous families with negative gene sequencing, SNP based genome wide homozygosity  mapping were performed. Results: Heterozygous mutations in KCNQ1 (5 families), and PKP2 (1 family), and homozygous mutations in KCNQ1 (4 families), CASQ2 (1 family), SCN5A (1 family) were  detected. SNP based homozygosity mapping identified a potential novel locus on chromosome 5q34 for RWS. Analysis of candidate genes in the region is in progress.  c onclusion : Our work represents  largest cohort of Arab patients with IAD.

This large gene is composed of 65 exons and extends over a genomic region of 633,366 bp. The molecular diagnosis revealed that most mutations are private and  therefore the sequencing of all exons is required. Using a series of 113 MDC1A families, we have identified two LAMA2 mutations in 79.7% of families. Therefore, for almost 1/5 of patients, the genetic counseling is difficult as secondary merosin deficiencies can be observed mainly as a result of abnormal O mannosylation of alpha dystroglycan as seen in the alpha dystroglycanopathies associated with mutations in the LARGE, FCMD, POMGnT1, FKRP, POMT1, POMT2 and Fukutin genes.We therefore developed a new method for detecting and characterizing  large rearrangements in the LAMA2 gene based on high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH technology. The study of all patients with a clinically diagnosed MDC1A but harbouring only one or no LAMA2 small rearrangement revealed that they indeed harbour one or two large rearrangements of the LAMA2 gene in most cases (16.8% of all MDC1A patients). In parallel, because of the high resolution of this technique, breakpoints were subsequently characterized by a simple polymerase chain reaction allowing a simple screening test for other  family members. This approach, in combination with cDNA sequencing, allowed us to identify LAMA2 mutations in 96.5% of MDC1A patients therefore having a major impact on genetic counseling.",2011
 m utation analysis of the LDL receptor gene in i ndian families with Familial Hypercholesterolemia,P12.121,"S. S. Kulkarni1, S. Basavraj1, S. V. Hiremath2, P. B. Gai1","1Research Center for DNA Diagnostics, Dharwad, India, 2Dept","of  Biotechnology,P.C.Jabin Science College, Hubli, India. Background: Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a metabolic  disorder inherited as an autosomal dominant trait characterized by an  increased plasma low density lipoprotein (LDL). The disease is caused by several mutations in the LDL receptor (LDLr) gene. Identification of individuals carrying the defective gene could be useful in reducing the  risk of atherosclerosis and myocardial infraction. Our study presents mutation analysis of the LDLr gene in 24 Indian families with FH. m ethods: Genomic DNA was isolated from blood, exon specific  intronic primers were designed and used to amplify DNA samples from  individuals.PCR products were directly subjected to automated DNA sequencing to detect the mutations. Alongwith the affected individuals, ten ethnically matched controls were also analyzed to determine the presence of the same mutations. Result: All the 24 patients had total cholesterol level above 300mg/dl  and LDL cholesterol level above 200mg/dl. Sequence analysis of the LDL receptor (LDLr) gene showed 3 novel mutations which have never been reported elsewhere. In exon 10 we reported g.29372_29373insC, which was found in all the 24 patients and was missence mutation coding for C (cysteine) instead of V (valine). c onclusion: Our study reported 3 novel mutations in 24 Indian  families. These novel mutations are predicted to produce change in  the amino acid and thus leading to the conformational changes in the structure of LDLr protein. Change in the LDLr protein makes the LDL receptor unable to transport the cholesterol in to the cell and hence cholesterol starts accumulating in the blood stream and leads to FH.",2011

The precise localization of the enhancer sequence is unknown.We collected clinical data from patients and their relatives with different deletions in the 3â PAR region, detected by the MRC Holland MLPA kit (P018 D). PAR probes were numbered 1 12 where nr 1 is SALSA probe 5642 L05096.Twelve individuals carried a large deletion starting in PAR1 and extending to PAR8/9 or to the flanking CSF2RA probe while 4 individuals had a PAR3 CSF2RA deletion. Thirty two individuals  carried a smaller deletion of 3 probes (PAR4 6), just 5â to the previously described common deletion interval.Median height SDS, sitting height/height ratio SDS and the presence of Madelung deformity in patients with PAR4 6 deletions were  1.8, +1.4, and 67%, in comparison to  2.4, +1.9 and 42% in patients with larger deletions. The index patients had a median height SDS of  2.7, shorter than their affected parents ( 2.0), but disproportion and the presence of Madelung deformity were similar.

LGMD2A is the most frequent form of LGMDs in many European countries.Another relatively common forms of LGMD are LGMD2I and LGMD2D. LGMD2I is caused by mutations in the FKRP gene (19q13.3) that encodes a protein which participates in the glycosylation of Î± dystroglycan in the muscle fibre. LGMD2D is caused by mutations in the Î± sarcoglycan gene (SGCA). SGCA (17q21) is an a integral  membrane glycoprotein that forms part of the dystrophin associated glycoprotein complex. We performed analysis of the CAPN3, FKRP, and SGCA genes in  a cohort of patients with preliminary diagnoses of LGMD at both the mRNA level using reverse transcription PCR or at the DNA level using PCR and direct sequencing.We screened 203 unrelated patients. 50 patients were found to carry CAPN3 defects.

The region was approximately 17Mb (150 genes). Instead of analysing these genes using traditional Sanger sequencing, Next Generation Sequencing was employed. Exome sequencing of  a proband from one of the families was performed using the Agilent human All Exon Capture Assay and sequenced on the Illumina GAIIx platform with 76bp paired end reads. The sequence reads generated were aligned to the reference human genome sequence (hg18) and the location of variant substitutions and small insertion/deletions defined. Analysis of the region of the genome previously shown to cosegregate with the disease status (chromosome 1 delimited by rs10494988 to rs1043909) revealed only two novel nonsynonymous variants in NVL (V746M) and in GJC2 (S48L). Both changes cosegregated with the  affected status in the two families and subsequent sequencing of these genes in 19 unrelated individuals with four limb lymphoedema revealed another two patients with the S48L change. Two additional nonsynonymous GJC2 variants in two patients were identified, one  unreported (M210R) and one published (P316L). Recently it has been suggested that GJC2 is a pathogenic gene in lymphoedema (Ferrell et  al 2010). Our report describes a novel variant in GJC2 and confirms the  S48L and P316L changes described by Ferrell et al (2010).

Three distinct age groups were considered: 8, 16 and 24 weeks (before onset, at onset, and at well established phenotype, respectively). Wild type mice (wt), serving as controls, were analyzed for the same tissues and age groups. Quantitative changes (changes in copy number) as well as qualitative changes (ÎmtDNA3867 deletion) in mtDNA were studied by Fluorescent based quantitative PCR (FQ PCR) in a total of 177 samples (84 TG and 93 wild type). The absolute quantities of mtDNA/nDNA were compared by the âabsolute quantitationâ method. Results: A clear pattern of mtDNA copies decrease with age was observed for both wt and TG mice (1.06 2.53 fold and 1.24 2.58 fold, respectively). Affected tissue showed higher level of mtDNA copies decrease (1.21 times higher in TG mice) and higher level mtDNA deletions (6.05% more in TG mice). The highest amount of mtDNA deletions was observed in 8 weeks old mice, with higher values for TG mice (49.75 72.75% vs. 47.60 58% of wt animals), decreasing with age.Conclusions: Our study confirms an association between mtDNA depletion with progression of phenotype in TG mice and indicates that the mtDNA 3,867 bp deletion may play a role in the early stage of the disease.",2011

 No evidence for involvement of excess free transforming growth factor Î² in disturbed signal transduction in Marfan syndrome,P12.132,"I. Leistra1, U. Baylan2, F. S. van Dijk1, A. Maugeri1, H. W. M. Niessen2, G. Pals1","1VU University medical center, dept","of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam,  Netherlands, 2VU University medical center, dept. of Pathology and Cardiac  Surgery, ICaR VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands. Background: Marfan syndrome is an inherited connective tissue  disorder which is usually caused by mutations in the fibrillin 1(FBN1) gene. In the ethiology, transforming growth factor Î²(TGF Î²) plays an important role. Inactive TGF Î² is stored in the large latent TGF Î² complex (LLC) in the extracellular matrix, bound to fibrillin 1. Mutations  in the FBN1 gene are supposed to impair binding of LLC and cause increased free TGF Î² and increased signalling. Activated TGF Î² receptors phosphorylate Smad3, to pSmad3, which in turn is transferred into the nucleus by Smad4, where it is involved in regulation of genes involved in growth, differentiation, inflammation and apoptosis.Methods: We studied these proteins by immunohistochemical staining of paraffin embedded aortic tissue from 5 Marfan patients, all with a pathogenic FBN1 mutation, that underwent surgery for thoracic aortic aneurysms. Control tissue (n,5) was obtained at autopsy of  individuals without aortic aneurysm. Quantification of immuno staining was performed using Mirax Scan(Zeiss) and 3D Histech Pannoramic Viewer1.14.Results: In controls and patients, TGF Î² showed extensive staining in the tunica adventitia. In tunica media no TGF Î² was detectable, except in areas adjacent to rupture. Intact areas of the tunica media showed no staining of TGF Î², but did show significantly increased staining of total Smad3 (p,0.006), Smad4 (p,0.001) and nuclear staining of pSmad3 (p,0.048), in patients compared to controls,Conclusion: We conclude that TGF Î² signal transduction is disturbed in Marfan patients with a mutation in FBN1, but the underlying mechanism is not clear. There is no evidence for involvement of excess free TGF Î².",2011

In most cases MFS is caused by heterozygous mutations in the gene encoding the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin 1 (FBN1). Heterozygous mutations in the genes coding for transforming growth  factor beta receptors I (TGFBR1) and II (TGFBR2) have also been reported in patients with MFS2 and MFS related disorders.In classical MFS, mutation analyses fail to detect FBN1 involvement in about 10% of cases, possibly suggesting the limitations of commonly used standard PCR based screening approaches.In this study, we searched for partial or complete deletions/duplications of FBN1 and TGFBR2 genes using MLPA technique in a cohort of 206  patients with suspected MFS or MFS like phenotypes, negative for point mutations in the FBN1, TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes. 16 abnormal patterns were found representing 14 deletions and 1  duplication in FBN1, and 1 deletion in TGFBR2. Real time quantitative PCR confirmed 15 abnormal patterns. In one case, the abnormal pattern was due to an insertion of an interspersed Alu element in the  target sequence of the MLPA probe.Taken together, the frequency of FBN1 or TGFBR2 deletions or duplications in patients with suspected MFS without point mutation  in FBN1, TGFBR1, and TGFBR2 can be estimated as 15/206 (7%).  FBN1 and TGFBR2 gross deletions or duplications could thus be  responsible for 0.5 to 1% of MFS cases. However, the relatively high cost of the MLPA technique raises the question of its routine use in a diagnostic laboratory.",2011

Marfan syndrome (MFS) is a heritable autosomal dominant disorder  of connective tissue with prevalence of between 1 in 5 10 000. Approximately 25% of MFS patients are sporadic cases due to new mutations. MFS is noteworthy for its clinical variability. Major features of the MFS include cardiovascular disorders (dilatation and dissection  of ascending aorta), eye disorders   ectopia lentis, defects of skeletal system   pectus carinatum, pectus axcavatum and/or other diagnostics  criteria as arachnodactyly . MFS is caused by mutations in fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1) resulting in defective glycoprotein fibrillin 1. FBN1 is located on chromosome 15  at locus q15 q21.1. Recently, there are showed that three other genes FBN2 (5q23 q31), TGFBR2 (3p22) and TGFBR1 (9q22) influence MFS. Mutations in these genes and their phenotype manifestations are also in Loyes Dietz syndrome, Marfan syndrome type II. and  thoracic aortic aneurysm.The molecular analysis includes mlpa (multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification), separation of PCR products by SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism) and sequencing.We have performed mutation detection on 395 patients with suspected MFS.

The Marfan syndrome is a genetic disorder of the connective tissue  which has many different clinical features most of them affecting the skeleton, skin, and joints. The varieties are known as type I (dominant autosomic disease related to FBN1 gene) and type II associated to gene TGFBR2. Whereas FBN1 gene codify for a protein known as  fibrillin 1 which is needed for the formation of elastic fibers of connective tissue. However, TGFBR2 gene codify for the receptor 2 of a growth factor. The aim of this poster is to present the analysis done in these both genes in eight patients from an Andalusian population (South of Spain), diagnosed of Marfan syndrome. The extraction of DNA was done by an organic procedure with phenol/chlorophorm and the amplification method was using VariantSEQrÂ® (Applied Biosystems). The sequencing process was done in adjacent codifying and intronic regions of both genes. As a result, we could observe four Nonsense mutations in four to eight patients.

Rett syndrome (RTT) is caused by mutations in the methyl CpG  binding protein 2 (MECP2) gene. The MECP2 gene has some unique characteristics: 1) it is mainly affected by de novo mutations, due to recurrent independent mutational events in a defined âhot spotâ regions or positions; 2) complex mutational events along a single allele  are frequently found in this gene; 3) most mutations arise on paternal X chromosome. The recurrent point mutations involve mainly CpG dinucleotides, where C>T transitions are explained by methylation mediated deamination. The complex mutational events might be explained by the genomic architecture of the region involving the MECP2 gene. The finding that most spontaneous mutations arise on paternal X chromosome supports the higher contribution of replication mediated mechanism of mutagenesis. We present 9 types of mutations in the MECP2 gene, detected in a group of 22 Bulgarian and 6 Romanian  classical RTT patients. Thirteen patients were clarified on molecular level (46.4%). The point mutations in our sample account for 61.5%. One intraexonic deletion was detected in the present study (7.7%).

Recent and fast technical developments allow to sequence the complete coding sequence of a human genome of one individual at once (exome  sequencing). This has revolutionized clinical genetic research, offering new opportunities to identify the genetic cause in ID patients and is expected to become implemented soon in the clinical practice as a diagnostic tool.We have collected families with at least two individuals with (non) syndromic ID that are suggestive for an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern. In these families, we perform exome sequencing on genomic DNA of one individual of each family. Stringent filtering with an in house developed pipeline allows fast identification of potential homozygous  and compound heterozygous mutations. In addition, homozygosity mapping with a 250K SNP genotyping array has been performed to identify overlapping homozygous genomic regions in siblings because we expect a significant contribution of pathogenetic homozygous mutations. So far, exome sequencing has been performed for 15 families and potential mutations are being validated. Next, we aim to identify additional mutations in our candidate ID genes in a cohort of patients with a comparable phenotype to confirm involvement of the respective gene in ID.This study will contribute to identification of genes that cause recessive ID and will help to implement exome sequencing for autosomal recessive ID into the diagnostic setting.421 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder",2011

To change dimensions of research in this field, we use Drosophila  to  systematically uncover ID gene function. In order to reveal ID gene function in flies, large scale RNAi screens are performed in which relevant aspects of neuronal architecture, functioning and behavior are quantitatively assessed. Because genes that cause similar phenotypes likely operate together, our functional data are further subjected to bioinformatics analysis to predict groups of ID genes that act in the same pathways. We aim to dissect these pathways and identify novel molecular players and interactions.In my PhD project, I have systematically dissected the role of all fly  orthologues of human ID genes in neuronal function and development. My RNAi screen was focused on Drosophila photoreceptor neurons,  for which I have established a phototaxis assay. This assay is used as a simple read out to measure photoreceptor functionality.I have recently completed the primary RNAi screen, which yielded many interesting results. Ablation of ID genes resulted in morphological phenotypes in 40% of all cases and 9% gave functional/phototaxis phenotypes. Strikingly, many of these first hits appear to be related to microtubules, actin cytoskeleton, mitochondria or membrane/vesicle trafficking.I will present these findings and my follow up approach using secondary assays such as histology and electrophysiology.",2011

Enrichment of the exonic regions within the respective linkage interval followed by next  generation sequencing revealed a missense mutation (R334C) in the MAN1B1 gene, segregating with ID in the Iranian family. Mutation screening in the Pakistani families revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (W473X) affecting MAN1B1 in one family, and an additional missense mutation (E397K) in this gene segregated in 3 families  from the same village with likely shared inheritance. Both missense mutations affect amino acid residues that are conserved throughout the animal kingdom and potentially disrupt the oligosaccharide binding properties at the enzymeâs catalytic domain. MAN1B1 encodes the mannosyl oligosaccharide alpha 1,2 mannosidase, which belongs to the glycosyl hydrolase family 47 (GH47). GH47 proteins are believed to be key enzymes in the maturation of N glycans in the secretory pathway and seem to be involved in the timing and disposal of misfolded glycoproteins through the endoplasmic reticulum associated degradation (ERAD) pathway. Unlike patients suffering from the lysosomal storage disease, mannosidosis (caused by mutations  in lysosomal Î± mannosidase enzyme MAN2B1, and lysosomal Î² mannosidase enzyme MANBA) who present with a variety of syndromic features, the patients from all 5 families identified with MAN1B1 suffer from purely non syndromic ID.

Identification of genes causing non syndromic  XLMR has long been challenging but large scale systematic resequencing has been shown to be promising for the discovery of rare, disease causing sequence variants.We report on a family including 10 affected males with severe MR  and several females with variable cognitive impairment consistent with X linked recessive inheritance. Male patients all had severe mental retardation and behavior problems. Dysmorphic features included long narrow face, malar hypoplasia, large forehead, full nasal root, thin nose, small philtrum. Head circumference was normal. They had no marfanoid habitus or visceral malformations. Brain MRI, in two patients, showed isolated moderate cerebral atrophy. Most affected females were moderately mentally affected but one of them had severe MR with autistic features. The initial linkage study revealed a localization region from Xp11.21 (AlaS2) to Xq22.3 (COL4A5) in 6 of 7 affected males. A novel, unreported frameshift mutation was identified in the MED12 gene  by exome sequencing performed within the EuroMRX consortium. The mutation segregated with disease in all affected males. MED12  encodes a subunit of the mediator complex, which serves as an interface between transcription factors and RNA polymerase II. Two recurrent missense mutations in MED12 have been previously reported in Lujan Fryns syndrome and in FG syndrome type 1 (Opitz Kaveggia).

Such deletions could either be harmless familial variants or recessive mutations. If the latter is true, the affected child should carry an additional mutation on the homologous chromosome. Since  autosomal recessive inheritance is supposed to account for nearly a quarter of all individuals with non syndromic MR, the likelihood of finding a second mutation in children with an inherited deletion is substantial.Experimental approach: Sanger sequencing of coding exons of selected genes. Criteria for gene selection: complete or partial deletion of one allele plus expression in brain. Selected genes: SYT11,  NRXN1, ARPP 21, HIST1H2AG, HIST1H2AH, HIST1H2BJ, ANLN, EXOC4, LINGO2, VCL, ALDOA, DOC2A, ASPHD1, KCTD13, RAB37,  and SULT4A1.Results: Besides several SNPs in various candidate genes we have identified three unclassified variants in LINGO2 (p.Asp135Asp,  p.Arg369Gln, p.Asn522Tyr) in three unrelated children with ID. Since all of these children have a partial LINGO2 deletion as well, the observed variants may represent recessive mutations.Future work: Since LINGO1 was shown to be critical for CNS myelination in mice, the closely related LINGO2 may also be critical for mammalian brain development. As a first step to elucidate a clinical relevance of our LINGO2 variations, we are going to quantify LINGO2 expression on cDNA level in our ID patients with a LINGO2 deletion, as well as in the corresponding healthy family members. Furthermore, we will determine the allele frequency of the LINGO2 variants mentioned  above by genotyping 500 healthy individuals at these loci.",2011

The mild phenotype of this nonsense mutation is related to downstream alternative translation initiation. In contrast to other cases, this family didnât have skewed X inactivation or epilepsy. In retrospect, it became clear that Tarpeyâs study did not include ATRX 5â exons. We have subsequently identified two other families with ATRX R37X, and conclude that this could be an overlooked cause of mild XLMR, which  may not be covered in XLMR testing panels.",2011

Genetic etiologies are found in about half of the cases and include chromosomal or structural abnormalities, genomic disorders and single gene diseases. A  significant portion of known mental retardation disease causing genes resides on human chromosome X, whereby the affliction is more prevalent in males. Despite extensive investigations, the molecular basis for many X linked mental retardation (XLMR) cases has not been reveled by classical genetic approaches, leaving numerous families without prenatal diagnosis. Next Generation Sequencing techniques open new avenues in the elucidation of such Mendelian disorders. We have recruited 6 Israeli families of different ethnic origins, with a total of 21 affected males, showing both syndromic and non syndromic XLMR.  Among syndromic families, XLMR is accompanied with neurological anomalies causing a neurodegenerative disease and early death. To uncover the disease causing mutations, we design a novel X chromosome âsuper exomeâ capture kit, which includes all coding and non coding exons, with extended splice junctions, RNA genes, as well as regulatory and highly conserved genomic regions. In parallel, we are developing next generation sequencing bioinformatics tools suitable for super exome analyses.

Expression in prokaryotic and eukaryotic cells showed a propensity of mutants to misfold/misassemble as evidenced by increased proportion of water insoluble to water soluble CBS antigen and decreased formation of correctly assembled tetramers accompanied by impaired catalytic activity (median activities of CBS mutants in E.coli and CHO K1 cells were 3% and 18% of the wild type CBS, respectively; median amounts of tetramers in these expression systems were 12% and 35%, respectively).

Despite recurrency in exon 7 and 13, it is more and more recommanded to develop a screening method of the entire gene.  Here, we propose to apply the qPCR HRM strategy as formarly published and show the validation process. The application of this approach reveals a large rearrangement. Material and method: 44 variants with at least one per exon were tested in validation set with 35 heterozygous and 9 homozygous variants. The protocol was designed in duplicate with two master mix with and without template DNA. The quantitative measure was based on delta deltaCp method. 30 selected patients with attenuated polyposis were also screened. Results: All variants were detected with the HRM curve analysis. 4 homozygous  variants (44%) were detected in HRM only with the template DNA mix. In the 30 selected patients, we found 2 homozygous mutations (c.[494A>G]+ [494A>G]) and 2 compound heterozygous mutations (c.[494A>G]+[891+3A>C] c.[1145G>A]+[307_1608del]). Variants and mono allelic mutations were also identified (n,4). Discussion : The approach qPCR HRM proposed combining point mutation detection and also large rearrangement identification helps to detect a large deletion (exons 4 to 16) associated to an attenuated polyposis family. This observation expands the spectrum of MUTYH alteration.  Presently, the frequency of such event is not known. But, it reinforces the need for full screening, particularly in patients with homozygous mutations and with one single heterozygous mutation.",2011
" m olecular, cellular and clinical heterogeneity of mosaic variegated aneuploidy syndrome",P12.161,"S. Hanks, K. Snape, E. Ruark, A. Murray, J. Douglas, N. Rahman","Institute of Cancer Research, Sutton, United Kingdom","Mosaic variegated aneuploidy (MVA) syndrome is an autosomal  recessive disorder characterised by mosaic aneuploidies, a variety of phenotypic abnormalities and predisposition to cancer. We previously identified biallelic BUB1B mutations as a cause of MVA. BUB1B  encodes BUBR1 which has multiple, crucial roles in the mitotic spindle  checkpoint. Our data supported a causal role for aneuploidy in cancer development and exemplifed the insights rare genetic syndromes can provide to our understanding of cancer. However, 60% of cases are not due to BUB1B mutations. There is a strong phenotypic overlap between  BUB1B positive and BUB1B negative cases but there is a significantly higher risk of cancer in BUB1B positive individuals. Analyses of mitotic checkpoint function demonstrated that the checkpoint defect was profound in BUB1B positive cases. In contrast, the BUB1B negative cases had intermediate or normal checkpoint function. In addition,  there was no apparent correlation between the presence or absence of BUB1B mutations and the extent of aneuploidies. Taken together,  our results clearly highlight the heterogeneous nature of this rare aneuploidy cancer syndrome. The underlying molecular defect(s) in cases without BUB1B mutations have not yet been elucidated. We are currently utilising an exome sequencing strategy to identify further causative gene(s) and this work will also be presented.",2011

The size of healthy range alleles is highly variable in both loci and expanded alleles may contain  several thousands of repeats in both DM1 and DM2. Combination of conventional PCR and âtripletâ or âtetrapletâ repeat primed PCR (TP PCR) is a commonly used approach to characterize healthy range alleles and to prove the presence or absence of expanded alleles in molecular testing for both disorders. We have designed three multiplex PCR reactions for simultaneous characterisation of the DM1 and DM2 locus using PCR based analyses and capillary electrophoresis on automatic DNA analyser. The first reaction includes bi directionally labelled conventional PCRs for both the DM1 and DM2 locus. The  second reaction contains the reverse directional DM1 TP PCR and the reverse directional DM2 TP PCR, while the third reaction was designed to include the forward directional DM1 TP PCR and the forward directional DM2 TP PCR. These three reactions were designed to be performable under the same amplification and electrophoretic conditions allowing thus their parallelisation. The usefulness of our multiplex assay is underlined by suggestions from previous studies, which showed, that performing conventional PCR with bi directional labelling of specific amplicons and TP PCRs simultaneously from both sides of the repeat regions can increase the reliability and accuracy of the assays which are based on the described methods.",2011

Eight of them (CLN1 3, CLN5 8 and CLN10) were molecularly characterized. Genes underlying CLN9 and adult onset forms, known as Kufsâ disease (CLN4), remained to be identified.

Through a combined genome wide association and linkage  study, we identified a polymorphism in exon 2 of the Arylsulfatase G  (ARSG) gene, encoding a lysosomal sulfatase. The polymorphism caused a non conservative p.R99H substitution in the protein. The missense change, in the vicinity of the ARSG catalytic domain, lead to a 75% sulfatase activity decrease in leucocytes from affected dogs, confirming at the functional level that the variant may be the NCL causing mutation (PNAS 2010, vol 107, 14775 14780). Our results unraveled a key role, presently evaluated in human patients affected by NCL, played by ARSG in NCL and neuronal homeostasis.

Nucleotide Excision Repair (NER) is one of the major DNA repair  mechanisms responsible for repairing DNA damaged by either UV irradiation or by certain chemicals that form âbulkyâ DNA adducts. The NER pathway involves at least 28 genes. Mutations in 13 NER genes have been associated with Xeroderma pigmentosum (XP), Cockayne  syndrome (CS) and Trichothiodystrophy (TTD), with complex and varying multisystem pathologies.These diseases are rare worldwide, but are frequent in Israel and the Middle East, probably due to the high rate of consanguinity among certain populations.The genotype phenotype correlation in those diseases has not been fully clarified. Each clinical phenotype can arise from mutations in more than one gene and conversely, different mutations in one gene can give rise to more than one clinical phenotype. We have clinically characterized fifteen patients with NER defects and identified their causative genes and mutations. Our analyses revealed 4 XP patients, 8 CS patients, 1 XP/CS patient and 2 TTD patients. We have identified 6 novel mutations in CSB, XPD, and XPG. We have  established a population screening program for CS in one of these villages where the carrier frequency was found to be 1:9.Our data might contribute to the understanding of the phenotype genotype relationship and basic pathology of NER related diseases.

These differ with respect to the extent of the deleted region, the  location of the respective breakpoints and the underlying causative mechanisms. Whereas type 1, type 2 and type 3 NF1 deletions are mediated by NAHR between low copy repeats, atypical NF1 deletions appear to have non recurrent breakpoints and differ quite markedly in terms of their extent.In this study, we have collected a cohort of 16 patients with de novo atypical NF1 deletions. Our aim was to precisely map the deletion breakpoints and to characterize the breakpoint flanking sequences in order to identify the mechanism(s) underlying these atypical deletions.  Initial analysis using MLPA and PCR based breakpoint mapping using somatic cell hybrids carrying only the chromosome 17 with the deletion of the respective patients generated several important findings: First, non homologous end joining (NHEJ) is the major mechanism responsible for atypical NF1 deletions. Second, one of both deletion breakpoints maps to one of the LCRs located in the NF1 gene region. These observations imply that NHEJ is driven by the local genomic architecture, specifically the LCRs in the NF1 gene region. Our findings indicate that the impact of the repetitivity of the LCRs located in the NF1 gene region is not confined to replication based mutational mechanisms such as FoSTeS and MMBIR but is also evident in the context of recombination based NHEJ events.",2011

Patients with NF2 also develop schwannomas at other locations and other tumours such as meningiomas, gliomas and neurofibromas. NF2 should be distinguished from neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and from schwannomatosis. Whereas neurofibromas are the cardinal manifestation of NF1, patients with schwannomatosis develop multiple schwannomas affecting the peripheral nerves and spinal nerve roots without vestibular schwannomas or other NF2 related tumours. We screened for mutations in the NF2 gene a panel of 16 unrelated patients referred to our laboratory because of clinical features that required the consideration of NF2, using direct cDNA sequencing complemented with MLPA analysis.Possible disease causing mutations were identified in 3 (18%) cases.

We report the identification of a gene potentially responsible for a novel X linked form of syndromic neuroichthyosis, segregating in a family characterized by ichthyosis, corpus callosum agenesis, microcephalia, seizures, mental retardation and spastic tetraparesis.Linkage analysis revealed a critical region of nearly 25 Mb in  Xq21.33q24 including about 250 genes. Having observed a clinical overlap with the cardio facio cutaneous syndrome, we analyzed the genomic sequence of PAK3, a gene involved in K ras pathway, coding  for a serin/threonine kinase with an important role in the organization of cytoskeleton. We found the K389N substitution within the highly conserved kinase domain of the protein. This mutation segregated with the disease in the family and it has never been detected in more than 450 control chromosomes; moreover prediction tools described this aminoacidic substitution as probably damaging. As mutations in PAK3 have been already reported in association with isolated mental retardation (MR), we compared the kinase activity of the wild type, the K389N and the MR forms, showing a complete loss of function for all mutants.These data suggest a causative role of the K389N mutation in the pathogenesis of neuroichthyosis, although the underlying mechanism leading to a complex disease is not clear.We can not exclude that another gene within the critical region could be involved, worsening the clinical picture caused by PAK3 mutations, but the relevant expression we observed in keratynocytes would suggest an implication of this gene also in the ichthyosis occurrence, possibly due to additional kinase independent activities of PAK3.",2011

Most monogenic disorders are caused by either exonic sequence variants or splice site mutations. These variants can now be readily identified by sequencing all exons in the human genome  (exome sequencing). However, identification of a disease causing variant is not trivial due to the extensive number of rare variants identified in individual exomes. Although databases such as dbSNP can be used to reduce the candidates by filtering out common variants, the remaining candidates are still often numerous.We present here the results from exome sequencing in five individuals of Pakistani origin affected by various monogenic disorders. We identified approximately 85,000 variants (synonymous and non synonymous) in each individual. After database filtering on average  over 12,000 variants could be described as novel and 3,300 of these are exonic. The majority of the novel exonic SNPs were non synonymous (70%) whereas 3% were nonsense variations and 1.5% were splice site alterations. Furthermore, each individual carries on average six nonsense variants in a homozygous state and about 20 in  a compound heterozygous state together with a novel nonsynonymous or nonsense variant. Our findings illustrate the extensive number of rare and possibly disease causing variants that can be identified by exome sequencing in any individual. The main challenge using NGS sequencing for disease gene tracking is to differentiate between the many rare benign variants and disease causing mutations. Strategies to overcome this problem will be presented in more detail.",2011

The GJB6 gene deletion, del(GJB6 D13S1830), was identified in seven patients carrying a GJB2 mutation in the other allele and in homozygote status  in one subject, while the del(GJB6 D13S1854) was not observed in our cohort of patients. Moreover, 45 affected subjects were compound heterozygous for recessive GJB2 allele not including 35delG and 8 were carrying dominant mutations (T55N, P58A, D179N and R184Q), indicating that the complete sequence of the gene is needed for an appropriate molecular diagnosis. The analysis of the deafness causing A1555G substitution in MTRNR1 mitochondrial gene was carried out in patients without Cx26 recessive mutations.

It may be sporadic or inherited as an autosomal dominant or recessive trait and occurs in 1 in 1000 2500  children. In more than 50% of patients with Noonan syndrome, mutations in the PTPN11 gene have been identified. This gene encodes a tyrosine protein phosphatase non receptor type II (SHP 2). c A s E REPOR t : We report the case of a 9 year old girl. This patient  was diagnosed at birth with severe pulmonary stenosis with a  dysplastic valve, and mild supravalvular stenosis. She presented with a permeable oval foramen. A valvuloplasty was performed at 2 years of age with limited results due to supravalvular obstruction and the type  of valve. As her phenotype presented characteristics that were typical of Noonan syndrome, we studied the PTPN11 gene by automatic sequencing of all exons and intron boundaries. c ON c LU si ON s : The patient was heterozygous for the M504A  mutation (c.1510A>G, p.Met504Val) in exon 13 of the PTPN11 gene. This mutation is located in the PTP domain of PTPN11 and is in close spatial proximity to important residues that stabilize the protein. The pathogenic mechanism in Noonan syndrome involves altered N SH2/ PTP interactions that destabilize the inactive conformation without altering the SHP 2 catalytic capability. PTPN11 is a key molecule in the cellular response to growth factors, hormones, cytokines, and cell adhesion molecules. This is the first time that the M504A mutation has been reported in the Spanish population.",2011

RAS signaling plays a key role in controlling appropriate cell  responses to extracellular stimuli, and participates in early and late developmental processes. While enhanced flow through this pathway had been established as a major contributor to oncogenesis, recent discoveries have revealed that aberrant RAS activation causes a group  of clinically related disorders characterized by facial dysmorphism, a wide spectrum of cardiac disease, reduced growth, variable cognitive deficits, ectodermal and musculoskeletal anomalies, and increased risk for certain malignancies. Here, we report that heterozygous germline mutations in CBL, a tumor suppressor gene encoding for a multivalent adaptor protein with E3 ubiquitin ligase activity mutated in myeloid malignancies, can underlie a phenotype with clinical features fitting or partially overlapping Noonan syndrome (NS), the most common condition of this disease family. CBL mutations were identified  in four sporadic cases and two families from among 365 unrelated  subjects with NS or suggestive features and negative for mutations in previously identified disease genes. Phenotypic heterogeneity and variable expressivity were documented. Four mutations were missense changes affecting the RING finger domain or the linker connecting this domain to the N terminal tyrosine kinase binding domain. One splice site nucleotide substitution, resulting in skipping of the exon coding for those domains, and one truncating mutation at the N terminus were also identified. Mutations were shown to affect CBL mediated receptor ubiquitylation and dysregulate signal flow through RAS. These findings document that germline mutations in CBL alter development to cause a clinically variable condition that resembles NS and that possibly predisposes to malignancies.",2011

Great clinical variability has been identified: heart disease, valvular pulmonary stenosis or hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, short stature of 431 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders postnatal onset, psychomotor development delay. Often this syndrome  is not diagnosed, but it is related to many complex problems such as coagulation defects and lymphatic dysplasias. Differential diagnosis includes major diseases in the same metabolic pathway: Costello, Cardiofaciocutaneous and LEOPARD Syndrome. m ethod: With a custom microarray panel (Array CGC   Pat. Pending)  that contains a panel of 80 point mutations, in 8 main genes involved in  Noonan (5 genes) and other genetically related syndromes (PTPN11, RAF1, SOS1, KRAS, HRAS, BRAF, MAP2K1 and MAP2K2) is possible to identify the molecular basis of the most frequent and severe forms.Results: Using the array panel we analyzed 6 cases of Noonan syndrome, where mutations on the PTPN11, were detected by sequence analysis. All the mutations were also detected with the array.  Additionally, 6 cases with clinical suspicion and a PTPN11 negative sequence analysis were also studied. In one case a mutation on the SOS1 gene was detected, making the molecular diagnosis possible. c onclusion:  This approach is an useful and valuable tool for  diagnostics, since it detects the most common mutations associated  with Noonan Syndrome, not only on PTPN11 gene but also in 4 other genes, improving the capacity for diagnosis. A broader clinical spectrum and a faster diagnosis are achieved, allowing an earlier decision making process in patient management.",2011

Here we report the results of molecular and clinical analysis in a cohort of 59 patients affected by NS. Mutation analysis of PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1 and KRAS genes confirmed NS in 56 patients, including 40 probands and 16 affected relatives, with a total mutation detection rate of 67.8%. We identified missense mutations in PTPN11 for 28, SOS1 for 10  and RAF1 for 2 unrelated patients. All of the changes were already known, except for two novel substitutions in SOS1 and one in RAF1 gene. The correlation between genotype and phenotype is similar to that observed in other studies. Patients with SOS1 mutations showed higher frequency of macrocephaly, ptosis, webbed neck, mitral valve anomaly, renal and ectodermal abnormalities in comparison to the group with mutations in PTPN11. This study demonstrated that only three most common genes related to Ras MAPK pathway (PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1) are involved in the pathogenesis of Polish NS patients.

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital cardiac  malformation occurring in 1 2% of the population. BAV is associated with significantly increased risk of developing thoracic aortic aneurysm and acute aortic dissection. It was shown that genotypic variations in the NOTCH1 gene are associated with BAV and may contribute to  the observed variability in aortic phenotype. We performed NOTCH1  mutational analysis in 30 unrelated subjects with BAV and 20 unrelated controls from general Czech population using high resolution melting  analysis and DNA sequencing. We focused preferentially on exons in which mutations associated with BAV have already been reported. In general population we detected one sequence change within exon and two intron variants which have not been described yet. The variant p.Asp1026Asn was found in one control sample and causes an amino acid substitution. The variant c.2587+20GtoA was detected in one sample from general population and also two patients with BAV. Its effect on alternative splicing of mRNA cannot be excluded. In addition, we discovered two novel sequence variants within exons in the patient group. The variant p.Cys570Arg causes amino acid substitution and probably disrupts a disulphide bond in the extracellular receptor domain. Another variant p.Cys144Cys is a silent mutation probably without a functional significance. Further studies are necessary to elucidate the  potential role of detected changes in disease manifestation. In general, identification of aneurysm predisposing susceptibility genes may lead to gene directed surgical therapy for patients with BAV in the future.This study was supported by grant MSMT CR No. 2B08060.",2011

Other organ systems can be involved, defining 13 specific subtypes. CNS malformations appear particularly associated with OFD I and VI syndromes. In OFD I syndrome,  while corpus callosum agenesis appears common (40%), other malformations, including intracerebral arachnoid cysts, porencephaly, heterotopias, cerebellar malformations, and abnormal gyrations, are rarely described. Only molecular bases of the OFD I syndrome have been elucidated, when the OFD1 gene has been identified. However, mutations have also been identified in the TMEM216 gene in two patients with OFD VI syndrome and in the GLI3 gene in five patients with OFD syndrome and median anomalies. Few years ago, Lesca et al. [2006] described an OFD syndrome with cerebellar dysgenesis  involving all the brain structures in a sporadic female foetus. We recently identified a causal c.400_403delGAAA mutation the OFD1 gene. This mutation has previously been reported in two sporadic cases with OFD I syndrome and normal neurological examination. The X chromosome inactivation pattern studied in three fetal tissues showed skewed X inactivation (0 100%) in all tissues. The identification of an OFD1 mutation permit to reclassify this patient as OFD I, instead of a new cerebral dysgenesis type as proposed by the authors. It illustrates also the high clinical variability in CNS features in OFD I syndrome. Therefore, sporadic severe CNS malformation associated or not with cerebellar findings does not exclude primarily OFD I syndrome.",2011

The X linked inheritance and the presence of cerebellar malformation suggested a mutation in the  OPHN1 gene and mutational screening revealed a 2 bp deletion that abolishes a donor splicing site, resulting in the inclusion of 48 bp tract of intron 7.

OPHN1 (ARHGAP41) encodes a GTPase activating protein belonging to the GRAF proteins subfamily characterized by an N terminal BAR domain, followed by a pleckstrin homology domain and the GAP domain. GRAF proteins play a role in endocytosis and are supposed to dimerize via their BAR domain, that induces membrane curvature.

Deficiency of any of the components of the collagen prolyl 3 hydroxylation complex causes recessive OI. The complex contains cartilage associated protein (CRTAP), prolyl 3 hydroxylase 1 (P3H1) and cyclophilin B; it hydroxylates the Î±1(I) Pro986 collagen residue. Most CRTAP mutations cause a null allele and lethal OI (10/15), while 2 hypomorphic or missense and 3 null alleles were non lethal. We report a 6 year old Egyptian boy with severe non lethal type VII OI, who has the length of a 2.5 yr old and DXA z, 3. He is homozygous for a null insertion/deletion CRTAP  mutation (c.118_133del16insTACCC). He received neridronate since 3 months of age. Similar to other CRTAP probands, his dermal fibroblasts synthesize fully overmodified type I collagen (40% OHL/L), which is well secreted into media. Only 5% of proband Î±1(I)Pro986 is  3 hydroxylated. On real time RT PCR, CRTAP transcripts are <15%  of control. CRTAP protein is absent on Western blotting, with residual P3H1 and normal CyPB levels. Dermal fibril diameters were minimally increased vs an age matched control, without loose fibril packing. We have noted a severe deficiency (10 15% of control) of collagen deposited in extracellular matrix by proband fibroblasts in long term cultures, examined by immunofluorescence; the fibrillar network surrounding proband cells was also poorly organized. This data is corroborated by similar deficiency of radioactively tagged collagen incorporated into matrix in deposition assays. Reduced collagen deposition in matrix is a novel finding which may play a role in the pathophysiology of CRTAP mutations.",2011

Recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) is caused by defects in genes  whose products interact with type I collagen for modification and/or folding. We identified a 5 generation Palestinian pedigree with both moderate and lethal forms of recessive OI caused by homozygous mutations in FKBP10 or PPIB, which encode ER resident molecular  chaperone and isomerase FKPB65 and CyPB, respectively. One  pedigree branch includes a child with moderate type XI OI and a homozygous FKBP10 mutation (c.1271_1272delCCinsA); both  parents and one sibling are carriers. FKBP transcripts in proband fibroblasts are 10% of control; the mutation is detectable in cDNA from fibroblasts cultured without emetine. FKBP65 protein is reduced in proband cells analyzed by Western blot and immunofluorescence microscopy. Transcripts for other proteins that interact with collagen, CRTAP, P3H1 and HSP47, are increased approximately 2.5  fold in proband cells, reflecting cell stress. Proband collagen gel electrophoresis reveals moderate band broadening, suggesting partial overmodification. Proband collagen Î±1(I)Pro986 3 hydroxylation is normal, as is collagen T m. Collagen in proband cells is not aggregated on immunofluorescence. This compares to two cases reported by  Alanay et al., in which cells lacking FKBP65 protein had collagen aggregation, while cells with an in frame FKBP10 deletion did not. A second pedigree branch includes two children with lethal OI. Both parents carry a 4 nt deletion in exon 5 of PPIB (c.563_566delACAG), predicting type IX OI in offspring. Mutant transcripts would likely escape NMD. Persistence of misfolded CypB would be predicted to cause severe dysfunction of the collagen 3 hydroxylation complex, compatible with the lethal outcome.",2011

Females exhibit sclerotic striations on the long bones, cranial sclerosis and craniofacial dysmorphism. Males with OSCS typically have skeletal sclerosis, malformations (omphalocoele, kidney, heart defects),  patterning defects and significant pre  and postnatal lethality. Males with milder phenotypes also have WTX mutations. In addition to skeletal sclerosis these individuals can have Hirschsprung disease, 434 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders joint contractures, cardiomyopathy and neuromuscular anomalies, but  lack congenital malformations. This study seeks to draw genotype phenotype correlations between these two groups.WTX is alternatively spliced to encode two protein isoforms (WTXS1, WTXS2). WTXS1 contains binding domains for APC, Ã catenin, WT1  and a region implicated in binding PtdIns(4,5)P2 . WTXS2 excludes the PtdIns(4,5)P2 binding domains and one APC binding domain. Mutations in WTX leading to OSCS are exclusively truncating and cluster according to phenotype; with those producing a severe phenotype located in the 5â region of the gene before the Ã catenin binding domain. Mutations leading to survival but still significant osteosclerosis are, in general, located more 3â in the gene, implying more C terminal domains also participate in bone accretion. Paradoxically mutations in two mildly affected males predicted to produce a severe phenotype  indicate that a correlation between mutation position within WTX and the phenotype severity is not absolute. Characterising new mutations and identifying new phenotypic features help to define functional domains within WTX and provide new information about the cellular pathophysiology of OSCS and the role WTX plays in morphogenesis in general.",2011

ARO is a heterogeneous disorder currently with 7 associated genes (TCIRG1, RANKL, CA2, CLCN7, OSTM1, PLEKHM1 and TNFRSF11A). Defining the genetic basis for ARO is important in determining whether HSCT therapy may be helpful or contra indicated.ADO type II (OMIM 166600) has an incidence of 1:20000 and typically has onset in late childhood or adolescence. Patients may exhibit sclerosis predominantly involving the spine with âsandwich vertebraeâ,  pelvis and skull base.

Guerrero","Hospital de la Ribera, Alzira (Valencia), Spain","BACKGROUND: Meniereâs disease is a disorder of the inner ear  that affects balance and hearing. This condition is characterized by sudden episodes of vertigo, tinnitus, a feeling of pressure or fullness in the ears, and fluctuations in hearing. The cause of Meniereâs disease is unknown, although it probably results from a combination of  environmental and genetic factors. Otoferlin belongs to a small family of membrane anchored cytosolic proteins. In the cochlea, otoferlin is  believed to play a role in exocytosis of synaptic vesicles at the auditory ribbon synapse of inner hair cells. Otoferlin is encoded by OTOF (OMIM: 603681). Mutations in this gene are a cause of neurosensory non syndromic recessive deafnessCASE REPORT: We reported a case of a 49 year old male. The first contact with the service of otolaryngology was in 2000. The patient complained of tinnitus in the left ear and vertigo. In 2004, it was detected hearing loss in left ear. In 2005, he began to have bilateral hearing loss. In 2007, last tonal audiometry detected sensorineural hearing loss (60dB) in left ear and mild hearing loss on the right ear and he was diagnosed with Meniereâs disease.RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Patient was heterozygote for R822W mutation (c.2464C>T) in OTOF gene. Role of this mutation in hearing loss is controversial; some authors associate this mutation with non  syndromic deafness, and others authors classify it as a polymorphism without a pathological role. We believe that this mutation may play a role in the developing of Meniereâs disease.",2011

It is characterized by sensorineural deafness, enlarged vestibular aqueduct (EVA) with or without cochlear hypoplasia and enlarged thyroid gland. Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene are known to cause syndromic and nonsyndromic  hearing loss associated with EVA. Mutations in this gene explain approximately fifty percent of the cases with hearing loss with EVA. A digenic model for hearing loss with the EVA phenotype has been established. Mutations in either the FOXI1 or the KCNJ10 gene in combination with a pathogenic mutation in the SLC26A4 gene have been reported to cause nonsyndromic hearing loss with EVA.The aim of our study is to investigate the prevalence of the digenic inheritance in patients with hearing loss with the EVA phenotype, and whether FOXI1 and KCNJ10 genes can be included in the routine  diagnostics of Pendred syndrome. We first investigated the FOXI1 gene in a group of patients carrying only one pathogenic mutation in the SLC26A4 gene. In a group of 32 patients only one possible splice site mutation was identified. Investigation of a group of 113 patients without pathogenic mutations in the SLC26A4 gene revealed two possible pathogenic mutations in the FOXI1 gene. The analysis of the KCNJ10 gene in the same patient cohorts is ongoing. Although this study is not yet completed, we can already conclude that yet unknown mutations in regulatory and non coding regions or other gene(s) are also involved causing hearing loss with EVA phenotype.",2011

ADPKD is a late onset multisystem disorder characterized by bilateral renal cysts and cysts in other organs including liver, pancreas and seminal vesicles. Mutations in PKD1 gene (16p13) and PKD2 gene  (4q21 q23) are present in 85% and 15%, respectively, of the ADPKD patients. Genetic diagnosis of the PKD1 gene is a tricky task because the presence of, at least, 5 pseudogenes with a 98% similarity with the 5â region of the PKD1 gene.Objective: To offer an accurate genetic diagnosis to patients with clinical diagnosis of autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD).Methodology: Genetic testing of the PKD1 gene in ADPKD patients has been carried out by sequencing throught the 46 exons of the gene.  To analyze specifically the 5â region of the PKD1 gene and discard the homologous regions of the known pseudogenes, five specific long PCRs were designed. Obtained fragments were used as templates for the amplification of the first 34 exons of the PKD1 gene by using intronic primers encompassing each exon.Results and conclusions: This protocol allows obtaining specific sequences for the PKD1 gene excluding homologous regions of the pseudogenes in normal and ADPKD samples.We can conclude that this validated protocol is a good methodology for genetic diagnosis of ADPKD, avoiding misinterpretation problems produced for the presence of pseudogene sequences. An accurate genetic diagnosis is essential to provide prenatal and preimplantational genetic diagnosis to ADPKD patients.",2011

Previously we showed that tubular epithelial injury accelerates cyst formation in inducible Pkd1 deletion mice. In these mice  expression of the Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) component Four jointed  (Fjx1) is decreased during epithelial repair but at later stages, in cystic kidneys, Fjx1 expression is increased.Additional to a role in PCP signaling, Four jointed is also implicated in the Hippo signaling pathway, which controls organ size by regulating proliferation and apoptosis. In humans, this pathway is also known from its involvement in several types of cancer, and in neurofibromatosis type 2 (NF2). The role of Hippo signaling, together with the opposing expression pattern of Fjx1 during epithelial repair and at cystic stages,  led us to investigate the activity of the Hippo pathway during these  processes.Examining the Hippo pathwayâs final effector molecule, the transcriptional co activator Yes associated protein (YAP), we found no differential expression between Pkd1 deletion mice and controls during tissue repair. However, in epithelia of dilated tubules and cysts, strong  nuclear YAP accumulation was observed, which was accompanied by up regulation of the suspected YAP transcriptional targets Birc 3, Ctgf, InhbA and Fjx1. Altered Hippo pathway activity was confirmed  in human renal ADPKD and ARPKD tissues, as well as cystic renal  tumors.

ADPKD is a systemic disorder, with cysts and connective tissue abnormalities involving many organs. The disease is caused by mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 genes. In the PKD database (http:// pkdb.mayo.edu ) 846 different variants of the PKD1 gene and 139  different variants of the PKD2 gene have been reported.The direct detection of mutations in both PKD genes was performed within research projects in our laboratory. The mutation analysis of PKD1 gene has so far detected probably causal mutations in 57  families. Only the described nonsense mutation p.R4021X was detected in three nonrelated families and the described missense mutation p.E2771K was detected in two families; other mutations are unique for individual families; 42 mutations are unique for Czech  population.The mutation analysis of PKD2 gene has so far detected probably causal  mutations in 36 families. The frameshifting mutation c.203_204insC was identified in 9 families, nonsense mutation p.Q160X in 6 families. Fourteen mutations are unique for Czech population.Two families with highly variable clinical course were identified. Trans heterozygous mutations in both PKD genes were found in the patient with end stage renal disease at 28 years. His 65 year old father with only PKD2 mutation has mild renal insufficiency and his mother died  because of uremia at 45 years. In the second family were found the influence of mosaicism and hypomorphic allele in PKD1 gene. Supported by the grant project VZ MSMT 0021620806",2011

The majority of PCH2 and PCH4 cases are caused by  mutations in the TSEN54 gene; one of four subunits comprising the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN) complex. We hypothesised that TSEN54 mutations act through a loss of function mechanism. At 8 weeks of gestation, human TSEN54 is expressed ubiquitously in the brain, yet strong expression is seen within the telencephalon and metencephalon. Comparable expression patterns for tsen54 are observed in zebrafish embryos. Morpholino knockdown of tsen54 in zebrafish embryos results in loss of structural definition in the brain. This phenotype was partially rescued by co injecting the morpholino  with human TSEN54 mRNA. A developmental patterning defect was not associated with tsen54 knockdown, however an increase in cell death within the brain was observed, thus bearing resemblance to PCH pathophysiology. Additionally, ENU mutant zebrafish homozygous for a tsen54 premature stop codon mutation die within 9 days post 437 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders fertilisation. To determine whether a common disease pathway exists  between TSEN54 and other PCH related genes, we also monitored the effects of rars2 (PCH1, PCH6) knockdown in zebrafish.

Also we suggest that a common disease pathway may exist between TSEN54 and RARS2 related PCH, which may involve a tRNA processing related mechanism.",2011

Parhon, Bucuresti, Romania. Prader Willi syndrome (PWS) is a complex disorder whose diagnosis  may be difficult to establish on clinical grounds, because of the individual variations in the phenotype and because this one develops with age.Molecular mechanisms that lead to this disorder could be  chromosomal deletions, uniparental disomy (UPD), intragenic mutations and epigenetic modifications in the process of imprinting and rarely reciprocal translocations in 15q11 q13. A common defect is noticed in all cases: loss of parental contribution in this region. This feature coupled with clinical scores and classical karyotyping have been investigated in a group of 36 patients. They were screened for genetic factors, that is: chromosomal translocations (karyotyping), deletions (FISH, fluorescent in situ hybridization) and combined genetic and epigenetic factors: microdeletions and DNA methylation  (MSPCR, methylation specific PCR and MS MLPA, methylation specific multilocus ligation dependent probe amplification). Among all clinically suspected cases, only 14 cases were confirmed by methylation analyses. The resulted MLPA scheme of microdeletions in the critical region 15q11 q13 in confirmed cases suggested the following mechanism: the imprinting defect can occur secondary to a DNA sequence modification or mutation in a cis acting factor or as  primary epigenetic modification in the absence of any DNA sequence change. Primary epigenetic modifications may occur after fertilization and lead to somatic phenotype mosaicism. An indirect trans genetic  factor implication, as the mthfr gene polymorphism, was investigated in the two families and in the 14 cases. The results of this approach suggested a further link of the PWS with the errors in the parental  methylome.",2011

The FMR1 premutation (55 199 repeats) alleles have been associated with premature ovarian failure (POF) and earlier age at menopause. The FMR1 alleles in the intermediate range (45  60 repeats) and in the high end of the normal range (>35) have also been found to be related with POF and early menopause. It has been estimated that approximately 20% of FMR1 premutation women have POF and among females with idiopathic POF, about 3.2% carries the premutation allele. These values are in accordance with our previous results in a sample from the Basque Country (3.5%). To complete the investigation, we have analyzed the prevalence of the intermediate alleles in patients with POF from the Basque Country. We have found that 4,76% of them has an intermediate allele with  more than 45 CGG repeats, but this percentage increases to 23,81% when we consider the 35 54 CGG repeats range. In the general Basque population previously analyzed, the percentage of alleles in this range (35 54 CGGs) was 6.8%.

Primary ciliary dyskinesia is a rare autosomal recessive genetic  disorder, caused by inherited defects of ciliary structure and function. The clinical features reflect the distribution of dysmotile cilia and include neonatal and chronic respiratory distress due to lack of coordinated ciliary movement. In approximately half of PCD patients,  there is apparent randomization of left right axis development, or situs inversus totalis proposed to result from defective function of embryonic nodal cilia.We have characterized a consanguineous Bedouin family from the Negev, who has two siblings diagnosed with situs inversus and respiratory symptoms and numerous healthy siblings. Linkage to the 13 genes known to be associated with the disease was negated. Further genome wide linkage analysis using the Affymetrix GeneChip mapping 250K array and microsatellite markers was performed. Homozygosity mapping identified a chromosomal region larger than 16cM.

RDEB I is characterized by predominant blistering in the body flexures and variable mucosal involvement.

However, no clear differences in position of mutated codon or nature of substituting amino acids were evident  between these RDEB I mutations and missense mutations causing other RDEB phenotypes. Our results do not support recent data that have suggested that glycine substitutions close to THD non collagenous imperfections might underlie RDEB I, as 7/11 (56%) of mutated glycine codons were sited in the central parts of THD collagenous subdomains. Our data demonstrate that RDEB I is caused by specific arginine and glycine substitutions within the type VII collagen THD, but the precise pathophysiological mechanism by which they lead to the curious inversa distribution remains obscure.

BACKGROUND: Pure restrictive cardiomyopathy (RCM) is a very  rare disease clinically characterized by impaired relaxation and left ventricular (LV) filling, dilation of both atria and absence of significant LV hypertrophy. Mutations that cause RCM have been identified in several genes that encode contractile proteins like Desmin (DES), Troponin I  (TNNT3) and Troponin T (TNNT2). TNNT2 is the tropomyosin binding  subunit of troponin, the thin filament regulatory complex which confers calcium sensitivity to striated muscle actomyosin ATPase activity. To date no benign mutations of the TNNT2 gene have been reported. Six mutations (p.I79N, p.R92Q, p.R92W, p.A104V, p.D160E and IVS15 1G>A) are characterized by a incidence of sudden death in the setting of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). In addition, one family with two affected individuals carriers of the p.F110L mutation has been reported. We here describe the clinical phenotype associated with the  mutation p.F110L of theTNNT2 gene within an italian family in which  the proband, who showed RCM, was carrying the above mutation in homozygous status.METHODS: Total DNA was extracted from whole blood. Pre mutation analysis of the TNNT2 was carried out by means of HRM on the VIIA7 platform. Anomalous melting profiles were subsequent sequenced on the ABI PRISM 3130xl. The proband and relatives underwent clinical and physical workup including cardiac magnetic resonance. CONCLUSIONS: Althought previously reported, the p.F110L mutation demonstrated to be causatively linked to the RCM phenotype in homozygous status: The carriers of the investigated family did not show any disease sign of the cardiac imaging even in adulthood.",2011

Mutations in RP1 can cause both autosomal dominant and recessive forms of RP. The RP1 gene encodes a protein of 2156 amino acids and localized in the connecting cilia of photoreceptors. Method: Familial and single RP cases were enrolled in this study, all came from consanguineous families. DNA samples from all affected individuals were genotyped using the Affymetrix GeneChip Human Mapping 250K Arrays. Genome wide scan was done using easylinkage software, multiple loci were suggested and evaluation of the potential loci was aided by homozygosity analysis. Direct sequencing of all exons of RP1 was done.Results: Three novel mutations were identified in RP1 gene in 3 different consanguineous families, and one sporadic case. All  mutations identified were clustered in exon 4; two nonsense mutations (p.K1517X, p.W1131X) in families arRP F028, sRP 19, respectively and one deletion (p.N1143I fs X25) in two unrelated families arRP F043, arRP DF01. These mutations were predicted to truncate the RP1 protein by approximately 50% of the full length and make it insensitive to nonsense mediated decay, leading to the production of truncated proteins which lacks the C terminal.Discussion:To date approximately 47 truncation mutations have been identified in RP1, all of which are located on exon 4. Among the truncation mutations only two mutations have been implicated in arRP. Here we are reporting three novel mutations to cause arRP which provides supporting evidence that mutations in RP1 can result in arRP.",2011

Aiming to further evaluate the role of FAM161A in arRP, we genotyped the two most common mutations we identified, p.Thr452SerfsX3 and p.Arg523X, and found a prevalence of  11% (21/193) and 3% (5/193) respectively, in a large cohort of Jewish RP patients from Israel and USA. Clinical manifestations of patients with FAM161A mutations varied: the majority had RP phenotype ranging from an early onset (at childhood) to relatively mild sector RP. One of the patients manifested an atypical retinal degeneration.Due to the high carrier frequency of the p.Thr452SerfsX3 mutation in some Jewish sub populations (carrier frequency of 1 out of 32 individuals), homozygosity for this mutation was also identified in families with an autosomal pseudo dominant pattern of inheritance. To study the localization of the FAM161A protein in the human and mouse retinas, we performed immunohistochemistry and Western Immunoblotting using a commercial antibody as well as custom made antibodies raised against the C terminal and an alternatively spliced  exon 4. The analysis in both species revealed a positive and intense signal in the photoreceptors inner segments as well as a weaker staining in the outer plexiform layer. No expression was evident in the  outer segments. FAM161A mutations are currently the most common cause of arRP in the Jewish population (14%).

Mutations in these genes have been associated with several forms of retinal dystrophies. There is no previous study in the Greek population on the correlation between genetic aberrations in the above mentioned genes and clinical phenotype. The first gene that was sequenced was RPE65  in families with Leber congenital amaurosis and retinitis pigmentosa.  Three exons of ABCA4 in families with Stargardtâs disease and retinitis pigmentosa and three exons of RHO in families with retinitis  pigmentosa, were also sequenced.Mutation c.272G>A (p.R91Q) in exon 4 of RPE65 was found in a patient with retinitis pigmentosa and in his healthy mother. This mutation has been associated with retinitis pigmentosa. Another important finding was mutation c.52C>T (p.R18W) in exon 1 of ABCA4.

All 18 inserted sequences showed the characteristics of LINE1 endonuclease mediated retrotransposition: the integration sites match the reported LINE1 endonuclease consensus cleavage site; the elements were flanked by target site duplications and contained poly (A) tails derived from their transcripts. Hence, these 18 pathogenic LINE1 endonuclease mediated insertions substantially add to the so far ~60 published mutations of this type and represent  the largest number of this mutation type characterized  in one single human gene.

 i nvestigation of association between 5 H tt gene and response to antidepressant drug ( c italopram) in i ranian major depressant patients,P12.225,"S. Sahraian, S. Hemati, H. NajmAbadi, K. Kahrizi, K. Kahrizi","Genetic Research Center,university of welfare and rehabilitation sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Background: The serotonin transporter (5 HTT) gene is known as  the responsible gene for interindividual variation and the genetic susceptibility for psychiatric diseases, such as bipolar mood, schizopherenia and major depression. A common polymorphism in its upstream regulatory region is caused by difference in the number of  GC rich, repetitive elements. Deletion or insertion in the 5 HTTLPR creates short (14 repeats), and long allele (16 repeats). Transcription of the L allele is 2 times more than the S allele. Since the serotonin and its transporter are involved in mood control, they can be targeted by antidepressant medications, and specially the selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor: Citalopram.Materials and methods: In this study the response of 80 patients suffering from major depression disorder, to Citalopram, and its association with their genotypes has been investigated. On the other  hand we estimated the allele frequency in Iranian population by analyzing the genotype of 100 normal samples. Our method included PCR followed by running on agarose gel.Result: frequency of each allele in normal Iranian population is near to 0.5 (L: 0.48 and S: 0.52). 69% of the patients with allele L (L/L or L/S) respond to Citalopram, while just 44% of the S/S patients did not need to change the drug.Conclusion: our study confirms the hypothesis that the L allele is associated with better response to antidepressant drug (P value,0.033. CI: 95%). But we could not prove any association between the S allele, and risk of major depression (add ratio: 0.923).",2011

Smith Lemli Opitz (SLO) syndrome is a severe  monogenic autosomal recessive syndrome associated with mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies. The responsible gene is the 7 sterol reductase (DHCR7). Both life expectancy and quality of life are severely affected by the disease. DHCR7 mutations show a large  inter ethnic variability. Our goal was to set up a diagnostic scheme that includes both biochemical and molecular genetic methodology to diagnose SLO and to detect mutations responsible for SLO in Hungarian patients.Patients and methods. Ten Hungarian patients were analyzed. Serum 7 DHC and cholesterol levels were measured using an UV spectrophotometry method and using an enzymatic colorimetric method, respectively. For mutation detection, the entire coding region of DHCR7 gene was sequenced. Results. All patients had elevated 7 DHC level (reference range <0.15 mg/L), ranging from 71.4 to 300.0 mg/L. Cholesterol levels were generally low (between 0.3 and 2.7 mmol/L). The cholesterol/7DHC ratio was abnormal in all cases. 9 patients were compound heterozygous for two causative mutations, while one patient was homozygous for a null allele. One splicing, one nonsense and 8 missense mutations were found. The detected alterations are known to be causative, except the previously unidentified c.374A>G (p.Y125C) which mutation lies in a phylogenetically conservative position. The closest known pathogenic mutations affect amino acid positions 119 and 138.Conclusions. Using biochemical and molecular genetic methods, the molecular diagnosis of ten Hungarian SLO patients could be established. In addition to the known missense, nonsense and splicing  mutations, a novel, most likely pathogenic mutation was identified.",2011

Machado Joseph disease (MJD/SCA3) is an autosomal dominant  neurodegenerative disorder of late onset, which is caused by a CAG repeat expansion at exon 10 of the ATXN3 gene (14q32.1). Clinical heterogeneity observed in MJD, however, is not completely explained by the repeat size. Although Parkinsonism seems to segregate within  some MJD families, only a few MJD patients develop parkinsonian features and, therefore, the clinical and genetic aspects of these rare presentations remain poorly understood. The main goal of this work was to investigate genetic variants, previously associated with Parkinsonâs disease (PD), in two MJD patients of Azorean background, displaying the rare parkinsonian phenotype. Patient 1 is a 40 year old female (onset at 30 years of age), initially presenting as a pure parkinsonian phenotype (similar to the phenotype previously reported for her mother). Patient 2 is a 38 year old male (onset at 33 years of  age), presenting an ataxic phenotype with parkinsonian features (not seen either in other affected siblings or in his father). Both patients presented an expanded ATXN3 allele with 72 CAG repeats. Screening  of mutations and polymorphisms in PD associated loci, namely PARK2, LRRK2 , PINK1, DJ 1, SNCA, MAPT, APOE, and mtDNA tRNA Gln  T4336C, revealed the absence of PD mutations in the analyzed loci.

In SMA, the SMN1 is deleted or destroyed by mutation, while  the neighbouring, nearly identical SMN2 fails to generate adequate levels of full length SMN protein . SMN2 copy numbers is inversely  correlated with the severity of the SMA phenotype. Total and SMN  FL  RNA production was analyzed in peripheral blood of a reduced cohort of 24 subjects: 5 with homozygous deletion of SMN1, 11 healthy deletion  carriers and 8 individuals from general population carrying 2 copies of SMN1, by using a new and highly accurate method that assesses  allele specific gene expression. We used base pair exchanges in exon7 and exon8 to distinguish between transcripts deriving from SMN1/2 genes. SMN1 and SMN2 resulted transcriptionally equivalent since observed proportions of total RNA transcripts deriving from the  two genes were in line with the respective allelic copy numbers across different genotypes. However, they are not functionally equivalent since the production efficiency of SMN  FL RNA of SMN1 and SMN2  varied between 55 90% and 5 17%, respectively. Furthermore, the production of FL RNA is highly correlated (P<0.001) with SMN1  copy numbers increase, while correlation with SMN2 copy numbers is heterogeneous supporting that SMN2 alleles are not functionally equivalent. Finally, two asymptomatic subjects bearing homozygous deletion of SMN1 showed significantly higher levels (P < 0.01) of FL RNA respect to affected individuals.An accurate evaluation of allele specific gene expression will significantly improve patients classification, follow up and basic research .",2011

We analysed seven tagSNPs of the PVR gene (rs1042640; rs1058402; rs17714931; rs203709; rs203710; rs3538129; rs714948). In SMA chronic patients, the presence of the T allele of the rs714948 polymorphism was significantly associated with a milder phenotype (type III) (chi square test p,0.041). Furthermore, there were no significant differences in the genotype distribution of the PVR SNPs between SMA or PPS patients and healthy individuals. Further investigations are warranted to unravel a possible effect of the PVR receptor in SMA. Supported by FIS 08 0729.444 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder",2011

The disorder is due, in most cases, to homozygous deletions of the SMN1 gene or, in rare cases, to small hemizygous  SMN1 intragenic mutations. Here we describe the identification and  characterization of c.835 3C>T,a novel SMA causing mutation detected  in the intron 6 of the single SMN1 allele of a type IV SMA patient.  This patient carries only 2 copies of SMN2, the partially functional  SMN1 paralog. We demonstrate both ex vivo, using minigene splicing  assays, and in vivo, by comparative multiplex RT PCR analysis of patient RNA, that c.835 3C>T is a deleterious splicing mutation that induces a modest but unequivocal exclusion of exon 7 from the SMN1 transcripts. We suggest that this effect may be due to the creation of a high affinity binding site for the splicing repressor protein hnRNP  A1 overlapping the splice acceptor site of exon 7. Importantly, the âleakinessâ of this splicing mutation explains the exceptionally mild phenotype of an ambulatory 70 year old SMA patient. Our findings support the current therapeutic strategies aiming at correcting exon 7 splicing in SMA patients, and bring clues about the level of exon 7 inclusion required to achieve a therapeutic effect.",2011
 c haracterising the pro survival function of the survival of motor neuron ( sm N) protein.,P12.234,"R. S. Anderton1,2, B. P. Meloni1,3, F. L. Mastaglia1,2, S.

Purpose: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), a neurodegenerative  disorder primarily affecting motor neurons, is the most common genetic cause of infant death. This incurable disease is caused by the absence of a functional SMN1 gene which leads to a critical reduction  in full length SMN protein. The SMN protein has been linked to  numerous cellular functions, including snRNP assembly and survival in motor neurons. However, exactly how SMN protein imparts its cell survival function is still unknown. This study aimed to characterise the pro survival function of SMN and the relationship between the anti apoptotic protein Bcl xL and SMN. m ethods: To assess the relationship between SMN and Bcl xL in vitro,  recombinant adenoviral vectors were used to over express proteins.  This relationship was also assessed in vivo using a transgenic mouse model over expressing SMN. The pro survival mechanisms used by  SMN were also assessed in an Akt/PI3 kinase inhibition model. Cell homogenates and mouse tissue were analysed using western blot analysis and real time RT PCR, to determine protein and transcript levels respectively.Results: We found a significant relationship between Bcl xL and SMN proteins. We found Bcl xL expression was significantly reduced in SMA patient fibroblasts. Over expression of SMN could increase Bcl xL levels by 6 fold, while Bcl xL over expression significantly increased SMN protein and transcript levels. Over expressed SMN protein also protected against Akt/PI3 kinase pathway inhibition, and blocked caspase 3 activation by preventing calpain mediated cleavage of procaspase 3. This study has determined how SMN reduces caspase 3  activation and links the Bcl xL protein to SMA pathogenesis.",2011

Phosphorylated osteopontin, a protein involved in bone reabsorption and in immune regulation, accumulates in serum, urine and cells cultured from TRAP deficient individuals. Patient derived dendritic cells exhibit an altered cytokine profile and are more potent than matched control cells in stimulating allogeneic T cell proliferation in mixed lymphocyte reactions.

To this end, we studied ten individuals showing features consistent with the immuno osseus dysplasia spondyloenchondrodysplasia (SPENCD). Of particular note was  the diverse spectrum of autoimmune phenotypes observed in these patients, including systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), SjÃ¶grenâs syndrome, haemolytic anaemia and thrombocytopenia. Haplotype data indicated the disease gene to be on chromosome 19p13 and linkage analysis yielded a combined multipoint lod score of 3.6. Sequencing of the ACP5 gene, encoding tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP),  identified biallelic mutations in each of the patients studied, and in  vivo testing confirmed a loss of expressed protein. All eight patients assayed demonstrated elevated serum interferon alpha activity. SLE patients frequently demonstrate an increased expression of type I interferon stimulated genes. To determine if a similar âinterferon signatureâ was present in SPENCD patients, we undertook whole genome microarray analysis, followed by confirmatory qPCR. We identified 18 genes which were greater than four fold over expressed, 15 of which are recognized as interferon stimulated genes.Our findings, recently published in Nature Genetics 1, reveal a  previously unrecognised link between TRAP activity and interferon  metabolism, and highlight the importance of type I interferon in the genesis of autoimmunity.1.

Two congenital NS patients had pathological NPHS1 genotypes: one  had three mutations (p.Cys217fsX in cis with p.P264R and trans to  p.S366R), the other homozygous for p.S366R. Three sporadic SRNS patients had pathogenic NPHS2 genotypes: p.R138Q homozygous,  p.R168H homozygous and p.R229Q/p.A295T compound heterozygous. The novel p.A295T was predicted pathogenic in silico  (SIFT http://blocks.fhcrc.org/sift/SIFT.html, polyphen http:// genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph ). PLCe1  gene analysis revealed three  homozygotes for the previously described p.R1246X (2 related/ familial, 1 sporadic). Six patients carried de novo WT1 mutations, including 5 known: one case IVS9+5G>A, one case p.R394Q, one case p.D396N, two cases p.R394W. Mutation p.R366H in the sixth case was novel, predicted pathogenic in silico. Excluding the case with p.D396N who was phenotypically male (XY karyotype), all other cases were phenotypically female, with XX karyotype in four although one p.R394W case had an XY karyotype. Heterozygous mutations were found in several familial cases: 3 with the NPHS2 gene p.R229Q mutation and 2 with the NPHS1 gene p.N188I mutation, although no di genic inheritance was observed. In conclusion 14/38 cases were characterized with pathogenic mutations in NPHS1, NPHS2, PLCe1 or WT1, indicating that molecular investigation of these genes is useful  to support definitive diagnosis and management of pediatric SRNS.",2011

Dystonia 6, a monogenic form of primary (isolated) dystonia, is associated with mutations in the THAP1 gene; however, its molecular pathophysiology is not well understood. THAP1 is a  transcription factor with a sequence specific DNA binding zinc finger domain at the N terminus (THAP domain) and a putative nuclear localization signal (NLS) towards the C terminus. Recently, we demonstrated that THAP1 specifically binds to the TOR1A promoter  and represses TOR1A expression. The TOR1A gene is involved in  primary dystonia 1.By screening a large cohort of 700 patients with dystonia, we identified several new mutations located within the THAP domain as well as mutations resulting in truncated THAP1 proteins. To investigate the  functional consequence of the missense mutations, we performed luciferase reporter gene assays demonstrating that missense mutations within the THAP domain result in a decreased or almost abolished THAP1 mediated repression of TOR1A expression . In  contrast, amino acid exchanges within the C terminal region of THAP1 did not influence its activity.Secondly, we analyzed the intracellular localization of GFP tagged wildtype THAP1, THAP1 with truncating mutations, and a missense mutation within the NLS (I149T) via confocal laserscanning microscopy. Mutations in the NLS, its complete or partial loss, resulted in an impaired transport of THAP1 protein into the nucleus.In summary, our data provide evidence that missense mutations in the DNA binding THAP1 domain as well as mutations leading to a  partial or complete loss of the NLS sequence both result in a disturbed transcription factor activity of THAP1.",2011

 i ntracellular localization of the t ype 1 VWD candidate VWF gene variants,P12.247,"E. Berber1, C. Brown2, D. Lillicrap2","1Istanbul Arel University, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Queenâs University, Kingston, ON,  Canada","Von Willebrand Factor (VWF) is a multimeric glycoprotein that  maintains hemostasis in the vascular system. VWF is secreted mainly from endothelial cells either constitutively or stored for regulated release in Weibel Palade Bodies (WPB). Partial quantitative deficiency of VWF is defined as Type I von Willebrand disease (VWD). Clinical  diagnosis of Type I VWD is complicated due to incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity of VWF. Deficiency in the biosynthestic pathway or increased clearance of plasma VWF might be responsible for the decreased VWF levels. The purpose of the study is to explore the effect of four VWF mutations (p.M771I, p.L881R, p.P1413L, p.Q1475X), that were reported as candidate mutations in Type I VWD patients on the intracellular localization of VWF in a heterologous cell system. p.M771 and p.L881 and p.P1413 are located in Dâ, D3 and A1 domains, respectively, implicated in multimerization and WPB storage.  p.Q1475 is located in A2 domain. The candidate mutations were generated on VWF cDNA expression vector by in vitro site directed mutagenesis. Intracellular localization of the variants were analyzed in the transiently transfected HEK293 cells by immunoflourescence antibody staining and confocal scanning laser microscopy. Diffuse staining was observed for the recombinant p.M771I and p.Q1475X VWF variants. However, similar intracellular pseudo WPB storage was observed as wild type recombinant VWF for the VWF variants having p.L881R and p.P1413L changes. This study demonstrated that while p.M771I and p.Q1475X mutations impair intracellular localization of the recombinant VWF, p.L881R and p.1413L mutations did not affect the pseudo WPB storage in HEK293 cells.",2011

WS is genetically heterogeneous with six genes already involved, including SOX10. Since 1998, about 50 heterozygous mutations or deletions of this gene have been described in patients presenting with WS2 or WS4, with or without myelination defects of the peripheral and central nervous system (PCWH). The mutations characterized so far  are mostly truncating mutations, removing part of the protein. Only 3 missense mutations were described. Here, we report the identification of new SOX10 missense mutations in 11 patients, associated with  a variety of phenotypes ranging from WS2 to PCWH, and describe the functional consequences of each of these mutations on the main SOX10 characteristics and functions. Altogether, our functional assays highlight deleterious effects of all the mutations tested. Some mutants present with partial cytoplasmic and/or subnuclear redistribution, some lose their DNA binding and/or their transactivation capacities on various tissue specific target genes. Intriguingly, several mutants were redistributed in nuclear foci. To our knowledge, such redistribution was not described so far during functional studies of patientsâ mutations identified in other SOX genes. Whether it is a cause or a consequence of the mutant pathogenicity remains to determine, but it could help identify new SOX10 function and mode of action.",2011

Weill Marchesani syndrome (WMS) is a rare disorder characterized  by short stature, short and stubby hands and feet, stiff joints and dislocation of microspherophakic lens which causes severe myopia, glaucoma or cataract. Despite clinical homogeneity, two modes of inheritance have been reported: autosomal dominant and autosomal  recessive. We first showed that Fibrillin 1 (FBN1) is responsible for the dominant form of WMS. We identified an in frame deletion of 24  nucleotides within a LTBP motif (exon 41, 5074_5097del) of FBN1. In the mean time, we identified three distinct mutations in ADAMTS10 (A Disintegrin like And Metalloproteinase domain (reprolysin type) with ThromboSpondin type 1 repeats) responsible for the autosomal recessive form of WMS.Following this initial study, we have collected the samples of 17 additional WMS families. We identified ADAMTS10 mutations in 2/17 patients comprising 3 novel mutations (2 missense and one nonsense mutations) and FBN1 mutations in 5/17 including 5 novel missense mutations. The screening of ADAMTS10 is still in progress for 3 cases and the screening of FBN1 is still in progress for 5 cases. Recently, three homozygous mutations in ADAMTS17 have been identified in 3 WMS cases. We therefore decided to screen ADAMTS17 in 2 cases unlinked to ADAMTS10 and FBN1. Finally we analysed the microfibrils  of fibroblasts of WMS patients by EM and showed no major changes in their microfibrillar structure.Our clinical and genetic findings suggest that ADAMTS10, ADAMTS17 and FBN1 play a critical role in crystalline lens and connective tissue formations.",2011

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal inherited disease  among Caucasians. The cause of death in 90% of the CF patients is respiratory insufficiency due to chronic inflammation caused by bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Burkholderia cepacia).Mannose binding lectin (MBL) protein is an important mediator  component of the innate immune defense system. It has been shown that MBL variant alleles causing low MBL serum levels are associated with an increased risk of different types of infections. In exon 1 of the MBL2 gene, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (nucleotide  substitutions) cause independently low serum levels of MBL at codon 52 (arginine with cysteine, allele D), at codon 54 (glycine with aspartic acid, allele B) or at codon 57 (glycine with glutamic acid, allele C). Y/X promoter polymorphism in codon  221 has a significant effect on the MBL serum levels.Polymorphisms in exon 1 and promoter region were typed by single base primer extension assay (SNaPshot) in 91 Slovak patients with cystic fibrosis and 100 healthy controls. Concentrations of MBL protein were determined in 34 patients by a Sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay. Spirometric and microbiological data were collected from medical records.No association was found for the MBL2 structural variants and  severity of cystic fibrosis lung disease. But significant association was observed between MBL2 variants and protein levels and positive implications between MBL2 genotypes, immunoglobulin G and atopy.

Up to 50 percent of all autosomal recessive nonsyndromic hearing impairment cases in different populations are caused by mutations in the GJB2 gene which encodes the gap junction (GJ) protein connexin (Cx) 26. However 10  to 50 percent of patients with GJB2 mutations have only one mutant allele. GJB6 encoding Cx30 is expressed in the same inner ear structures as GJB2, with which are normally co assemble into GJs in the cochlea. This study aims to determine whether variations in GJB6 can be the second mutant allele causing the disease in the GJB2 heterozygous cases studied.We examined 44 unrelated GJB2 heterozygous autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss subjects for any sequence variations in GJB6, using polymerase chain reaction followed by direct sequencing. Sequence analysis showed a heterozygous substitution of c.173C>T in GJB6 in one of the cases which leads to the change of p.Pro58Leu in amino acid sequence.So this allelic variation in GJB6 can be considered as the second mutant allele in patients with only one GJB2 mutant allele.

INTRODUCTION: Hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure  palsies (HNPP) is an autosomal dominant disease. Motor and sensory nerve dysfunction due to compression at common entrapment sites is the characteristic clinical presentation. Electrophysiological findings show a distinctive background polyneuropathy, independent of  superimposed entrapment neuropathy. It is characterized by diffuse sensory nerve conduction velocity (NCV) slowing. Spite of distal motor latencies are prolonged, there is a minor reduction of motor nerve conduction velocities. Up to 84% of HNPP are due to the 1.5 Mb deletion at 17p11.2 12 containing the PMP22 gene. This gene codifies for the membrane glycoprotein, Peripheral Myelin Protein 22.PATIENT: A previously healthy 31 years old male presented with dropped food due to left peroneal neuropathy with clinical improvement after 3 months. At 17 years old he presented an episode of dropped  wrist. Electrophisiological studies revealed the typical HNPP findings.METHODS: We performed the genetic testing of the CMT1A/HNPP region using allelotyping studies and MLPA technique.RESULTS: An exon 3 duplication of PMP22 gene instead of the common deletion was found.DISCUSSION: The HNPP phenotype presented in this patient with a partial duplication could be explained because of a frameshift change resulting in a loss of function of the new truncated proteinCONCLUSION: HNNP is a genetically heterogeneous disease and can be due to partial duplications in PMP22 gene",2011
 Low density lipoprotein receptor mRNA level in freshly isolated human familial hypercholesterolemia leukocytes does not correlate with plasma serum cholesterol level,J12.16,"T. Y. Komarova , A. S.

Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is a common (1:500)  monogenic disease caused by low density lipoporotein (LDL) catabolism lowering due to dysfunction of the specific LDL receptor (LDLR). We aimed to investigate if the LDLR mRNA level in freshly isolated peripheral venous blood leukocytes was inversely correlated  with plasma level cholesterol in patients with heterozygous FH.Methods. Total RNA was prepared from 1 2 millions of freshly isolated viable white blood cells and approximately 100 ng of cDNA was used in real time PCR TaqMan mRNA quantitation test. LDLR gene expression was normalized against ubiquitine C gene expression and plotted versus blood plasma total cholesterol figures.Results. We found LDLR mRNA level to be highly variable in FH blood leukocytes ranging from 0.2 to 1.8 times content of LDLR mRNA in the control individual. We found that most possible mechanism of LDLR  gene dysfunction in common deltaG197 (also known as G218del or FH Lithuania mutation) variant heterozygous leukocytes is due to mRNA level lowering and not to defects in the intracellular protein maturation and transport. Patients taking up high dose of statins usually demonstrate the elevated level of LDLR mRNA.Conclusions. We found no inverse correlation between LDLR mRNA level in peripheral blood FH leukocytes and plasma cholesterol level. So far, quantitation of LDLR mRNA in leukocytes cannot be used for prediction of disease severity and efficacy of hypocholestorolemic drug treatment in heterozygous FH.",2011

A case of prenatal diagnostics in high risk family of congenital adrenal  hyperplasia (CAH) is presented. Formerly the detection of two mutations in CYP21A2 gene was diagnosed as CAH. However it is not always correct. It is necessary to take into account the number of copies of the gene that is under consideration. In the examined family index case was a boy with a neonatal simple virilizing form of the disease with the splice mutation of intron 2 (CYP21A2 gene) in homozygous. The farther had a second normal allele (not inherited by the patient) carrying the Q318X Dup variant (inherited by the fetus). Real time PCR method was used to determine the copy number variation of CYP21A2 gene. The severe point mutation Q318X was detected in ânormalâ chromosome with a duplicated gene. The other fetal allele carried the splice mutation of intron 2 of CYP21A2 gene inherited from the mother. So, the fetus had  two mutations, but 3 copy of CYP21A2 gene. Thus our final conclusion was the fetus would be healthy.The correct definition of the Q318X variant as a severe mutation of a single functional gene or a gene duplicated nondeficient allele is very important for genetic counseling and prenatal diagnosis.",2011

The screening of classical genes linked to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) tested negative. We thus additionally tested the GLA gene. Results: Bidirectional sequencing of the GLA gene showed that the patient was hemizygous for a single base sequence change in the codon 186 (p.H186P). The peripheral leukocytes showed a decreased GLA activity. Clinical and physical examination of the patient revealed the presence of cornea verticillata and angiokeratoma on the back.Conclusion: Data in this study contribute to Fabry mutation database with a new mutation (p.H186P), confirming the reported heterogeneity in Fabry disease genotypes. The potential pathogenic effect of this novel mutation is likely due to conformational change in the enzyme structure leading to a less stable enzyme with a loss of activity.455 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorder",2011

We report an investigation carried out on forty five unrelated Italian HSP patients. All of the patients fulfilled the Harding  criteria for the  diagnosis of HSP. After giving informed consent, exhaustive REEP1  mutation screening was performed on all of the patients by PCR and direct sequencing. No mutations in the coding region of REEP1 gene were identified suggesting that the REEP1 mutation frequency may be  very low in Italian patients. Different studies carried out in European  population indicate that mutations in REEP1 account for up to 8% of  autosomal dominant HSP cases. The low frequency of REEP1 gene  mutations detected in our population could be limited by factors such as PCR based approaches that are sensitive to point mutations, as well as small deletions and insertions. A REEP1 specific multiplex  ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay is necessary to exclude multi exonic REEP1 deletion/duplication. Furthermore, the study of additional samples may increase the mutation detection rate.",2011

Hearing loss is the most common sensory disorder. The autosomal  recessive non syndromic form (ARNSHL) accounts for 72% of monogenic HL. DFNB1 is the most common cause of ARNSHL in many populations (50%) including Iran (20%).Most of the research on HL in Iran has focused on this locus. The fact that many loci are 456 Metabolic disorders involved together with the heterogeneity of the status, necessitate  studying further loci in various Iranian ethnic groups. Nine large deaf pedigrees originating from the Southern Khorasan province of Iran were selected. The families analyzed for GJB2, exon II, mutations. Affected heterozygous for GJB2 mutations were analyzed for two  GJB6 deletions (D13S1830, D13S1854). Pedigrees negative for GJB2 mutations were then subject to linkage analysis for DFNB4, DFNB3 & DFNB59 loci. Individuals were genotyped for STR markers using touch down PCR PAGE. Three out of the 9 families showed GJB2 mutations. One family carried homozygous c.35delG mutation. The other pedigree carried two different mutations; One patient was heterozygous for c.231G>A while another carried a heterozygous c.380 G>A mutation. The second alleles were not detected. The 3 rd  pedigree showed to carry heterozygote mutation of p.V27I+E114G/wt  . GJB6 deletions were not detected among the GJB2 heterozygous population. None of the remaining families showed linkage to the 3 other loci studied. Our study showed that GJB2 mutations accounts  for about 33% of affected families. These results could provide further  insight into the etiology of HL and may lead to better genetic diagnostics & counseling. This study proceeds with more loci and more families.",2011

The CYBA gene (16q24) encodes the essential subunit of the NADPH oxidase p22phox and has several allelic variants, some of them in the promoter region associated with higher transcriptional activity, as the   930A/G (rs9932581). Once there is no data regarding the frequency of this variant in the Brazilian population, it was determined in 135 SCA patients and 66 controls through direct sequencing. In the SCA group, the GG, AG and AA genotype frequency was 33.3%, 48.9% and 17.8%, respectively while in the control group it was 37.9%, 45.4% and  16.7%. The frequency of the G allele was 57.8% in patients and 64.4% in controls and of the A allele it was 42.2% in patients and 35.6% in controls, similar to the ones reported by the HapMap Project for CEU and ASW populations. There is no statistically significant difference in the genotype distribution between patients and controls although p value is equal to 0.053; the alleles are in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in both groups.

Half of the cases have genetic etiology with extraordinary genetic heterogeneity. Mutations in one gene, GJB2, are the most common cause for autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) in many different populations. GJB2 encodes a gap  junction channel protein (connexin 26), and is located on DFNB1 locus on chromosome 13q12.11 which also involve another connexin gene, GJB6. Co expression of GJB2 (connexin 26) and GJB6 (connexin 30) in the inner ear is thought to be prerequisite for the maturation of the cochlea. Mutation screening of GJB2 revealed that a high number of deaf patients carrying only one mutant allele.In this study, using PCR based direct sequencing; we searched for second mutant allele which leads to deaf phenotype. We assessed one hundred patients with ARNSHL through Iranian population bearing  first mutation in their coding exon (exon 2) of GJB2, for mutations in non coding exon of GJB2, promoter region (as the most important cis regulatory elements) of GJB2 and GJB6, and 4 known deletions through DFNB1 locus.

Approximately one half of all patients with Triple A syndrome have been shown to have mutations in the AAAS gene on chromosome 12q13, which result in loss or non  function of the encoded protein.Five unrelated families clinically diagnosed as Allgrove syndrome were evaluated for sequence variations in the AAAS gene. Blood samples were collected after informed and written consent was received. Isolated DNA derived from subjects was amplified using intronic primers. The entire sequence of the AAAS gene including regulatory region, coding regions and exon intron boundaries were analyzed for any alteration by PCR and direct sequencing.In six probands of five families, four previously reported and two  novel mutations were identified. Two heterozygote and homozygote mutations in exon 9 and the regulatory region respectively were 457 Metabolic disorders detected in one of the probands. In addition, SNPs analysis using  SNPs plotâs presented several previous reported variations in Allgrove families.This is the first report of Triple A syndrome from an Iranian population.

Methods: Thirty eight patients followed in our CF Center were considered for a prospective five years study. For the retrospective information we used data records of CF Centre. Diagnosis criteria for tuberculosis were: positive Mantoux test, BAAR positive and/or bacteriological confirmation, additional to clinical and radiological signs. Results: Regarding TB only one patient (2.6%) with CF had all the criteria  diagnosis. Tuberculin skin test was positive in 4 patients (10.5%), 3 of them being vaccinated. Despite the mandatory vaccination for TB in our country, merely in 84% from patients the vaccination was documented. Interestingly, almost 16% of patients (6 pts) were considered and treated as TB cases, before being diagnosed with CF. One patient had active TB, bacteriological confirmed (del F508 homozygous, Pseudomonas  positive and poor nutritional status).  Conclusion: We could not find a correlation between tuberculosis and CF children, despite the presence of distinctive risk factors. Although TB is a quit common condition in our area, CF children seemed to be protected against it. Further studies need to be done to evaluate this hypothesis.",2011

Investigations revealed megaloblastic anemia/pancytopenia with normal serum B12, folate and homocysteine levels. Within one week, he developed intractable seizures and cerebral folate deficiency was  diagnosed. Brain MRI showed cerebellar and cerebral atrophy. His symptoms improved dramatically on folinic acid. His biochemical profile was consistent with reduced activity of dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR), a critical enzyme for synthesis of DNA precursors. DHFR has been studied extensively as target of anti neoplastic, antimicrobial and anti inflammatory drugs, but no cases of DHFR deficiency have been previously described.Mapping identified multiple regions of homozygosity including a 3Mb region encompassing DHFR.

Same homozygous mutation was identified in the probandâs affected deceased sibling and in an unrelated child with similar clinical features. This mutation alters a highly conserved residue and was absent in 146 ethnically matched controls. It results in normal expression, but significantly reduced enzyme levels and activity. Protein modelling suggested that the Phe residue could disrupt cofactor binding and/or destabilize the protein.Our proband continues to be severely neuro developmentally delayed and was found to have cerebral tetrahydrobiopterin deficiency unresponsive to folinic acid. DHFR is important for maintenance of BH4:BH2 ratio in vascular endothelium and our findings suggest that DHFR may also facilitate BH4 salvage in the brain. The affected  children had normal development until three months, indicating the possibility of better outcome with earlier diagnosis and treatment.",2011

The pathogenesis of insulin resistance is due to a cellular defect in insulin binding, receptor autophosphorylation and tyrosine kinase activity on insulin stimulated biological activity. We  have identified a newborn patient with Donohue syndrome caused by the novel homozygous missense mutation (p.Leu795Pro). The mutation is located in the extracellular portion of the Î² subunit of the insulin receptor. We aimed to functionally characterize the post binding defect of the insulin receptor signaling in cultured fibroblasts from patient, patientâs mother and control individual.Functional characterization showed that novel INSR gene mutation in insulin receptor Î² subunit is causing a syndrome of extreme insulin resistance due to decreased insulin receptor autophosphorylation  rather than insulin binding impairment.",2011

To estimate the effect of agalsidase alfa (agalÎ±)  enzyme replacement therapy on estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR), pooled data were analyzed post hoc from three similarly designed, prospective, randomized, placebo controlled trials (RCTs  TKT010/TKT005/TKT003). m ethods: 18 54 year old males with FD received â¥1 infusion of  agalÎ± (0.2mg/kg; n,59) or placebo (n,58) every other week (EOW)  for 6 months (analysis population). The Modification of Diet in Renal Disease (MDRD) equation was used to calculate eGFR in the analysis population at baseline and â¥3 follow ups and in a subpopulation with chronic kidney disease (CKD) stages 2 3 (defined as eGFR 30â80mL/min/1.73m 2). Change in eGFR was calculated using a random slopes  and intercepts model. This longitudinal analysis allows for serial  measurements to exhibit within patient correlations.Results: Each RCT demonstrated numerical improvements in mean change in eGFR (agalÎ± vs placebo).

Background. Type 4 haemocromatosis is a rare disorder of  iron homeostasis, characterized by intracellular iron overload, hyperferritinemia and various levels of transferrin saturation, associated to mutations in ferroportin gene (SLC40A1), the sole known iron exporter in mammals. Loss of function mutations cause  ferroportin disease (FD) (type 4a), whereas gain of function mutations  cause a haemocromatosis clinically indistinguishable from that due to HFE gene (type 4b).Aims and Methods. Aim of this study was to investigate the SLC40A1 gene in 86 patients with iron overload, in whom the mutation screening of HFE gene were negative and other primary causes of iron overload were excluded. All exons and 5âUTR region of SLC40A1 gene were analyzed by dHPLC and DNA sequencing. Phylogenetic analysis, prediction analysis (Polyphen) and homology modeling study (Swiss  Prot) were performed for the novel detected variants.Results and Conclusions. We detected the novel heterozygous missense variant c.524C>A (p.A175D) in three subjects of one Italian family. The mutation co segregated with the affected family members and it was absent in 322 normal chromosomes. Interspecies comparison of ferroportin protein sequence showed that alanine 175 is strongly conserved. Software prediction and molecular modeling analysis indicate that its substitution with the negative charged aspartic acid 175 could modify the channel charge distribution, impairing the iron outing. This results indicate that the A175D is a novel loss of function mutation in SLC40A1 gene associated with ferroportin disease. A functional study for investigating in vitro the mutated iron exporter efficiency is underway.",2011
 Hereditary Hemochromatosis in Russian children,P13.18,"N. Averiyanova1, S. Polykova1, N. Jourkova1, O. Kondakova1, A. Asanov1,2, V.  Pinelis1","1Scientific Center for Childrenâs Health, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2I","M.  Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation. Hereditary Hemochromatosis type 1 (HH 1) is an inherited disorder of  iron metabolism that results of mutations in the HFE gene. The most common mutations in HFE gene are C282Y, H63D and S65C. Since allele and genotype frequencies of these three variants of the HFE gene vary in different population, the determination of their prevalence  in Russian children is important because genetic diagnostic in early stage can help to prevent the development of serious complications in these patients. There are two groups of children: 63 patients with biochemical signs of iron overload (BSIO, iron level was more 23,6 mkmol/l and transferrin saturation higher 40%) and 43 patients with somatic diseases without iron overload. All samples of DNA were genotyped by PCR followed by RFLP analysis. The H63D homozygote was identified in 14.2%, compound heterozygotes H63D/C282Y and H63D/S65C in 4.8% and 3.2% of patients with BSIO. The frequency  of H63D heterozygote was in 3.5 times higher, than in control group (P,0,0004). We did not find patients with homozygote of mutations C282Y and S65C. However the frequencies of heterozygote mutations of C282Y and S65C in patients with BSIO were higher than in control group. Thus our data have shown that the main genotypes were homozygote H63D/H63D and compound heterozygotes H63D/C282Y and H63D/S65C in children with syndrome of iron overload. Taking in account that biochemical signs of iron overload syndrome could be observed in children with different somatic diseases therefore molecular genetic study is necessary to confirm HH 1.",2011

In DR and other angiogenesis associated diseases, increased levels of cytokines, inflammatory cells, growth factors, and angiogenic factors are present. DR is one of the  primary causes of visual loss worldwide.We evaluated possible roles of interleukin 8 gene polymorphisms (1633T/C rs2227543, 251A/T rs4073) and interleukin 18 gene polymorphisms ( 607C/A rs1946518,  137G/C rs187238) in the development of DR in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes. 271 patients with DR and 113 without DR were enrolled in this cross sectional study. We did not observe an association between either interleukin 8 gene polymorphisms (rs2227543, rs4073) or interleukin 18 gene polymorphisms(rs1946518, rs187238) and DR in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes. We did not find statistically  significant differences in interleukin 8 serum levels between diabetics with the TT and AA genotype and those with other genotypes. The interleukin 18 serum levels between diabetics with the CC genotype of the rs1946518 polymorphism and those with other genotypes (AA, AC) were not significantly different. Moreover, we did not observe a statistically significant effect of the tested polymorphisms of either interleukin 8 or interleukin 18 genes on serum levels in diabetics. In conclusion, our study indicates that the examined polymorphisms of interleukin 8 (rs2227543, rs4073) and interleukin 18 (rs1946518, rs187238) genes are not genetic risk factors for diabetic retinopathy. Therefore, they may not be used as genetic markers for diabetic retinopathy in Caucasians with type 2 diabetes.",2011

In total HPRT absence classic LNS with severe movement disorders and self injurious behavior develops. Partial HPRT deficiency, or Kelly  Seegmiller syndrome (KSS) produces phenotypes with less severe or no CNS involvement. While somatic symptoms are treated with allopurinol, there is no treatment for neurological symptoms. Mutations de novo make up 30 per cent of cases, most of patientâs mothers are heterozygous carriers. Enzymatic and molecular diagnostics are in current use the latter being more reliable for carrier and prenatal testing. First Russian DNA confirmed cases, three SLN and one KSS, are presented.

Mutation Gly15Ser found in a 14 year old boy with somatic  KSS was described earlier with the same phenotype. All mothers and two patientsâ sisters proved to be carriers; in one family prenatal DNA testing was performed. Despite typical presentation, the diagnosis in all patients was significantly delayed, SLN was considered cerebral palsy and KSS was regarded as juvenile arthritis.

OBJECTIVE: To  report the follow up of a cohort of Brazilian NPC patients treated with SRT for a period of 3 years MATERIAL/METHODS: 28 patients with clinical, biochemical and/or molecular diagnosis of NPC were evaluated with a clinical protocol/physical examination and complementary exams (abdominal ultrasound, brain MRI,EEG,NCV/EMG) during 3 years of treatment with the iminosugar N butyldeoxynojirimycin (NB DNJ) RESULTS: All patients but two had started on NB DNJ after the onset of the neurological symptons. Most of the patients have the classical  childhood presentation of NPC disease, but there were 4 patients with perinatal presentation. Stabilization of mental deterioration was seen in 18 patients with neurological symptons   although in the remaining 8 patients NB DNJ appeared to slow the neurological progression of the disease, further neurological deterioration could be seen. Electrophysiological studies did not demonstrate any peripheral neuropathy. NB DNJ was only discontinued in two patients for different reasons (worsening of tremor and difficulty to manage the diarrhea episodes, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: SRT seems to be a reasonable and safe approach to treat NPC patients. Nevertheless, there are patients that seem to have a poor response, regardless of the age of starting the treatment, so it is necessary to develop better biomarkers to follow treatment responses  in NPC patients.",2011

Several mutations in the HSD17B10  gene have been  identified. Interestingly, disease severity is not correlated to the  dehydrogenase activity. Recently HSD10 was found to be part of the ribonuclease P (RNase P) protein complex in mitochondria. RNase P is an endonuclease consisting of three proteins (MRPP1, HSD10, MRPP3) and is responsible for the 5` maturation of precursor transfer RNAs (pre tRNAs) required for mitochondrial protein translation.We now analyzed whether HSD10 mutations found in patients interfere with mtRNase P assembly or function. Quantitative RT PCR analysis of different pre tRNAs sequences in HSD10 knock down cells caused accumulation of tRNA precursors. Western blot analyses of the three  mtRNase P subunits in protein extracts from patient fibroblasts as well as HSD10 knock down HEK and HeLa cells compared to control cells showed markedly reduced expression of both HSD10 and MRPP1. Expression of MRPP3 was not affected. On RNA level MRPP1 expression levels were comparable to controls, indicating that HSD10 mutations cause reduced MRPP1 protein stability. Surprisingly, pre tRNA levels in patients` fibroblasts did not differ from control cells. 463 Metabolic disorders Taken together our results indicate that HSD10 mutations found in  patients interfere with RNase P production, but this is not reflected in impaired mitochondrial tRNA processing in cultivated fibroblasts.

So far, more than 1000 sequence variants of the LDLR gene have been described. However, only one APOB mutation is prevalent in Europe.Owing to time consuming and expensive classical DNA analysis of the whole LDLR gene (DNA sequencing), we have proposed a new diagnostic tool, an APEX (Arrayed Primer EXtension) based genotyping DNA microarray called FH chip. The FH chip enables detection of 167 mutations in the LDLR gene and 1 mutation in the APOB gene simultaneously containing point mutations and small DNA  rearrangements detected in Czech FH patients and other European and Asian FH populations.To date, more than 300 FH suspected patients were analysed by using FH chip. In approximately 25 % of all cases a mutation was found, which corresponds to results obtained by DNA sequencing of the LDLR gene.The FH chip is a rapid, reproducible, specific and cost effective tool for genotyping and in combination with MLPA (Multiple Ligation dependent Probe Amplification) represents a reliable molecular genetic protocol for the large scale screening of FH mutations in the Czech population.This work was supported by grants MSMT 2B08060 and LC06023.",2011

Rinaldo","Biochemical Genetics Laboratory, Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathology, Mayo Clinic School of Medicine, Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United  States","The primary goal of newborn screening is the early diagnosis of  asymptomatic newborns affected with treatable conditions. The desire for the highest possible sensitivity has the innate risk of compromising specificity thus not only adding to the cost of management of the patients but also potentially increasing the risk of dysfunctional parent  child relationships. Approaches to reduce false positive results include: 1) utilization of as many as possible analytes and informative ratios; 2) Definition of clinically validated cutoff target ranges; 3) Implementation of second tier tests (performed on the same specimen without further patient contact).In recent years our laboratory has introduced in routine clinical practice the following second tier tests: 1) profiling of methylcitric acid, methylmalonic acid and homocysteine for disorders of propionate and methionine metabolism; 2) succinylacetone for Tyrosinemia type I (now  incorporated in the primary screening); 3) alloisoleucine for maple syrup urine disease; 4) steroid profiling for congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH); 5) Ethylmalonic acid, glutaric acid, 3 hydroxyglutaric acid and 2 hydroxyglutaric acid for Glutaric acidemia type I and Type II.Utilization of these methods has impacted our practice in three ways: First, the false positive rate of screening by MS/MS has declined to 0.05 % with a positive predictive value of 64 % (2010 metrics); Second, problematic cut off values have been optimized to reduce the risk of false negative results; Third, we are able to screen for new groups of disorders, not previously included in the screening panel such as remethylation disorders and different types of CAH.",2011

Zakharova1","1Medical Genetics Research Centre, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Russian  Childrenâs State Hospital, Moscow, Russian Federation","Niemann Pick disease type C (NPC) is an autosomal recessive  neurovisceral metabolic disease, one of sphingolipidoses. NPC is heterogeneous genetically and clinically. About 95% of cases are caused by numerous mutations of NPC1 gene. Juvenile NPC manifesting in  4 14 years, usually before 10 years, makes up about 65% of cases;  infantile, early childhood and adult forms are infrequent. Genotype phenotype correlations exist. Along with DNA testing detection of non etherified cholesterol in skin fibroblast lysosomes is in current use, but it is more complicated and less reliable for prenatal testing.  Recently pathogenetic treatment with miglustat was proposed which makes early diagnostics vital. We diagnosed NPC in five unrelated patients, in one of them the diagnosis was verified biochemically, in four others by DNA testing (in two cases only one of allelic mutations was detected). Four children age 5 9 years, three of Russian and one of Azerbaijan ethnicity, had severe juvenile NPC with dementia and multiple neurologic signs in all and evident visceromegaly in two. Adult NPC in a 18 year old Byelorussian girl presented mostly with dementia and psychiatric signs including acute psychosis while neurologic signs and splenomegaly were mild and transient which, along with normal MRI, hampered diagnostics. The genotypes were: p.Pro1007Ala/?, p.Ser954Leu/c.3614delC, p.Ser954Leu/? (in Azerbaijan patient) and  p.Ser954Leu/c.326dupT (in adult NPC). Mutation p.Pro1007Ala is relatively common in European populations (along with p.Ile1061Thr); mutation p.Ser954Leu was described previously in German and Canadian patients in heterozygous or compound heterozygous state like in ours; mutations c.3614delC and c.326dupT are novel.",2011
Correlation between lipid profile / cardiovascular risk and type of mutation in Portuguese patients with familial hypercholesterolemia,P13.39,"A. C. Alves, A. M. Medeiros, M. Bourbon",Instituto Nacional de SaÃºde Dr,"Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal. Familial Hypercholesterolemia (FH) is characterized by high levels  of LDLc in plasma, accelerated atherosclerosis and increased risk of premature coronary heart disease. FH results from mutations in three genes involved in lipid metabolism: LDLR, APOB, PCSK9. It is known that FH patientsâ phenotype is heterogeneous varying with different  conditions.The aim of this study was to analyse the biochemical profile of patients with genetically diagnosed FH in accordance with the mutations in different genes and the different types of mutations identified in the LDLR gene to identify whether there is a correlation between these variables in Portuguese patients.Biochemical parameters, total cholesterol (TC), LDLc, HDLc, triglycerides, ApoB and ApoA of 325 patients with FH were analyzed by SPSS using ANOVA and Tukey. Patients with mutations in the PCSK9 have LDLc and TC levels significantly higher than patients with mutations in the remaining two genes. There is no significant difference in these parameters between patients with mutations in LDLR and APOB genes, although all values are higher in patients with mutations in the LDLR. Patients with nonsense mutations in the LDLR gene present values of TC, LDL and ApoB statistically higher than in patients with missense mutations. The comparison between the other categories showed no significant changes in biochemical parameters. Patients with mutations in the PCSK9 have a more severe phenotype than patients with mutations in LDLR and APOB genes.The type of mutation (in different genes or different mutations in LDLR) is important in determining cardiovascular risk in FH patients.",2011

Blangero","Texas Biomedical Research Institute, San Antonio, TX, United States","Metabolic syndrome is a complex disorder that is reaching pandemic  proportions and is a strong predictor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Currently little is known about the importance of epigenetic variation in disease risk. We performed preliminary analysis quantifying relative DNA methylation in 190 Mexican Americans, within  the San Antonio Family Heart Study, at 1,505 gene centric CpG sites using an Illumina GoldenGate assay to identify epigenetic correlates with metabolic syndrome related phenotypes. Linear models were used to identify a number of consistent correlations across multiple dimensions of metabolic syndrome for many CpG sites in highly relevant genes. For example, CpG methylation within POMC was correlated with fasting (p,0.031) and 2 hour (p,0.020) insulin, high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL C; p,0.002) and triglycerides (p,0.009) as well as with NCEP:ATPIII defined metabolic syndrome  (p,0.011). Deficiencies in POMC are strongly correlated with obesity  and it is possible that methylation reflects another mechanism by which decreased expression influences body weight. Methylation of CpG sites in other candidate genes such as RYK , RUNX1T1  and TGFBR3  were also correlated with various metabolic syndrome phenotypes including fasting and 2 hour glucose, fasting and 2 hour insulin, body mass index, waist circumference, HDL C, triglycerides and metabolic syndrome. Of interest is the fact that methylation at each of these sites was associated with a more detrimental profile of phenotypes. We are currently employing next generation sequencing technologies and large scale methylation arrays to look for genome wide alterations in DNA methylation that might contribute to metabolic syndrome in a larger cohort of 1,200 individuals.",2011

The TSH receptor gene (TSHR) encodes a transmembrane receptor ,  present on the surface of follicular cells which mediates the effects of  TSH secreted by the anterior pituitary. Is critical for the development and  function of the thyroid gland. It belongs to a subfamily of heptahelical  G protein coupled receptors that have a common structure consisting  of seven transmembrane segments, three extracellular and three  intracellular loops, an extracellular amino terminal domain, and an  intracytoplasmic carboxyl terminal tail. Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) affects 1 in 3000   4000 newborns.  In Bashkortostan the incidence is 1 in 3800 births. We examined the frequency of TSHR mutations  among patients with permanent primary  congenital hypothyroidism and in the general population of Republic  Bashkortostan (Russia).In total, 82 children aged 8 months to 17.2 years with CH diagnosed by neonatal screening were investigated. All patients had markedly elevated TSH levels concomitant with low peripheral thyroid  hormone levels. A reduced thyroid volume or absence of the thyroid gland was determined by ultrasonography or/and scintigraphy. This constellation of clinical findings warranted the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism.We found 4 patients with moderate to severe CH who had monoallelic mutations in TSHR. Observed mutations included one previously characterized mutation (R450H) and three uncharacterized mutations (L653F, L440I, and R531W).The results demonstrate that mutations in the TSHR gene can be  responsible for clinical manifestation of congenital hypothyroidism in a relatively small subset of children.

We tried to replicate this finding in obese children and adolescents undergoing a one year lifestyle intervention (Obeldicks progam). Subjects and methods: 453 overweight and obese children and adolescents (10.8 Â± 2.6 years, BMI SDS 2.4 Â± 0.5; 55% girls) were genotyped for rs324420 (C/A) by restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. Participants received a balanced diet, containing 55 En% carbohydrates, 30 En% fat and 15 En% proteins. Moreover, they took part in an exercise therapy once a week. Blood was 469 Metabolic disorders taken at baseline and after one year of intervention. Anthropometric  (height, weight, BMI and BMI SDS) and plasma parameters (total cholesterol, LDL cholesterol, HDL cholesterol, triacylglycerides, glucose, insulin and HOMA) as well as blood pressure were measured.Results: Both BMI and BMI SDS improved significantly among all  subjects. The mean systolic blood pressure was also lowered and concentrations of HDL cholesterol increased significantly. However, none of the measured parameters were associated with FAAH rs324420 genotypes.Conclusion: We did not detect association of FAAH genotypes with weight reduction in overweight and obese children and adolescents. Hence, the previous finding in adults could not be confirmed. As the length (1 year to 3 month) and the set up (hypo caloric diet in adults versus physical activity plus balanced meals) of the interventions  differed, these parameters might have influenced the different results.Funding: NGFNplus01GS0820, BMBF 01KU0903",2011

Backgroud: Maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY) is a  heterogeneous group of disorders characterized by early onset of non insulin dependent diabetes and autosomal dominant inheritance. At least 9 MODY causing genes have been identified.Aims and Methods: we aimed to investigate the promoter P2 of HNF4A  gene in 97 families with suspected MODY, that were negative for mutation in coding sequence of the most common MODY genes GCK, HNF1A and HNF4A. The proximal P2 promoter was screened from  365 using dHPLC and sequencing.Results: the  169 C>T was detected in a female patient (diabetes at age 8) and her brother (diabetes at age 11), both displaying phenotype of HNF4A/MODY1. The variant was absent in 214 normal chromosomes. The substitution lies within a known binding site for HNF 1alpha in a conserved nucleotide position. Evidence for the pathogenicity of this  mutation was obtained in transient plasmid transfection assays with mutated and wild type P2 promoter. Luciferase activity assay revealed a markedly decreased activity of the mutant allele compared to the wild type in cancer cell lines and in freshly isolated rat primary pancreatic islets.Conclusion: our results indicate that the  169C>T mutation at the HNF4A P2 promoter gene plays a causative role in MODY, due to an impairment of the HNF 1alpha dependent activation of HNF 4alpha in adult beta cell. This is the first time that the P2 promoter activity is investigated in freshly isolated primary rat pancreatic islets.

Molecular basis of this most prevalent disorder is frequent mutations in phenylalanine hydroxylase gene. PAH require tetrahydrobiopterin as a cofactor for conversion of  phenylalanine to tyrosine. Loss of PAH activity results in accumulation of phenylalanine in tissues and biological fluids that cause the formation of secondary neurotoxic metabolites. To date more than 600 mutations in the PAH  gene have been identified and submitted to the PAH and  HGMD databases. The prevalence of phenylketonuria In Europe or among the general Caucasian populations is about 1 in 10,000.

Results: Five patients presented during early infancy (2.5 months   6.5 months) with vomiting, poor feeding, lethargy, hepatopathy and nonketotic hypoglycemia. Three of them developed coma and seizures. One patient presented at the age of 21 months with hypoglycemic coma  and seizures, psychomotor retardation and one patient was diagnosed before clinical symptoms. Two patients were born preterm with severe intrauterine growth retardation. During metabolic crisis all patients had typical acylcarnitine profile, increased level of 3   hydroxydicarboxylic acids in urine, elevated liver enzymes, moderate lactic acidemia and hyperammonemia. All patients had homozygous mutation 1528G>C in HADHA gene. Acute hepatopathy during prenancy was reported  in three cases. After infancy progressive retinopathy occurred in three patients, two patients had episodes of severe muscle pain and rhabdomyolisis during intensive physical activities or illnesses.One patient died at the age of 6.5 months before diagnosis was made, other died at the age of 10 years during acute gastroenterocolitis. c onclusion: LCHAD deficiency is frequent fatty acid oxidation  disorder in Latvian population.

 Neurodegeneration in Cobalamin A Deficiency,P13.54,R. Gavrilova,"Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States","Cobalamin (Cbl) A deficiency is rare cause of Cbl responsive  methylmalonic academia. It results from defect in mitochondrial Cbl reductase, encoded by MMAA. Treatment with B12 reduces the amount of MMA. Liver or stem cell transplantation has been applied in some cases. Despite therapy patients suffer progressive neurodegenerative  course resulting in significant disability. The metabolic defect underlying nerve degeneration is unknown but some authors propose synergistic toxic effect of methylcitrate, malonic acid, propionyl CoA on respiratory chain and tricarboxylic acid cycle resulting in brain damage.An 11year old boy born to consanguineous marriage developed normally until 3 years of age when he suffered a metabolic stroke during an intercurrent viral illness. Brain MRI showed bilateral stroke like lesions in the globus pallidus. He was diagnosed with Cbl A deficiency based on elevated MMA responsive to vitamin B12  challenge and was found to have homozygous c.1034delT frameshift mutation in MMAA. Despite cyan cbl carnitine and metronidazole therapies, protein restriction and stem cell transplant within 1.5 years after his acute presentation he lost ability to walk and his speech output decreased due to severe dystonia that started in left upper extremity but progressively generalized. Dystonia improved with deep brain stimulation at 11 years.Standard treatment of Cbl responsive MMA has improved survival but has not modified neurodevelopmental outcome. Stem cell transplantation did not alter disabling neurological deterioration in our patient but DBS improved dystonia. The mechanism underlying progressive brain damage is uncertain but new therapies targeting proposed secondary mitochondrial respiratory chain dysfunction and  antioxidants should be investigated.",2011
 m utation in the OTC promoter may cause symptoms of ornithine carbamoyltransferase deficiency,P13.55,"O. Luksan1, M. Jirsa1, M. HÅebÃ­Äek2, L.

Mutation analysis of the coding regions of OTC, the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of citrulline in the liver, fails in 20 25% of patients manifesting OTCD. In such cases, the disease may be caused by gross gene rearrangements  or defects in regulatory regions of the gene.In our study we examined the 5âUTR, identified and functionally characterized OTC regulatory elements and estimated the  pathogenicity of a promoter variation c. 366A>G found in a female patient with mild symptoms of OTCD.Three alternative transcription start sites located 95, 119 and 169 bp upstream the iniciation codon were determined within the OTC 5â UTR. The human OTC promoter and enhancer elements were predicted from the homology with rat and mouse and functional functionaly  characterized using dual lucisferase reporter assay. Functional studies revealed a moderate transcriptional activity of the promoter in both liver and kidney derived cells. Significantly higher and liver specific OTC expression was observed when promoter interacted with the distal enhancer. The promoter variation c. 366A>G did not affect the function of the promoter alone but it disrupted the interaction of the promoter with the enhancer, which was observed as 50% decrease of the transcriptional activity.Our data indicate that full transcriptional activity of human OTC  promoter depends on an upstream enhancer. The promoter   enhancer interaction contribute to tissue specific expression of OTC in the liver  and the disruption can lead to the manifestation of OTCD.Support: GAUK25116899910",2011

The oculo cerebrorenal syndrome of Lowe is an X linked recessive  disorder characterized by the triad of congenital cataracts, mental retardation and incomplete renal Fanconi syndrome. Additionally, various neurological signs may be present such as developmental delay, seizures, hypotonia, areflexia or behavioural disturbances.  Patients show progressive growth retardation and may develop a debilitating arthropathy. Although phenotype might vary, congenital cataracts have been assumed the first and obligatory sign.We report a 13 year old patient showing the complete phenotypic spectrum of Lowe syndrome who was not classified as having the disease due to the absence of any ocular involvement. OCRL gene  analysis revealed a Gln199X (c.760T; according to ENST00000371113) mutation and a silent variant (c.G270A; p.Arg35Arg) in the patient. We suggested that the synonymous substitution might effect  correct splicing, however an in vitro model revealed only normally spliced transcripts. Moreover, RNA obtained from the patientsâ EBV transformed lymphocytes showed presence of both transcripts due to alternative splicing of exon 18a.Taken together, the silent variant provided no clue for the milder phenotype in the context of a classic Lowe mutation (p.Gln199X). This finding extends the phenotypic spectrum caused by OCRL mutations  and illustrates that even in the absence of congenital cataracts Lowe syndrome has to be assumed, if all other features are present.471 Metabolic disorder",2011

Mutations have been detected in mitochondrial and nuclear genes, but many patients remain unresolved and new genes are likely involved. In a consanguineous family, patients presented since early childhood with easy fatigability, exercise intolerance and lactic acidosis  in blood. In muscle, subsarcolemmal mitochondrial proliferation and a severe complex I deficiency were observed. Exercise intolerance and complex I activity improved by supplementation with a high dosage of riboflavin. Homozygosity mapping revealed a candidate region on chromosome three containing six mitochondria related genes. Four genes were screened for mutations and a homozygous substitution was identified in ACAD9 (c.1594C>T), changing the highly conserved arginine 532 into tryptophan. This mutation was absent in 188 ethnically matched controls. Protein modelling suggested a functional  effect due to loss of a stabilizing hydrogen bond in an Î± helix and a local flexibility change. To test whether the ACAD9 mutation caused the complex I deficiency, we transduced fibroblasts of patients with wild type and mutant ACAD9. Wild type ACAD9, but not mutant ACAD9, restored complex I activity. An unrelated patient with the same phenotype was compound heterozygous for c.380G>A and c.1405C>T, changing arginine 127 into glutamine and arginine 469 into tryptophan respectively. These amino acids were highly conserved and the substitutions were not present in controls, making them very likely pathogenic. Our data support a new function for ACAD9 in complex I function, making this gene an important new candidate for patients with complex I deficiency, which could be improved by riboflavin treatment.",2011

Mutations in CYP7B1 were identified in SPG5 families presenting with a pure form of HSP (Tsaousidou et al, 2008; Goizet et al, 2009). CYP7B1 encodes  the cytochrome P450 7Î± hydroxylase implicated in cholesterol metabolism, and plays a role in the alternate/acidic pathway for primary bile acid production. Increased levels of oxysterols, 27  and 25 hydroxycholesterol were recently identified in the plasma of 4 SPG5 patients (SchÃ¼le et al, 2010). Besides the potential consequences on hepatobiliary functions of altered bile acids synthesis in SPG5, in vitro studies suggest that 27 hydroxycholesterol   an endogenous selective estrogen receptor modulator   may decrease bone mineral density, inhibit the cardiovascular protective effects of estrogens and increase  oxidative stress in retinal pigment epithelial cells. Therefore, we investigated 9 SPG5 patients from 6 families in order (i) to confirm that plasma oxysterols can be used as biomarkers in HSP due to CYP7B1 mutations, and (ii) to explore the non neurological manifestations that may result from the altered oxysterols metabolism in SPG5 patients   i.e. bone homeostasis, hepatobiliary and cardiovascular functions, retinal trophicity. Preliminary data suggest that the elevation of plasma 27 and 25 hydroxycholesterol in our SPG5 cohort is associated with systemic complications, and in particular reduced bone density. Better delineating the non neurological manifestations that may occur in SPG5 should also shed light on the best therapeutic approaches aiming at lowering 27 hydroxycholesterol levels.",2011

Classical xanthinuria frequently presents with renal calculi and occasionally leads to renal failure. Classical xanthinuria is classified into two categories. Classical xanthinuria  type I lacks only XDH activity by XDH gene mutations, while the type II results from dual deficiency of XDH and aldehyde oxidase due to mutations in the molybdenum cofactor sulfurase (MOCOS) gene. Classical xanthinuria is easily differentiated by means of the allopurinol loading test. As allopurinol is converted to oxypurinol by both XDH and aldehyde oxidase, oxypurinol is detected in urine and serum of subjects  with classical xanthinuria type I upon administering allopurinol.We studied fifteen Japanese hypouricemic subjects with classical xanthinuria from fourteen different families at Jikei University School of Medicine. We report the spectrum of mutations identified to data. Eleven subjects were xanthinuria type I, while three subjects were xanthinuria type II. We could not verify a causative mutation of XDH and MOCOS genes in one subject with xanthinuria. The percentage of xanthinuria type I in xanthinuria was 78.6 %.

The vast majority of FHH is caused by autosomal dominant loss of function mutations in the gene CASR, which codes for the calcium sensing receptor (CASR). 474 Metabolic disorders Loss of function mutations in CASR impair the feedback inhibition  of parathyroid hormone secretion in response to a rise in the blood calcium concentration. Thus, higher than normal blood calcium levels are necessary to inhibit release of parathyroid hormone, resulting in hypercalcemia associated with normal or mildly elevated levels  of parathyroid hormone. Material: We report the case of a 11 month old female baby, admitted for the closure of a large persistent ductus arteriosus, who was accidentally discovered with a high blood calcium level of 2,99 mmol/l ( normal values 2,10  2,60), ionized calcium 1,38 mmol/l (1,03   1,30), normal phosphatemia, having actually no symptoms of hypercalcemia.

Aryan","Special Medical Center, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Niemann Pick disease, an inborn error of sphingomyelin catabolism,  results from the deficient activity of the lysosomal hydrolase, acid sphingomyelinase (sphingomyelin phosphodiesterase; E.C.3.1.4.12). Two allelic forms of this autosomal recessive disorder have been delineated based on their distinct phenotypes. Type A Niemann Pick  disease is a severe neurodegenerative disorder of infancy characterized by progressive psychomotor retardation, hepatosplenomegaly, and death by three years of age. In contrast, Type B Niemann Pick disease is a nonneuronopathic disorder characterized by hepatosplenomegaly, respiratory involvement, and survival into adulthood. The clinical course of patients with Type A disease is quite uniform, whereas the severity among Type B patients is more variable. In fact, some mildly affected Type B patients may survive into the sixth decade of life. Our case was a 6 year old girl characterized by hepatosplenomegaly,  respiratory involvement, hyperlipidemia and thrombocytopenia who affected by Niemann Pick type B. Enzyme activity in peripheral blood lymphocytes for this patient was less than 10% of controls. Whole SMPD1 gene sequencing analysis of this proband depicted a homozygote mutation in codon 36 which changes codon Valine to Alanin in exon 1. For confirmation of the mentioned mutation, we analyzed exon 1 of SMPD1 gene for her parents. Sequencing analysis showed heterozygote state for this alteratio",2011

Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is one of the leading causes of blindness  and has an unclarified pathogenesis in which genetic predisposition may play a role. Hyperglycemia increases oxidative stress which may trigger the development of DR. SOD2 is a key enzyme which protects cells from oxidative damage. Functional polymorphisms in SOD2  gene may result in predisposition to DR. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible association between Val16Ala polymorphism (rs4880) in SOD2 gene and DR, in type 1 diabetes.We enrolled 189 unrelated Caucasian patients with type 1 diabetes divided into a group A   patients with diabetes duration over 15 years without DR (n,70) and group B   patients with DR (n,119). Genotyping was achieved by Taqman. Statistical analysis was performed using DeFineti software and Cochran Armitage correction was applied. Genotype spread analysis indicated that ValVal genotype is more frequent in the DR group (22.68%) compared with controls (17.14%). There was a significant deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in the control group (X2,8.22,F,0.343). Presence of homozygous 16Val allele seem to increase the risk for DR (OR,1.333), while the 16Ala allele seems to be protective (OR,0.750), but he results are not statistically significant (p,0.55). Corrected OR for both alleles are not reaching statistical significance. This is the first study of Val16Ala polymorphism in DR from Romanian population. Although this is a small study that suggests there is no association between Val16Ala polymorphism and DR, further studies are necessary in order to clarify the role of SOD2 gene in DR.",2011

It has become increasingly apparent that genetic factors like retinoid related genes may be involved in the pathogenesis of the disease. The need to increase the survival has pushed the limits of therapy to fetal  surgery and endoscopic interventions. In severe cases, it is preferred nowadays to perform a temporary fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion in order to stimulate lung development. Case report: We present a case of a male preterm child with right CDH. The CDH was diagnosed at 19 weeks of gestation and at 28 weeks a fetal endoscopic tracheal occlusion was performed. He was born by C section at 32 weeks, birth weight of 3000 g. Even from birth the child suffered from severe hypoxia and pulmonary hypertension necessitating tracheal intubation and mechanical ventilation. During the first 24 hours of life the SaO2  remains under 80% despite the aggressive resuscitation, inotropic support, 100% O2, surfactant and Ilomedin administration. The patient died 36 hours after delivery because of severe pulmonary hypoplasia and pulmonary hypertension. Conclusion: Despite the modern and sometimes heroically treatment methods for CDH the final negative outcome is sometimes inevitable. Accurate medical lung development assessment is mandatory, before any attempt of surgical therapy. Sometimes pregnancy interruption should be considered as the best way to avoid sufferance.",2011

MethodsWe conducted a 12 months prospective study on 20 patients with CF aged between 4 and 12 years, from Romanian National Cystic Fibrosis Centre. They followed the protocol consisting in airway clearance games (flow ball, TrainAir) and aerobic activities five times a week for 40 minutes. Children have been tested at inclusion and at the end of the study using the Questionnaire of life quality in CF. For data analysis we used Spearmanâs rho.Results After one year we observed an increase in sleep quality in 20% of cases and 30% of them enhanced the nutritional status. The majority of patients increased the level of fitness during ADL. Moderate fatigue in effort decreased from 60% to 50 % .Initially 40% of them followed constant educational activities compared to 60 % finally. Hospitalizations due to exacerbations decreased from 60% to 45% compared to the last year. Good correlation (at the 0.01 level) was  observed between mucus quantity and fatigue during ADL, educational activities and sleep quality.Conclusions:Combined airway clearance games and physical exercises are a very good choice to optimize the quality of life in children with cystic fibrosis.Acknowledgement: This paper was supported by a research grant from CNCSIS RO, TE36.",2011

The pharmacological chaperone AT1001 (GR181413A, migalastat hydrochloride, 1 deoxygalactonojirimycin) is currently in Phase 3 clinical development as a potential therapy for Fabry disease. AT1001  selectively binds and stabilizes Î± Gal A, increasing total cellular levels and activity for some mutant forms (defined as âresponsiveâ). Responsive mutant forms can be determined readily in male Fabry patients; however, this is more challenging in female patients due to the expression of wild type and mutant forms of Î± Gal A. We assessed whether pharmacogenetic information could aid in the identification of Fabry patients with responsive mutant forms of Î± Gal A. Fabry disease associated mutant forms (473 in total) were individually expressed in HEK 293 cells; ~60% responded to AT1001 incubation. GLA mutations  from the subset of mutant forms that responded to a clinically relevant  concentration of AT1001 (10 ÂµM) were categorized as âeligibleâ; others were considered âineligibleâ. Phase 2 clinical trial results were then retrospectively analyzed by grouping subjects, based on genotype, into these two categories. Oral administration of AT1001 increased Î± Gal A more frequently in males with âeligibleâ (13/14) versus âineligibleâ (0/3) mutations. Importantly, AT1001 treatment decreased kidney interstitial capillary globotriaosylceramide by â¥50% more frequently in male and female subjects with âeligibleâ (7/10) versus âineligibleâ (2/7) mutations. Thus, the Î± Gal A response measured in vitro for each mutant form  may identify Fabry patients who can respond to AT1001 and are more likely to benefit from AT1001 therapy.",2011

In the brain of fragile X animal models, we found a decreased mRNA expression of several subunits of the GABA A  receptor. GABAA receptors are the major inhibitory neurotransmitter  receptors in the mammalian brain. This ionotropic receptor plays a role in learning and memory, hyperactivity, insomnia, epilepsy, anxiety and depression; processes that are disturbed in fragile X patients. This indicates that a dysfunction of the GABA A receptor is involved in the  behavioural problems observed in the fragile X syndrome. The GABAA 476 Therapy for genetic disorders receptor is therefore a target for rational treatment of the syndrome. In a set of experiments we already demonstrated that GABAergic drugs are able to correct some of the symptoms in fragile X mice. However, before therapy on patients can be initiated, it is required to validate GABAergic abnormalities in human. As post mortem studies  are not feasible, we set up a study to image and quantify the GABA A  receptor distribution in vivo. Using positron emission tomography  (PET) with [11C]Flumazenil, a known GABAA receptor antagonist, as a  radioligand we determined the amount of GABAA receptors in the brain.  We found an overall significant decrease (6 17%) in GABAA receptor  availability in fragile X patients. The decrease was most prominent in specific brain regions, including cortical regions. This confirms that the GABAergic system is involved in the pathophysiology of the fragile X syndrome and suggests that GABAergic drugs might ameliorate  several symptoms of fragile X patients, improving their quality of life.",2011

However, the transcription factors that are required for this upregulation have not been identified. Similarities between the HU and sodium butyrate (SB) pathways suggest Creb1 as a potential candidate. Reports indicate that in K562 cells, both HU and SB (1) activate p38  MAPK and (2) selectively induce Ggamma gene expression. In the case of SB, this induction seems to be mediated through a Creb1 binding site present in the promoter region of the Ggamma (and not Agamma) gene. In this study, we have investigated the possible role of Creb1 in the HU pathway. We show that transient or stable knockdown of Creb1 blocks HU mediated gamma globin induction in K562 cells. However quantitative ARMS PCR (Amplification Refractory Mutation System) experiments suggest that HU does not solely induce Ggamma expression in this cell line. Electrophoretic mobility shift  assays (EMSAs) indicate that HU treatment leads to increased levels of Creb1 complexes binding to the Ggamma promoter. Collectively, these results suggest that Creb1 is necessary for gamma globin induction by HU, a role which may in part be mediated through the Ggamma promoter Creb1 binding site.",2011

Material and method: This study is an analysis of all the cases with the diagnostic of HOI admitted in our hospital from January 2008 to December 2010 Results: There were a total number of 134 patients with age ranging from 2 months to 8 years. In 54.3 % of the cases were localized on the neck and head, 22.7% on the torso, 13.86% on the limbs, 3, 24% on the genitals, and multiple in 5.9%.

The outcomes of treatment were good in the majority of  the cases with no major complications, except one case of keloid formation after the excision of a very large hemangioma. Conclusions: The treatment of hemangioma varies according to affected area. In most of the cases surgical excision is sufficient. For large hemangioma and those located in esthetic areas the most promising treatment is now propranolol. Aethoxisclerol is used only when propranolol therapy has no results and the surgical excizion is prohibited.

Using the native sequence, glycogen storage was reduced significantly in heart and diaphragm, with near normalization of heart morphology and function, but only to a limited extent in skeletal muscle. Challenge of the treated animals with  the rhGAA protein demonstrated robust specific immune tolerance. The use of the codon optimized GAA gene (GAAco) resulted in even higher levels of GAA activity in all affected tissues, including skeletal muscle and an almost complete reduction of glycogen storage. Using the GAAco construct, skeletal muscle function was maintained and initial results also indicate reduced glycogen levels in brain tissue.Thus, ex vivo hematopoietic stem cell lentiviral vector mediated gene  therapy results in correction of the Pompe phenotype in the mouse model and would be suitable for further clinical exploration.",2011

 Development of the exon exchange method for repair of mutant nebulin transcripts,P14.11,"J. Laitila , K. Pelin","Department of Biosciences, Division of Genetics, University of Helsinki,  Finland, Helsinki, Finland","The nebulin gene (NEB) has 183 exons encoding transcripts up to  26 kb in length. Mutations found in NEB are dispersed throughout the gene, i.e. no mutational hot spots are evident. Mutations cause autosomal recessive nemaline myopathy, distal nebulin myopathy and core rod myopathy, for which no therapy is available. The size of NEB  limits the options of gene therapy development. Thus, our research has focused on methods correcting the mutation carrying transcripts. Recent advances in RNA reprogramming technologies have raised the possibility to develop RNA therapies for correction of mutations in NEB at the pre mRNA level. Spliceosome mediated RNA trans  splicing (exon exchange), i.e. splicing between two separate pre mRNA molecules, allows the replacement of mutant exons with wild type ones at the pre mRNA level. Targeted exon exchange requires the spliceosome and a target pre mRNA, both provided by the cell, and a pre trans splicing RNA molecule (PTM) which is produced from an expression vector transfected into the cells. PTMs can be designed to carry out three forms of exon exchange: 3â , 5â  or internal exon replacement. We have developed PTMs for NEB 3â  and internal exon replacement. PTMs designed carry one or several wild type NEB exons to replace exons from target pre mRNAs produced from NEB minigene expression vectors in cell cultures. We have obtained  successful results from our 3âexon exchange and first internal exon exchange experiments. We are now focusing on further development of the internal exon replacement method, which would be the most useful one for correction of mutations in NEB transcripts.",2011

Although progressive neurodegenerative diseases are commonly associated with ageing, they also affect children and young adults. Cerebellar ataxias are rare neurodegenerative disorders, which can be thought of as a syndrome,  which has many different causes, genetic or environmental. These diseases are progressive and very serious illnesses with no treatment available so far. A common feature in the early stages of these diseases lies in mitochondrial dysfunction and oxidative stress induced by a deregulation of oxidative phosphorylation.The Harlequin (Hq) mouse, where a spontaneous mutation in the AIF gene results in a drastic reduction of its expression, gradually develops a cerebellar ataxia associated with mitochondrial degeneration and a complex I deficiency. Although all cerebellar neurons finally die after 6  months, granule neurons are affected first with a gradual death starting around 2 months.We have designed an in vitro protocol combining media and selective factors to push hES toward the neuronal lineage and make them differentiate into functional neurons expressing granular markers of the cerebellum. We have also produced granule neuron progenitors to attempt cell replacement in ataxic Hq mice. We show that progenitors implanted in the cerebellum can differentiate into mature human neurons and integrate into the adult mouse cerebellum. Motor coordination was improved in cell treated animals up to three months after implantation. Our results bring a proof of principle that human embryonic stem cell based therapies might be relevant for treating neurodegenerative disorders.",2011
 Oxidative stress and sperm DNA quality in couples experiencing recurrent spontaneous abortions,P14.13,"M. B. Shamsi, K. Yadav, K. Kumar, D. Deka, R. Dada","AIIMS, New Delhi, India","introduction:  Sperm has dynamic and critical role in embryogenesis  that extends clearly beyond fertilization. Supraphysiological Reactive  Oxygen Species (ROS) levels damage both mitochondrial and nuclear genome. During embryonic development, nucleotide alterations if unrepaired are lethal to accurate transmission of genetic information  and affect the embryonic viability and post natal health. Nicks/breaks and/or nucleotide modification caused by unregulated free radical concentration due to inefficient antioxidant machinery leads to sperm DNA damage. This study was planned to understand the association of seminal ROS, antioxidant capacity and sperm DNA damage in men of couples experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss following spontaneous conception.478 Therapy for genetic disorders material and m ethods: Male partners of 77 couples experiencing  recurrent pregnancy loss and 41 fertile controls were included in study.  Seminal ROS were measured by luminol induced chemiluminescence. Seminal total antioxidant capacity (TAC) was assessed by commercially available kit. Sperm DNA integrity was quantified by single cell gel  electrophoresis (comet assay). Semen analysis was done according to WHO 2010 guidelines. Mann Whittney test was applied for statistical significance.Results: Significantly increased ROS and reduced seminal TAC was  observed in patients (p,0.002; p,0.014 respectively) as compared to controls. In patient group the number of sperms with DNA damage was higher (p,0.024).Discussion: Seminal oxidative stress is a major cause of sperm DNA  damage. DNA damage leads to recurrent spontaneous abortions,  childhood cancers, genetic and epigenetic defects in offspring. Oxidative stress and sperm DNA damage assessment have better diagnostic and prognostic capabilities and should be included in diagnostic workup of patients experiencing recurrent pregnancy loss.",2011

Aartsma Rus","Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts  and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is the most prevalent type of hereditary vascular dementia and is recognized as an important cause of stroke and dementia in the young. CADASIL is caused by characteristic missense mutations of the NOTCH3 gene which lead to  an uneven number of cysteine residues in the proteinâs ectodomain. This causes misfolding of the protein which leads to aggregation of NOTCH3 at the surface of vascular smooth muscle cells, a key factor in CADASIL pathophysiologyWe are currently testing a novel application for antisense mediated protein modulation, named âcysteine quantity correctionâ, as a treatment  strategy for CADASIL. In this approach we use antisense mediated exon skipping to intervene in protein synthesis at the pre mRNA level. By inducing the skipping of specific exons, we re establish an even number of cysteine residues in the NOTCH3 proteinâs ectodomain. Our hypothesis is that by this modulation the protein maintains function, but loses toxicity. With this approach, we can target ca. 70% of CADASIL related mutations using the same set of antisense oligonucleotides.Technically, we are able to induce the desired exon skipping in our CADASIL cell models as shown by RT PCR and sequencing analysis. Currently, we are evaluating whether the induced cysteine quantity  correction reduces CADASIL associated NOTCH3 accumulation in vitro, using Western blot and immunocytofluorescence.Our hypothesis and preliminary, but promising, in vitro results will be  presented.",2011
Production of K562 cells stably expressing m BD2 shRNAs,P14.16,"S. Farashi, M. Banan","Genetic Research Center, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","MBD2 (Methyl Binding Domain 2) has been shown to repress the  human Î³ globin gene in mouse models. We have previously shown that transient MBD2 knockdown (35%) using siRNAs results in induction of Î³ globin expression (1.75 fold) in K562 cell line. In order to achieve higher levels of knockdown and possibly g globin induction, a lentivirus  system was used for shRNA delivery. First, functionality of the system was verified by using a lentiviral transfer vector containing a GFP expression cassette. Next, five lentivirus transfer vectors containing MBD2 shRNAs were screened for target gene knockdown by qRT PCR in HEK 293T transient transfection assays. The two most effective shRNAs gave >70% mRNA knockdown levels after normalization for transfection efficiency. These vectors were subsequently packaged and used to transduce K562 cells. Upon infection and antibiotic selection, a cell population stably expressing MBD2 shRNAs was obtained. The  amount of MBD2 knockdown and Î³ globin expression was assessed in these cells by relative qRT PCR. In one cell line (shRNA 3), MBD2 was knocked down by 73% and g globin was induced 5 fold. In the other (shRNA 5), MBD2 was down regulated by 51% and g globin increased by 11.75 fold. These results support those of the transient RNAi experiments. Moreover, these cell lines can now be used for delineating the mechanism of MBD2 repression.",2011

The urinary GAG level decreased to the initial value. A multidisciplinary physicians checkup including 6 MWT, ECG, computed tomographic scanning, US of the abdominal cavity, echocardiography, respiratory function test, clinical blood and blood serum biochemistry was performed before and after the therapy.Results: Two children aged 5 6 years showed a general improvement of movement abnormalities and lung function in contrast with adult patients. A progressive arthropathy temporarily remitted in the 16 year old patient; there was no effect in the 13 year old. Mitral and  aortic regurgitation and/or stenosis commonly decreased after ERT. US of the abdominal cavity did not show significant decreased hepatosplenomegaly in the patient aged 13.Idursulfase is generally well tolerated, although infusion reactions did occur. c onclusion:  The response to ERT appears to depend on the severity  of the individualâs condition and the age at which the treatment begins.

Differentiated mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) can be therapeutic source for the cure of type 1 diabetes. The aim of current experiment is to explore  the possibility of derivation of insulin producing cells from bone marrow MSCs by overexpression of pdx1 transcription factor. In this study rat MSCs were isolated and identified by flow cytometry. Then, MSCs were transduced by lentiviruses harboring pdx1 and pdx1 expressing cells selected by puromycin. The appropriate expression of exogenous pdx1 was confirmed in level of mRNA and protein using RT PCR and immunofluorescent analyses. In addition to ectopic expression of pdx1, differentiating medium containing nicotinamid and betamercaptoethanol ( Nico/betaME) used to efficient differentiation  of MSCs into beta cells. Then, the expression of islet markers was investigated by quantitative RT PCR. The immunoflurescent showed a nuclear localization of pdx1. Pdx1 expressing MSCs transcribed specific pancreatic endocrine markers such as endogenous Pdx1, Ngn3, Glucagon and insulin regardless to using Nico/betaME, but the quantitative RT PCR showed a high increase in all markers except insulin, in Nico/betaME treated cells compared to non treated cells. The beta cells derived from MSCs also expressed glucokinase and Glut2 indicating these cells have the glucose sensing ability. In contrast, treated MSCs didnât express P48; it implies these cells have been committed to endocrine linage. In conclusion, MSCs as an available resource can have impacted in cell based gene therapy of type1 diabetes.",2011

In vitro experiments and subsequent treatment of mdx mice showed a promising improvement in the form of functional recovery (Welch et al. 2007). This led us to investigate  the effect of PTC124 on nonsense mediated premature termination in two of the three cerebral creatine deficiency syndrome genes, namely the creatine transporter gene (SLC6A8) and the guanidinoacetate methyl transferase gene (GAMT). We obtained PTC124 from Selleck Chemicals (Houston, Texas, USA) and incubated patientâs cell lines containing nonsense mutations with 17ÂµM of PTC124 for 46 days (SLC6A8, n,2) and 14 days (GAMT, n,3) and collected cells every 7 days. We measured intra cellular creatine content and formation of 2H3 13C2 creatine using a two step derivatization procedure,  followed by quantification with GC MS. With all cell lines we found no increase of function, indicated by low intra cellular creatine content (SLC6A8) (Rosenberg et al. 2007) and no formed 2H3 13C2 creatine (GAMT) (Verhoeven et al. 2004) as compared to the wild type cell lines. This led us to conclude that PTC124 (Selleck Chemicals) cannot induce ribosomal readthrough of the five tested nonsense mediated termination codons in the SLC6A8 and GAMT gene. However, since we were unable to validate the obtained compound, these results could also have been caused by the initial inability of our PTC124 to function correctly.",2011
 i nhibition of superoxide dismutase expression with progestins as a mechanism for the treatment of familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.,P14.20,D. E. Benjamin,"Cenoxsys Corporation, Princeton, NJ, United States","Familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (fALS) is a severe motoneuron  disease, and mutations in superoxide dismutase (SOD1) are responsible for at least 20% of cases. fALS is inherited in an autosomal dominant manner and disease severity is mutant gene dose dependent. Knockout of the SOD1 gene does not result in motoneuron disease  in the mouse. Thus reduction of mutant SOD1 expression has been proposed as a mechanism for treatment of fALS. We aimed to identify compounds that selectively decrease cellular levels of SOD1. A library of known drug like molecules was screened for the ability to decrease SOD1 levels in several cell lines including Hek 293 cells and HeLa cells. Cells were seeded into 96 well plates and test compounds were added 24 hours later. Several progestins (IC50: 100 300 nM) dose dependently decreased SOD1 levels following 96 hours of incubation. Total cell number, cell morphology, and total protein level was not  affected in the transformed cell lines. However, in HeLa cells, all progestins exhibited significant cytotoxicity, as expected based on the reported toxic effect of siRNA to SOD1 in specifically cancer derived cells. Norethindrone, a progesterone analog, selectively decreased SOD1 cellular levels by 80% (IC50: 92 nM). The progesterone receptor antagonist mifepristone dose dependently inhibited this effect, supporting a receptor mediated action. In the G93A mouse model of fALS, 7 days intraperitoneal administration of norethindrone (100 Âµg/Kg) decreased spinal cord levels of mutant human SOD1 in preliminary studies. Collectively, these results suggest that further investigation of progestins in the treatment of fALS is warranted.",2011

It is caused by functional loss of SMN1, resulting in progressive degeneration of spinal Î± motor neurons. SMA severity is mainly determined by SMN2 copy number. Consequently, a number of therapeutic approaches has been developed directly  targeting SMN2. We have shown that valproic acid (VPA), a short chain fatty acid histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi), significantly increases SMN levels in vitro, ex vivo and in VPA treated SMA patients. However, in a first pilot clinical trial with VPA only 1/3 of the patients exhibited markedly increased SMN levels, whereas the remaining were non responders. To identify the crucial factors accounting for this observation, we established fibroblast lines from >30 SMA patients undergoing VPA therapy. Response to VPA was concordant between blood and fibroblasts in about 65% of cases. By microarray analysis  we identified four significantly differentially expressed transcripts between both patient groups. Strikingly, non responders lacked any differences in expression between mock  and VPA treated cells, suggesting a failure of HDAC inhibition. Indeed, the most differentially expressed gene is involved in fatty acid transport suggesting an altered VPA import/export. By employing different analytical and biochemical methods, we could identify striking differences in fatty acid uptake and metabolism, which most likely account for the observed differential response to VPA.Our data sheds first light on the molecular mechanisms influencing VPA response and may not only have a major impact on the therapy of SMA but also on other diseases treated with VPA, like epilepsy or migraine.480 Laboratory and quality management",2011

Bone and teeth are major source for genomic DNA due to their higher stability. DNA degradation and also contamination with PCR inhibitors could interfere with DNA amplification and  contamination with bacterial DNA might be a reason especially when we work with aged DNA (aDNA). Here we report effect of bacterial DNA contamination in DNA extracted from Iranian human remains from the war with amplification using real time PCR.Material and methods: DNA was extracted from aged bone (remained from 20 30 years before) and also E.coli. PCR based techniques were used to amplify both human and bacterial DNAs separately using different set of primers. aDNA was mixed with bacterial DNA and amplification was performed using both set of primers. Result: Amplification of artificially contaminated aged bone DNA with E. coli DNA didnât showed any negative interference or inhibition by bacterial DNA. Even in some samples, amplification was performed just in the cases of mixture aDNA with bacterial DNA. We tested this with real time PCR and conventional PCR results were confirmed by amplification of mixed DNA in 2 3 cycles before the aDNA.Conclusion: It seems bacterial DNA does not inhibit amplification of human aDNA. Even in some instance it might act as a biological indicator for the presence or absence of PCR inhibitor.",2011

Huntingtonâs disease results from a CAG repeat expansion in the first  exon of the Huntingtin gene; this is measured routinely in diagnostic  laboratories. The European Huntingtonâs Disease Network REGISTRY project centrally measures CAG repeat lengths from fresh blood samples; these were compared with the original results from 121  laboratories across 15 countries. We report on 1326 duplicate results: there was a discrepancy of reporting the upper allele in 51% of cases; this reduced to 13.3% if acceptable measurement errors proposed by the American College of Medical Genetics were applied. Duplicate results were available for 1250 lower alleles and discrepancies occurred in 40%. Clinically significant discrepancies occurred in 4.0% of cases with a potential unexplained mis diagnosis rate of 0.3%. There was considerable variation in the discrepancy rate among 10 of the countries participating in this study. 348/1326 DNA samples were  re analysed by an accredited diagnostic laboratory based in Germany, with concordance rates of 93% and 94% for the upper and lower alleles respectively. This became 100% if the acceptable measurement errors were applied. The central laboratory correctly reported allele sizes for 6 standard reference samples, blind to the known result.Our study differs from external quality assessment schemes in that these are duplicate results obtained from a large sample of patients across the whole diagnostic range. We strongly recommend that laboratories state an error rate for their measurement on the report; they should participate in external quality assessment schemes and  use reference materials regularly to adjust their own internal standards.",2011
Efficiency of neurogenetic testing during a 10 year period,P15.09,"N. Teran, H. JakliÄ, B. Peterlin","Institute of Medical Genetics, University Medical Centre Ljubljana, Ljubljana, Slovenia","Neurogenetic disorders have low prevalence (<1/10000) in the  general population. Specific genetic tests are used to help diagnose neurological diseases depending on the type of mutation. In this study we analysed the diagnostic yield and estimated the costs of negative results of neurogenetic testing. We performed a retrospective review of the data in the database of the molecular genetic laboratory of the Institute of Medical Genetics, UMC Ljubljana, involving a 10 year period (2000 2010).Overall, a mutation was identified in 30.9 % of the tested patients (n,443). In patients with muscle weakness (n,205) the mutation detection rate was 38.4 % with an estimated cost of 55,781.95 EUR per negative result. In patients with neuropathies (n,99) the mutation detection rate was 36.1 % with an estimated cost of 53,046.85 EUR per negative test. In patients with chorea (n,100) a positive result  was obtained in 42.5 % (22,889.25 EUR per negative result). The diagnostic yield in patients with congenital malformations was 8.9 %; the estimated cost per negative result was 70,931.25 EUR. For ataxias (n,16) the mutation detection rate was 11.9 %; the estimated cost of negative result was 36,071.85 EUR.The diagnostic yield and costs per negative results varied among the different diagnostic groups, reflecting utilization guidelines and selection criteria for neurogenetic testing. The results of this analysis may assist the clinician when weighing the decision whether to test or not. Guidelines including new testing strategies would contribute to appropriate and cost effective use of molecular genetic testing in general.",2011
 External quality assessment schemes for molecular testing on blood spots,P15.10,"A. Wittner, Z. Deans","UKNEQAS Institute of Human Genetics, Newcastle upon Tyne, United  Kingdom","Newborn screening is performed in many countries by analysing dried  blood spots to detect abnormal levels of chemicals as indicators of inherited blood and metabolic disorders. Confirmation of clinical diagnosis is often provided by molecular testing and DNA analysis is part of the cystic fibrosis (CF) and Medium chain acyl CoA  dehydrogenase deficiency (MCADD) screening protocols of several newborn screening programmes in Europe.UK NEQAS for Molecular Genetics is an accredited, self funding, not for profit organization providing external quality assessment schemes (EQAs) for a wide range of molecular disorders since 1991. The scheme has offered âCF molecular testing on blood spots EQAâ for the last five years and introduced âMCADD molecular testing for the common ACADM mutation c.985A>G on blood spots EQAâ in April 2010. Three blood spot samples are distributed 4 times a year and  participants are required to analyse them according to their routine protocol and report the genotyping results. These are assessed for genotyping accuracy. To reflect the laboratory testing, the âMCADD extended mutation screening on blood spots pilot EQAâ was introduced last year.To further enhance these EQA schemes the development of artificial blood spots has been initiated. Using simulated EQA material will enable the distribution of samples with mutations/polymorphisms with the potential to cause interference during analysis or interpretation. The laboratories thereby would be provided with a measure of the robustness of their testing protocol and would be assured of the standard of their service.483 Laboratory and quality management",2011

Detection of cells carrying BCR/ABL fusion is extremely important in monitoring response to treatment, remission and relapse in CML patients. Among the molecular diagnostic techniques used amplification of BCR/ABL fusion transcript  , RT PCR is regarded to be most sensitive.In this experimental study, we compared RT PCR and NASBA techniques to determine quantitatively the number of bcr/abl transcripts. In order to make an accurate comparison, the sequences of primers and probes used in both techniques were the same. Fusion transcripts were synthesized and RNA was extracted from K562 leukemic cell line. A serial dilution of both fusion transcript and RNA was prepared; then sensitivity of both techniques was determined. RT PCR and NASBA reaction products were labelled using equal ratios of DIG 11 dUTP  and DIG 11 UTP respectively. Following denaturation , hybridization reactions were carried out with specific probes. The products were incubated in streptavidin coated microplates. Then, the plates were washed, anti DIG conjugated to peroxidase added and using ATBS as substrate, enzymatic activity was determined by absorption at 405 nm.The our results showed that specificity between two techniques is equal but RT PCR ELISA sensitivity is about a 100 fold more than of  NASBA ELISA. Also, leukemia cell detection rate in sample by RT PCR ELISA and NASBA ELISA is 4 and 400 cells, respectively.Interpretation and Conclusions: Therefore, despite the NASBA technique have not need to thermal cycler PCR but have a low sensitivity than RT PCR and it is not suitable method for quantitative assessment.",2011

Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common vascular disease that  includes deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary thromboembolism. It is one of the leading causes of mortality across the world; with an annual incidence range from 1 5 cases per 1000 individuals. Various investigations examined the prevalence of thrombophilic  gene mutations in patients who have suffered from a pulmonary thromboembolism. We aimed to determine the association of specific inherited thrombophilias with pulmonary thromboembolisms. A total of 85 subjects were included in this study: 53 patients who had been affected with a pulmonary thromboembolism and 32 healthy controls in the North West of Iran. Total genomic DNA was extracted from 2 ml EDTA anti coagulated blood samples by a standard salting out method and amplified by PCR using gene specific primers. Amplification Refractory Mutation System (ARMS PCR) method was used in the  identification of PAI 1 ( 675 I/D, 5G/4G), Factor XIII (Val34Leu), Beta fibrinogen ( 455G/A), Factor VII (Gln353Arg), Glycoprotein Ia (807C/T) and tPA (intron h D/I) gene mutations. Our data indicates that there were statistically significant differences in PTE patients compared with controls, when studying the frequency of these specific gene mutations. In conclusion, we propose that compound thromboplilic gene mutations rather than a specific gene mutation can be a risk factor for the occurrence of pulmonary thromboembolisms; however, further studies on a larger scale are required in order to gain a better understanding of the role of these gene mutations in pulmonary thromboembolisms.",2011

Wichmann1","1Helmholtz Zentrum MÃ¼nchen, Munich Neuherberg, Germany, 2QIAGEN  GmbH, Hilden, Germany","Biobanks are a key resource for unravelling the molecular basis of  diseases and the identification of new targets for disease therapy. One challenge of biobanks is to maintain huge collections of limited samples sizes for future studies. In consequence, there is need for a high quality amplification of limited amounts of nucleic acids. In this project  we focused on the standardization and qualification tools of whole genome amplification (WGA) in the context of biobanks. A new simple quantitative PCR based test system was developed, which enables the standardization of the complete whole genome amplification process including (1) the quality and quantity of the template DNA and (2) the resulting WGA products. For validation of the performance, the system was tested in different laboratories using template DNAs of different quality. Consistent results could be achieved in the quality system test of the WGA products reflecting the amount and the fragmentation  degree of the initial template DNA. The system was also implemented in the KORA Biobank with SNP genotyping technology. The results of the WGA test system were correlated with the concordance of genome wide SNP genotypes from genomic template DNA and from 484 Laboratory and quality management the corresponding WGA products. Based on this result, a general  standardized protocol for WGA in biobanking will be developed.Furthermore, the concept of this project is to make the WGA solution available to other national and international biobanks.

Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS; OMIM 194050) is caused by a  hemizygous contiguous gene microdeletion at 7q11.23. Supravalvular aortic stenosis (SVAS), mental retardation, overfriendliness, and ocular and renal abnormalities comprise typical symptoms in WBS. Although fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is considered the  gold standard technique and the microsatellite DNA markers provide  efficient confirmation, Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) could also be used. MLPA is a new technique for measuring sequence dosage, allowing large number of samples to be processed simultaneously and thus significantly reducing laboratory work. We assessed the performance of MLPA for the detection of microdeletions by comparing the results with those generated using microsatellite markers. We studied 77 patients with clinical diagnosis of WBS using five microsatellite markers: D7S1870, D7S489, D7S613, D7S2476,  D7S489_A and commercial MLPA kit (SALSA P029). A total number of 77 patients were tested. Using five markers together, the result was informative in all patients. The microdeletion was present in 64 (83.1%) patients and absent in 13 (16.9%) patients. Maternal deletions were found in 56.3% of patients and paternal deletions in 43.7% of patients. The size of deletions was 1.55 Mb in 57/64 patients (89.1%) and 1.84 Mb in 7/64 patients (10.9%). Our results show a high degree of concordance between MLPA and markers assays for all samples tested. We conclude that even though the microsatellite markers were important for determine the parental origin, MLPA is a highly sensitive, quick and cost effective alternative and can provide helpful information for clinical diagnose of WBS.",2011

The initial premise for this work was that the measure should be transparent and flexible to allow comparisons between laboratories and to take account of developing technologies. The unit chosen for  the measure was the final diagnostic report which is easily counted. As reports vary in complexity a weighting system was required. The unit chosen to weight the reports was âan ampliconâ which is again easily counted. The weights were then assigned to a band from A to G. The basic unit, Band A, is sample reception and DNA extraction with a weight of one. Band G has a weight of 40.This system was piloted in 6 UK laboratories. The laboratories varied in size and testing repertoire to ensure a broad base for the trial.Work is ongoing to align cytogenetic workload units with these molecular units and to validate the measure by comparing workload assigned to the external quality assessment schemes of UK NEQAS.

A microfluidic liquid handler was used to prepare pre coated 96 well PCR plates with M13 tailed  exon specific primers.  PCR was done in 96 well plates followed by high resolution melting  analysis on the LightScanner. However, analysis of the data can be a bottleneck in the process. Therefore, an automated analysis method for high resolution melting was developed to scan multiple exons of genes and assess the quality of the data generated. A custom program was developed to appropriately set normalization and overlay parameters, and calculate a Curve Spread value that provides an estimate of the degree of variability among clustered melting curves. The Curve Spread allows quality control of primer plates and master mix lots, and provides a standard metric to identify variant sequences  as melting curves that do not cluster well with wild type samples. A higher Curve Spread value reveals a greater degree of variation and allows unknown samples containing variants to be easily identified. This software has been applied to the analysis of 70 clinical specimens suspected of having mutations in CYBB, variants of which are the major cause of X linked chronic granulomatous disease. Standardized analysis eliminates user bias and automatically provides a Curve Spread value that can be used as a guide for judging the quality of amplification and to set decision criteria for reflex testing to identify the specific sequence of variants.",2011

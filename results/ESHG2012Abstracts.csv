" Myocardial infarction: common disease, common variants, common mechanisms",PL1.3,H. Schunkert,"LÃ¼beck, Germany","The primary manifestation of coronary disease occurs often suddenly and unexpectedly in form of myocardial infarction. Thus, the prediction of silent atherosclerotic alterations in coronary arteries is a highly relevant medical need. Recent genomic research identified numerous genetic variants that associate with a higher prevalence of coronary disease. At present, associa   tion with coronary artery disease has been demonstrated at more than 40 chromosomal locations with risk alleles increasing relative risk by 8 25 % per allele. Moreover, genetic variants primarily affecting cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or LDL cholesterol were shown to affect the risk of coronary disease as well.This enormous progress has been facilitated by genome wide association studies. By nature, these studies focus on frequent alleles. Thus, the alleles that have been identified to increase the risk of coronary disease are also relatively frequent in our population, i.e. allele frequencies range between roughly 10 90%. As a consequence, virtually all individuals of our populati   on carry a variable degree of genetic predisposition. More recently, the focus turned to rare variants with more profound effects. In this regard, the do   main of human genetics, i.e. family based research and counseling, received more attention   once again. The presentation will address how this infor   mation can be utilized for a better understanding of disease mechanisms as well as for genomic prediction of coronary artery disease.",2012
 Genome sequencing of childhood medulloblastoma brain tumors links chromothripsis with TP53 mutations a discovery with clinical implications,PL2.1,"J. O. Korbel1, P . Lichter2, S. Pfister2","1European Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany, 2DKFZ, Heidelberg,  Germany","Somatic structural variations typically occur progressively during tumor development. Recent findings, however, suggest an alternative mechanism, involving chromosome shattering and reshuffling (âchromothripsisâ), the  underlying mechanistic basis of which is unknown. In the context of the  International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC) Pediatric Brain Tumor  Project (www.pedbraintumor.org), whole genome sequencing of a Sonic Hedgehog medulloblastoma (SHH MB) brain tumor from a patient with a germline TP53 mutation (Li Fraumeni syndrome) revealed massive, com  plex rearrangements resulting from chromothripsis. Integrating TP53 sta  tus with genomic rearrangement data in additional medulloblastomas re  vealed a striking association between TP53 mutation and chromothripsis in SHH MBs. Unexpectedly, five seemingly sporadic SHH MB patients with chromothripsis harbored TP53 germline mutation. Our analysis of additio   nal tumor entities substantiated a link between TP53 mutation and chro  mothripsis, beyond general genomic instability. Among these, we observed  a strong association between somatic TP53 mutations and chromothripsis in acute myeloid leukemia, and an increased occurrence of chromothripsis in Li Fraumeni Syndrome associated malignancies other than medullobla   stoma. Our findings implicate p53 in the initiation of, or cellular reaction to, chromothripsis   a novel role for the âguardian of the genomeâ. In additi  on, our findings are of relevance for clinical management and personalized  medicine, since TP53 germline mutations represent an âactionableâ genetic  variant. Regular cancer screening in TP53 germline mutation carriers can lead to a survival benefit. Furthermore, in patients with known Li Fraumeni  Syndrome, administration of high dose radiotherapy or DNA damaging che   motherapy has to be thoroughly weighed against the potential of these mo  dalities of readily inducing secondary malignancies.",2012

Only a minority of cases are caused by  mutations in the genes encoding With No lysine (K) kinases 1 and 4. We carried out linkage analysis combined with whole exome sequencing in  two informative French families and identified mutations in the KLHL3 gene.  This gene encodes for an actin binding protein that recruit substrates for  the Cullin3 based ubiquitin ligase complex. Direct sequencing of 47 addi   tional cases revealed 11 inherited missense KLHL3 mutations in 16 fami  lies with dominant or recessive transmission. Analysis of the CUL3 gene re  vealed de novo splice site mutations clustered around exon 9 and observed in younger and more severe cases. Three dimensional structural modeling showed that the mutated KLHL3 residues are located within conserved mo  tifs at the surface of the molecule, whereas all CUL3 mutations lead to a loss  of 57 residues corresponding to a segment linking BTB and RING binding  domains of the protein. KLHL3 is highly expressed in the distal nephron like the Na + Cl  cotransporter (NCC) and its inhibition by RNA interference leads  to an increase of NCC expression at the cell membrane. We further showed that KLHL3 and NCC co immunoprecipitate in HEK293T cells, suggesting that KLHL3 directly mediates a negative regulation of NCC expression, pro bably through ubiquitination.In conclusion, we identifies KLHL3 and CUL3 as members of a new pathway regulating ion transport in the distal nephron and thus blood pressure.",2012

Split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) is a congenital disorder characteri   zed by severe malformations affecting the central rays of hands and/or feet. The combination of SHFM and long bone deficiency represents a distinct entity termed SHFLD. Although six different loci/mutations (SHFM1 6) have ESHG Plenary Lectureswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 20125 www.eshg.orgbeen associated with SHFM the underlying cause in a large number of cases  is still unresolved. We performed array CGH in a SHFM/SHFLD cohort which detected micro  duplications on chromosome 17p13.3; a locus previously associated with SHFLD. Detailed analysis of 17 families revealed that this CNV serves as a  susceptibility factor for a highly variable phenotype with reduced penetran  ce, particularly in females. Compared to other known causes 17p duplica   tions appear to be the most frequent cause of SHFLD. A ~11.8kb minimal critical region was identified encompassing a single gene, BHLHA9 , a puta   tive basic helix loop helix transcription factor. Whole mount in situ hybri dization showed expression restricted to the limb bud mesenchyme under   lying the apical ectodermal ridge (AER) in mouse and zebrafish embryos.  Mouse models suggest that a defect of the central AER leads to the SHFM  phenotype. Knock down of bhlha9 in zebrafish resulted in shortening of the  pectoral fins indicating a role of this gene in limb development. In summa  ry, we demonstrate microduplications encompassing BHLHA9  associated  with SHFLD and non Mendelian inheritance characterized by a high degree  of non penetrance with gender bias. Our finding shows that rare CNVs can serve as a susceptibility factor for congenital disease, a mechanism which  may explain increased recurrence risk in conditions otherwise considered  to be sporadic.",2012

Aminoglycosides are the most commonly used antibiotics world wide. Although highly effective, their use is restricted by side effects such as ototoxicity in a significant subset of patients. However, underlying pa thogenesis and pharmacogenetic risk variants are largely unknown. Here we show that dysfunction of an actin remodeling protein (named here ARP) can result in a drug inducible disturbance of actin dynamics and an irrever   sible hearing impairment in humans. By positional cloning, we identified a homozygous missense variant, p.L329P , in ARP as a cause of aminogly   coside induced hearing impairment in a large consanguineous family from Turkey with 4 affected individuals. Complete ARP loss in knock out mice leads to hearing loss associated with shortened stereocilia. We demonstrate that the protein is a component of the tip complex that regulates stereocilia length and that it interacts with whirlin. The mutation severely impairs this interaction in vitro. Extensive biochemical studies showed that myosinXVa can stabilize the ARP whirlin interaction complex, and we show for the first time that kanamycin has a negative effect on this complex formation, which is even more pronounced in mutant complexes, thereby explaining the de   velopment of hearing loss in affected individuals after aminoglycoside treat ment. Taken together, we link ototoxicity after aminoglycoside treatment to actin dynamics and this finding will help in devising strategies to counteract this severe side effect of aminoglycosides.",2012

Hip osteoarthritis (HOA) is one of the most disabling and common joint dis   orders with a large genetic component which is, however, still ill defined. To  date, genome wide association studies (GWAS) in osteoarthritis (OA) and  specifically in HOA have yielded only few loci, which is partly explained by the heterogeneity in OA definition. Therefore, we here focused on radiogra  phically measured joint space width (JSW), a proxy for cartilage thickness  and an important underlying intermediate trait for HOA. In a GWAS of 6,523 individuals on JSW of the hip, we identified the G allele of rs12982744 on chromosome 19p13.3 to be associated with a 5% larger joint space width  (P, 4.8Ã10 â10). The association was replicated in 4,442 individuals from 3  UK cohorts with an overall meta analysis P value of 1.1Ã10â11. The SNP was  also strongly associated with a 12% reduced risk for HOA (P ,1Ã10 4). The  SNP is located in the DOT1L gene, which is an evolutionarily conserved hi  stone methyltransferase. Immunohistochemical staining of DOT1L protein  during mouse limb bud development supports a role for DOT1L in chondro genic differentiation and adult articular cartilage. Silencing of Dot1l inhibi  ted chondrogenesis. Dot1l knock down reduces proteoglycan and collagen  content, and mineralization during chondrogenesis. In the in vitro ATDC5  chondrogenesis model system, DOT1L interacts with TCF and Wnt signal   ling. These data are a further step to understand the role of Wnt signaling during chondrogenesis and cartilage homeostasis. DOT1L may represent a therapeutic target for osteoarthritis.",2012

Moreover, DNA methylation is known to be associated with gene silencing, and more recently with active gene expression when present within the gene body. Yet the mechanisms by which genetic variation and DNA methylation affect gene expression and tissue specificity are not well understood. In this study, we use a cohort of 210 newborn Caucasian individuals who we genotyped (2.5 million SNPs) and for whom we measured mRNA levels through RNA seq in three cell types derived from cord blood and umbilical cord: lymphoblasto id cell lines, T cells and fibroblasts. For ~110 samples of each of the three cell types, we have assayed DNA methylation levels in more than 400,000 CpG sites through bisulfite conversion and bead chips. We characterized the tissue specificity of eQTLs, allele specific expression, mQTLs and eQTMs (methylation expression associations). We identified genetic variants and a modest number of methylation sites affecting alternative splicing. Addi   tionally, we tested the contribution of different mechanistic models. We provide evidence for synergistic interactions between SNPs and methylati   on sites. We found a significant number of cases in which the SNP effect on gene expression is mediated through methylation. Finally, we describe the mechanistic differences between patterns of methylation associated with increase and decrease of gene expression. Overall, our results provide in sights into the genetics and epigenetics involved in gene regulation and tis sue specificity, which is important for better understanding complex traits.",2012
 Found in Translation: New Insights into the Pathogenesis and Treatment of Marfan syndrome and related disorders,PL3.1,H. Dietz,"Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States","Dysregulation of TGF signaling has been implicated in many disease states including Marfan syndrome (MFS), a condition caused by deficiency of the extracellular matrix protein fibrillin 1. Many manifestations of MFS can be attenuated in mouse models using interventions that antagonize TGF signa ling. TGF can initiate both canonical (Smad dependent) and noncanonical (prominently including the MAPKs ERK, JNK and p38) signaling cascades. Multiple lines of evidence will be presented that implicate ERK signaling as ESHG Plenary Lectures  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org6 www.eshg.orgthe primary TGF dependent event that drives disease including the ability  of ERK antagonists to achieve phenotypic rescue. Despite this progress, our  understanding of how fibrillin 1 deficiency initiates altered TGF activity re  mains incomplete, as does knowledge regarding events that culminate in tissue failure or that that account for the wide intrafamilial variability in  the severity of vascular disease. In attempt to refine our mechanistic un  derstanding of disease pathogenesis (with a focus on aortic aneurysm), we have launched initiatives to identify environmental and genetic modifiers of MFS. Use of calcium channel blockers to mitigate hemodynamic stress resul  ted in a marked acceleration of aortic growth and rupture in mice with MFS  and correlated with accentuation of ERK signaling. The deleterious con sequences of this gene by environment interaction were abrogated using  ERK antagonists. In a separate study, we identified a single major protective  modifying locus for MFS coincident with the map position for MAP3K4 (a major JNK and p38 kinase). Taken together, these data reinforce the concept  that noncanonical TGF signaling is central to disease progression. Insights  regarding initiating events derived from our demonstration that a conge nital presentation of skin fibrosis (scleroderma) is caused by mutations in fibrillin 1 that specifically impair integrin binding to its RGD sequence. Mice  harboring a RGD to RGE mutation in fibrillin 1 (causing an obligate loss of  integrin binding) show dense dermal fibrosis in association with increased expression of an integrin subtype (v3) known to activate TGFbeta and ERK,  and are protected from fibrosis by manipulations that mimic the interaction  between fibrillin 1 and other integrins (e.g. 51). When stimulated with TGF, scleroderma fibroblasts show unique and marked activation of ERK when  compared to control cells. This effect is prevented by treatment with an inte  grin 1 activating or 3 blocking antibody. These data suggest that 3 integrin  not only augments TGF signaling, but also specifically influences the choice between the Smad and ERK cascades (favoring ERK), perhaps through a di rect potentiating interaction between Î±vÎ²3 and TÎ²RII. RGE mice also deve  lop aortic aneurysm, providing an ideal system to test the hypothesis that  loss of matricellular integrin ligand interaction is an inciting event in the  MFS aorta and to test integrin targeted therapies.",2012

This mutation is associated with hypermethylation at the FMR1 promoter and subsequent transcriptional silencing. The absence of FMRP (FMR1 protein) at the synapse has many consequences, including up regulation of metabo  tropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) mediated signaling. It has been po stulated that this increased mGluR5 signal may be responsible for many of the clinical manifestations observed in fragile X syndrome. mGluR5 receptor  antagonists have repeatedly been shown to rescue many phenotypes and  endophenotypes in animal models of the fragile X syndrome. Comprehensi   ve phenotype correction also occurs when treatment is administered later in the adult KO mice.

However, for most risk loci the causative genes amongst positional candidates remain unknown.To aid in the identification of causative genes, we have generated transcrip tome data for nine IBD relevant cell types in more than 200 healthy indivi duals. We have mapped cis  and trans eQTL in all cell types. We first quanti   fied tissular overlap between eQTL as well as their tissue specific degree of coincidence with IBD risk loci.We then used the ensuing eQTL information to pinpoint likely causative genes in known risk loci as follows. It is becoming increasingly apparent that a substantial proportion of inherited risk is due to regulatory variants that alter the expression profile of the causative genes. In such cases, and independently of the number of risk variants involved, disease association profile (i.e. the combination of p values exhibited by all variants in a risk locus) and eQTL association profile are bound to be highly correlated in the disease relevant tissue. We have devised and characterized the behavior of metrics that measure such correlations. These metrics are made indepen   dent of known disease associated coding SNPs mapping to the risk loci of interest.

 Investigating Genomic Heterogeneity in Breast Cancer by Single Cell Sequencing,S02.2,N. Navin,"Houston, TX, United States","As a tumor evolves from a single cell, it acquires complex somatic mutations and diverges to form distinct lineages of clones. This intratumor heterogenei   ty confounds basic research and clinical diagnosis, because tools do not exist to resolve it. To address this problem, we developed a single cell sequencing method to profile genomic copy number in individual tumor cells. We used this method to profile hundreds of single cells from two triple negative (ER , PR  and Her2 ) breast cancer patients. Analysis of 100 single cells from a heterogeneous tumor revealed three distinct clonal subpopulations that re present sequential clonal expansions. Additional analysis of 100 single cells from a homogeneous primary tumor and its liver metastasis indicated that a single clonal expansion formed the primary tumor and seeded the meta  stasis. In both primary tumors, we also identified an unexpectedly abundant  subpopulation of genetically diverse âpseudodiploidâ cells that do not travel to the metastatic site. In contrast to the prevailing models of gradual tumor  progression, our data suggest that these tumors grew by punctuated clo  nal expansions, in which hundreds of chromosomal rearrangements were acquired in short bursts of evolution. Recently, we have also developed a method to perform whole genome sequencing of single cells. From this data  we can detection many classes of chromosomal mutations (point mutations,  indels and structural variants) at base pair resolution in single cells. We are using this tool to investigate several major areas of cancer biology including  invasion, metastasis and response to chemotherapy.",2012

We showed that already under normal conditions, replication fork progression along the fragile site, FRA16C, is slow and forks frequently stall at AT rich sequences, leading to activation of additional origins. Under mild replication stress, the frequency of stalling at AT rich sequences is further increased. Strikingly, unlike in the entire genome, in FRA16C additional origins are not activated, suggesting that all potential origins are already activated under normal conditions. We further studied the replication dynamics of another fragile site FRA16D. The results of this analysis will be presented and discussed.

This model shows that chronic and unpredictable maternal separation causes depressive  and impulsive like behaviors, social withdrawal and co  gnitive defects in adult mice, and that these symptoms are transmitted to  the following offspring. It provides initial evidence that these alterations are associated with persistent changes in DNA methylation in the promoter as   sociated CpG island of several genes, in the brain of the offspring and in the germline of their stressed fathers 2 4. These findings suggest that epigenetic  mechanisms contribute to the impact of negative environmental conditions  early in life on adult behavior and its inheritance5 8. Novel molecular can  didate mechanisms thought to contribute to transgenerational epigenetic inheritance will also be discussed. References1 Franklin, T . B. & Mansuy, I. M.

 Integrating clinical and genomic approaches to identify causative genetic loci for nonsyndromic orofacial clefting,S04.1,E. Mangold,"Institute of Human Genetics, University of Bonn, Bonn, Germany","Formal genetic and epidemiological studies have indicated that the etiolo gy of nonsyndromic orofacial clefts is multifactorial, with both genetic and environmental factors contributing to the phenotype. Improved understan ding of the etiology of clefting may facilitate development of new preven tative measures and therapeutic approaches, and could improve genetic counselling for families at risk.In this talk the latest genetic findings for nonsyndromic orofacial clefts will be discussed as well as their biological and functional implications.Most epidemiological and molecular genetic studies of nonsyndromic orofa cial clefts have been performed in patients with nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (nsCL/P), which is the most common form of oro facial clefting. Nonsyndromic cleft palate only (nsCPO) is the second most common subtype, and only limited research has been conducted into the genetic factors underlying nsCPO.For nsCL/P linkage and candidate gene studies have attempted to elucidate the underlying genetic architecture, however, only the interferon regulatory factor 6 (IRF6) gene has been identified as causative. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS) have substantially extended our knowledge of the underlying risk factors. Four GWAS of nsCL/P have been conducted, and these have identified five new chromosomal loci. One locus, located in an intergenic region of chromosome 8q24, has been implicated in all GWAS and constitutes a major susceptibility locus. Although there is considerable overlap between studies in terms of the regions identified (particularly for the loci at 8q24 and 10q25), the causative variants still await identification. With the exception of 8q24, each of the identified loci harbors candidate genes. However, proof of causality is still lacking in all cases.",2012
 Dissecting Treacher Collins syndrome using the mouse as a model organism,S04.2,"M. J. Dixon1, P . A. Trainor2, J. Dixon1","1University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2Stowers Institute for Medical  Research, Kansas City, MO, United States","Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of craniofacial development that occurs with an estimated incidence of 1 in  50,000 live births. TCS is characterized by a combination of: bilateral down   ward slanting of the palpebral fissures; colobomas of the lower eyelids with  a paucity of eyelashes medial to the defect; hypoplasia of the facial bones;  cleft palate; malformation of the external ears; atresia of the external audi  tory canals; and bilateral conductive hearing loss. A high degree of inter  and intra familial variation in the clinical phenotype is observed. The majority of TCS patients are heterozygous for a mutation in TCOF1 which introduces a  premature termination codon into the encoded protein Treacle. Treacle is a nucleolar phosphoprotein which co localizes with upstream binding factor (Ubf) and RNA polymerase 1 in nucleolar organizing regions where it func  tions in ribosomal DNA (rDNA) gene transcription. To investigate the developmental basis of TCS, we have generated a mouse model through germline mutation of Tcof1 . Haploinsufficiency of Tcof1  re  sults in marked apoptosis in the neuroepithelium leading to a deficiency of migrating neural crest cells and resulting in severe craniofacial malfor   mations. We have further demonstrated that Treacle is required cell auto nomously for the formation and proliferation of neural crest cells and that  Treacle elicits its role through regulating the production of mature riboso   mes. Subsequently, we have demonstrated that haploinsufficiency of Tcof1   induces nucleolar stress and p53 checkpoint activation which results in p53  stabilization and cyclin G1 mediated, cell cycle arrest. Collectively, these perturbations underpin the tissue specificity of neuroepithelial apoptosis and neural crest cell hypoplasia characteristic of TCS. Importantly, chemical or genetic inhibition of p53 prevents cyclin G1 driven apoptotic elimination of neural crest cells and rescues the craniofacial abnormalities associated with mutations in Tcof1 . Notably, recent evidence has indicated that a subset  of TCS cases arise from mutations in two genes encoding subunits of RNA polymerases I and III, POLR1D  and POLR1C, providing further evidence that  TCS is a ribosomopathy.",2012
 Human Facial Dysostoses,S04.3,D. Wieczorek,"Institut fÃ¼r Humangenetik, UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Essen, Essen, Germany","Human facial dysostoses can be subdivided into mandibulofacial (MFD) and acrofacial dysostoses (AFD). Both are characterized by hypoplasia of facial structures derived from the first and second branchial arches. In addition to facial findings AFDs include anomalies of the extremities.The best known MFD is the Treacher Collins syndrome, a monogenic disea   se caused by mutations of the TCOF1, POLR1D  or POLR1C genes (Dauwerse  et al., 2011), which are involved in rRNA transcription. MFD with microce   phaly is another important form of MFD. Very recently, haploinsufficiency of a spliceosomal GTPase encoded by the EFTUD2  gene was identified in  these patients (Lines et al., 2012). Other MFDs such as MFD type Toriello or Burn McKeown syndrome are more rare and their molecular etiology has not been resolved so far.AFDs fall into two groups: i) AFDs with postaxial malformations of extremi ties, e.g. Miller syndrome, and ii) AFDs with preaxial involvement, e.g. Nager syndrome. Miller syndrome is caused by mutations within the DHODH gene,  involved in the pyrimidine biosynthesis pathway (Ng et al., 2010). Haploin  sufficiency of SF3B4, a component of the pre mRNA spliceosomal complex,  leads to Nager syndrome (Bernier et al., 2012).

OâDonovan;  MRC Centre for Neuropsychiatric Genetics and Genomics, Institute of Psychological  Medicine and Clinical Neurosciences, Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom. It has long been known that schizophrenia has high heritability, but as for  other complex disorders, identifying the specific genes responsible has been  a major challenge. However, through the technological revolution in geno  mics, and by the deployment of very large samples through international collaboration, highly significant evidence for the involvement of around 15  common genetic variants has emerged, each making a small contribution to  risk of the disorder. Replication studies suggest that of 81 independent vari ants surpassing p<10 5 in the largest schizophrenia GWAS, the vast majority are likely to be true risk variants but it is also clear from multi locus tests  that around a thousand or more risk variants exist. There is clear evidence  that these common variants substantially overlap with risk variants for bipolar disorder, and emerging evidence that they also overlap with those  conferring risk of other disorders, in particular ADHD. The same develop  ments that have allowed GWAS have also identified a number of abnorma lities of chromosome structure with clear evidence for their involvement in  schizophrenia and that these occur as de novo mutations in about 5% of  cases. Although rare, the CNVs confer a substantial increase in risk of schi   zophrenia to carriers as well as to other neurodevelopmental phenotypes including ADHD, Autism and Intellectual Disability. Although only a small  amount of the total genetic variation that contributes to schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder has been allocated to specific DNA variants, recent findings have strongly implicated specific aspects of neuronal function that are of importance in the pathogenesis of psychosis.",2012

 Tailoring and implementing aCGH for prenatal diagnosis: experience from Hong Kong,S06.1,R. K. W. Choy,"Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China","Microarray analysis has been recognized as a powerful diagnostic tool for detection of chromosome copy number aberrations in infants and child ren with congenital malformations and neurodevelopmental disabilities. Although microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) was made available at the same time as the postnatal setting, in the prena tal setting it has had a slower adoption rate. Based on the CNVs abnorma lity rate detected from the recent NICHD sponsored multicentre trial and meta analysis reported, aCGH is a more sensitive diagnostic test and adds incremental value to conventional karyotyping. There were also emerging evidences suggested that a targeted or lower resolution array appeared to be more appropriate for the detection of majority of clinically relevant chro mosome copy number abnormalities while maintaining a low rate of results with unknown clinical significant. Our laboratory has been offering âone stopâ prenatal screening and diagnostic service using low resolution targe ted array (aCGH; 4x44K) since 2009. In this study, we present a prospecti ve follow up survey of 500 pregnancies after prenatal screening and aCGH analysis with subsequent antenatal care in our unit. This is a prospective follow up study, using pregnancy outcome as the end point to investigate the accuracy, efficacy, clinical advantages and shortcoming of prenatal dia gnosis using targeted aCGH as compared to standard conventional chromo some analysis using microscopy and QF PCR.

 Prenatal diagnosis: Challenges in the interpretation of high resolution genetic screening tests,S06.2,K. Devriendt,"Center for Human Genetics, UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","High resolution genetic screening tests based on array CGH are being in troduced in the prenatal setting. They significantly increase the detection of genetic variants with clinical implications. Several flow charts exist for the interpretation of CNVâs in postnatal setting. However, the clinical inter   pretation of CNVâs in a prenatal setting is more challenging compared to a  postnatal setting, since the clinical information needed to interpret CNVâs is  often incomplete, time is pressing and decisions taken are irreversible. In high risk pregnancies, e.g. (multiple) malformations detected on ultrasound, the added value of array CGH often is limited, since decisions with regard to  pregnancy management are already taken based on the detected anomalies.  In contrast, array CGH can have a major added value as a screening tool in low risk pregnancies, this has to be outweighed against the difficult issues  such as CNVâs with reduced penetrance, variable expressivity and pleiotro  pic effects, unclassified CNVâs, incidental findings etc. The huge demand for pre test counseling raised by these difficulties cannot be met by most ge  netic centers.

De   velopment of genomic biomarkers guiding drug therapies has moved to the forefront of translation into clinical practice. The US FDAâs Table of Pharma cogenomic Biomarkers in Drug Labels (1) now contains >120 drug entries where evidence of a genetic effect has been described. However, confidence in the presented evidence and effect size with regards to drug response or toxicity vary over a wide range   from definitive clinical recommendations to âfor information onlyâ. While strong genetic factors predictive of adverse drug reactions move into clinical practice as biomarker tests, drug efficacy is typically multifactorial, with few tests capable of predicting outcomes   companion biomarker tests for targeted cancer chemotherapy a possible exception. Yet accurate prediction of positive response to therapy has the potential to improve drug therapy substantially, while much of the genetic variability in drug response genes has yet to be discovered. Our research fo cuses on expression genetics, based on the premise that regulatory variants (affecting transcription, RNA processing, and translation) are more preva lent than nonsynonymous SNPs that alter protein function directly.

 Clinical pharmagenomics: perspectives and limitations,S07.2,"M. Schwab1,2","1Dr Margarete Fischer Bosch Institute of Clinical Pharmacology, Stuttgart, Germany,  2Department of Clinical Pharmacology, University Hospital, Tuebingen, Germany","Variation in drug disposition and response among patients is a major con cern associated with many therapeutical agents used in all disciplines of medicine. The clinical relevance of variability is most evident with drugs that have a narrow therapeutic window (i.e., the dose used is close to the dose probably resulting in drug related toxicity in most individuals). With increasingly information available from the Human Genome Project and the HapMap Project, pharmacogenomics aims to elucidate the genomic deter   minants of drug efficacy and toxicity. For instance, variants in genes that are relevant for ADME processes such as drug metabolizing enzymes, drug transporters and nuclear receptors have profound effects on patient outco me. Recent clinically important examples are pharmacogenomics of tamoxi fen, a well established drug for treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer, and pharmacogenomics of clopidogrel, an antiplatelet drug. However, it is unlikely that one single gene will affect exclusively disease or treatment out come, and therefore a more comprehensive approach will be to consider genetic polymorphisms in entire biological/ pharmacological pathways. Re cently developed â omicsâ appoaches (e.g. genomics, transcriptomics, prote ESHG Concurrent Symposia  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org10 www.eshg.orgomics, metabonomics) will be helpful to identify further putative targets for  better prediction of drug response and will complement each other.

Finally,  non genetic factors as well as epigenetics (e.g. methylation, miRNA) have to  be considered more intensively in the future. Experimental as well as compu tational approaches are required to obtain holistic, mechanistic information on disease networks and drug response.

" Research about psychological issues related to genetic counselling and genetic testing: a personal view on past, present and future",S08.1,G. Evers Kiebooms,"Department of Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Notwithstanding the complex psychological risks faced by individuals at  increased risk for developing genetic disease or for having offspring with genetic disease, psychological issues related to genetic risk, genetic coun selling and genetic testing were hardly studied before 1980. Thereafter the attention for the psychological dimension increased rather slowly and moreover most studies were descriptive and did not use adequate control groups . In several countries the success of the human genome project also stimulated research on other than technical or medical aspects of the new genetics. Unfortunately more attention and funding went to ELSI (Ethical, Legal, Social issues) than to Psychological issues. ELSI instead of PELSIâ¯ The fact that the âteaching modelâ of genetic counselling dominated the  âcounselling modelâ for many years, resulted initially in psychological research that was mainly focused on cognitive aspects of genetic counse   ling (understanding of probabilistic information, recall of risks). Seymour Kessler played an important role in drawing the attention on genetic coun seling as a complex communication process and on the factors involved in processing emotionally laden information, coping with genetic disease and communication about genetic issues within the family. The first part of the presentation is dedicated to a personal selection of research findings about the impact of genetic counselling as well as about directiveness versus non directiveness. The progress in diagnostic possibilities allowed the detection of more and  more genetic diseases in adults or children, prenatally and even in the em bryo. The second and major part of the presentation consists of a personal looking back on research about psychological aspects of prenatal testing, carrier testing and predictive testing. For each of the three types of genetic testing two major dimensions will be considered: decision making about testing and the psychological impact of testing. Where applicable in the context of predictive testing attention will also be paid to a third dimensi   on: psychological issues involved in preventive health behavior or life style changes that may be induced by a genetic test result. The focus in this part of the presentation will be on predictive testing, prenatal testing and pre implantation genetic diagnosis for Huntingtonâs disease, with special atten tion for longitudinal studies evaluating the impact of the test result on the psychological wellbeing of the tested person and his or her partner and on subsequent family planning. So far psychological research to delineate the challenges as well as the pit  falls of whole genome sequencing for predicting future health problems is very limited. Based on relevant research in psychological decision making and health psychology, mainly on risk perception, the consequences of in formation overload and differences in coping style, a few comments will be formulated in the closing part of the presentation.",2012
 Psycho onco genetics: historical background and future challenges,S08.3,E. M. A. Bleiker,"The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam, Netherlands","âPsycho onco geneticsâ is the domain where psychology, oncology and gene tics meet. A brief historical background of the three sciences is presented, followed by suggestions for future research.Cancer  is as old as mankind. In Western countries, first successful treat  ments for cancer were given between 1900 and 1950. In the 1960s, the ta   boo decreased and a cancer diagnosis was more openly communicated to the patient. At that time, psychology and psychiatry entered oncology. By  the mid seventies, the first psycho oncological investigators studied issues like anxiety and depression. Questionnaires assessing âquality of lifeâ were developed in the 1980s and 1990s, to measure physical, social, and emo tional wellbeing. In the 21 st century, the screening of cancer patients for  distress (âthe 6th vital signâ) is being advocated. Parallel to the developments  in cancer treatment and psycho oncology, the field of genetics developed.  The hypothesis that a disease like breast cancer could be inherited was for the first time reported by Paul Broca in 1866. In 1953, Watson and Crick were among the first to report on the structure of DNA, and more impor   tant discoveries followed in the next decades. In the 1960s the first papers on genetic counseling for cancer appeared. A literature search on this topic revealed over 10.000 papers published since 1967, with a strong increase in the 1990s, when a number of genes associated with cancer syndromes were identified.Concerns were raised about the possible negative psychosocial impact of genetic testing and preventive surgery for (breast) cancer. In general, results did not support this concern. However, a number of questions still need to be answered. For example: are the currently used distress questionnaires sufficiently sensitive to assess the specific problems encountered by the counselees? Are those who do not request counseling psychologically more vulnerable? To what extent should counselors play an active role in the com munication of genetic test results to distant relatives of mutation carriers? What will be the best use of SNPâs in clinical practice, and how can we sup port counselees with coping with these small elevated risks for cancer? How can we improve psycho education about reproductive decision making such as prenatal and pre implantation genetic diagnosis? In addition, a number of questions need to be answered when commercial genetic testing will ar rive in Europe, making genetic testing accessible without the intervention of a trained genetic counselor.ESHG Concurrent Symposiawww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201211 www.eshg.orgS09.1 Opposing roles for IL 23 and IL 12 in maintaining occult cancer in an  equilibrium state M.

The detailed mechanism controlling the equilibrium phase of cancer im  munoediting that results in immune mediated dormancy of cancer remains  to be delineated. Here, we investigate the length of the equilibrium phase  during immune control of methycholanthrene (MCA) induced cancers and extend these observations to aging, cancer prone p53 mutant mice. We also  demonstrate, for the first time, the critical and opposing roles of IL 23 and  IL 12 in maintaining cancer cells in a state of immune mediated dormancy. Over a series of experiments, inhibition of IL 23p19 was shown to reduce the malignant potential of lesions established by MCA inoculation, while  inhibition of IL 12/23p40 enhanced tumor outgrowth. Furthermore, ago  nistic anti CD40 antibody treatment mimicked the effects of anti IL 23p19 mAb treatment. Other cytokines such as IL 4, IL 17, TNF, and IFNÎ±Î², which  are known to play important roles either in MCA tumorigenesis or in the  elimination phase of cancer immunoediting did not play critical roles in maintaining the equilibrium phase. Taken together, these data indicate op  posing roles for IL 23 and IL 12 in determining the outgrowth versus dor   mancy of occult neoplasia and suggest a potential long term danger in using  IL 12/23p40 antibodies for treating human autoimmune inflammatory dis   orders.",2012
 Paracrine and Autocrine Signals Induce and Maintain Mesenchymal and Stem Cell States in the Breast,S09.2,C. Scheel,"Helmholtz Center Munich, German Research Center, for Environmental Health, Neuherberg, Germany","The epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been associated with the acquisition of motility, invasiveness, and self  renewal traits. During both normal development and tumor pathogenesis, this change in cell phenotype is induced by contextual signals that epithelial cells receive from their mi croenvironment. The signals that are responsible for inducing an EMT and maintaining the resulting cellular state have been unclear.We describe three signaling pathways, involving transforming growth factor (TGF) beta and canonical and noncanonical Wnt signaling, that collaborate to induce activation of the EMT program and thereafter function in an au   tocrine fashion to maintain the resulting mesenchymal and stem cell like state. Importantly, the downregulation of endogenously synthesized inhibi tors of autocrine signals by epithelial cells enables the induction of the EMT program. Conversely, disruption of autocrine signaling by added inhibitors of these pathways inhibits migration and self renewal in primary human mammary epithelial cells and reduces tumorigenicity and metastasis by their transformed derivatives.Our results indicate that ongoing autocrine signaling is required for mainte nance of mesenchymal and stem cell traits both in primary and transformed mammary epithelial cells. At the same time, given the appropriate signaling context, these factors act in a paracrine manner that allow the derivation of mesenchymal and stem cell like cells in both primary and transformed po pulations of mammary epithelial cells that do not display these attributes.In the longer term, our observations may provide the basis for efficiently inducing differentiated epithelial cells to pass through an EMT and enter into a SC state without relying on genetic alteration. Such an approach may eventually be of great utility in the area of regenerative medicine. Acting in the opposing direction, the tumor initiating cells of certain carcinomas may be forced to exit the mesenchymal, stem cell like state by therapeutically interrupting multiple autocrine signaling pathways required for their conti nued residence in this state.",2012
 Microsatelite instability and cancers: From biology to clinics,S09.3,"A. Collura, A.

Med. 2011). The human tumour phenotype referred to as MSI is frequent, being associated with inherited neoplasms (Lynch syndro me) and with 10 15% of sporadic colon, gastric and endometrial cancers. Unpublished results we recently obtained show that HSP110 is frequently  mutated in human MSI neoplasms regardless of their primary location. Heat shock proteins (HSPs) are necessary for cancer cell survival. The HSP110DE9 mutant is the first HSP inhibitor produced endogenously by the  cancer cell. It is generated from an aberrantly spliced mRNA and lacks the  HSP110 substrate binding domain. HSP110DE9 expression is observed at variable levels in MSI cancer cells and tightly correlates with the size of al   lelic deletions in a T17 DNA repeat located in HSP110 intron 8. HSP110DE9 impaired both the normal cellular localization of HSP110 and its interaction with other HSPs, thus abrogating the chaperone activity and anti apoptotic  function of HSP110 in a dominant negative manner. Forced overexpression  of HSP110ÎE9 causes the sensitization of cells to anticancer agents such as oxaliplatin and 5 fluorouracil regardless of their microsatellite status. Importantly, these in vitro results have clinical significance, since MSI CRC  highly expressing HSP110DE9 due to large T17 deletions show significant  ly longer relapse free survival and response to chemotherapy compared to those with a low ratio (Collura et al., Submitted). More generally, we suspect  HSP110 mutation to constitute a first step towards understanding of the  clinical behaviour of colorectal, gastric and endometrial MSI tumours that have been reported to show an improved prognosis and possibly a different  response to chemotherapeutic agents.",2012

The mutational mechanism is null muta   tions   non sense, splicing and frame shifting INDELS. The exception being  WDR62, where mis sense mutations are found, but non sense mutations  additionally cause cerebral dysplasia. All the Primary Microcephaly genes encode proteins involved in mitosis.  One is involved in the timing of entry into mitosis, others in the mitotic  spindle and the remainder in centrosome and centriole function during mi tosis.

Furthermore, no unifying mechanism has yet  emerged to explain how these particular mitotic apparatus proteins interact  to modulate brain growth.",2012

 Interrogating the RNA heterogeneity within cellular compartmens,S14.2,R. Guigo,"Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain","The unfolding of the instructions encoded in the genome is triggered by the transcription of DNA into RNA, and the subsequent processing of the resul ting primary RNA transcripts into functional mature RNAs. RNA is thus the first phenotype of the genome, mediating all other phenotypic changes at the organism level caused by changes in the DNA sequence. While current technology is too primitive to provide accurate measurements of the RNA content of the cell, the recent development of Massively Parallel Sequencing Instruments has dramatically increased the resolution with which we can monitor cellular RNA. Using these instruments, the ENCODE project has sur   veyed the RNA content of multiple cell lines and subcellular compartments. The results of these surveys underscore pervasive transription, as well as great RNA heterogeneity between and within cells. Comparison of RNA sur   veys with other genome wide epigenetic surveys_such as those of binding sites for Transcription Factors, or of Histone modifications_reveals a very tightly coupling between the different pathways involved in RNA processing, transcription and splicing in particular.ESHG Concurrent Symposiawww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201213 www.eshg.orgS14.3 Transcribed dark matter: meaning or myth?

 Informed consent in non invasive prenatal diagnosis,S16.3,"H. Strange, Z. Deans, A. Newson","ESRC Centre for Economic and Social Aspects of Genomics (Cesagen), Cardiff, United Kingdom","Non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD) offers the opportunity for exciting changes to prenatal screening and diagnosis. It can give definitive results reliably at an early stage of pregnancy and without the miscarriage risk as sociated with invasive testing. NIPD is already used within the UK for fetal sexing for women at high risk of sex linked disorders, and in routine scree ning for fetal RHD in D negative pregnant women. It is also available in the USA and China as advanced screening test for trisomy 21.While the technology advances quickly, there is a need to examine careful ly how the introduction of NIPD into public clinics and the private sphere might affect women and coupleâs capacity for making informed decisions.The presentation starts by outlining reasons to safeguard a fully informed decision making process, as far as is possible. This is followed by high lighting three key areas in which the process of informed decision making might be affected by the introduction of NIPD. These are: prenatal screening programmes; direct to consumer testing; possible expansion to genome wide sequencing.Prenatal screening programmes: Against the background concern that pre natal screening and testing programmes have become âroutinisedâ, evidence suggests that, with the apparent ease of NIPD and without any associated risk of miscarriage, healthcare professionals may regard informed decision making as less important for NIPD.Direct to consumer testing: Any test that is partially carried out at home raises concerns about consent, pressure, and possible coercion by indivi duals and companies. Direct to consumer testing also presents logistical challenges for making sure the results are communicated accurately and are properly understood and interpreted by the recipient.Possible expansion to genome wide sequencing: Although not yet clinical   ly available, if NIPD were to be offered for whole genome sequencing, this would present a significant challenge to traditional models of informed con sent procedures.ESHG Concurrent Symposia  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org14 www.eshg.orgESHG Educational Sessio",2012

 Next Generation Sequencing and Applications,ES5.2,I. G. Gut,"Centro Nacional de Analisis Genomico, Barcelona, Spain","Nucleic acid sequencing has been the workhorse of genome research from the very beginning in the late 80âs. Classical Sanger sequencing was used for the Human Genome Sequencing project and was successively refined and finally used with automated capillary gel electrophoresis separation. The first sequence of the human genome was generated using exclusively this technology (Lander et al. Nature 2001, Venter et al. Science 2001). In 2005 nucleic acid sequencing saw a paradigm shift with the introduction of the Genome Sequencer from Roche and was shortly followed by other 2 nd  generation sequencers from Illumina, LifeTechnologies and Helicos. 2nd ge  neration sequencers rely on the preparation of random physically separated arrangements of individual fragments of the input nucleic acid, followed by cyclic base additions to the random array and high resolution imaging. 2 nd  generation sequencers are combinations of high resolution imaging instru ments and microfluidic devices. 2 nd generation sequencers are the main tool  used in large scale projects such as the 1000 Genomes, the International Cancer Genome Consortium (ICGC), the International Human Epigenome Consortium (IHEC) and will play an important role in the International Rare Disorder Research Consortium (IRDiRC).However, development of sequencing methods has not stopped at 2 nd ge  neration. Several instruments have been introduced, that move beyond in their characteristics. Detection systems are shifting from optical detection to electrical detection. I would characterise true 3 rd generation as a method  that does not rely on a replication method, such as primer extension or oli gonucleotide ligation, for sequence determination, and delivers long clonal reads. Methods such as the GridION System from Oxford Nanopore Techno   logies fall into this category. Even 4 th generation sequencing methods are  already showing on the horizon with developments of the EU funded FP7 project READNA (www.cng.fr/READNA). A 4 th generation sequencing me  thod would allow the determination of nucleic sequences cell by cell within a histological section.",2012
 Clinical and genetic heterogeneity of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis,ES6.1,M. Sabatelli,"Department of Neurology, Pol","âA. Gemelliâ, UniversitÃ  Cattolica del Sacro Cuore, Rome, Italy. Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) is a fatal neurodegenerative disorder involving upper and lower motor neurons. Within definite ALS, variants are recognized based on the age of onset, site of localization of first signs, rate of progression of the disease, relative mix of upper and lower motor neuron deficits and the presence of fronto tempora dementia (FTD). The question of whether ALS is a single disease with variable expression or different di seases with heterogeneous causes still remains unsolved.Most ALS cases are sporadic (SALS) while familial ALS (FALS) account for about 5% of total cases. Over the last 20 years the pathogenic role of ge nes such as SOD1 , TARDBP , FUS, C9ORF72, OPTN, ATXN2 , VCP , ANG and UBQLN 2 has emerged and mutation in these genes have been identified in ESHG Educational Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201215 www.eshg.orgabout 50 60% of FALS. A large hexanucleotide (GGGGCC) repeat expansi  on in the first intron of C9ORF72, represent the most common mutation in FALS being respomsible of about 40% of cases. Near 50% of patients har bouring C9ORF72mutation have FTD, compared to 30% of patients with TARDBP mutation and 9% of cases with unknown gene. Patients with FUS and C9ORF mutations have shorter survival with respect to patients with different mutations. .Discoveries in the genetics of FALS are changing the scenario of sporadic ALS as well, making the distinction between familial and apparently spora dic ALS less clear than previously assumed. In fact mutations in the same ge nes involved in FALS may be identified also in a considerable proportion of patients with apparent sporadic disease. The same genes may act as either Mendelian genes in FALS or low penetrance risk alleles in SALS. This chal lenges the current indication for DNA analysis only in cases with a known family history of ALS.",2012

 Next generation sequencing goes diagnostic: First experiences,ES7.1,L. Biesecker,"National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United States","Medicine is being challenged by the DNA sequencing revolution. Next gene ration (NGS) has led to a precipitous drop in costs, making clinical sequen   cing of the genome or exome comparable in cost to other diagnostic tests. The question before us is how we can harness this technology to benefit patients. As well, we do not know which medical scenarios are appropri   ate for NGS, nor how we should work with patients and their families to communicate the results. To address these questions, research is needed to develop an evidence base upon which we can create practice standards. We developed the ClinSeqâ¢ pilot project to explore these questions. The goals of this project are to enroll 1,000 subjects, initially focusing on cardiovascular disease, apply NGS technologies, and pilot approaches to consent, data ana   lysis, and return of results.The initial analyses of ClinSeqâ¢ have shown that subjects have good abi lities to understand the sequencing research through informed consent. They are eager to undergo sequencing and receive results, both for their own benefit as well as to benefit science. They are highly motivated, willing to engage in follow up research to correlate genotype and phenotype. We began our analyses by screening 572 exomes for highly penetrant mutations for serious medical conditions. These included familial hypercholesterole mia (n,9 identified), cancer susceptibility (n,8), cardiomyopathies (n,4), arrhythmias (n,4), malignant hyperthermia (n,2), and hereditary liability to nerve and pressure palsies (n,3). Most of these have been returned to the subjects with medical and genetic counseling. In total, we have detected and returned genetic test results for 30 patients. Most of these diagnoses were not suspected to be present by the patient or clinician before the sequen   cing. While this highly educated and affluent cohort of patients is not repre sentative, there is a substantial desire for NGS results. Further analyses of additional categories of genes (e.g., recessive carrier status) will yield many more clinically relevant results. I will give examples of some of the results we have returned to illustrate the range of the disorders and the reactions of the subjects. These data should be useful to others in planning how to deploy MPS in clinical settings.",2012

 Myotonic dystrophy: complex repeats in a complex disorder,ES8.2,D. G. Monckton,"University of Glasgow, Glasgow, United Kingdom","Myotonic dystrophy is an autosomal dominant disorder presenting a wide range of symptoms frequently including cataracts, heart conduction defects,  insulin insensitivity and hypersomnia, along with muscular atrophy and  myotonia. Disease severity is extremely variable and the disorder displays striking anticipation progressing from the mild late onset form to congenital  disease in as little as three generations. The most common form of myotonic  dystrophy, type 1, is caused by the expansion of a CTG repeat in the 3â un translated region of the DMPK gene. The CTG tract ranges from 5 to ~40 re peats in the general population. Patients inherit from 50 to 1,000+ repeats,  with longer alleles associated with earlier age at onset. The expanded repeat  is highly unstable and nearly always increases when transmitted from one generation to the next, explaining the anticipation observed. The expanded  repeat is also unstable in the soma in a process that is age dependent, tis  sue specific and expansion biased, with particularly large expansions in the  affected tissues. Although the majority of DM1 patients present with a pure expanded CTG repeat array, recent evidence has revealed that a subset of pa tients carry alleles with variant repeats. These variant repeats stabilise the  array and are associated with milder symptoms. Pathogenesis appears to be  primarily caused by the gain of function of the DMPK transcript containing a large CUG tract that remains trapped within foci in the nucleus and disturbs  the function of two families of RNA splicing factors that leads to genome  wide dysregulation of alternative splicing. In particular, mis splicing of the  CLC1 chloride channel gene appears to be associated directly with myoto  nia and mis splicing of the insulin receptor gene with insulin insensitivity. Exciting recent developments suggest that the RNA gain of function defect  may be alleviated using antisense oligonucleotides paving the way for new  treatments in this devastating disorder.ESHG Educational Sessions  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org16 www.eshg.orgESHG Concurrent Sessio",2012

The 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome is characterized by intellectual disa   bility (ID), hypotonia, facial dysmorphism, epilepsy, and congenital malfor   mations. The recurrent deletion encompasses five known genes, CRHR1,  IMP5 , MAPT, STH, and KANSL1 , in addition to four putative genes. We identified two atypical de novo deletions encompassing only part of  MAPT and KANSL1  in two children with ID and typical features of 17q21.31  microdeletion syndrome. Next, we selected 16 individuals with core fea  tures of the 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome. Sanger sequencing revealed no pathogenic changes in MAPT. However, sequence analysis of KANSL1  did  reveal two heterozygous mutations, a nonsense mutation and a splice site mutation, both predicted to cause loss of function.KANSL1  is a widely expressed gene encoding a member of the highly con  served NSL complex. This complex contains, among others, the H4K16 ace  tyltransferase KAT8. To explore the effect of haploinsufficiency of KANSL1  on gene expression  levels, we performed whole transcriptome (mRNA) sequencing using EBV  transformed cell lines of the individual with the KANSL1 splice site mutation  and three individuals with the classical 17q21.31 deletion. Functional anno  tation clustering of genes that were differentially expressed in all samples  compared to controls revealed enrichment of genes involved in neuronal  processes. Further evidence that KANSL1  has a function in neurons is pro  vided by our studies in Drosophila . Tissue specific knockdown of wah (fly  ortholog of KANSL1 ) in the mushroom bodies was sufficient to cause a 25%  reduction in learning ability ( P<0.05). In conclusion, our findings demonstrate that haploinsufficiency of KANSL1   is sufficient to cause the classical 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome phe notype.",2012

A question to be still addressed is whether this condition  is a contiguous gene syndrome or a monogenic disorder. MAPT has been  considered the major candidate gene, however no productive mutations have been identified so far. Starting from the hypothesis that a single gene mutation in undeleted patients could affect either one gene residing within the deletion interval, or another gene participating in a shared molecular pathway, we performed exome sequencing of one undeleted patient and both parents. A de novo heterozygous nonsense mutation within exon 6 of  the KIAA1267  gene (OMIM *612452) was identified and validated by San  ger sequencing: c.C1816T , p.R606X. This result prompted us to sequence KIAA1267 in a second undeleted patient, in which a de novo heterozygous  frameshift mutation introducing a premature stop codon was detected within exon 13: c.2785_2786 delAG, p.R929G fsX44.

Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS) is an autosomal dominant connective tissue  disorder with both features that overlap with and distinguish it from Mar  fan syndrome (MFS). In its most typical presentation, LDS is characterized  by the triad of hypertelorism, bifid uvula/cleft palate and widespread aor tic/arterial aneurysms and tortuosity. LDS is most often caused by hetero  zygous loss of function mutations in genes encoding positive effectors of  transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) signaling including either subunit of the TGFÎ² receptor (TGFÎ²R1/2) and Smad3. Nevertheless, in aneurysmal aortic tissues a signature compatible with increased TGFÎ² signaling is con sequently observed, engendering controversy regarding the mechanism of aortic aneurysmal disease. TGFÎ²s comprise three multipotential cytokines, encoded by three separate genes, that regulate multiple aspects of cellular performance including, proliferation, differentiation, migration and synthe tic repertoire. Here, we report heterozygous deletions or loss of function mutations of the gene encoding the transforming growth factor beta 2 (TGFÎ²2) ligand in eight families characterized by a phenotype within the MFS/LDS spectrum and demonstrate upregulation of TGFÎ² signaling in aor tic tissue from affected individuals. Furthermore, haploinsufficient Tgfb2 /+ mice demonstrate aortic root aneurysm by 8 month of age and biochemical evidence of increased canonical and noncanonical TGFÎ² signaling. Mice that harbor a mutant MFS allele (Fbn1 C1039G/+) in the context of Tgfb2  haploinsuf  ficiency show a pronounced increase in TGFÎ² signaling and phenotypic wor   sening in association with normalization of TGFÎ²2 expression and excessive expression of TGFÎ²1.

Patients can present with a few to hundreds of cutaneous and pathognomonic gastrointestinal lesions. These are most commonly in the small intestine, documented by endoscopy, colo noscopy, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Although several case re ports have been published, the etiopathology of BRBN is still unknown.Since inherited venous malformations (VMCMs) are caused by germline ac tivating TIE2 mutations and common sporadic venous malformations (VMs) ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201217 www.eshg.orgare due to strongly hyperphosphorylating somatic TIE2 mutations, we hy   pothesized that BRBN may also be part of the spectrum of TIE2 mediated  phenotypes. To test this, we screened the coding region of TIE2 by direct sequencing of genomic blood DNA and cDNA from the resected lesions of 14 patients. In  16 tissues from 10 patients, we identified mutations leading to amino acid  changes, absent in the blood DNA from patients as well as in cDNA from con trol tissues.

Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is the number one genetic killer during early infancy. SMA is caused by functional absence of SMN1 leading to progressive degeneration of spinal Î± motoneurons. Currently, no cure for SMA is available.Therapeutic approaches are focusing on SMN2, since its copy number main ly modifies disease severity. Previously, we have been able to show that the anti epileptic drug valproic acid (VPA) increases SMN levels in vitro, ex vivo as well as in VPA treated SMA patients. A pilot clinical trial with VPA revealed that 1/3 of the patients responded positively to VPA treatment, while for 2/3 either no response or even the opposite effect was detected. To elucidate mechanisms underlying VPA nonresponsiveness, we collected fibroblasts lines from >30 SMA patients undergoing VPA treatment. We de   monstrated that response to VPA was concordant in about 65% between blood and fibroblasts. Furthermore, by generating GABAergic neurons from fibroblast derived iPS cells, we showed that similar response to VPA is re tained even in the CNS neurons. This is the first prove that response to a potential SMA drug is concordant between blood, fibroblasts and neurons. Moreover, by transcriptome wide Âµ array we identified increased expres   sion of CD36, a known LCFA translocase, as the pivotal factor suppressing positive response to VPA.Our data provide first evidence that monitoring VPA response in fibroblasts is indeed feasible to infer response in CNS neurons. Furthermore, CD36 was identified as the crucial protein suppressing response to VPA. This is of ma  jor implication also for other diseases treated with VPA such as epilepsy or  migraine.",2012

In a strategy to identify novel genes involved in glioma pathogenesis by  molecular characterization of chromosomal translocation breakpoints, we identified the KIAA1797 gene, encoding a protein with an as yet undefi   ned function, to be disrupted by a 7;9 translocation in a primary gliobla   stoma culture. Array based comparative genomic hybridization detected deletions involving KIAA1797  in around half of glioblastoma cell lines and  glioblastomas investigated. Quantification of mRNA levels in human tissu es demonstrated highest KIAA1797  expression in brain, reduced levels in  all glioblastoma cell lines and most glioblastomas, and similar levels in glial and neuronal cells by analysis of different hippocampal regions from muri ne brain. Antibodies against KIAA1797 were generated and showed similar  protein levels in cortex and subcortical white matter of human brain, while levels were significantly reduced in glioblastomas with KIAA1797  deletion.  By immunofluorescence of astrocytoma cells, KIAA1797 co localized with vinculin in focal adhesions. Physical interaction between KIAA1797 and vin culin was demonstrated via co immunoprecipitation.

Cytogenetically normal acute myeloid leukemia (CN AML) with biallelic CEBPA gene mutations (biCEPBA) represents a distinct disease entity with a favourable clinical outcome. So far, it is not known if other genetic alterati ons cooperate with biCEBPA mutations during leukemogenesis. To identify additional mutations, we performed whole exome sequencing of five biCEB PA patients and detected somatic GATA2 zinc finger 1 (ZF1) mutations in 2 out of 5 cases. Both GATA2 and CEBPA are transcription factors crucial for hematopoietic development. Inherited or acquired mutations in both genes have been associated with leukemogenesis. Further mutational screening detected novel GATA2 ZF1 mutations in 13 of 33 biCEBPA positive CN AML patients (13/33: 39.4%). No GATA2 mutations were found in 38 CN AML pa tients with a monoallelic CEBPA mutation and in 89 CN AML patients with wild type CEBPA status. In Kaplan Meier survival analysis, the presence of GATA2 mutations did not negatively impact on the favourable overall survi   val and event free survival of biCEBPA patients. In reporter gene assays, all tested GATA2 ZF1 mutants showed reduced capacity to enhance CEBPA me diated activation of transcription, suggesting that the GATA2 ZF1 mutations may collaborate with biCEPBA mutations to deregulate target genes during malignant transformation. We thus provide evidence for a genetically di stinct subgroup of CN AML.

Most cases (>70%) are due to domi   nant, variably penetrant, germline mutations in the tumor suppressor gene TP53 . In TP53  and non TP53  LFS, there is evidence for risk heterogeneity  within and between families. While TP53  mutations predispose LFS pati  ents, they do not appear to be sufficient and additional genetic and epigene  tic âhitsâ are necessary for tumorigenesis. To identify second somatic hits as  downstream drivers of p53 mediated tumorigenesis, we performed geno  mic and epigenomic profiling of primary soft tissue sarcomas, osteosarco mas and matching constitutive samples of 10 LFS patients (6 with, 4 without  TP53  mutations). We also performed whole genome sequencing of a subset  of tumor/normal pairs with an inherited TP53  mutation. Although we ob  served chromothripsis in a subset of tumor samples, it was independent of  TP53  mutation status. Integration of the observed genetic genomic and epi  genomic alterations into the extended p53 and p16/RB pathways revealed multiple and shared hits (irrespective of p53 status or tumor type), in nu  merous p53 transcriptional targets and interacting proteins (e.g., ATM, CD  KN1A, CDKN2A, CHK1, PTEN, MDM2/4 ). Identification of recurrent somatic  alterations in p53 network genes in independent LFS tumors is remarkable. This indicates that p53 defects alone (due to inherited mutations) are not  sufficient and that additional hits in genes with p53 associated functions  are not redundant but rather are a necessary part of LFS tumorigenesis. Re current somatic alterations cooperating with p53 in LFS tumors appear to cluster in a limited number of cellular pathways.",2012

Recently, we showed that LPXN is involved in the progression of PCa via deregulation of p120CTN. In the present study we analyzed the LPXN mediated adhesive and cytoskeletal changes during PCa progression. After downregulation of LPXN expression we could show an unambiguous reduced adhesiveness of PCa cells PC 3 and DU 145. LPXN knockdown resul ted in a reduced cell surface area and reduced formation of focal adhesion sites in these cells. Interestingly, we found decreased expression of small GTPase RhoA and increased expression of Rac1. Furthermore, the expres   sion pattern of several integrins was deregulated after LPXN knockdown, specifically Î²1 integrin expression was downregulated.To identify a candidate protein that mediates the cytoskeletal changes af ter LPXN knockdown, we performed a Yeast two Hybrid screen. The actin binding protein caldesmon (CaD) was identified as a putative interaction partner of LPXN. Co immunoprecipitation and a proximity ligation assays confirmed the interaction of LPXN with CaD. Furthermore, we demonstra ted that CaD expression is upregulated in PCa cells and that knockdown of CaD by RNA interference leads to an increased migration and invasion, whereas no changes in proliferation were detected. Interestingly, we found that knockdown of LPXN lead to a decrease in phosphorylated, inactive CaD (pCaD) but total CaD levels remained unaffected. Subsequently, low levels of pCaD resulted in reduced migration of PCa cells.Taken together our present results indicate that LPXN mediates cytoskeletal changes during PCa progression through the regulation CaD phosphoryla   tion.",2012

Furthermore, attachments of the tendons were  abnormal. We mapped the condition to a 5 Mb region on the long arm of chromosome 5 (5q31.1) but were not able to identify a coding mutation.

Although CCD is usually caused by mutations leading to haploinsufficiency of RUNX2, the  underlying genetic cause remains unresolved in about 25% of cases. Besides RUNX2, MSX2 is another transcription factor known to play important roles during many developmental processes including tissue organogenesis, cra niofacial and limb development.Here we describe two unrelated individuals with microduplications upstream of MSX2 on chromosome 5q35.2. One of the affected individuals  presented with a phenocopy of CCD. In addition to a classical CCD pheno type the other affected individual had a complex synpolydactyly of the hands and postaxial polydactyly of the feet which have so far never been reported in association with CCD or copy number variations (CNVs) on 5q35.2. The microduplications overlap in a ~219 kb region that contains several highly conserved non coding elements which are likely to be involved in MSX2 gene  regulation. Functional analyses using viral overexpression in chicken cells demonstrated that the inhibitory effect of Msx2 overexpression on minerali   zation can not be ameliorated by forced Runx2  expression. Our results indicate that CNVs affecting non coding regions upstream of a gene can cause developmental defects, and that the resulting phenotype can be distinct from those caused by point mutations or CNVs encompassing the corresponding gene.

Dominant mutations in EZH2 encoding a histone lysine N methyltransferase of the polycomb repressive complex have been recently reported to cause Weaver syndrome. We now present an autosomal recessive form of Weaver like syndrome in two affected siblings from a con sanguineous Turkish family. Using a whole exome sequencing strategy com bined with determination of homozygous stretches of identified variants, we found a homozygous nonsense mutation in a novel gene encoding an E3 ubiquitin ligase. The mutation is located within the N terminal region of the protein leading to a complete loss of the ubiquitin ligase activity. To determi   ne the underlying molecular pathogenesis, we analyzed patientsâ fibroblasts and could show that cells lacking this ubiquitin ligase activity have an in creased sensitivity to DNA damage and responded with prolonged activati on of checkpoint kinase 1 and increased level of apoptosis. Our data link the molecular pathogenesis of overgrowth syndromes to altered DNA damage response and increased cancer risk. Additional sequencing of a cohort of patients with Weaver syndrome for mutations identified novel de novo mu tations in EZH2 and provided evidence for further genetic heterogeneity in Weaver syndrome.

Myhre syndrome (OMIM #139210, MS) is a developmental disorder cha racterized by pre and postnatal short stature, brachydactyly, facial dysmor   phism (short palpebral fissures, maxillary hypoplasia, mandibular progna thism, short philtrum), muscular hypertrophy, joint limitation and deafness. Other features include intellelectual disability behavioral disturbance, car diac defects, and cryptorchidism. Skeletal manifestations include thickened calvarium, cone shaped epiphyses, shortened tubular bones, hypoplastic iliac wings, broad ribs and large vertebrae with short and large pedicles. All reported MS cases are sporadic supporting de novo dominant mutations.Using exome sequencing in 2 MS cases, we selected mothers against DPP homolog 4 (SMAD4) as a candidate gene based on its pivotal role in BMP and TGFÎ² signalling. SMAD4 mutations were subsequently found in additional 18 affected individuals. We identified only3 distinct heterozygous missense SMAD4 mutations all affecting Isoleucine 500 which in located in the Mad Homology 2 (MH2) domain, near the mo noubiquitinated site Lys519. We further demonstrated a defect in SMAD4 ubiquitination in patient fibroblasts and increased level of SMAD4 sugge sting a stabilization of SMAD4 protein in Myhre syndrome. These results were in contrast of those observed with SMAD4 loss of function mutations, identified juvenile polyposis syndrome and associated with SMAD4 insta bility. We further study the nuclear localization of mutant SMAD complexes and found that the complexes translocate to the nucleus. We finally obser   ved a decreased expression of downstream TGFÎ² target genes supporting impaired TGFÎ² driven transcriptional control in MS.",2012

To uncover further underlying genetic mechanism we performed genome wide homo   zygossity mapping using an Affymetrix SNP 6.0 array in 8 patients with idio   pathic short stature of consanguineous families. We identified runs of ho mozygossity with an average size between 2.7 and 300.1 Mb not reported in European populations. As the gene content averaged 874 genes we carried out whole exome sequencing after Agilent sure select enrichment v3 with 50 Mb. Runs were performed on a Life Tech5500xl platform. After Mapping and SNP calling with LifeScope variants were annotated with ANNOVAR. This identified the homozygous missense mutation p.A391T in the MAP4   gene not present in 300 controls or the 1000genomes project. MAP4 is a major protein for microtubuli assembly during mitosis. The patientâs phe notype showed significant overlap with those reported for Seckel syndrome and Microcephalic Osteodysplastic Dwarfism type Majewski which are also  caused by defects in centrosomal proteins. The MAP4  mutation creates a no  vel phosphorylation site in the KDM domain of the MAP4 protein which is  predicted to destabilise the microtubuli architecture. Immunofluorescence  analysis on a fibroblast cell line of the affected patient showed a higher rate  of centrosome duplications and confirmed this hypothesis.

To date, we have collected a cohort of 65 patients with CNV  including MECP2. Previous analyses derived from high resolution compara  tive genomic hybridization arrays (aCGH) revealed the frequent occurrence  of complex rearrangements within our patient cohort in 27% of cases. Here  we studied 31 patients carrying duplications including MECP2 in whom we  were able to accomplish DNA sequencing for each of the rearrangement  breakpoint junction. Surprisingly, DNA sequencing unveiled the presence of complexities in up to 50% of the rearrangements. All complex alterations  have at least one breakpoint within or flanking the low copy repeats (LCRs)  supporting our hypothesis that such LCRs stimulate those rearrangements.  The most striking observation, however, was the high frequency (42%) of small insertions and deletions (indels) observed at/or flanking the break   point junctions, none of which were found present in dbSNP (built 135)  suggesting that they were generated concomitant with the rearrangement.  This observation strongly supports a role for replication based mechanisms  underlying such rearrangements as break induced replication (BIR) was re cently shown to increase the rate of frameshift mutations in yeast. In addi   tion, SNP genotyping revealed absence of heterozygosity (AOH) within the  altered genomic region strongly suggesting that the MECP2 duplication is  mainly an intrachromosomal event. In summary, our results add to a gro  wing body of data documenting a role for a DNA replication mechanism in complex genomic rearrangements associated with genomic disorders.",2012
" How to deal with genomic imbalances in the imprinted region 11p15.5: Insights in the complex regulation of two imprinting domains T . Eggermann1, M. Begemann1, M. Gogiel1, A. Dufke2, I. Spier3, I. Spier3, S. Spengler1; 1University Hospital, Aachen, Germany, 2University Hospital, TÃ¼bingen, Germany, 3University Hospital, Bonn, Germany. Duplications or deletions affecting the imprinting control regions 1 and/or 2 (ICR1/2) in 11p15.5 have been reported for both growth retardation and overgrowth. However, due to the complexity of the 11p15.5 imprinting regions, the interpretation of copy number variations (CNVs) is difficult. The clinical outcome in 11p15.5 CNV carriers is influenced by the size, the breakpoint positions, their parental origin and the imprinting status of the affected genes. We report on three carriers of different CNVs (two duplica tions and one deletion) restricted to the telomeric ICR1: two patients were referred with the diagnosis of Silver Russell syndrome (SRS), in the third case the clinical features were probably not associated with the imbalan ce. Summarising our results and those from the literature, a central role of the IGF2 gene and its telomeric enhancer elements for the clinical course of 11p15 disturbance carriers is obvious: whereas duplications or deletions of H19 do apparently not affect the phenotype, imbalances of both IGF2 as well as its enhancer can separately cause abnormal phenotypes depending on the parental origin. As a result, carriers of ICR1 duplication can even show a normal phenotype. A similar pattern can be delineated for the centromeric ICR2: here the type of imbalances affecting the CDKN1C and the KCNQ1OT1 genes and their differentially methylated region influences the clinical out come. As a result, CNVs in 11p15.5 require an extensive workup to delineate risk figures for 11p15.5 associated syndromes. Additionally they allow pro found insights in the complex regulation of the imprinted factors localised in 11p15.5.ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts European Human Genetics Conference 201221 www.eshg.orgC04.3 Nonlinear and nonrandom genome organization of SNRPN, UBE3A, and GABRB3 in the normal human nucleus by three color 3D fluorescence in situ hybridization",C04.2,"R.

The frequency and distribution of de novo somatic structural variants in normal cells is poorly explored. Using age stratified cohorts of 318 monozygotic twins (MZ) and 296 single born subjects, we describe age related accumulation of copy number variation in the nuclear genomes in vivo and frequency changes for both megabase  and kilobase range variants. Megabase range aberrations were found in 3.4% of subjects â¥60 years old; these subjects included 78 MZ twin pairs and 108 single born individuals. No such findings were observed in 81 MZ pairs or 180 single born subjects who were â¤55 years old. Recurrent region  and ge ne specific mutations were observed. Longitudinal analyses of 43 subjects whose data were collected 7 19 years apart suggest considerable variation in the rate of accumulation of clones carrying structural changes. Further   more, the longitudinal analysis of individuals with structural aberrations suggests that there is a natural self removal of aberrant cell clones from pe ripheral blood. In three healthy subjects, we detected somatic aberrations characteristic of patients with myelodysplastic syndrome. The recurrent rearrangements uncovered here are candidates for common age related de   fects in human blood cells. We anticipate that extension of these results will allow determination of the genetic age of different somatic cell lineages and estimation of possible individual differences between genetic and chrono logical age. Our work might also help to explain the cause of an age related  reduction in the number of cell clones in the blood; such a reduction is one  of the hallmarks of immunosenescence.",2012

Here, we report the generation and the characterization of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) derived from monozygotic twins discordant for trisomy 21: Twin N iPSCs for the normal and Twin DS iPSCs for the DS affected iPSCs. We hypothesize that these samples were ideal to study the effect of the supernumerary chromosome 21, since the rest of the genome is identical between the two samples. Karyotype and high resolution array based comparative genomic hybridization analysis, confir   med the chromosomal constitution of these iPSCs. Transcriptome analysis by mRNA Seq showed alterations in the expression of genes that impact on DS features. In vivo differentiation of Twin DS iPSCs revealed an abnor  mal teratoma formation in NOD SCID mice. In vitro, Twin DS iPSC derived neurospheres showed a reduced number of neuroprogenitor cells (NPCs). When NPCs were further induced to mature into neurons, we found struc tural changes in the architecture and density of neural populations together with alterations in the expression of genes involved in lineage specification in neurogenesis and brain development. Furthermore, we provide novel evidence that the increased expression and activity of the dual specificity tyrosine (Y) phosphorylation regulated kinase 1A protein underlie these defects.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) are powerful tools to unravel  genomic loci associated with common traits and complex human disease.  However, GWAS only rarely reveal information on the exact genetic elements  and pathogenic events underlying an association. In order to extract functio nal information from genomic data, strategies for systematic follow up stu  dies on a phenotypic level are required. Here we address these limitations  by applying RNAi to analyze >100 candidate genes within 55 loci identified by GWAS as associated with blood lipid levels, coronary artery disease and/or myocardial infarction for a function in regulating cholesterol levels in  cells. The genes were knocked down with siRNAs and the consequences on  cellular free cholesterol (FC) and the efficiency of LDL internalization into cells were quantified using automated microscopy and multiparametric  image analysis. We will show evidence that loss of function of a surprisingly  high number of the trait associated genes affected LDL uptake, FC, or both. For several genes without previously known lipid regulatory roles the func  tional effects upon gene knockdown closely correlated with altered LDL  receptor levels. By providing strong evidence for disease relevant functions of lipid trait associated genes our study demonstrates that quantitative, cell based RNAi is a scalable strategy for a systematic, unbiased detection of  functional effectors within GWAS loci.",2012

A recent GWAS in the general population identified 95 common genetic variants associated with lipid levels. To obtain insight into the genetics underlying diabetic dyslipidemia, genotype scores approximating the additive effects of those variants were calculated for each major lipid class (total cholesterol, TC; high density lipoprotein cholesterol, HDL; low density lipoprotein chole sterol, LDL; and triglycerides, TG) in individuals with/without T2D in the Rotterdam Study (n,7735) and Erasmus Rucphen Family Study (n,2313). Adjusted for age, sex and bmi, all four genotype scores were significantly as sociated with lipid levels in both non diabetics and diabetics. The genotype scores for HDL, LDL, and TG were also used to predict hypercholesterolemia. The area under the ROC curve (AUC) for the genotype scores was 0.68[0.66 0.69] in non diabetics and 0.72[0.68 0.76] in diabetics, which was better than the predictive ability of age, sex and BMI (AUC non diabetics,0.65[0.64 0.66],  AUCdiabetics,0.69[0.65 0.73]). Combining the genetic scores with the non  genetic risk factors improved the AUC in both non diabetics and diabetics (AUC non diabetics,0.69[0.68 0.71], AUCdiabetics,0.75[0.71 0.79]).

We used LD estimated from 1000 Genomes CEU data.Across the 106 regions defined by SNPs of interest, we observed 49 (30%) containing the same SNP associated with more than one trait. Of these, 37 contain SNPs associated with highly correlated traits, e.g. lipids and obesity. Of the remaining regions, 38 (23%) contain variants in strong LD and 30 (19%) contain variants in moderate LD, and 46 (28%) regions contain vari ants in only modest LD (r2<0.2).Our results highlight that a substantial proportion of metabolic trait loci in corporate complex patterns of multi trait allelic heterogeneity, suggesting that statistical approaches that model epidemiological correlations between phenotypes may increase power and resolution of gene mapping efforts.ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201223 www.eshg.orgC05.5 Dysfunctional NO signaling due to a double mutation in GUCY1A3  and CCT7 identified by whole exome sequencing increases risk for  myocardial infarction J.

Myocardial infarction is a life threatening disease, which results from sud den atherothrombotic occlusion of a coronary artery. Most cases of MI occur  sporadically but in rare cases the disease accumulates in families. Here we  show by using exome sequencing in such family the identification of hetero zygous mutations (p.Leu163Phefs*24 and p.Ser525Leu) in two functional   ly related genes, GUCY1A3 and CCT7, in 7 and 11 out of 15 affected family members, respectively. Single locus linkage analysis revealed no significant LOD score, however two locus linkage analysis considering both mutations revealed a significant maximum LOD score of 5.68. Moreover, a GWAS of 28K  MI or CAD cases and 75K controls identified a signal across the GUCY1A3  locus (P<1.74x10 8 for rs7692387). While GUCY1A3 encodes the alpha1 subunit of soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC), CCT7 a member of the chapero  nin containing TCP1 complex (TRiC/CCT), which, among other functions,  stabilizes sGC. This enzyme generates cGMP upon stimulation with nitric oxide (NO) and thereby pacifies platelets among other functions. We sub  sequently demonstrated that in vitro sGC activity is severely impaired by  the GUCY1A3 and CCT7 mutations. Platelets from double mutation carriers  contained less sGC protein and consequently a reduced NO induced cGMP  formation. Moreover, in mice deficient for the alpha1 sGC protein subunit thrombus formation in the microcirculation in vivo upon local trauma was  accelerated. In conjunction, we linked mutations in GUCY1A3 and CCT7;  encoding two functionally related proteins, to MI, associated a common va riant in one of the genes to the same disease, and propose defective sGC dependent NO signaling as a mechanism leading to MI.",2012

Chimpanzee and gorilla chromosomes differ from human chromosomes by the presence of large blocks of subterminal heterochromatin thought to be composed primarily of arrays of tandem satellite sequence. Due to the high copy repetitive nature of these sequences, like centromeric and secondary constriction on acrocentric chromosomes, the subtelomeric heterochroma tin is not represented in the existing genome assemblies of the chimpanzee and gorilla. We use a combination of molecular cytogenetics, clone based sequencing, and phylogenetic analysis to explore their sequence compositi   on and organization and show a complex organization composed of specific sets of segmental duplications, which have hyperexpanded in concert with the formation of subterminal satellites. These regions are highly copy num ber polymorphic between and within species and copy number differences involving hundreds of copies can be accurately estimated by assaying read depth of next generation sequencing datasets. Phylogenetic and compara tive genomic analyses suggest that the structures have arisen largely inde   pendently in the two lineages with the exception of a few seed sequences present in the common ancestor of humans and African apes. We propose a  model where an ancestral human chimpanzee pericentric inversion and the  ancestral chromosome 2 fusion both predisposed and protected the chim  panzee and human genomes respectively to the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatin. Our findings highlight the complex interplay between du  plicated sequences and chromosomal rearrangements that rapidly alter the  cytogenetic landscape in a short period of evolutionary time.",2012

A follow up yielded 7 hits with significant (<5% FDR) replication sex difference P values: (a) 6 women specific loci without any effect in men, including 3 novel (near MAP3K1, HSD17B4, PPARG) and  3 previously established (near GRB14/COBLL1, LYPLAL1/SLC30A10, VEGFA)  loci; and (b) one previously published locus (near ADAMTS9  ) with a less  pronounced effect in men.

A second approach to search for sex differences was particularly powered to detect signals with association in both sexes and with opposite effect direction. This method, however, did not yield any signals.Our results underscore the importance of sex stratified analyses in order to illustrate a sexually dimorphic genetic underpinning for anthropometric traits.",2012

Although variations in gene expression among individuals have been documented, the origins of these differences are not clear, and studies that directly measure differences in transcription factor binding si tes among humans have not been performed. We have examined genome wide variation in transcription factor binding in different individuals and a chimpanzee using chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by massively parallel sequencing (ChIP Seq). The binding sites of RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) as well as a key regulator of immune responses, NFÎºB, have been mapped in ten lymphoblastoid cell lines derived from individuals of African, Euro pean, and Asian ancestry, including a parent offspring trio. Using a strin gent threshold, approximately 7.5% and 25% of the respective NFÎºB and Pol II binding regions exhibit differences between any two individuals. To understand the underlying basis of the variations, we examined the effect of  SNPs and genomic structural variations (SVs) on binding differences among  individuals. We find that many binding differences are associated with SNPs  and SVs. Comparison of the binding data with gene expression data gene rated by RNA Seq revealed that differences in binding often correlate with  gene expression differences. Furthermore, comparison of the Pol II human  sites with binding sites identified in the chimpanzee suggests a high level of divergence in binding relative to our closest evolutionary neighbor.

Inclusion or exclusion of regu  latory sequences in the 3â UTR may ultimately affect gene expression levels.  Poly(A) binding protein nuclear 1 (PABPN1) is involved in polyadenylation of pre mRNAs. A repeat expansion in PABPN1 causes oculopharyngeal mus  cular dystrophy (OPMD), a late onset and progressive muscle disorder. Microarray expression profiling of mice overexpressing expanded PABPN1 showed alternative PAS usage in 8% of the interrogated genes. We hypothe sized that previously observed disturbed gene expression patterns in OPMD muscles may have been the result of an effect of PABPN1 on alternative PAS usage.To explore PAS usage on a genome wide level, we developed a single mole cule PAS sequencing method. We identified 2,012 transcripts with altered PAS usage. In the far majority, alternative more proximal PAS were used. This resulted in overall shortening of 3â UTRs and increased expression for most of the transcripts.We recapitulated these changes in PAS usage in myogenic cells by low over   expression of expanded but not wild type PABPN1. Since expanded PABPN1 is known to be trapped in intranuclear inclusions, we investigated the effect of sh RNA mediated downregulation of PABPN1. We found that reduced Pabpn1 levels also resulted in shortening of 3â UTRs. Our data suggest that PABPN1 is involved in PAS selection. We propose therefore that reduced availability of functional PABPN1 in OPMD muscles results in use of alterna tive, proximal PAS, leading to large scale deregulation of gene expression.",2012

The analysis and interpretation of exome data in diagnostics has spe  cific challenges with respect to quality control, the possibility of incidental findings, and allowing for easy and flexible interpretation.

Six heterogeneous diseases are interrogated by exome sequencing: Intel lectual Disability (âde novoâ strategy), Blindness, Deafness, Movement dis   orders, Oncogenetics, OXPHOS diseases (disease gene package). The patient  and/or legal representative need to sign an IC before exome sequencing  can be requested by the clinical geneticist. It includes an agreement for se   quencing their exome and subsequent reporting of all medically relevant  findings, including possible findings not related to the initial enquiry. Se  quence variants detected can be analyzed using a diagnostic oriented GUI that automatically limits genetic findings to the relevant genomic loci for a  disease, and allows interpretation using predefined filter schemes. The results of a cohort of 300 patients (including 100 ID patients) will be presented. QC, cases, and pitfalls will be discussed. Data analysis shows a median coverage of 67x per exome. With the analysis still ongoing, disease  gene package analysis detects on average 378 variants with 2 to 18 private  non synonymous variants per patient.

Cell development is driven and controlled by tem poral and spatial changes in gene transcription,. Single cell RNA Seq analysis can be instructive concerning how individual cells respond to signals at cri   tical stages of cell fate determination, or when they acquire aberrant phe notype. Essentially all cells within an individual organism share a virtually identical genotype, but the individual transcriptomes reflect expression of a subset of genes, which is determined by their epigenetic state, including DNA methylation and histone modifications. If these two copies of a gene are expressed at different levels, the quantities of messenger (mRNA) from individual alleles will differ. This is called allele specific gene expression (ASE). ASE is potentially important for development, and during evolution when a new allele emerges from mutation, which might immediately affect development through changes in expression levels in a heterozygous cell. However, the extent of ASE in individual mammalian cells and, has not so far been examined. Here, we took advantage of recent advances concerning sin gle cell RNA Seq, to analyze allele specific gene expression within individual early mouse blastomeres. We found that around 50% of distinguishable ex   pressed alleles of individual genes showed differential allele specific expres   sion. This shows that ASE is widespread at the earliest stages of mammalian  development.

Currently, GWAS are sometimes accompanied by li mited eQTL (expression quantitative trait locus) data to prioritize the genes within the associated regions, however, a large reference panel is not yet publicly available.Here, we report on a comprehensive cis eQTL (distance between SNP and probe mid point position < 250kb) meta analysis of 5,311 samples (full blood) from seven cohorts using imputed GWAS data. We identified cis ef   fects for 12,500 unique probes (reflecting 8,600 unique genes) and 12,000 independent SNPs, a number that is twice as large as those currently repor   ted in NHGRI GWAS catalog (of which 38% have a cis effect in our analyses). Genes for which we did not detect a cis eQTL were generally very weakly expressed in blood.Since many of the cis eQTLs p values were less than 10 100, we hypothe sized that the top eQTLs were enriched in causal variants.. By comparing ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201227 www.eshg.orgthese extreme eSNPs with small effect eSNPs, we observed highly significant  enrichment of SNPs mapping to splice sites, introns, UTRs, miRNA binding  sites and especially transcription factor binding sites. Surprisingly, we found  that less than 6% of the top eSNPs were coding while only 3% were non synonymous, indicating that regulation of gene expression is predominantly  determined at non coding regions. These results imply that a stronger focus  on investigating non coding variants in future GWAS fine mapping studies is justified.",2012

At the University of Bonn, we have access to a unique sample of pre mortem human hippocampus samples originating from surgery of treatment resistant epilepsy patients.

Differential diagnoses include Albright hereditary osteodystrophy and pseudopseudohypoparathyroidism due to loss of function mutations in GNAS (Î± stimulary subunit of the G protein).Recently, a recurrent mutation in the PRKAR1A has been identified in 3 individuals with acrodysostosis and resistance to multiple hormones ( p.Arg368X). Studying ten unrelated acrodysostosis cases, we identified de novo PRKAR1A mutations in 5/10 (p.Arg368X mutation in 4/10 and p.Tyr373His mutation in 1/10). We then performed exome sequencing in 2/5 remaining cases and selected phosphodiesterase 4D (PDE4D) as a can didate gene. PDE4D encodes a class IV cAMP specific phosphodiesterase, regulating cAMP concentration. We finally identified heterozygous PDE4D mutations in 4/5 cases. All mutations occurred de novo in all 4 cases. Neit her PDE4D nor PRKAR1A mutations were found in one adult patient with characteristic skeletal features but no hormone resistance or facial dysosto sis.Splitting our series based on the disease causing gene revealed interesting genotype phenotype correlations.

Primary hypertrophic osteoarthropathy (PHO) is a rare hereditary condi   tion, which is characterized by digital clubbing, periostosis, arthropathy,  pachydermia, and hyperhidrosis. Recently, mutations within the gene HPGD  encoding the prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) catabolizing enzyme 15 hydroxy  prostaglandin dehydrogenase were found to cause PHO. Here, we analyzed  PHO patients lacking mutations in HPGD for mutations in genes involved in  prostaglandin metabolism namely: PTGS1 , PTGS2 , PTGES, PTGES2 , PTGES3 ,  PTGER1 , PTGER2 , PTGER3 , PTGER4 , SLCO2A1 , SLCO3A1 , SLCO4A1 , PTGR1 ,  and PTGR2. In three unrelated families we identified hetero  and homozy   gous mutations within the solute carrier organic anion transporter family  2A1 (SLCO2A1 ) gene (MIM ID *601460, chromosome 3q21) as underlying  genetic cause for isolated digital clubbing and PHO, respectively. Mutations  in SLCO2A1 comprise a homozygous insertion c.830_831insT , resulting in a  premature stopcodon at p.Phe276fsX18; a homozygous missense mutation  c.1670T>C introducing an amino acid substitution p.Phe557Ser and a he  terozygous nonsense mutation c.754C>T resulting in p.Arg252X. SLCO2A1   encodes the prostaglandin transporter (PGT), which is involved in carrier mediated re uptake of PGE2 across the plasma membrane for metabolic  clearance of prostaglandins. Consequently, in patients with mutations in SL  CO2A1 , elevated PGE2 levels induce the PHO phenotype as well as isolated  digital clubbing. By phenotypic correlation of hitherto identified SLCO2A1   mutations, we found an incomplete penetrance of isolated digital clubbing  in heterozygous carriers, suggesting a threshold effect of impaired PGE2 de   gradation defining disease progression and severity. In summary, our study  establishes mutations in SLCO2A1  as further molecular determinant of PHO  and digital clubbing supporting the importance of PGE2 metabolism for  bone, joint and skin physiology.",2012

Stu   dying FBLN4, FBLN5 and L TBP4 in 12 families with ARCL type I, we found  bi allelic FBLN5 mutations in 2 probands, whereas 9 probands harbored  biallelic mutations in L TBP4. No mutations were identified in FBLN4. FBLN5  and L TBP4 mutations cause a very similar phenotype associated with severe  pulmonary emphysema, in the absence of vascular tortuosity or aneurys ms. Gastro intestinal and genitourinary tract involvement seems to be more severe in patients with L TBP4 mutations. Functional studies showed that  most premature termination mutations in L TBP4 result in severely redu  ced mRNA and protein levels. This correlated with increased transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) signaling. However, one mutation, c.4127dupC, escaped nonsense mediated decay. The corresponding mutant protein (p.R1377fsX27) caused altered binding to fibrillin 1 and loss of binding to fibronectin, leading to an abnormal morphology of microfibrils in fibroblast cultures, while retaining normal TGFÎ² signaling. We conclude that L TBP4  mutations are more prevalent than FBLN5 mutations in ARCL type I. L TBP4  mutations cause disease through both loss of function and gain of function mechanisms.",2012

The occurrence and age of diagnosis of breast and ovarian cancer in all available family members was recorded. Cox regression analysis was applied to assess the correlation between age related penetrance of ovarian cancer and the presence and the age at dia gnosis of breast and ovarian cancer within the family.Results: In total 263 ovarian cancer cases were diagnosed. Among BRCA2  mutation carriers, the risk of ovarian cancer was significantly higher with relatives with ovarian cancer before age 50: HR,2.34, (95% CI,1.18 4.64, p,0.02) with first degree affected relatives and HR,2.11 (95% CI,1.12 3.98, p,0.02) with first  or second degree affected relatives).

Germinal center (GC) derived B cell lymphomas are the most frequent ma  lignant lymphomas with Burkitt lymphoma (BL) being the predominant  subtype in children. Within the German BMBF funded International Cancer  Genome Consortium (ICGC) Network Project ICGC MMML Seq we analyzed four IG MYC positive BL from children treated within the BFM NHL trials.  Genome, exome, transcriptome, miRNAome and methylome sequencing was  performed using Illumina technology.We detected between 1751 and 3174 somatic mutations. There was a good concordance between exome and whole genome sequencing. We identified  between 59 and 105 potentially protein changing somatic mutations, inclu   ding previously known changes in MYC and TP53. Sanger sequencing vali   dated 20/25 new mutations. A total of 16 genes were affected at least twice by potentially protein chan ging mutations, including known lymphoma associated genes (e.g. FBXO11). Remarkably, two of the genes recurrently mutated, ID3 and SMARCA4, are part of the BL index recently described by us and are strongly expressed in BL (Hummel et al., NEJM, 2006). Analysis of the RNAome sequences con firmed the high expression of both genes in BL and provided evidence for aberrant splicing. As we previously reported recurrent homozygous loss at the ID3 locus (Scholtysik et al., Haematologica, 2010) we sequenced ID3 in an extended series of 100 molecularly pre characterized IG MYC positive GC derived B cell lymphomas. We identified ID3 mutations in 36/55 IG MYC positive BL but only 6/45 IG MYC positive GC derived other B cell lympho ma (p<0.001). In the BL, ID3 mutation was associated with a BCL6+/BCL2  phenotype, lower genomic complexity (all p<0.05) and a trend for a better prognosis.",2012

Known causative genes account for the majority of dominantly inherited cases, but for less than 40% of the recessive forms. We previously mapped the SPG28 locus in a Moroccan family to chromosome 14. Capture and next generation sequencing of all exons of the SPG28 interval allowed us to iden   tify a homozygous truncating mutation in the DDHD1  gene, encoding for a  phosphatidic acid (PA) preferring phospholipase A1 that was shown to se   gregate with the disease in patients. In 2 Saudi Arabian families, genome wide linkage studies mapped a new disease locus, SPG49 , to chromosome 4.  Classical Sanger sequencing of the 22 assigned genes allowed us to identify a missense mutation in the CYP2U1 gene, encoding for extra hepatic cyto  chrome P450 protein. The mutation segregates in patients in the 2 fami lies, while 2 other mutations were identified in the same gene, including a frameshift mutation in a kindred from Egypt. All mutations were absent in large series of healthy unrelated controls.The SPG28 and SPG49 mutations were associated with a decreased mi tochondrial respiratory rate in patient lymphoblasts.

Spinocerebellar ataxia type 19 (SCA19) is characterized by a late onset, slowly progressive, mild cerebellar ataxia, postural head tremor, myoclonic  movements, and cognitive impairment. In 2002, we mapped the SCA19 di  sease gene to chromosome region 1p21 q21 in a Dutch family. This candida te region contained ~500 genes, but prioritized candidate gene sequencing  yielded no success. In a further attempt to identify the disease gene, we performed exome se   quencing in two patients of the SCA19 family originally studied. After quali   ty control and other exclusion criteria, we validated 5 missense mutations in  potentially interesting candidates. After screening 400 Dutch controls, only  one missense mutation remained unique for all SCA19 patients in the family (n,12). In addition, we screened the coding region of this candidate gene  in 200 Dutch ataxia cases and identified two more families with missense  mutations that had not been reported before. All of these mutations change highly conserved amino acids. Immunohistochemisty in SCA19 autopsy cerebellum showed a significant  loss of Purkinje cells and altered localization of the mutant protein. Analysis of mRNA and protein levels showed increased expression in patient cere bellum compared to controls. The different mutations alter the subcellular  localization of the SCA19 protein and lead to reduced protein stability. We  were able to rescue the mislocalization of the mutant proteins and increase their protein stability by co expressing auxiliary subunits. Whether these mutations induce a gain  or loss of function is now being investigated. The identification of new SCA genes remains important as they advance our  understanding of the disease etiology.",2012

The neuromuscular junction (NMJ) is a specialized synapse with a complex molecular architecture that serves to achieve reliable transmission between the nerve terminal and muscle fibre. Using linkage analysis and whole exo me sequencing of DNA samples from subjects with distal hereditary motor neuropathy (dHMN) type VII, we identified a mutation in the presynaptic choline transporter (CHT , SLC5A7), a critical determinant of synaptic acetyl choline (ACh) synthesis and release at the NMJ. This dominantly segregating, CHT mutation truncates the transporter just beyond the final transmembra ne domain, eliminating sequences in the cytosolic C terminus known to me diate surface transporter trafficking. Our choline transport assays in both transfected cells and patient monocytes revealed significant reductions in hemicholinium 3 (HC 3) sensitive choline uptake, findings most consistent with a dominant negative mode of action. The paradigm hereditary disorder of the NMJ is the congenital myasthenic syndrome, a genetically heteroge neous neuromuscular disorder resulting from mutations in genes encoding pre , post  and synaptic NMJ proteins. The discovery of CHT dysfunction as sociated with motor neuropathy is an unexpected finding which identifies a new biological basis for this group of conditions and widens the spectrum of disorders that derive from impaired NMJ transmission. Our efforts compel consideration of mutations in CHT or its functional partners in relation to idiopathic forms of the disorder.",2012

By using homo   zygosity mapping in an individual with autosomal recessive (ar) RP from a consanguineous family, we identified three sizeable homozygous regions, together encompassing 46 Mb. Next generation sequencing in these three  regions revealed a homozygous nonsense mutation (c.497T>A; p.Leu166*)  in C8orf37 , located on chromosome 8q22.1. This mutation was not present  in 150 ethnically matched control individuals, single nucleotide polymor   phism databases or the 1000 Genomes database.

We identified the mutated gene responsible for this condition in 10 individuals originating ESHG Concurrent Sessions  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org32 www.eshg.orgfrom the same isolated highly inbred population. A single large continuous  segment of homozygosity on chromosome 12q13.12 containing 35 OMIM  genes was identified in the affected individuals using SNP array based ho  mozygosity mapping. Candidate gene sequencing revealed a homozygous splicing mutation, c.361 1G>C, in GPD1 , which encodes glycerol 3 phosphate  dehydrogenase 1. This mutation is predicted to result in a truncated protein lacking essential conserved residues including a functional site responsible for initial substrate recognition. Functional consequences of the mutation were evaluated by measuring intracellular concentrations of cholesterol  and triglycerides as well as triglyceride secretion in HepG2 (hepatocellu   lar carcinoma) human cells lines overexpressing normal and mutant GPD1   cDNA. Overexpression of mutant GPD1  resulted in increased secretion of  triglycerides (P , 0.01), supporting the pathogenicity of the identified muta   tion. GPD1  mutation may lead to hypertriglyceridemia by limiting the con  version of glycerol 3 phosphate to dihydroxyacetone phosphate, and thus causing an increase in the amount of hepatic glycerol 3 phosphate available  for triglyceride synthesis. The transient nature of the hypertriglyceridemia in the individuals described in this study is compatible with the fact that the rates of triglyceride secretion by hepatocytes are higher in neonates than  in adults.",2012

Within a large scale genome wide Munich ENU (N ethyl N nitrosourea) Mutagenesis Project mutant mouse models for metabolic bone disease were identified using three blood parameters (total alkaline phosphatase activity (ALP), total calcium (Ca), and inorganic phosphate (Pi) levels) which were commonly used as biochemical markers in patients with metabolic bone disease. Here, we describe three different sequencing strategies, (1) a candidate gene ap proach, (2) whole chromosome sequencing, and (3) exome sequencing, to identify novel genes involved in phosphate homeostasis and bone meta bolism. In two mutant mouse lines (BAP012, BAP024) we identified novel Phex alleles (Phex c.148A>T , p. Lys50* and Phex c.2197T>C, p.Csy733Arg) by  capillary sequencing of the candidate gene and extend the available mouse models for X linked hypophosphatemia (XLH, OMIM 307800) to the num ber of 9. In two mutant mouse lines (BAP004, BAP005) the disease causing mutations were identified by linkage analysis, chromosome sorting and whole chromosome sequencing (BAP004: Jak1  c.1933T>C, p.Ser645Pro and  BAP005: Asgr1  c.815A>G, p.Tyr272Cys). In 20 mutant mouse lines and one  C3H wt line we performed exome sequencing using an exome capture kit from Agilent on a HiSeq2000 genome analyzer from Illumina. We identified in each mouse line between 3 and 42 SNVs (single nucleotide variants).

Biosynthesis of GPI anchors involves more than 30 different genes. Genetic defects in various components of the GPI pathway have been identified in a number of phenotypically diverse diseases.We have recently identified mutations in PIGV in individuals with hyper   phosphatasia mental retardation (HPMR) syndrome, an autosomal recessive form of mental retardation with facial dysmorphism, seizures, brachytele phalangy, and persistent elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (hyperphos   phatasia). However, not all patients with HPMR syndrome harbor mutati   ons in PIGV. The purpose of the current study was therefore to investigate the molecular etiology of HPMR syndrome in PIGV negative patients and to establish a next  generation sequencing based screening approach for GPI  pathway diseases. We employed whole exome sequencing of two siblings with HPMR and  identified compound heterozygous PIGO mutations. Screening of further PIGV negative patients detected compound heterozygous PIGO mutations in  another affected individual. The characteristic facial appearance, develop  mental delay, hypoplastic or even absent terminal phalanges including nails and hyperphosphatasia were present in all affected. In a cell based assay, two of three PIGO mutations had a deleterious effect on PIGO function.

Exomes were enriched with SureSelect Human All Exon 50 Mb kits and sequenced to an average read depth of 100. We detected de novo non synonymous variants in 84% of patients. The number per individual varied between 0 and 4. The average number was higher in the disease (1.4/individual) than in the control group (0.8/indivi dual). Specifically, the disease group showed a considerably higher number of nonsense/splice/indel variants (0.37/individual) than the control group (0.1/individual). 16 patients showed de novo mutations in the known ID genes IQSE2, SATB2, SNC2A, SCN8A, SETBP1, SLC2A1, STXBP1, SYNGAP1, TCF4, and MECP2. We regarded at least 8 variants in 8 novel genes to be disease causing because they fulfilled 4 of the following criteria: mutation type (nonsense/splice/frameshift), location in regions known for de novo microdeletions, haploinsufficiency predictions, brain expression, and func tional evidence.

In expanding  our inquiry, we identified three patients with global developmental delay  who carry deletions of the genomic regions encompassing the UPF2 gene,  another important member of the NMD pathway. We hypothesized that loss of one allele of UPF2 and likely loss of other NMD factors impair NMD and  result in neurological phenotype. Using RNA SEQ on lymphoblastoid cells  from UPF2 del patients we identified 1009 differently expressed genes (DEGs). 38% of these DEGs overlapped with DEGs identified in UPF3B pa tients. More importantly, 95% of all DEGs in either UPF2 or UPF3B patients  share the same trend of de regulation. This suggested that the transcripto  me de regulation in UPF2 and UPF3B patients is similar. To gauge into the role of other NMD factors we performed a comprehensive search for copy  number variations (CNVs) encompassing all known NMD factors in ID pati   ents and controls. Our data indicate that CNVs, especially for UPF2, UPF3A,  Y14, SMG6 and EIF4A3 are frequent in patients with neurological disorders  and ID in particular. This tells that the changes in copy number of these fac  tors, and as such dosage imbalance of NMD genes, are likely the causes or predisposing factors to ID.

To study the role of alphaPix/Arhgef6 in neuronal development and plasticity and gain insight into the pathogenic mechanisms underlying ID, we genera ted alphaPix/Arhgef6 deficient mice. Gross brain structure in these mice  appeared to be normal, however, analysis of Golgi Cox stained pyramidal  neurons revealed an increase in both dendritic length and spine density in the hippocampus, accompanied by an overall loss in spine synapses. Early  phase long term potentiation was reduced and long term depression was  increased in the CA1 hippocampal area of alphaPix/Arhgef6 deficient ani mals. Knockout animals exhibited impaired spatial and complex learning  and less behavioral control in mildly stressful situations, suggesting that  this model mimics the human ID phenotype. The structural and electrophy   siological alterations in the hippocampus were accompanied by a significant reduction of active Rac1 and Cdc42, but not RhoA.

To uncover the importance of srGAP3 in the underlying neurodevelopmental processes required for normal cognition, a srGAP3  knockout mouse model  was generated (Waltereit et al. submitted). srGAP3  /  mice exhibit a complex  behavioural phenotype including impaired social interaction along with various neuroanatomical defects. To gain more insight into the molecular processes underlying these defects, we identified novel binding partners of srGAP3. This avenue led us to the discovery that srGAP3 and its novel inter   acting partner lamellipodin co localise to the leading edge of cell protru sions and that srGAP3 inhibits protrusion dynamics through lamellipodin. Additionally, srGAP3  /  hippocampal neurons exhibit excessive lamellipodia  formation. To take the story further, we examined the role of srGAP3 in axon guidance using commissural axon crossing in the spinal cord as a mo del system. We were able to show that axons were not normally positioned after crossing, implicating srGAP3 in axon repulsion from the floor plate. Taken together, our results have begun to uncover the underlying processes in which srGAP3 is playing a role during brain development, thus shedding  light on the importance of this gene in cognitive processes.",2012

This variant affects an exon splice enhancer site and alters mRNA splicing in lymphoblasts of affected family members. Systematic sequence analysis in two POAG patient groups (195 US and 977 German) and their respective controls (85 and 376) lead to the identification of 26 amino acid changes in 70 patients (70 of 1172; 6.0%) compared with 9 in 13 controls (13 of 461; 2.8%; P , 0.008).

Age related macular degeneration (AMD) is a prevalent disease of complex aetiology and one of the leading causes of vision impairment in industria  lized countries. To further our understanding of AMD genetics, 18 groups  from 12 countries formed the AMDGene Consortium in 2010.This endeavor brought together 15 genome wide association studies com  prising 7,650 advanced AMD cases and 51,812 controls of European and  Asian ancestry. The meta analysis revealed SNPs at 32 genomic loci with P < 10 5 that were followed up in 18 additional studies consisting of 9,531 advanced AMD cases and 8,230 controls. In the joint analysis, a total of 19  loci reached genome wide significance (P < 5x10 8) which included all  12 previously established and the seven novel AMD loci COL8A1/FILIP1L (4x10 13), IER3/DDR1 (2x10 11), SLC16A8 (3x10 11), TGFBR1 (3x10 11),  RAD51B (9x10 11), MIR548A2 (5x10 9), and B3GALTL (2x10 8). Pathway  analyses of the 19 loci indicated an over representation of genes involved in complement activity, lipid metabolism and inhibition of angiogenesis the  reby falling well into place with known AMD pathomechanisms. While the  sensitivity analyses indicated that several loci had differences in disease risk between males and females, or in European and Asian ancestry or disease subgroups, the overall predictive value of these variants displayed similar effectiveness in all samples examined (0.69 < AUC < 0.79).Our findings can guide future biological and genetic AMD studies, allow bet   ter classification of individuals at risk, and might ultimately lead to impro ved disease treatment and prevention.",2012

Psoriatic arthritis (PsA) is a common inflammatory joint disease distinct from other chronic arthritides and frequently accompanied by psoriasis vul   garis (PsV). In a first genome wide association study (GWAS), we were able to identify several genetic risk factors. But even combined with previously identified factors, only a fraction of genetic contribution to disease is explai   ned. Therefore we pursued further 16 loci from our GWAS with several SNPs showing association in the range of 5E  8 (, genome wide significance level)  < p value < 1E 5 as well as one functional candidate. 20 of 21 SNPs at 18 loci were successfully genotyped in independent Euro pean cohorts of 1,748 PsA cases and 3,926 control probands, furthermore in ESHG Concurrent Sessions  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org36 www.eshg.orga group of 961 German PsV patients. Association to a RUNX3 variant was re  plicated and resulted in a combined (GWAS + replication) p value of 1.52E 06  in a Cochran Mantel Haenszel test and an OR of 1.20 (1.11 1.29). Further  analyses based on linkage disequilibrium at RUNX3 could pinpoint the most  significant association to the initial SNP located in the first intron of one  isoform.  In the smaller patient group of PsV patients and corresponding  German control individuals, p value was 2.5E 02 and OR 1.22 (0.96 1.56), in  dicating also a role in skin manifestation of psoriasis. Our analyses suggest that variants in RUNX3 contribute to susceptibility to  PsA, a genetic factor already described to be associated with another spon  dylarthritis, ankylosing spondylitis. RUNX3 is a transcription factor involved  in CD8 lymphozyte differentiation and therefore a good candidate for PsA  and PsV as T cell mediated diseases.",2012

Knowing the cause enables anticipation on associated health and behaviour problems, and is essential for adequate counseling regarding re currence risk and prognosis. In recent years, advances in genetic technolo gies have provided great new opportunities for the identification of genetic defects. We aimed to identify genetic causes of ID in a unique cohort of 254, mainly adult, patients with unexplained ID, selected from a large cohort of individuals from Dutch residential settings. Our studies included a multidis ciplinary clinical evaluation, followed by specific genetic diagnostic tests if indicated, and standard genome wide array analysis and a metabolic screen. In the diagnostic part of the study a genetic diagnosis was established in 17.5%, comprising of 12% chromosomal abnormalities and 5% monoge netic defects, mostly fitting syndromes for which the causative genes were identified recently, such as Pitt Hopkins and Kleefstra syndrome. In a small minority (<1%) a primary metabolic cause was established. About 60 pati   ents were selected for further research studies, mainly comprising different  next generation sequencing approaches. So far, these led to the identificati  on of 14 additional likely molecular diagnoses, including both known and novel genetic defects. Pertinent diagnoses included de novo mutations in  PDHA, GRIN2A, DYNC1H1 and GATAD2B . This has increased the current dia  gnostic yield to over 23%.

 NGS panel targeting 150 cilia related disease genes improves diagnostic testing for the broad spectrum of ciliopathies,C15.5,"V. Frank, T . Eisenberger, C. Eitel, C. Decker, H. J. Bolz, C. Bergmann","Bioscientia Center for Human Genetics, Ingelheim, Germany","Cilia related disorders (ciliopathies) are characterized by great clinical and genetic heterogeneity. Literally all organs can be affected, frequent ci lia related manifestations are cystic and polycystic kidney disease, retinal degeneration, situs inversus, polydactyly, skeletal features, and defects of the central and peripheral nervous system. These can occur isolated or as part of syndromes, such as Bardet Biedl, Joubert, Meckel, Jeune, Ellis van Crefeld, and Sensenbrenner syndrome. Variable expressivity and overlaps between different entities often make it difficult to give a clear diagnosis. Genotype phenotype correlations are usually not convincing and mutations in the same gene can cause very different phenotypes. Overall, it is more the rule than the exception that multiple, often dozens of genes are to be considered to be disease relevant in a patient with suspected ciliopathy. Second site modifiers are expected to exert an aggravating effect in an epi static way. In this scenario, altered dosage of disease proteins may disturb cell homeostasis and network integrity contributing to early and more seve re disease expression. We designed a âciliopathy panelâ for next generation sequencing (NGS) that allows the parallel investigation of about 150 cilia related disease genes in a time  and cost efficient manner. We present fa milies from a broad spectrum of cilia related disease phenotypes in which we have used our NGS panel and identified convincing disease related mu tations in different genes corroborating our hypothesis. This novel genetic testing approach considerably improves genetic diagnostics of ciliopathies and deserves increased attention in genetic counselling and the manage   ment of affected families.",2012

The extracted maternal plasma DNA was analy   zed using Illumina sequencing platform HiSeq2000 in a multiplexed fashion. For data analysis a z score equation was used to distinguish samples with fetal aneuploidies from samples with a set of normal fetal chromosomes.

PGD, an established reproductive alternative for couples with high risk of transmitting a monogenic disorder, currently involves PCR based methods. PCR protocols must be robust, sensitive and highly accurate, completely precluding misdiagnosis. Misdiagnosis can be adverse (affected pregnancy/baby) or benign. The twelve adverse misdiagnoses reported to the ESHRE PGD Consortium are likely an underestimate. This study assessed validity, diagnostic value and accuracy of PCR based PGD, through re analysis of untransferred embryos from monogenic PGD cycles. Data from 7 centres included: disease, embryology, assay type (singleplex/multiplex, one  or two cell biopsy), genotype concordance at PGD and follow up. Reasons for discordance included ADO, contamination, mosaic embryo, other. Data from 1352 untransferred embryos was analysed for: sensitivity (Se), specificity (Sp), false negative (FN) and positive (FP) rates, Negative (NPV) and Posi   tive predictive value (PPV), diagnostic odds ratio (OR). Impact of 1  versus 2 cell biopsy, and type of assay (singleplex versus multiplex) on PGD outco me was also assessed. In addition, frequencies of factors leading to discor   dant results (FP or FN) were estimated.Diagnostic outcomes were better for multiplex assays versus singleplex (OR 2116 versus 154), and for two cell versus one cell biopsy (OR 1036 versus 407). However, Sensitivity and NPV of singleplex/multiplex assays compared to one  or two cell biopsy were not significantly different, indicating that 2 cell biopsy is not essential for more accurate clinical results. Inherent risks of PCR based PGD methods (ADO, contamination) accounted for 40.68% of discordant results, whereas mo caisism (biological risk) accounted for 57.63%.

BackgroundIntrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) or stillbirth, accounts for 60% of perinatal  mortality, and its incidence is 1:200 pregnancies. Despite extensive post  mortem investigations, nearly 50% of IUFDs remain unexplained. Since 10 15% of sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS) cases carry functionally  relevant long QT syndrome (LQTS)  or Brugada syndrome (BrS) associated  genetic variants, we hypothesized that sudden arrhythmic death may un derlie some IUFD as well.Methods Ninety eight IUFD cases with negative diagnostic work up (gestational age  at death >,15 weeks; average 26.3Â±8.6 w.) were collected. Molecular scree ning of KCNQ1 (LQT1), KCNH2 (LQT2),  SCN5A  (LQT3, BrS1) genes was per   formed using DHPLC and sequence analysis on genomic DNA extracted from frozen tissue. Each genetic variant identified was evaluated in ethnically matched controls and reference databases. Novel variants were expressed  in mammalian cells and studied using patch clamp technique. ResultsFour missense mutations, absent in >1,000 controls, were identified in 4 IUFD cases (4%). The genetic variants detected in KCNQ1 ( A283T , R397W) and in the 1b splicing isoform of KCNH2 ( R25W) were associated with markedly reduced I Ks and IKr current respectively, consistent with in utero  LQTS type 1 and 2. The mutation identified on SCN5A ( T220I), induced a si gnificant reduction in the late I Na current, consistent with a BrS phenotype. ConclusionsThis study represents the largest cohort of stillbirths in which a molecular autopsy was performed. The results of this study highlight that 4% of unex   plained fetal demise may be due to life threatening arrhythmias secondary to underlying cardiac channelopathies, as LQTS or BrS.",2012

Epigenetic pro cesses such as DNA methylation are primary candidates when searching for mechanisms that can stably modulate gene expression and metabolic pathways due to fetal overnutrition. Umbilical cord blood and placenta tis sue were obtained from 88 newborns of mothers with dietetically treated GDM, 98 with insulin dependent GDM and 65 without GDM. Bisulfite py   rosequencing was used to study the methylation levels of seven imprinted genes involved in pre  and postnatal growth, four genes involved in energy metabolism, one anti inflammatory gene, one tumor suppressor gene and one pluripotency gene. In addition, we examined global DNA methylation of the ALU, LINE1 and alpha satellite repeat families. The maternally imprin ted MEST gene and the non imprinted glucocorticoid receptor NR3C1 gene as well as ALU repeats showed significantly decreased methylation levels in both GDM groups, compared with controls, in both analyzed tissues. De   creased blood MEST methylation was also observed in adults with severe obesity, compared with normal weight controls. The fact that two of 14 ana   lyzed genes and ALU repeats showed significant hypomethylation in new   borns of GDM mothers suggests that the effects are minor (in the order of several percentage points) but widespread. Epigenetic changes in children exposed to a hypergylcemic intrauterine environment provide a molecular link between GDM and life long predisposition to metabolic disorders. Over   all our results support the idea that adverse early life conditions can have long term effects on the epigenome and phenotypic consequences.ESHG Concurrent Sessionswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201239 www.eshg.orgC16.6 SPOC1 is involved in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) C.

Winterpacht1;   1Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich Alexander University, Erlangen, Germany,  2Bundeswehr Institute of Radiobiology affiliated to the University of Ulm, Munich,  Germany. Meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI) and meiotic silencing of unsyn apsed chromatin (MSUC) are two barely understood mechanisms respon   sible for transcriptional silencing of unsynapsed chromatin during male meiosis. It has been shown that both mechanisms are essential for normal spermatogenesis and fertility. Recently, we identified SPOC1 (PHF13) as a  novel gene whose expression is negatively correlated with the survival time  in patients with ovarian cancer. SPOC1 associates dynamically with chroma tin in cell lines (probably via H3K4me3 binding) and plays a role in chromo some condensation and cell division. We demonstrated that male Spoc1 /   mice show pronounced hypoplasia of the testis with progressive loss of  germ cells due to apoptosis in the pachytene stage. Here, we report data of microarray based gene expression analyses performed with testis tissue  from Spoc /  strains and wild type controls. We identified a chromosome  specific dysregulation of transcripts with a highly significant disproportio   nate number of X  and Y  linked genes overexpressed in Spoc1 /  tissue. The  results were verified using qPCR. Together with the increased apoptosis rate  observed during pachytene stage the microarray data strongly suggest an essential function of SPOC1 in meiotic sex chromosome inactivation (MSCI). The formation of the XY  body, the double strand break (DSB) formation/repair, as well as chromosome synapsis seems normal in the knockout testis, which suggests a direct epigenetic effect SPOC1 on X  and Y  linked genes. In conclusion, our data indicate that SPOC1 is a novel factor involved in MSCI, and is essential for the epigenetic control of male germ cell development.",2012

Adjusting for the effects of position 55, we found additional associations to positions 57, 203 and 71 in the DQÎ²1 subunit and to positions 72 and 22 in DQÎ±1. The haplotypes formed by these six positions recapitulate the known risk conferring effects of the classical",2012
" (OR, 2.02), and DQ8 (OR, 4.4) alleles. After controlling for these HLA DQ effects, we found 6 other associated variants within HLA A and HLA B class I, and in DRB1, DPB1 and DPA1 in class II.Our results provide a structural basis for the well known HLA DQ associa tions and confirm that six amino acids can explain the bulk of the observed MHC association.

Marchini1","1Department of Statistics, University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2Conservatoire  National des Arts et MÃ©tiers, Paris, France","Next generation sequencing is now widely used in many studies of human disease and population genetics. Sequencing is still relatively expensive so  many studies are collecting low coverage data that necessitates the use of  phasing and imputation methods to call genotypes and haplotypes at po lymorphic sites. Sequencing reads carry valuable phase information when  spanning two or more heterozygous sites. For example, in the Phase I 1000  Genomes Project data we have found ~33% of the heterozygous sites are covered by phase informative reads. This information is not used by cur rent methods. We have extended SHAPEIT to incorporate the sequencing  read information and boost performance. To compare methods and inve  stigate parameters such as coverage, read length and insert size we have carried out an extensive simulation study of sequence read level data using  the SFS_code. For example, with 5x paired end 100bp reads (500bp insert  size) using phase informative reads increases the mean distance between phasing errors from 85.2kb to 94.0kb. The mean switch distance for BEA   GLE was much lower at 63.5kb. By adjusting the distributions of read length and insert size performance can be substantially improved. These results indicate the likely benefit of future advances in sequencing technologies. On real data we have achieved similar performance but have found necessary to  carefully account for poorly mapped reads and poor calibration of base qua  lities. Overall our results highlight the gains that can be achieved by using phase informative reads when estimating haplotypes from next generation sequence data.",2012

In this way, the pairwise matching is extended to tiny clusters with at least one case and one control. Association P values are obtained by within cluster case control permutation.The matching can be performed both genome wide and window wise (âlo calized matchingâ).

As a byproduct, our implementation strongly outper  forms common covariate approaches based on multidimensional scaling in runtime, and makes genome wide application possible.

 Variants in exons and in transcription factors affect gene expression in trans,C17.5,"A. Kreimer1, I. Peâer2","1Department of Biomedical Informatics, Columbia University, New York, NY, United  States, 2Department of Computer Science, Columbia University, New York, NY, United  States","In recent years many genetic variants have been found to be associated with  gene expression (eSNPs). However, unraveling the causal variants and the  regulatory mechanisms by which they act is still limited. Here we present  a computational framework to study trans eSNPs, integrating SNPs that  are fully ascertained from sequencing data along with publicly available  RNA seq for 50 Yoruban samples. We focus on pairs of eSNP located within  a source gene: anywhere along the span of a Transcription Factor (TF) or  within any known exon. We map the source and its in trans target onto a  Protein Protein Interaction (PPI) network and study their topological pro  perties. When considering pairs of exon source with their corresponding eQTL tar  gets, the more likely their association, the closer they are within the PPI net work and the higher the rank of target. These effects are significantly diffe rent than chance expectation, as demonstrated by randomly permuted data. These results suggest a mechanism for trans regulation by coding variation,  thereby pinpointing the causal SNPs.In addition, the more likely is the association of a TF source eSNP to its tar get, the higher is its rank. These results pinpoint a causal SNP within a TF and suggest a global property of TF sources as hubs in the PPI, even more so than other TFs. The targets of eSNP TFs are enriched for proteins sorted to intracellular membrane bounded organelles.",2012

When confining our analysis to 4,500 SNPs that are known to be associated with complex traits and diseases, we detected over 1,000 SNPs (24%) with trans eQTL effects (FDR 0.05) and over 600 SNPs (14%) with both cis and trans eQTL effects on at least one gene.Although we studied peripheral blood (?leukocytes) and identified many plausible downstream effects for hematological and immune related traits, we also detected significant trans eQTLs for other traits as well. For examp  le, a SNP (rs174550) in FADS1_a gene known to affect lipid and glucose  levels_showed significant association in trans with LDLR gene expression  levels (p value: 4.27*10 14), and we furthermore observed a significant correlation between LDLR gene expression and phospholipid levels.

CantÃº syndrome, also known as hypertrichotic osteochondrodysplasia, is characterized by congenital hypertrichosis, characteristic facial features and cardiac defects. CantÃº syndrome is an autosomal dominant disorder with a thus far unknown genetic cause. We used trio based exome sequencing to detect candidate de novo variants in a selected patient with CantÃº syndrome and his healthy parents. We identified a de novo missense mutation in a sub unit of a potassium channel. Subsequent sequencing of the candidate gene in additional cases was performed to confirm the initial findings. Sanger se   quencing revealed heterozygous missense mutations in the same gene in 13 out of 15 cases. The mutations had occurred de novo in all 7 cases where genetic material from both parents was available. In one male CantÃº pati   ent, the mutation was inherited from an affected mother, providing further support for causality of this gene in CantÃº syndrome. We built a molecular model to gain insight on the effect of the mutations on protein structure. All mutations affect residues in or close to the transmembrane part of the protein. Using patch clamp experiments we show that the mutations in the potassium channel reduce ATP mediated inhibition of this channel. Our findings may have direct implications for the treatment of CantÃº patients because the channel is a known pharmaceutical target.",2012

Linkage analysis in a large Tyrolean kindred identified a homozygous frameshift mutation in FKBP14 in two affected individuals. Based on the cardinal clinical characteristics of the disorder four additional individuals originating from different Eu ropean countries were identified who carried either homozygous or com pound heterozygous mutations in FKBP14. FKBP14 belongs to the family of FK506 binding peptidyl prolyl cis trans isomerases (PPIases). ER resident FKBPs have been suggested to act as folding catalysts by accelerating cis trans isomerization of peptidyl prolyl bonds and to act occasionally also as chaperones. We demonstrate that FKBP14 is localized in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) and that deficiency of FKBP14 leads to enlarged ER cisterns in dermal fibroblasts in vivo. Furthermore, indirect immunofluorescence of FKBP14 deficient fibroblasts indicated an altered assembly of the extracel lular matrix in vitro. These findings suggest that a disturbance of protein fol ding in the ER affecting one or more components of the extracellular matrix might cause the generalized connective tissue involvement in this disorder.

Fraser syndrome (FS) is an autosomal recessive malformation syndrome  characterized by cryptophthalmos, syndactyly and urogenital defects. Thus  far, mutations in FRAS1  and FREM2 have been identified as a cause of FS.  Both FRAS1  and FREM2  encode extracellular matrix proteins that are es   sential for the adhesion between epidermal basement membrane and the underlying dermal connective tissues during embryonic development. Mu   tations in murine Grip1, which encodes a scaffolding protein that interacts  with Fras1/Frem proteins, result in FS like defects in mice. We therefore te  sted GRIP1  for genetic variants in FS families that did not have mutations in  FRAS1  and FREM2 . In three unrelated families GRIP1  mutations were found  to segregate with the disease in an autosomal recessive manner (donor splice site mutation NM_021150.3:c.2113+1G>C in two families and a 4 bp  deletion, NM_021150.3:c.1181_1184del in the third). RT PCR analysis of the  GRIP1  mRNA showed that the c.2113+1G>C splice mutation causes skipping  of exon 17 leading to a frame shift and a premature stop of translation. The FS phenotype of the three probands presented here appears to be indi   stinguishable from the phenotype that results from mutations in FRAS1  or  FREM2 .

 Access to assessment of familial cancer risk by people from minority ethnic communities,P01.01,"A. M. Allford1, C. Lewis1, N. Qureshi2, J. Kai2","1Genetic Alliance UK, London, United Kingdom, 2Division of Primary Care, University of  Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom","Background: Patients from minority ethnic groups diagnosed with, or are at  risk of, cancer with a genetic component appear less likely to access scree ning and other services to assess their higher level of risk than the main  stream population in the UK.Aim: To explore why people from minority ethnic groups with a significant  family history of cancer are under represented in NHS clinical genetics ser   vices to inform interventions and service development to improve quality  of care, and review and dissemination of findings at stakeholder and com munity levels. Methods: Qualitative study using semi structured interviews and focus  groups with: patients with direct experience of familial cancer risk assess   ment; and community members from Black Caribbean, South Asian, and  White Irish communities with, or at familial risk of breast and ovarian, bo  wel, and prostate cancer; and clinical genetics and other key NHS staff. Tran  scripts were analysed using constant comparison of data and processes for  validation and feedback with respondents.Results:  Data were generated with a purposeful sample of 58 respondents  (15 patients, 20 community members, 23 health and other professionals).  Some findings appeared common to all patients, but were amplified for  people from minority ethnic communities, for example in relation to the  challenges of sharing information and decision making within families about cancer and genetic risk. Factors further preventing people being em powered to negotiate health services effectively, obtain appropriate referral  or further assessment included: language barriers and cultural sensitivities  relating to stigma; accessibility of family medical histories; and a non direc  tive emphasis in genetic counselling.",2012

The health informa tion has been collected by medical personnel with access to the electronic health records. The health data are expanded periodically through linking to national registries as well as through follow up.By having the genotypic and longitudinally collected health data for 5% of the Estonian adult population it is possible to estimate the impact of the genomic information on public health. We attempt to present what portion of the population would benefit from a specific genomic test for an actio nable disease by studying the population allele frequencies of the markers associated with the disease and the impact of these markers in the context of the predictive value.

The implementation of cohort biobank studies is intrinsically dependent on the successful recruitment of participants. Studies have shown that the de   cision to enroll is only partly influenced by the information provided during recruitment and mainly relies on individual attitudes and motivations. Cost benefit analyses (which include the potential benefit of receiving informa  tion about oneâs health) also play a significant role in the decision making  process. Whether the (potential) participantâ perception of benefit corre sponds to what the researchers communicate in the informed consent pro cedure is a question that has received increased attention in the last years.  Empirical studies addressing individualsâ motivations to enroll have been  implemented in different biobank settings. For the scope of this review, we focus on the motivations expressed by apparently healthy and legally auto  nomous participants who actually took part to a biobank study. To this end, three literature databases (PudMed, Embase and Web of Sci ence) as well as Google Scholar have been searched with standardized  keywords. To guarantee its systematic approach, the search had been done  twice using the same strings by two different teams of authors. 157 articles considered relevant have then been read independently by four of the au   thors to decide on their inclusion in the review.

Pilot follow up studies in people with a genetic predisposition for cancers,  were created in France in 2009. In this context, a specific database was set up for the follow up of these patients in two French regions. Observance of surveillance recommendations for breast and ovary cancer in patients with a BRCA mutation was studied using the collected data.The patients were at least thirty years old and had known their genetic sta tus for at least 2 years. Concerning the breast, poor observance was defined as an interval of more than 18 months between breast follow up examina   tions. Concerning ovary cancer, poor observance was defined as not having ovariectomy after the age of 50 years. The 2 centers followed 248 women with a BRCA mutation: 232 from 30 to 50 years, and 116 over 50 years.Prophylactic mastectomy was performed in 11/232 women (5%); nine had already had cancer, and two were asymptomatic.

We  therefore set up GGC sessions for cardiomyopathy index patients. Aim: To see whether the quality of care provided by GGC is acceptable to  counselees.Methods: GGC was offered in regional hospitals with few referrals of car diomyopathy patients to our academic center in the past years. Sessions  were led by two counselors: a clinical genetics expert and a group leader.  Patients completed questionnaires before and after counseling, measuring  sociodemographics, Personal Perceived Control (PPC), State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), Clinical Genetics Satisfaction Indicator, etc.Results: 53 patients and 36 relatives attended a course of eight GGC sessions.  PPC scores (range 0 2) increased in 81% of patients, mean item score (SD):  before 0.92 (0.54), after 1.29 (0.38). STAI scores (range 1 4) decreased in  51% of patients, mean item score (SD): before 1.89 (0.58), after 1.68 (0.49). Median score of the Clinical Genetics Satisfaction Indicator (range 1 5) was 4.93. Conclusion: This is the first report of GGC being used for cardiomyopathy  patients. On average, personal perceived control increased and anxiety was  lowered. Mean changes in PPC and STAI were comparable to reports for group and individual counseling in oncogenetics. Satisfaction scores were high, patients reported their questions were answered during the sessions  and they received no undesired information. Our study indicates GGC is well  accepted.

Findings indicate a low level of awareness of direct to consumer genomic  testing in both users and some health professionals. Consumers appeared motivated to purchase tests to obtain information to guide their own health management while some wanted to avoid disclosure of genetic risk to health professionals. Potential users expressed concerns about privacy, reliability of genomic tests and the nature of results. Many consumers preferred to discuss the test with a health professional before and after testing, while health professionals expressed concerns for the consumer such as misin   terpretation of results and increased anxiety due to perceived risks. In the review of policies, more potential harms than benefits were cited. An area of concern was the overstatement of the actual predictive power or utility of the results. Strong recommendations were made about the need to involve health professionals and to regulate test quality. We conclude that there is public interest in direct to consumer genomic tests.

A few stu dies have been published regarding the publicâs view of these services but none have specifically addressed the publicâs desire for âunrestrictedâ ac cess to their genomic information. The goal of this study is to increase our understanding of the publicâs views of accessing GT without the intermedi   ate of a health care professional.

Of the 522 individu als who have signed the petition to date, 240 individuals have also written comments; these were the focus of our content analysis. Preliminary results reveal that the main themes raised by the petitioners include: i) the notion that each individual âownsâ their DNA and ii) that individuals have the right to access information about their DNA; iii) the notion that regulation of DTC GT falls outside of the realm of the governmentâs control; and iv) the belief that involving health care professionals as intermediates provides no added value for consumers.

HorstkÃ¶tter1,2, R. Berghmans1,2, G. de Wert1,2;   1Maastricht University, CAPHRI, Maastricht, Netherlands, 2Centre for Society and  Genomics, Nijmegen, Netherlands. Current research in the genomics (and neurobiology) of antisocial behavior  (ASB) trigger great hopes and expectation concerning the development of  new forms of early detection of children at risk and of targeted early preven  tion. Children as young as preschoolers, toddlers and babies are considered the most important target group of such efforts. While scientific research  progresses continuously, it is of great importance to pro actively consider  the social and ethical implications of potential applications. This presentati on reflects on this development from an ethical point of view.It investigates whether and when it may be justified to expect that early  detection and prevention is mainly for the good of those identified and in  tervened upon, what are relevant caveats and dangers and how both are to be balanced. Issues that will be discussed encompass increased support,  empowerment and emancipation as well as dangers of stigmatization and  labeling, surveillance and repression, privacy concerns, and possible negati ve impacts on childrenâs development and (self)perception. However, unlike much other ELSI research, this presentation wants to avoid  any kind of gene exceptionalism. That is, it will argue that from an ethical point of view it is of secondary interest whether future prevention practices are informed by either new genomical or traditional social/psychological  findings. Instead, the ethical evaluation should focus on the characteristics,  specificities and conditions of use of any measure applied. To this end, the proposed ethical analysis of early prevention practices will be conducted in a comparative way.",2012
 Poster for ESHG: Comprehensive embryo screening. Results from two focus group studies,P01.16,"K. Hens, W. J. Dondorp, G. M. W. R. de Wert","Maastricht University, Maastricht, Netherlands","Genetic testing of embryos is done in two contexts. preimplantation gene tic diagnosis (PGD) is done when one or both of the prospective parents are known carriers of a genetic disease, be it a Mendelian condition or a chromosomal translocation. Preimplantation genetic screening (PGS) is the screening of embryos from infertile or subfertile couples undergoing IVF to select the embryo which is most likely to lead to a successful pregnancy. The technique of PGS is not standard offered to couples, because it is still uncertain whether it really leads to improving implantation rates. However, with the introduction of microarray technology, and single cell whole geno me sequencing, embryos could also be screened for Mendelian disorders, susceptibility genes and potentially non medical traits. Hence, the aim of PGS may shift from choosing the best embryo for transfer in order to ensure a successful pregnancy, to choosing the embryo most likely to develop into a healthy child, to even selecting the âbest childâ. In order to understand the ethical questions arising from the introduction of comprehensive screening techniques in clinical practice, we have conducted two focus group studies. One study, which was performed in October 2011, explored the opinions of top scientists in the field of embryo testing regarding the technical possibi   lities and associated ethical questions. The other study, performed in March 2012, was conducted with gynecologists and genetic counselors and explo   red opinions about possible dilemmas and their solutions in IVF practice.

 Predictive genetic testing for Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP) in young children,P01.17,"A. A. Kattentidt , M. den Heijer, I. van Kessel, A. Wagner","Erasmus Medical Centre, Rotterdam, Netherlands","Objective. Predictive genetic testing for familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is routinely offered to children at risk from the age of 10 years on wards. Because of absence of medical benefits, potential psychosocial harm and respect to the childâs autonomy, predictive testing for FAP at younger age is reluctant. As a result, there is a lack of experience in predictive testing of children at the young age.Patients and methods. We evaluated 13 children from 8 families, tested for an APC  mutation at the age younger then 10 years (the male to female ratio  was 1.6:1; mean age was 6,4 years (2 9 years); 7 APC carriers and 6 non carriers). All parents were re contacted and structural interviewed.Results. None of the contacted parents regretted the timing of genetic te sting. Ten children were tested at the same moment with an older sibling. The main reasons for testing were 1) testing all children in a family at the same moment (4:13); 2) a possibility to prepare a child for future surveil  lance (3:13); 3) certainty about the future (3:13). According to the parents  none of the children showed changes of mental and physical health after testing. Conclusion. Genetic testing for FAP at a young age is desired by some parents  and is experienced as causing no harm. However, the effects of early genetic testing on children and their own experience should be evaluated in future studies. a.mouravieva@erasmusmc.nl",2012

Recurrent themes were identified after verbatim  transcription and content analysis.Consecutively, a Delphi consensus procedure was conducted. A purposively  selected heterogeneous panel (n,18) of experts participated. Educational  needs regarding genetics in general practice in terms of knowledge, skills and attitudes, were rated and ranked in a Top 10. Results Four themes emerged from the focus group study: (1) genetics knowledge, (2) family history, (3) ethical dilemmas and psychosocial effects in relation to genetics and (4) insight into the organisation and role of clinical genetics  services. These themes reflected a shift in the role of genetics in primary  care with implications for education.The entire Delphi study panel completed all three rounds.

This paper will review  the state of genetics instruction in the United States from the perspective  of backward design, with particular attention to the goals and assessments that inform curricular practice. An analysis of syllabi and leading textbooks indicates that genetics instruction focuses most strongly on the structure  and function of DNA and Mendelian genetics. At the same time, a survey  of faculty indicates that other concepts, such as the application of genetics  to society or the environment, are viewed as equally or even more impor   tant than certain foundational concepts.

For example, the advent of stratified medicines has enabled the co development of therapeutic products and âcompanion www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201249 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters diagnosticsâ which are used together to prospectively target individuals who  through genetic factors, are at risk of disease.

Current legal and regulatory frameworks do not provide a clear route for developing these linked applications and the safeguards, protections and  incentives for developing packages of diagnosis, treatment and care some   times lack coherence. Other emerging technologies, such as the diagnostic algorithms that sup port the process of stratification, may not be within the remit of existing  legislative frameworks at all, or may be protected by non patent intellectual  property rights, such as copyright. In other respects, the regulatory frame work is predicated upon outdated assumptions, such that products and de   vices can always be easily differentiated, or that the processes in bringing a product, device or test to market will take place entirely within Europe, when increasingly this is a global exercise. In combination, these factors have the potential to negatively impact upon  clinical translation and national healthcare economics.

Over the recent years, a growing number of patient databases are being created to accommodate patient data for various diseases. Registries acting as a hub for information and social awareness, can prove very beneficial to the patients registered and society in general, especially since they help di sease organizations with government lobbying. They also provide valuable information to scientists, helping them to perform research on a bigger sca le, having access to accumulated medical and genetic data. For neuromus cular disorders in particular, patient registries have played a significant role facilitating clinical trials designed to test for new therapeutic strategies and thus have promoted research regarding those types of diseases.

The main concept behind the HNDR is to organize a reliable electronic database, containing clinical and personal data of all patients in order to provide important data for the study and research of neuromus cular disorders in Greece. Ultimately, the goal is to connect the Hellenic re gistry to the global network of patient registries that is universally being developed ensuring that patients who register in the HNDR can be retrieved if their profile fits to a clinical trial.",2012
 Incidental findings in genetic testing: current laboratory reporting procedures,P01.31,"L. M. Jackson , L. Goldsmith, H. Skirton","Plymouth University, Plymouth, United Kingdom","Incidental findings from genetic testing are defined as those that have po tential health or reproductive importance and are discovered in the course of testing but beyond the aims of the initial test. Since genetic testing was initiated there has been a potential for incidental findings, but numbers are likely to increase with the emergence of array and sequencing techniques. A genetic incidental finding is unlikely to require immediate treatment; most often it will affect the relative risk of a patient developing a disease. This raises questions as to which genetic incidental findings should be returned to the patient, at what time and by whom. These issues are passionately de   bated in the ethical literature, however there is a paucity of empirical data on which to base recommendations. The aim of this study was to determine current practice and ascertain the views of many different stakeholders as to future management of incidental findings. In the first phase a systematic review indicated a dearth of empirical evidence on dealing with incidental findings. In Phase 2 we surveyed staff of national health service genetics laboratories in the United Kingdom to determine how incidental findings were reported. Our initial findings indicate a lack of consensus; no univer   sally accepted set of guidelines were used and decisions were made on a case by case basis. This individualised approach may interfere with equity of patient care.

Decisions regarding how and by whom relatives at risk for the dis   order should be informed are included in the counselling. Aim: To examine how aspects of respect for autonomy are addressed by ge  netic counsellors when patients have relatives deemed to be at risk.Method: Data from empirical observations of genetic counselling, insight in medical charts, and discussion with health care personnel regarding infor   mation strategies for relatives was gathered and analysed through a struc tured, philosophical theoretical approach.Results: When relatives are informed by a tested patient, the outcome of  their experience and perception of the information is influenced by how  they are informed.Counselees are affected by their own diagnosis and may be challenged in  disseminating complex genetic information correctly to relatives. Problems particularly arise when lack of communication in families is pre sent and when relatives are in conflict.Health care professionals are reluctant to contact relatives at risk directly, to  respect their right to not know. Discussion:  Existing procedures for informing relatives at risk may be inade  quate. Complexities of genetic information, combined with tested patientsâ emotional reactions, reduce relativesâ access to relevant information, neces   sary for making autonomous and rational choices about their future.A more proactive role for health care professionals seem warranted, towards increasing accurate information and knowledge of options, enabling patient and relatives to make informed, autonomous decisions.",2012

The facial features were dysmorphic with: prominent forehead, hypertelo rism, low set and posterior rotated ear, dysplastic ears small mandible and broad based nose. Radiological findings were: markedly thin ribs, flat ace tabular roof of pelvic, no talus or calcaneus ossification, hypoplastic pubic ossification, asymmetric femoral size and narrow thorax. Parents are first cousins with history of two spontaneous abortions. Cytogenetic analysis, performed by array CGH revealed a 5.6 Mb region deletion of chromosome 10q25.1 q25.3. Chromosomal studies of both parents were normal confir   ming the abnormality to be of de novo origin.To the best of our knowledge this phenotype with major anomalies which had lead to intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD) has not been reported before with this deletion. The unique presentation of our case notably, agenesis of diaphragm is a very rare finding and not reported previously in 10q deletion cases. It should be taken into consideration that most cases with agenesis of diaphragm had normal chromosomes based on karytoype, and it is possible that minor chromosomal abnormalities were missed with routine cytoge netic techniques.",2012

Here we present three unrelated patients with intellectual  disability carrying novel heterozygous interstitial deletions encompassing  13q12.3. The proximal and distal breakpoints are similar and the deletions span about 1.4 Mb, comprising at least 11 RefSeq genes. The patients present with moderate intellectual disability, secondary micro  cephaly and short stature as the leading symptoms. In addition, they experi enced pronounced feeding difficulties in early infancy and later on eczema/atopic dermatitis. They display strikingly similar facial features such as full   ness of the periorbital region, a flat malar region, a characteristic nose with a bulbous nasal tip and hypoplastic alae nasi, a smooth philtrum and thin upper lip. Heterozygous deletions of 13q12.3 overlapping about 1 Mb of the distal  part of the deletions in our patients have been described in healthy carri   er parents of patients with Peters Plus syndrome (an autosomal recessive  disorder caused by inactivation of the B3GAL TL gene). We therefore propo  se that the critical region of the 13q12.3 microdeletion syndrome contains  only three genes, namely, KATNAL1 , LINC00426  and HMGB1. So far, little is  known about the function of the KATNAL1  and LINC00426  genes in humans.  HMGB1, however, is an evolutionarily conserved chromatin associated pro tein which has been implicated in various disease processes.In summary, we suggest that microdeletion 13q12.3 represents a clinically  recognizable condition characterized by intellectual disability, microcepha  ly, short stature, a disposition for atopy and characteristic facial features. The critical region encompasses about 300kb with 3 genes assigned to it.",2012

Our patient 1 with a deletion overlapping both, the distal and proximal 15q25.2 deletions, presented with mild lear ning deficits, portal vein thrombosis, iron deficiency anaemia, short stature, and Noonan syndrome aspect.

We demonstrate a 50% reduction in copy number of RPS17 in our patient 1 by quantitative real time PCR. Loss of two copies of RPS17 might be responsible for at least some of our patients features. As the clinical spectrum of DBA includes individuals without DBA who have other DBA associated congenital anomalies, patients with proxi mal 15q25.2 deletions should be monitored for development of anaemia and DBA associated malignancies.Patient 2 with the more distal 15q25.2 deletion presented with severe psy   chomotor retardation, microcephaly and epileptiform signs.

Subsequently we analysed the 22q11.2 deletion features in our large patient cohort of CHD7 mutation  carriers (n,834). In 29 patients (3.5%) typical 22q11.2 deletion features, like hypocalcaemia, thymus anomalies and severe immunological problems, were mentioned. This prompted us to study CHD7 in 20 patients clinically  diagnosed as 22q11.2 deletion syndrome but without deletion or mutation of TBX1. We found truncating CHD7 mutations in five of these patients. Our results demonstrate that the clinical diagnosis of these two highly va riable syndromes is challenging.

From family histories of non consan guineous parents, a paternal aunt showed ID, delayed speech, and obesity. Karyotype analyses showed the deletion of 3p not only in affected sibs but also in their healthy father. Characterization of the rearrangement extent was performed by InfiniumHD whole genome genotyping assay (Huma nOmniExpress BeadChip arrays). The analysis of brothers showed identical 3p25.3 terminal hemizygous deletion of 10.9 MB. The deletion encompasses 49 RefSeq genes, including proposed 1,5 Mb minimal terminal deletion with causative CRBN and CNTN4 genes, and two others proposed as major candi dates for ID: CHL1 mapped at 3p26.3 distally and SRGAP3 mapped at 3p25.3 proximally to minimal terminal region.

Aarskog Scott syndrome is an X linked recessive syndrome caused by FDG1 mutations and characterized by dysmorphism, shawl scrotum, short stature  and brachydactyly. We demonstrate that carrier females are distinguishable  based on craniofacial measurements. We evaluated 20 adult females, out of  which 16 are obligatory carriers, 1 is a molecularly verified carrier, and 3 are  verified non carriers. First, we compute the likelihood to be sampled from the matched control population for each of 21 craniofacial measurements. The combined likelihood scores demonstrate a moderate recognition rate with Area Under ROC Curve (auc) of 0.74. In order to improve the recogni tion rate, we consider the interaction variables that correspond to all pairs of measurements. Since the individual measurements of the control popu lation became unavailable once the statistics of each measurement were computed, we cannot directly estimate the distribution of the interaction variables. Instead, we employ a second data set of 21 adult female Navajos, for which five cranio facial measurements that are common with the ones of the Aarskog Scott syndrome carrier dataset are available per person. Em ploying only these five measurements and correcting for the correlations among the derived interaction variables, we are able to obtain an improved recognition rate (auc of 0.78). This is significantly higher than the recogniti on rate obtained from these five measurements without considering the in teraction variables (auc of 0.65). Therefore, our results highlight the utility of interaction variables in evaluation of facial features and support the usage of surrogate correlation matrices when such data are unavailable.",2012

Congenital abdominal wall defects are one of the most common malforma tions. The purpose of this study is to assess the main factors that may in fluence the outcomes of the treatment of omphalocelle and laparoschizisul. Between 1999 and 2010, 96 patients (53 boys and 43 girls) were admitted in the Pediatric Surgery Departments of two of the major pediatric hospitals in Romania. There were 62 with laparoschizis and 34 with omphalocelle. Primary closure of the abdominal defect was possible in 49 cases of laparo schizis (79%) and 21 cases of omphalocelle (60%). Complications occurred in 57 patients with infectious one being the most prevalent. Overall morta lity rate was 62,5 %, 69% for laparoschizis and 50% for omphalocelle. In table 1 and 2 are summarized the main prognostic factors assessed by us. Conclusions: The main predictors for complications are: low APGAR score, masculine gender, incongruence between abdominal cavity and the hernia   ted bowel, postoperative anemia, thrombocytopenia and renal insufficiency during postoperative course. The main predictors for an unfavorable outco me are: low birth weight, low APGAR score, masculine gender, incongruence between abdominal cavity and the herniated bowel, associated malformati ons, postoperative anemia, thrombocytopenia, renal insufficiency, pulmona   ry infections and sepsis during the postoperative course  Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org54ESHG Posters www.eshg.orgMann Whitney U Wilcoxon W Z p Sex 894,000 1674,000  1,884 0,050 Gestational age 813,500 2088,500  ,554 0,579 Birth weight 878,000 2418,000  1,306 0,192 APGAR 444,500 1572,500  2,578 0,010 Prenatal diagnostic 1032,000 1812,000  1,175 0,240 Natural birth/ C section 1089,000 2742,000  ,234 0,815 Presentation 1110,000 1890,000  ,029 0,977 Maternal age 683,500 1673,500  ,745 0,456 Heredo colateral 73,000 128,000  ,590 0,555 Alcohol/ cigarettes 99,500 144,500  ,223 0,823 Type of the defect 814,500 2467,500  2,675 0,007 Size of the defect 778,500 1306,500  ,358 0,720 Herniated organs 1056,000 1836,000  ,478 0,632 Chromosomal aberrations 1075,500 2728,500  ,561 0,575 Cardiac malformations 981,000 1761,000  1,411 0,158 Intestinal atresia 1105,500 2758,500  ,078 0,938 Scheletale malformations 1069,500 1849,500  ,547 0,584 Renal malformations 1093,500 2746,500  ,388 0,698 Malformations overall 883,500 2536,500  1,786 0,717 Surgical intervention 1090,500 1870,500  ,374 0,709 Age at operation 264,000 792,000  1,058 0,290 Surgical procedure 794,000 1497,000  1,941 0,052 Reinterventions 818,500 1521,500  1,500 0,134 Concomitant operations 908,000 2183,000  ,216 0,829 Anemia 846,000 1626,000  2,299 0,021 Thrombocytopenia 850,500 1630,500  2,299 0,022 Renal insufficiency 855,000 1635,000  2,588 0,010 Hidro electrolitic disturbances 922,500 1702,500  1,641 0,101 Positive cultures 880,500 1660,500  2,080 0,038 Mann Whitney U Wilcoxon W Z p Sex 846,000 1512,000  2,056 0,040 Gestational age 660,000 2145,000  1,631 0,103 Birth weight 586,000 2297,000  3,404 0,001 APGAR 307,000 1633,000  3,718 0,000 Prenatal diagnostic 1062,000 1728,000  ,270 0,787 Natural birth/ C section 1038,000 1704,000  ,444 0,657 Presentation 1074,000 2904,000  ,118 0,906 Maternal age 555,500 1731,500  1,936 0,053 Heredo colateral 56,000 92,000  1,421 0,155 Alcohol/ cigarettes 56,000 462,000 ,000 1,000 Type of the defect 876,000 2706,000  1,864 0,062 Size of the defect 760,000 2245,000  ,224 0,822 Herniated organs 873,000 1539,000  1,810 0,070 Chromosomal aberrations 1080,000 2910,000 ,000 1,000 Chromosomal aberrations 882,000 1548,000  2,171 0,030 Cardiac malformations 1056,000 2886,000  ,317 0,751 Intestinal atresia 912,000 1578,000  2,219 0,026 Scheletale malformations 1056,000 2886,000  ,525 0,600 Renal malformations 966,000 1632,000  1,709 0,087 Malformations overall 860,000 2690,000  1,727 0,050 Surgical intervention 972,000 1638,000  1,949 0,051 Age at operation 178,000 958,000  1,603 0,109 Surgical procedure 705,500 1371,500  2,786 0,005 Reinterventions 883,500 2368,500  ,649 0,517 Concomitant operations 853,500 2284,500  ,612 0,540 Postoperative bowel occlusion 986,000 2526,000  ,045 0,964 Anemia 978,000 2808,000  ,896 0,370 Thrombocytopenia 828,000 1494,000  2,251 0,024 Renal insufficiency 810,000 1476,000  2,764 0,006 Hidro electrolitic disturbances 1020,000 1686,000  ,528 0,597 Positive cultures 900,000 1566,000  1,644 0,100 Blood transfusion 1008,000 1674,000  ,631 0,528 Fever 972,000 1638,000  1,018 0,309 Enterocolitis 966,000 1632,000  1,709 0,087 Pneumonia 540,000 1206,000  4,825 0,000 Sepsis 642,000 1308,000  3,848 0,000 Wound infections 1074,000 2904,000  ,118 0,906 Overall complications 630,000 1296,000  4,003 0,000",2012
 Aicardi GoutiÃ¨res syndrome type 1 in a Russian family,P02.019,"G. E. Rudenskaya1, E. Y. Zakharova1, E. S. Ilyina2","1Medical Genetics Research Centre, Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Russian State  Pediatrics Hospital, Moscow, Russian Federation","Aicardi GoutiÃ¨res syndrome (AGS) is a rare early onset hereditary encepha lopathy with some features of congenital virus infection which often leads to misdiagnosis. AGS is genetically heterogeneous, five genes are known and genotype phenotype correlations exist. TREX1  mutations produce AGS type  1, a severe neonatal onset form making up 25% of AGS cases. Inheritance is autosomal recessive but few cases due to heterozygous TREX1  mutation de  novo are known. We diagnosed AGS type 1 in a non consanguineous family with two affected children, a 1.5 year old girl (index case) and a 9 year old  boy (whom we did not examine personally). Both children had typical pre  sentation: uncomplicated pregnancy and delivery, normal condition in first weeks of life, unexplainable fever >38 oC, leukocytosis and severe motor and  mental delay with variable neurological signs since 1 1.5 months, stabili   zation and partial improvement with time, multiple petrificates and white matter lesions on CT/MRI. Along with intrafamilial likeness few differences in MRI and clinical signs were seen. There were no characteristic skin chil  bains. The boyâs previous diagnosis was âcerebral palsy due to congenital  CMV infectionâ, and risk for the second child was mistakenly considered low. AGS was first recognized in the girl. Homozygosity for TREX1  mutation  c.342G>A (p.Arg114His) was detected. The mutation is most common in Eu  ropean populations and is supposed to have common origin due to founder  effect [Crow et al, 2006]. Evidently, ours is the first AGS Russian case which shows its underestimation in practice. AGS should be considered in âCNS  congenital infectionâ with negative virusological tests.",2012

We will illustrate the clinical heterogenei   ty of the ALX4  related craniofacial malformations by describing the first fa  milial case segregating a heterozygous mutation and with an intermediate  phenotype between isolated parietal foramina and the severe ALX4  related  frontonasal dysplasia with alopecia and genital abnormality phenotype (ALX4 related FNDAG).The proband, the second child of non consanguineous parents, has had nor   mal cognitive development and his craniofacial features included hypertelo rism, telecanthus, epicanthus, broad nasal bridge, notch at the tip of his long nose and fronto parietal alopecia. These features strongly resembled his mother. He also presented with bilateral cryptorchidism and broad thumbs. Cranial and limbs X rays disclosed only parietal foramina in both the patient and his mother.The coding region sequencing of the ALX4  gene disclosed a novel heterozy   gous mutation on the proband and his mother: p.Asp326fs (c.1080 1089_delGACCCGGTGCinsCTAAGATCTCAACAGAGATGGCAACT; cDNA reference: NM_021926.3; protein reference: NP_068745.2). This mutation was consi   dered causative of the phenotype based on the facts that it is a frameshift mutation with generation of a stop codon and it segregates only in the affec ted individuals within this family.We have, then, expanded the phenotype of the ALX4  related craniofacial anomalies by describing a patient harboring  a heterozygous loss of function mutation in the ALX4  gene that presents a  mild frontonasal dysplasia associated with parietal foramina. This illustrates the broad phenotypic spectrum associated to mutations in ALX4  gene, ran  ging from isolated parietal foramina to a severe frontonasal involvement.",2012

We report a 22 months old girl with the diagnosis of complete androgen in  sensitivity syndrome (CAIS). From her medical history, we learned that she  had been operated because of left inguinal hernia. Its pathological exami  nation revealed immature testis without malign transformation. Ultrasono graphy and MRI had shown testis in right inguinal channel, but no wolffian  derivatives. In laboratory, basal testosterone was 57,6 ng/dL, stimulated  testosterone was 264 ng/dL, stimulated DHT was 30 ng/dL. Accordingly,  stimulated T/DHT ratio was calculated as 8,8. Her basal LH was 2,22 mIU/mL, basal FSH was 0,94 mIU/mL. Direct sequence analysis of the androgen receptor (AR) gene showed c.88G>A mutation in exon 1 causing p.val30met  in N terminal domain of the AR. It may disrupt receptor activity in two ways.  Firstly, val30 residue is too close to  23FQNLF27 primary androgen dependent  motif which stabilizes hormone receptor complex via N/C interaction. Alt   hough both amino acids are hydrophobic in nature, methionine is a bigger  molecule than valine. Hence, it may distort the delicate three dimensio   nal structure of the protein and interfere with receptor activity. Secondly, c.88G>A creates a noncanonical start codon. Translation initiation from this noncanonical start codon removes  23FQNLF27 motif and disrupts N/C inter   action. There are very few missense mutations in exon 1 shown to cause CAIS, and p.val30met mutation has never been reported before.",2012

Recently, mutations in the SMAD3  gene were found to cause a new autoso   mal dominant aneurysm condition similar to Loeys Dietz Syndrome (LDS), mostly with osteoarthritis, called Aneurysms Osteoarthritis Syndrome (AOS).Our proband is a 3 year old boy who underwent correction of an inguinal hernia at 3 months and substitution of the ascending aorta for pathologic dilation at 12 months of age. He also presents LDS like facial features and elongation and kinking of the thoracic aorta on MRI. Family history reveals aortic dilation in his mother, death due to aortic dissection of an 18 year old maternal aunt, surgical replacement of the ascending aorta because of an eurysm in a maternal uncle at 19 years of age, postpartum death of the ma ternal grandmother at 24 years and surgical intervention because of thora cic aortic aneurysm in a brother of the probandâs grandmother at 54 years. Other clinical findings in affected individuals include pes planus, striae, easy bruising, dural ectasia, degenerative disc disease, hiatus hernia, premature loss of teeth. No radiologic evidence of osteoarthritis was present in the fa mily. Molecular testing of the TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes , involved in LDS ,  resulted negative, but analysis of SMAD3  disclosed the novel heterozygous loss of function mutation c.1170_1179del (p.Ser391AlafsX7) in exon 9 in all affected family members, confirming the diagnosis of AOS. SMAD3  mutati   ons should be considered in patients of all ages with LDS like phenotypes and negative TGFBR1/2  molecular tests, especially in the presence of early  onset osteoarthritis.

Symptoms resolved with discontinuation of treatment.Those observations suggest high susceptibility to antipsychotic agents in  this population and could be move closer to description of two Angelman  patients who develop in adulthood extra pyramidal features consistent with Parkinson Disease with spectacular improvement with L Dopa therapy (Harbord 2001). It could be useful to perform DAT Scan in Angelman patients. In the same way, in the mouse model (maternal loss of Ube3a ), number of neurons in the substantia nigra is significantly reduced and motor deficits could be attributed to the dysfunction of the nigrostriatal pathway (Mulher kar et al, 2010).Furthermore the dysregulation of CaMKII could be responsible of neurologi cal phenotype and could be improved by Levodopa.In this population, if neuroleptic medication turns out necessary, we suggest to use atypical neuroleptic with different pharmacokinetic pathway with less affinity to Dopaminergic receptors D2.Those results could improve our understanding of pathophysiological me chanisms involved in Angelman syndrome and lead to finalize new thera peutic strategies.",2012

Angelman syndrome (MIM 105830) is a complex neurodevelopmental dis   order caused by loss of function of the imprinted UBE3A gene in 15q11 q13 region. Approximately 7% of cases are due to paternal uniparental disomy (UPD). Our case is the first child of healthy non consanguineous Italian ma ting. He was born at term after uneventful pregnancy. At birth no anomalies were referred, birth weight , 3540g (50Â° centile). Growth curve was normal and at 6 yrs his paramethers were: weight , 37Kg (>>97Â°), height , 125cm (50Â° 75Â°) and OFC , 52cm (50Â° 75Â°). He had normal motor development (sitting , 6m, walking , 10m). He was evaluated for absence of speech. All audiological investigations were normal. He had friendly personality. No fa cial dysmorphysms were evidenced and no seizures were referred, although sleeping EEG showed anomalies. Molecular karyotype analysis using âHu manCyto 12 BeadChipâ ILLUMINA, revealed a paternal UPD 15 mosaicism. Data analyzed with GenomeStudio 2011.1 (cnv Partition 3.1.6) and Penn CNV, showed a 80% percentage of mosaicism, which was calculated from B allele frequencies. Results confirmed by UPD study. Is the first time that we can describe a somatic paternal UPD 15 mosaicism. UPD 15 patients nor   mally have milder phenotype with a better prognosis, and our case is a very mild condition with mainly severe speech delay and truncal obesity. If we compare with other cases due to somatic mosaicisms of the imprinting cen ter, our case could clinically overlap although maybe is still milder.

Anorectal malformations (ARM) occur in about 1 in 2,500 live births. Similar  to most congenital defects, ARM can occur as an isolated malformation or  associated with other defects or syndromes. To date, no causative genetic or  non genetic factor has been unequivocally identified in humans. Since intel lectual disabilities (ID) are frequently associated with chromosomal aber  rations, we suggested that a cooccurrence of ARM and ID will make it more  likely to detect causative CNVs (copy number variations).Molecular karyotyping, utilizing 1,134,514 SNPs (single nucleotide poly   morphisms), was performed to screen 30 non isolated ARM patients with ID  and/or malformations of the central nervous system. To identify potential  CNVs, the SNP fluorescence intensity was analyzed with QuantiSNP using an Objective Bayes Hidden Markov model for calling putative CNVs. Preliminary results revealed probably causative deletions in five patients  encompassing chromosomal regions: 6q14.3 q16.3 (16.5 Mb; 51 RefSeq genes), 13q31.2qter (28.5 Mb; 85 RefSeq genes), 17q12 q21.2 (2.1 Mb; 81  RefSeq genes), and two regions on chromosome 22q11.2 (2.54 Mb; 43 Ref  Seq genes and 2.52 Mb; 43 RefSeq genes, respectively). In one patient we identified a 7.9 Mb duplication on chromosome 3q26.32 q27.2 harboring 56 RefSeq genes. All findings were confirmed by quantitative PCR. These observations support the previously described association of microdeleti on 22q11.2 and the occurrence of ARM and/or ID suggesting this region to harbor genes, which contribute to both phenotypic features. Studying larger cohorts is likely to detect additional CNVs that might give further informati on on chromosomal regions and genes involved in the etiology of ARM and/or ID.",2012

We report genotypic and phenotypic data from a series of 9 patients born as collodion babies, who developed BSI or SICI due to mutations in the transglutaminase 1 gene (TGM1), including 3 previously unreported missense mutations. All our BSI or SICI patients car ried at least one specific missense mutation in TGM1 concerning an arginine at position 307 or 315. In two patients the disease evolved in two phases (BSI to SICI or BSI to ARCI). The other 7 patients exhibited a stable BSI phe notype after shedding of the collodion membrane. This study highlights the possibility of variable evolution of the phenotype of patients with identical mutations in the same gene. Combined with data from the literature, this confirms the hypothesis that only a restricted spectrum of TGM1 mutations is susceptible to lead to a BSI and/or SICI phenotype. This phenotypic varia bility also depends on other genetic and external factors.",2012

The prevalence of aberrations in the group with MCA was 25% whereas in the group with isolated CL/P it reached 21%.  All CNVs found (except 4 deletions exceeding 5Mb) were unique and did not  encompass any known microdeletion/microduplication syndrome regions. Novel candidate genes (T brachyury, SLFN12) were suggested in the group  with isolated CL/P , whereas in the MCA group one of the interesting findings  was del2q35 (STK36 gene). Our results demonstrate that high resolution array CGH is a powerful diagnostic tool in newborns with MCA and isolated  CL/P . It can also help in recognition of genes involved in pathogenesis of  congenital anomalies.The research is funded by the grant of the Polish Ministry of Science and Higher Education NN407459438.",2012

The phenotype varies from a mild form to a severe form of fetal anemia resulting in hydrops fetalis. DBA is associated with an increased risk of hematological malignancy and solid tumors including osteogenic sarcoma. Other genetic forms of anemia, such as Fanconi anemia, need to be considered and ruled out as appropriate. The mutations of nine genes encoding ribosomal proteins have been recognized to be responsible for DBA. Most of the mutations are detected by sequence analysis except for the RPS19. We present a patient with mild intellectual disability, chronic normochromic anemia, mild neutropenia, normal plate lets, and multiple congenital malformations including characteristic facial appearance, finger like thumbs, atrial septal defect, growth retardation, and vaginal atresia. The detection of chromosomal aberrations in cells after culture with a DNA interstrand cross linking agent (MMC) failed to deter   mine the diagnosis as Fanconi anemia. Bone marrow examination revealed hypoplastic, but showed normal balanced hematopoiesis. Microarray CGH analysis revealed 7.9 Mb deletion at 1p22.1 p22.3, involving ribosomal pro tein L5 (RPL5), and transcriptional repressor protein GFI1. RPL5 is respon   sible for Diamond Blackfan anemia, and GFI1 is responsible for autosomal dominant severe congenital neutropenia, where both genes are adjacent to each other. These results indicated that the 1p22 microdeletion represents a novel contiguous gene syndrome associated Diamond Blackfan anemia, but overlapping with clinical features of Fanconi anemia.",2012

Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) has pro vides a relatively quick method to scan the genome for gains and loses of chromosomal material. This new methodologies have led to identification of novel genomic disorder in patients with developmental delay/mental retardation and/or multiple congenital anomalies (DD/MR/MCA), with a significant increase in diagnostic yield .In this study we present the result of array CGH obtained in 150 children with normal karyotype but DD/MR/MCA. The array CGH 60K from agilent platform was performed.In 34 patients (22,66%) was detected a chromosomal deletion or duplicati   on previously described like pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs),. In 15 cases (10%) was necessary the analysis of parental samples, showing that 6 anomalies (40%) had occurred de novo and was classified as pathogenic and in 9 cases (60%) appeared to be inherited from an unaffected parent. In a total of 40 patients (26,66%) was possible to detect a pathogenic CNVs .Recent studies suggest that when aCGH is performed with an apparently normal karyotype, the diagnostic yield increases by an additional 8 17%. In our study we have obtained a 26,66% of children with pathogenic CNVs that is higher than the results obtained by other authors. This increase at the detection rate probably is due to the array type utilized.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201257 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters As a conclusion, array CGH can be implemented routinely after a normal  chromosome result when a phenotype of DD/MR/MCA is present, but is  also appropriate for patients with autism and apparently balanced trans  locations.",2012

Human body asymmetry is a diagnosis with a large spectrum of features, with a multifactorial aetiology: physiological, osseal, neurological, genetic.  There are many aspects to discuss involved in asymmetry: situs anomalies,  asymetric cell division, laterality, asymetric embriopathy, hemiasymetries, asymetric vascular syndromes, somatic mosaicism. Asymmetric entities are classified in non syndromic and syndromic, conge  nital or acquired, total or limited. Left right asymmetry has important impli cations for human health and development.We report our clinical experience of some rare entities with body asymme  try: 1) an infant with Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (MIM: 130650) 2) a newborn with probably Proteus syndrome (MIM: 176920) 3) three cases with Klippel Trenaunay Weber syndrome (MIM: 149000) 4) a girl with short stature, left right asymmetry and radiologic signs of  skeletal dysplasia, with clinical diagnosis of Conradi HÃ¼nermann syndrome  (MIM: 302960)5) a six years old female patient with diploid tetraploid mixoploidy   (92,XXXX/46,XX), demostrated by cytogenetic studies in blood cultures, with asymmetric overgrowth, abnormal skin pigmentation, mental retarda tion, the first child of a family with primary subfertility. Different mechanisms involved in the development of asymmetry in these  disorders are discussed: mutations of imprinted genes, mosaicism for a  somatic activating mutation, pathogenic gene for vascular and tissue over   growth, random X inactivation in affected tissues in heterozygous female,  mosaicism versus chimerism. The diagnostic were given according to the associated clinical features. Cli  nical delineation of the cases with congenital growth asymmetry remains  essential until pathophysiological mechanisms are elucidated. Other labora  tory tests like chromosomal analysis, biochemical studies, molecular assay, applied on different tissues, help in the differential diagnosis.",2012

It is a cardiac repolarization abnormality that  is characterized by prolonged OT interval and propensity for ventricular ta   chycardia (VT) of the torsades de pointes type are the charecteristics of the  disease. This syndrome represent high risk of presyncope, syncope, cardiac  arrest and sudden death. Jervell and Lange Nielson syndrome (JLNS) is one  of the inherited form of long QT syndromes. It is inherited recessively and characterized by profound sensorineural deafness and prolongation of the OT interval, thus representing abnormal ventricular repolarizasiton. JLNS  has been shown to occur due to homozygous and copmpound heterozygous  mutations in KCNQ1 or KCNE1. There was one clinical report on JLNS in  Turkey; however, it was not confirmed by a molecular study. We identified a homozygous mutation in KCNQ1 in a 3.5 yr old female child with JLNS, who visited the hospital due to recurrent syncope and seizures and had con  genital sensorineural deafness. Her electrocardiogram revealed a markedly  prolonged QT interval. The sequence analysis of the proband revealed the  presence of homozygous missence mutation (c.728G>A, p.R243H).

Krajewska Walasek","Department of Medical Genetics, The Childrenâs Memorial Health Institute, Warsaw, Poland","Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is characterized by overgrowth, macroglossia, abdominal wall defects and a high risk of childhood tumors. BWS is caused by various 11p15 genetic or epigenetic defects leading to defective expression of imprinted genes. The genes in 11p15 region are or   ganized into two imprinted domains controlled by two Imprinting Centers: IC1 (H19DMR) and IC2 (KvDMR). The most common defect in BWS (~50%)  is loss of methylation at IC2. Paternal UPD of 11p15, gain of methylation at  IC1, mutations in CDKN1C gene encoded on 11p15 and chromosomal re  arrangements also result in the BWS phenotype. Some specific phenotype  (epi)genotype correlations are observed in BWS. However, there is a mar  ked phenotypic variability within molecular subgroups.We present fourteen Polish patients with BWS and IC2 hypomethylation. A  molecular analysis was performed by methylation sensitive multiplex liga  tion dependent probe amplification (MS MLPA) in a group of thirty five un  related BWS patients. The analysis demonstrated loss of methylation at IC2  in 40% of investigated patients. All the patients presented clinical features  typical for BWS, although in various degree. The study underlines correlati   on between IC2 hypomethylation and the presence of BWS features such as:  macroglossia (14/14 cases), characteristic face (14/14 cases), abdominal  wall defects (12/14 cases) and anterior ear lobe creases and/or posterior  helical pits (12/14 cases). An interesting finding is a relatively high preva  lence of cryptorchidism (5/9 male patients). The further investigations of  the genetic background of BWS in Polish population are under way.

Bloch Sulzberger syndrome (BSS) or Incontinentia pigmenti (MIM 308300)  is an X linked dominant syndrome with cutaneous, neurologic, ophthalmo logic, and dental manifestations. It is caused by mutations in the IKK gam ma gene (IKBKG; MIM 300248, Xq28). A.Garrod reported the first probable  case of incontinentia pigmenti in 1906. Subsequently, Bloch and Sulzberger  further defined the condition in 1926 and 1928, respectively, as a clinical syndrome with unique features of typical cutaneous manifestations. IKK   gamma is the regulatory subunit of the inhibitor kappa kinase (IKK) com  plex and is required for the activation of the transcription factor NF kappaB (NF kB). NF kB is central to many immune, inflammatory, and apoptotic pa thways. The incidence of BSS is believed to be 1 case per 40,000. Here we re  ported on 5 female patients with BSS aged from 4 to 20 yr. Proband mothers  (3/5) had multiple male miscarriages. All patients had hypopigmented, atrophic patches, conical forms of their teeth and some ophthalmologic fin  dings. Two patients had strabismus and nystagmus due to congenital ectopy  of the macula and optic nerve atrophy. Their visual acuity was insufficient and rehabilitation process was difficult without positive prognosis. Three  patients had vitreoretinal abnormality as congenital hyperplastic persistent  vitreous body complicated with traction retinal detachment. These pro bands have been observed formerly as the patients suffered from retrolental fibroplasias.

Bohring Opitz symdrome (BOS) is a rare condition comprising distinct facial features including bulging forehead over the metopic suture, frontal nevus flammeus, exophthalmos, retinal abnormalities, hypertelorism, upslanting palpebral fissures, and cleft lip and/or palate, intrauterine growth retarda tion, severe failure to thrive, flexion deformities of the upper limbs, lower limb deformities, severe developmental delay, and death often early in child hood. Recently, ASXL1 nonsense mutations were identified in 7/13 suspec   ted BOS cases as the cause of the syndrome [Hoischen et al., 2011]. Here we report on 10, clinically undoubtful cases with BOS. All of them fulfilled the diagnostic criteria proposed by Bohring et al. [2006] and all carry a private, previously undescribed heterozygous nonsense/frameshift ASXL1 mutati   on. As far as parental DNA was available for analysis, the mutations were shown to be de novo. Thus, our data further support ASXL1 as the main cau se of BOS and confirm exon 13 (NM_015338) as mutational hotspot in this syndrome. In addition, our data show that in clinically well characterized cases the detected mutation rate may be 100%. Further carefully performed genotype phenotype studies are necessary to specify the most appropriate key symptoms and to differentiate between BOS and other phenotypically overlapping syndromes or to prove genetic heterogeneity.",2012

Craniosynostosis, caused by early fusion of cranial sutures, can  include premature fusion of the saggital (scaphocephaly) or metopic suture  (trigonocephaly). Though often occurring as isolated findings, their co exi  stence in a craniosynostosis syndrome is infrequent and mostly sporadic.Case description. The male proband presented with premature fusion of the  saggital and metopic suture. Imaging revealed also coronal synostosis and  multiple endocranial hypoplastic areas. Radiographs demonstrated bilate ral agenesis of the middle phalanges in the feet. Family history revealed the father, his sister and half sister, to have scaphocephaly with 3 4 syndactyly. The paternal grandfather did not have a phenotype, though the great grand father had bilateral 3 4 syndactyly. Molecular analysis revealed a mutation (p.P148L) in the MSX2 gene, which has been associated with the Boston type of craniosynostosis in a single family (Warmer et al., 1993). Segregation analysis confirmed non penetrance in the grandfather.Conclusion. In this four generation family with various expression of sca phocephaly and severe trigonocephaly, molecular analysis revealed a mis sense mutation in MSX2, previously described in the Boston craniosynosto sis family. Besides unique features such as incomplete penetrance, limb abnormalities and the cranial sutures involved, our patients share with the original family autosomal dominant inheritance with anticipation and the endocranial hypoplastic areas. Though these findings are diagnostic clues for MSX2 related craniosynostosis, the initial patients in this family pre sented with isolated scaphocephaly and syndactyly. MSX2 analysis should therefore be considered in patients with scaphocephaly, especially if a posi   tive family history for craniosynostosis or syndactyly is present.",2012

We suspected cat eye syndrome (CES) which was con  firmed by subsequent ophthalmologic evaluation describing coloboma of iris, choroid and retina. Accordingly, cytogenetic analysis identified an extra  bisatellited marker chromosome in all metaphases of a lymphocyte culture  (47,XX,+idic(22) (pter q11::q11âpter)). The finding was confirmed by FISH  and MLPA analyses. Further clinical studies revealed an open foramen ovale and a ductus arteriosus as well as biliary atresia. Jung Min Ko et al. (2010) reported a patient with the same partial tetrasomy of chromosome 22q11.1,  but with milder clinical features. CES is a complex malformation syndrome with a significant clinical varia  bility ranging from severely affected children to phenotypically unaffected parents carrying the same cytogenetic abnormality. Accordingly, only 40% of the CES patients present the classical triad of symptoms iris coloboma,  anal anomalies, and praeauricular pits or tags. In addition, CES may be as  sociated with cardiac defects, hepatic, renal and skeletal abnormalities and  mental retardation.The cause of this clinical variability remains to be determined. The classical CES is present in most cases and characterized by supernumerary bisatel  lited and isodicentric marker chromosome containing duplicated material  of chromosome 22. The phenotype does not correlate with the size of the  marker chromosome. It may be speculated whether mosaic conditions, the genetic background and/or epigenetic factors affect the phenotypic presen   tation.

The increasing resolution of DNA microarrays and the techni   ques optimization allow detection of larger (> Mb) aberrations and a large  number of small CNVs, whose clinical significance in some cases is unknown. The interpretation of CNVs with unknown clinical significance remains still a challenge.Materials and methods. Oligo array CGH was applied in 52 patients with de   velopmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies in order to unravel the underlying genetic abnormalities. We have used BlueGnome CytoChip oligo 2X105K microarray, v1.1, with 35kbp backbone resolution.Results. A total of 247 CNVs were detected, of which 15 pathogenic (7 dele tions, duplications 8), 124 normal (62 deletions, 62 duplications) and 108 with unknown clinical significance (68 deletions, 40 duplications).Discussion. Due to insufficient data for the Bulgarian population we made an individual assessment of each variant. In our study 19 variations in chromosomal loci 2q37.3, 10q11.22, Xp22 were found in over 5% patients, which gave us a reason to suppose that they were probably not pathogenic. Twenty five of the variations occurring in patients with established large   Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org64ESHG Posters www.eshg.orgpathological aberrations associated with specific phenotype. Therefore, we  have assumed that probably they have no pathogenic nature. Thirty five of  the other variants do not contain OMIM genes. Conclusion. So from total 108 unknown CNVs as potentially pathogenic re main to be seen only 29 variations. Of these, only one aberration in Xq22.1  can be directly related to patientâs clinical phenotype. This gave us a reason  to accept this deletion as potentially pathogenic.Acknowledgements: Grant 02/76 21.12.2009, National Science Fund, Bul   garia.",2012

In the dawn of novel sequencing strategies we report on our 14 year experience in traditional Sanger based mutation screening of a large cohort of 680 independent patients with suspected CMS. In addition to most known CMS causing genes, we analyzed the functional candidate genes LRP4, VACHT , and CNTN1.

Pain can be topographically classified in articular limb (acute/subacute and chronic), muscular limb (myofascial and fibromyalgia), neuropathic limb, back/neck, abdominal and pelvic pain, and headache. For selected forms of pain, specific predisposing characteristics are outlined. Fatigue appears as the result of multiple factors, such as muscle weakness, respiratory insufficiency, unrefreshing sleep, dysautonomia, intestinal mal   absorption, reactive depression/anxiety and excessive use of analgesics.

Mutations in NIPBL gene  etiologically account for 60% of CdLS patients. This gene encodes a key re  gulator of the Cohesin complex, which controls sister chromatid segregati  on. TS affects about one in 2000 live born females and results from complete  or partial absence of one of the X chromosomes, frequently accompanied by cell line mosaicism.Here, we report a patient with CdLS due to a mutation in the NIPBL gene  (c.1445_1448delGAGA) and mosaic TS (mos 45,X/46,XX karyotype). This patient showed the classical and predominant phenotype of CdLS, although without limb reduction. She was also clinically diagnosed with TS because of  two typical recognizable features: the peripheral lymphedema and the web  bed neck. Molecular characterization showed that the NIPBL mutation was  present in all the tissues analyzed from different embryonic origins (meso   derm and ectoderm); while FISH analyses revealed that the percentage of cells with monosomy X was low and tissue specific.These findings indicate that, ontogenically, the NIPBL mutation appeared  before the mosaic monosomy X. Moreover, the recent identification of fra  meshift NIPBL  mutations in colon cancer cells associated with chromosome  aneuploidy suggests that it could affect faithful chromosome segregation. The coexistence in several patients of both these rare disorders raises the issue of whether there is indeed a cause effect association.

Craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS) is a rare X linked dominant disorder characterized by a more severe manifestation in heterozygous females  than in hemizygous males. Typical manifestations involve hypertelorism  with telecanthus, widowâs peak, frontal bossing, craniosynostosis, a bifid or broad nasal tip, wiry hair, and grooved fingernails. Besides, anterior  cranium bifidum, axillary pterygia, joint abnormalities, cleft lip and palate,  unilateral breast hypoplasia, diaphragmatic hernia, asymmetric lower limb shortness, and agenesis of the corpus callosum are within the rare manife stations of CFNS. Most CNFS patients have mutations in the EFNB1  located  at chromosome Xq13.1. This gene encodes a member of the ephrin family protein, Ephrin B1, which interacts with Eph tyrosine kinase receptors. It functions in the formation of tissue boundaries. Here, we report a 7 month old female patient who has brachycephaly, frontal bossing, hypertelorism, telecanthus, downslanting palpebral fissures, broad nasal root and bifid nasal tip. She also had large anterior fontanelle and broad right hallux. To confirm CFNS diagnosis, EFNB1 was sequenced and a novel de novo c.402  T>C heterozygous mutation in exon 2 was detected.

Three types of Usher syndrome are known and differ by the time of onset of the symptoms, severity and progressiveness of deafness and addi   tional vestibular dysfunction. Several genes are known to be associated with the disease. Patients with type II Usher syndrome have congenital bilateral sensorineural hearing loss that is mild to moderate in the low frequencies and severe to profound in the higher frequencies, intact vestibular respon   ses, and bilateral retinitis pigmentosa (RP).We describe a 30 years old female whose parents are first cousins of Mo roccan origin. She has congenital deafness and has been referred by her ophthalmologist because of recently diagnosed RP . A clinical diagnosis of Usher syndrome type II has been suggested. However a molecular workup including testing of the three genes known to cause the disease ( USH2A,  GPR98 and DFNB31)  were all negative. A founder mutation (c.1355_6delCA, p.Thr452SerfsX3) in the RP gene FA  M161A  has been later described in Moroccan Jews. Our patient was found to  be homozygous to the founder mutation and her parents were heterozygous to this mutation. Information was given to the family during genetic coun seling explaining that Usher syndrome was ruled out and a plausible expla   nation would be that she is expressing two independent diseases. Recently she was tested for mutation in the TMC1 gene associated with autosomal recessive deafness and was found homozygous for the c.1939T > C delete rious mutation.",2012

However, unanticipated findings may be a major challenge. We present the case of a boy with developmental delay and multiple physical  anomalies in whom array analysis revealed a concomitant diagnosis of a tu   mor disposition syndrome. Case Report: A boy of 4 years of age was evaluated for short stature, psy   chomotor retardation, hypotonia and physical anomalies (e.g. hypospadias,  pectus excavatum). Physical examination also showed facial dysmorphism  (flat face, down slanting palpebral fissures), inverted nipples and hypere mia of fingertips and toes. Array analysis (AffymetrixÂ® CytoScan HD) sho   wed a de novo 9.5 Mb interstitial deletion on chromosome 3p22.1 p24.1 not  detectable by G banding analysis. The deletion was confirmed by FISH ana   lysis with probes specific for 3p22.3. The deleted region comprised about 60  refseq genes among which MLH1 (confirmed by MLPA). Discussion: Overlapping interstitial deletions of 3p22 p24 so far have been  rarely reported and most often predate molecular karyotyping. They are  associated with global developmental delay, CHD, short stature and mild dysmorphic features. In the present case, based on haploinsufficiency of the mismatch repair gene MLH1, a diagnosis of Lynch syndrome (HNPCC)  was also established and surveillance guidelines were discussed with the parents.Conclusion: This case illustrates that any chromosomal imbalance has to  be evaluated carefully for alterations potentially affecting cellular key pa thways as deletions of tumor suppressor genes with implications for health management.",2012

A chromosomal analysis was performed and showed a normal female karyo type. In the further course of her development, the girl showed profound psychomotor retardation, speech delay, mental retardation, recurring infec tions and early behavioural problems. On the occasion of the second presen   tation at the age of 2 Â½ years to the genetic counsellor the first array CGH was performed using a low resolution BAC array (resolution 0,44 Mb). The result was interpreted as normal. Because of the persisting impression of a syndromal clinical picture the parents continued presenting her daughter to the genetic counsellor. An Angelman Syndrome as well as a Rett Syndrome were excluded.

DBA is genetically heterogeneous. Causal variants have been identified in nine ribosomal genes, and diagnostic tests are clinical available for only a limited number of them.We present a 6 year old boy with classical DBA. He was diagnosed in early childhood with severe anemia, is currently transfusion dependent and on steroid treatment. He has short stature and dysmorphic facial features. His paternal grandfather had DBA and died of liver sarcoma, 26 years old, after androgen treatment. The boyâs father is asymptomatic.Exome sequencing (Agilent 38Mb exome capture and 2x100bp Illumina se   quencing) detected a novel heterozygous deletion in RPS26  (c.6_9del). The  deletion leads to a framshift, and will most likely cause a premature stop codon and induce nonsense mediated decay. Sanger sequencing showed that the variant was paternally inherited. Variants in RPS26  are estimated  to cause 2.6% of the DBA cases (DBA10; OMIM #613309). A molecular dia  gnosis should enable prenatal diagnostic testing, however predicting the diagnostic outcome of an affected fetus is challenging in this family.This case illustrates the force of targeted exome sequencing to efficiently identify novel variants in a large set of candidate genes, and demonstrates its clinical utility to identify causal variants in rare dominant disorders.",2012

Even though familial cases of BWS and SRS are rare, the identification of heritable factors affecting genomic imprinting in these disorders is crucial to estimate the recurrence risk in affected fa milies. For illustration of the (epi)genetic complexity, we present several familial  and sporadic SRS and BWS cases with rare disturbances in 11p15.5. Fur thermore, we refer to Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) as a suitable te  sting approach for future detection of genes involved in the regulation of  genomic imprinting and further epigenetically regulated regions involved in BWS and SRS.",2012
 A new case of genome wide paternal uniparental disomy emphasizing the need of multilocus testing in imprinting disorders,P02.092,"M. Begemann1, S. Spengler1, M. Gogiel1, L. Soellner1, U.

Chromosomes associated with IDs are 6, 7, 11, 14, 15 (Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus, Silver Russell syndro  me, Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome, upd(14) syndromes, Prader Willi  syndrome, Angelman Syndrome). The clinical outcome of a UPD depends on the transmitting parent. Whereas maternal and/or paternal UPD of the aforementioned chromosomes have clinical consequences, others are not  associated with clinical phenotypes (if not carrying a recessive mutation).  Therefore it can be argued that UPDs of other chromosomes are underdia gnosed and are detected only by chance. We here present a 19 year old wo man carrying a mosaic genome wide paternal UPD that was coincidentally  identified in a multi locus screening for aberrant methylation. The patient  was initially diagnosed as BWS due to a mosaic upd(11p15)pat but presen   ted additional clinical findings including nesidioblastosis, fibroadenomas,  hamatomar of the liver, hypoglycemia and ovarian steroid cell tumour. So far, only single cases with similar clinical and molecular findings mainly dia  gnosed in early childhood have been reported. Based on these data it can  be concluded that the mosaic genome wide paternal UPD (also known as  androgenic/biparental mosaicism) in our patient explains the unusual BWS phenotype. These findings emphasize the need for multilocus testing in imprinting disorders to efficiently detect cases with disturbances affecting  more than one chromosome.",2012

CDKL5, TCF4, SLC9A6, ARX and FOXG1 are important genes belonging to this group. The conditions caused by mutations in these genes are especially relevant differential dia gnoses to Rett and Angelman syndromes. The incidence of these conditions is unknown. In addition, there is only insufficient data available concerning the phenotypic variability, caused by haploinsufficiency of these genes.In a cohort of 70 patients with seizures or EEG abnormalities and ID, we sequenced the genes CDKL5, TCF4, SLC9A6, ARX and FOXG1. Further we performed MLPA analysis for CDKL5, TCF4, ARX and FOXG1. We found he terozygous pathogenic alterations in eight patients (11,4 %). Four patients showed alterations in FOXG1 (one frameshift, two missense mutations and one deletion) and two in CDKL5 (one splicesite mutation and one deletion). Two patients had the same recurrent missense mutation in the TCF4 gene. We present detailed clinical and molecular data of our patients. We compare the results to the literature and discuss on novel insights into the pheno types of patients with FOXG1, TCF4 and CDKL5 mutations.Our study contributes to the delineation of the phenotypes of these rare conditions. Further investigations with new molecular techniques such as next generation sequencing will identify much more patients.

 Whole exome sequencing to identify genes involved in epileptic encephalopathy,P02.095,"C. G. F. de Kovel, E. Brilstra, R. van ât Slot, S. van Lieshout, B. P . C. Koeleman","UMC Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands","Epileptic encephalopathy is a severe condition occurring often at a very young age. Patients suffer from epileptic seizures, and, presumably as a con sequence, show developmental retardation.When no external cause is prevalent, the condition is assumed to be genetic. In some families, multiple sibs are affected. A few genetic causes for epilep tic encephalopathy are known, but many cases cannot be explained. Probab   ly, there is high genetic heterogeneity.In order to identify more genetic causes for this disorder, we have collected patients with healthy parents. Five families had multiple affected sibs, whe reas ten patients had no affected relatives. We performed exon sequencing to look for genetic causes, assuming a recessive model, either homozygous or compound heterozygous in the multiplex families, while in the sporadic cases a de novo mutation is an additional possibility.So far, we have identified X linked mutations in CDK16 and GABRE as pos sible candidates in male patients. Further analysis of the remaining families may identify more candidate mutations. To confirm their pathogenicity, we will combine our results with those of other research groups.",2012
 Establishment of Diagnostic Decision Support System (DDSS) in Clinical Diagnosis of Genetic Diseases: The FaceGP DDSS Methodology and Its Applications,P02.096,"K. Kuru1, Y. Tunca1, M. Niranjan2","1Gulhane Military Medical Academy (GATA), Ankara, Turkey, 2University of Southampton,  Southampton, United Kingdom","A face develops under the influence of many genes. Thus, facial appearance can be a significant clue in the initial identification of genetic anomalies asso   ciated with especially cognitive impairments. It may be possible to diagnose a good number of syndromes correctly by using computer assisted face ana   lysis. For dysmorphic syndromes  with   known genetic causes, cyto  and/or molecular genetic analysis is the appropriate route of investigation in order to confirm a diagnosis. In this study, in terms of helping non experienced practitioners in diagnosing process as well as supporting experts in their decisions, we established a methodology to ease the process and we refer to our method as FaceGP DDSS. In the methodology, digital facial image pro cessing methods are used to reveal facial features with disorders indicating genotype phenotype interrelation. A great number of genetic disorders indi   cating a characteristic pattern of facial anomalies can be typically identified by analyzing specific features with the aid of facial image processing me thods such as PCA in order to determine reference values (eigenfaces) and train the system. Distance algorithms such as Euclidean, Mahalanobis are used to construct the correlation of the input image with the trained images in matching. Some image enhancement methods such as histogram equali zation and median filter are implemented on detected degraded images to capture better features. This study proposes a novel computer assisted and cost effective method by merging several methods in the characterization of the facial dysmorphology, in particular a method relying primary on face image capture and manipulation to diagnose genetic diseases.",2012

FMF, as ethnic disorder for Me diterranean sea ancestors region, is widespread in Armenians. Chest pain attacks are 2 nd manifestation after febrile abdominal attacks.Objective; to investigate clinical and genetic characteristics of the chest manifestations (pleuritis and pericarditis) in children with FMF. Results: We performed clinical and genetic (MEFV gene mutations) investigations in 715 children (438 boys, 277 girls, mean age 8,64Â±0,17). Chest pain attacks (pleuritic or/and pericardial in origin), mainly unilateral, short lasting, with dyspnea, su perficial, painful inspiration, often developed recurrent pleurisy (81.7%), pericarditis (13.8%). Pleurisy as 1st manifestation was observed in 23.1% of patients. In 1% of cases lung atelectasis and asthma attacks were obser   ved. We detected the most frequent mutations of MEFV gene. Frequency of V726A mutation in Armenians is higher (22.3%) than in other populations with high level of FMF: Jews (3.0%), Turks (2.9%). Risk of leurisy in contrast to other serosities was associated mainly with V726A/M694V compound heterozygous genotype (81,6%) and was 2.3 time higher than in M694V homozygotes (71.9%) and M694V heterozygotes (68,9%) with benign cli nical course. Recurrent pericarditis was revealed in 13.8% and associated with M694V homozygotes in compare to patients without M694V mutation. Conclusions: Taking into consideration our data about more frequent asso   ciation of V726A mutation with pleurisy, we suppose that the prevalence of V726A compound heterozygous genotype might be considered as a risk factor for development of the pleurisies. Pericarditis as rare FMF manifesta tion, was associated with M694V mutation and considered as unfavorable FMF prognosis.",2012

Results: we here present the neurological findings, selected MR images and  results of FLNA mutation analysis for three new male patients. Patient A at the age of 4 years presented with a severe global developmental delay,  dolichomicrocephaly, muscular hypotonia, complex cerebral malformations  including polymicrogyria and PVNH in MR imaging and was hemizygous for a FLNA missense mutation inherited from his mother.

Fetal DNA was extracted from cultured amnio cytes and submitted to Southern blotting and (CGG)n PCR analysis. While  the father is mosaic for a methylated full mutation in lymphocytes (around  20% of the cells are not methylated), his wife has two normal alleles. The female fetus harbored a normal allele and a 105 CGG repeats premutation.  She was therefore predicted to be unaffected with Fragile X syndrome and  the pregnancy was pursued.

Survival of affected subjects seems to be up to 25% by 1 year of age and up to 15% at 1 10 years. CASE PRESENTATION: A girl with Fraser syndrome was followed from birth to the time of death (at 9 years of age). Parents were young, healthy, unrela   ted but originating in the same relatively isolated village. The patient had a healthy brother (4 years older), and a brother with Dandy Walker mal   formation (2 years younger). On examination she presented major criteria for Fraser syndrome: bilateral criptophtalmos, syndactyly   both hands and both feet, clitoromegaly, associated with multiple other anomalies. Brain imaging (ultrasound, CT , MRI) revealed no abnormalities. She had clinical progression of multi sensory impairment, along with learning difficulties and physical disabilities. No cytogenetic anomalies were found and there were no molecular studies conducted. DISCUSSION: Fraser syndrome has a very low frequency. The syndrome can be caused by mutations in two ge nes, FRAS1 (4q21) and FREM2 (13q13.3). This case posed multiple medical problems determined by multi sensory involvement and physical and men tal retardation. A speculative element of the case presented consists of the familial association of a brother with Dandy Walker malformation; Fraser syndrome is associated in 20% of cases with Dandy Walked malformation. CONCLUSION: The case presented could contribute to a better understan ding of this rare syndrome, given phenotypical characteristics and survival up to 9 years of age.",2012

Frontonasal dysplasia is due to disturbance in the development of fronto nasal, medial nasal and maxillary prominences, structures derived from the neural cresta. It is a clinically and genetically heterogeneous disease that presents large hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge, bifid hidden skull, nose bifid and cleft lip/palate. By far, most cases show an autosomal recessive pattern. In the present study, we describe a family in three generations with 15 affected members with frontonasal dysplasia and alopecia. The proband was a woman of 22 year old with high forehead, mild alopecia, hypertelo rism, broad nasal bridge, nose bifid, hypoplastic midface, sparse eyebrows.  She underwent reconstructive surgery of the nose at 19 years. The rest of  the family members harbour similar clinical characteristics. There are few reports of frontonasal dysplasia with dominant autosomal inheritance, prac  tically all of them have an autosomal recessive pattern. In the present family  we confirm the automosal dominant inheritance in frontonasal dysplasia, linkage analysis is necessary to identify the gene responsible of the disease.",2012

The infant was the first child of unrelated caucasian  parents. FX levels were markedly reduced (<1%). Both parents had border   line low FX levels. The FX gene of the patient and her parents were examined  by direct sequencing. The analysis revealed a homozygous 4 bp deletion in exon 2 of the girl. This deletion leads to a frameshift and subsequently to a  premature stop codon. The father is a heterozygous carrier of this patho genic mutation, whereas the motherâs sequence for exon 2 was wild type, raising the possibility of a large deletion involving the FX gene on one ma  ternal allele, which she could have passed on to the child. Subsequent SNP analysis showed that the patient was homozygous for a variant in intron 2 of the FX gene, whereas the father was heterozygous and the mother carried  the homozygous wild type allele at this position. As MLPA analysis of the FX gene is currently unavailable and deletions involving both FVII  and FX genes  have been reported, MLPA analysis was performed for the FVII  gene, which  is located in close proximity to the FX gene.

Previous randomized controlled trials revealed that the majority of children and adolescents with mild and mo derate forms of disease have low areal bone mineral density (BMD) at the lumbar spine and that cyclical treatment with biphosphonates has benefi cial effects.Methods: In a two years longitudinal study, we prospectively followed up 35 pediatric patients recruited from a Romanian primary care setting between November 2009 and November 2011. Inclusion criteria: positive family hi story   presence of at least one fracture or dentinogenesis imperfecta, child ren > 10 yr of age. Patients were randomized to either risedronate (N,18) or alendronate (N, 17) and study visits occurred every 3 month.Results: The main efficacy variable was the change in lumbar spine (L 1  L4)  areal BMD Z score; risedronate increased it by 0.76, whereas patients recei   ving alendronate therapy experienced an increase of 0.45 (p >0.05).

Congenital deafness is one of the most frequent sensory disorders which  accounts for about 1 in 1000 newborns, and approximately half of all cases  have a genetic etiology. 15 20 cases of congenital/early onset hearing im  pairment (HI) in 14000   15000 live births (~1:900 1:750 newborns) are detected per year in the Sakha Republic (Yakutia) located in Eastern Siberia  (Russian Federation). In recent study we registered a large cohort of Yakut  patients homozygous for the IVS1+1G>A mutation (70 unrelated deaf sub jects in total) [Barashkov et al., 2011].We collected audiometric data on 40 patients with genotype IVS1+1G>A /  IVS1+1G>A. Audiograms from available medical documents were analyzed  retrospectively for each ear separately. All 40 patients (80 ears) underwent otoscopic examination, tympanometry, and audiometric testing. Analysis of  the audiological characteristics obtained from 40 subjects with genotype  IVS1+1G>A / IVS1+1G>A revealed significant association of this genotype  with severe to profound HI (85% of severe to profound versus 15% of mild to moderate, p<0.05) with mostly symmetrical bilateral hearing loss (29 out of 40 examined patients, p<0.05).

Atypical absence seizures and dystonic posturing were seen since 2 years of age, and astatic episodes after a long walk has seen since 10 years of age. Hypoglycorrhachia and decreased erythrocyte glucose uptake were obser   ved. She was diagnosed with Glut1 DS and started on the ketogenic diet. Patient 2: A 17 year old girl, born to healthy non consanguineous parents. Since 4 years of age, she showed myoclonus, ataxia, and loss of conscious   ness with drooling. Such events were mostly seen in the late afternoon, and recovered with eating. Hypoglycorrhachia was observed while erythrocyte glucose uptake was normal. She has not started ketogenic diet yet, and her developmental status is severely retarded. Both patients had the same mu tation in SLC2A1 (R330X).

MRI described an ischemic vascular lesion of the left ce rebellar hemisphere with edema, herniation phenomena through foramen magnum and supratentorial and amputation of the fourth ventricle. Ultraso nography of the heart and precerebral arteries revealed normal aspects The most significant laboratory finding was moderate hyperhomocysteinemia. Molecular analysis revealed the presence of a heterozygous MTHFR C677T mutation and the absence of A1298C mutation. After drug therapy, he was admitted in our clinic at about one month after the vascular accident, having only coordination problems. Rehabilitation treatment was complex and in volved coordination of several team members, with the following main ob jectives: coordination and balance in physical activities, through stimulation exercises specific for occupational therapy and kinetotherapy. He showed significant improvement after three weeks of intensive treatment. Prompt response to the rehabilitation programme in this case is another argument for early, individualized treatment, which continues at home, over a long pe riod of time.",2012

This region is responsible for the elastic distortion of the protein which allows strain to develop within the motor before the cargo is actually moved.Methods: Identification of mutations in the converter domain of MYH7 was performed in a cohort of more than 800 cases diagnosed either with Hyper   trophic (HCM) or Dilated Cardiomyopathy (HCM), followed up in a single reference unit. We also reviewed the published data about mutations loca ted within this domain.Results: 6 mutations (G716R, G741R, G768R, I730N [novel mutation], I736T  and R719Q) were identified in 11 families (59 relatives 30 carriers). Taking  in account our data and data from literature, a total of 21 pathogenic mu tations have been identified within this domain. They were distributed in 143 families (470 relatives). 424 relatives were affected or possibly affected  (11 with DCM and the rest with HCM) and 382 were mutation carriers. We  observed an early onset of disease (27Â±18 years, 56% males). Thirteen of 21 mutations were associated with a severe adverse event affecting at least one  member in 52/143 families: sudden death occurred in 96 patients and at  least 56% were younger than 45 years old, heart failure death in 35, cardiac transplantation in 18 and fatal stroke in 6.

In several countries, the incidence appears to be increasing, possibly due to increased repor   ting of minor degrees of hypospadias, but severe cases were also reported. Some reports have linked its high rate to prematurity and low birth weight. The etiology is still unknown in many cases, pedigree analyses indicating  a heterogeneous pattern of inheritance. A genetic predisposition has been  suggested. The aim of this study was to perform an epidemiological study focused on this type of pathology, in newborns from Timisoara, Romania, for a period of three years, between 2008 and 2010 and to highlight the etiological aspects of hypospadias. Methods: data selection, family history, clinical, laboratory, cytogenetic and molecular study. Major and minor con genital defects present in examined patients were recorded. The determined incidence was 0.36% of male newborns. Glanular and distal penile locations prevailed. At birth, mean values were 2982 g weight and 46 cm for height. Frequently associated anomalies were genital, skeletal, nervous system and different minor anomalies. A brotherhood with hypospadias was noted. 8.3% of mothers had previous miscarriages or malformed births. Cytoge netic investigation revealed trisomy 21 in one case.

This condition can be caused by a number of different pathological processes in the brain or defects to any structure in the motor unit. Cen   tral hypotonia affects the central nervous system, including the spine, and among its most frequent causes is systemic illness. As part of the central approach to the hypotonic baby, it is important to eliminate syndromic and genetic causes. Some reports have been proposed that 40% of the central hypotonic neonates had Prader Willi the most common genetic cause of obesity however, in children under 2 years of age the diagnosis is especially difficult. It is clear that early diagnosis of PWS o any other genetic entity is crucial to avoid complications and decrease morbidity and life expectancy. Nevertheless, other genetic syndromes have central hypotonia as main cli nical manifestation during infancy. So, genetic approach is mandatory du ring the initial clinical intervention. We present the genetic approach in 30 consecutive pediatric patients with central hypotonia as a major symptom, referred by the neuro pediatrician. According with the clinical genetic eva luation and presumptive clinical diagnosis, molecular analysis was perfor   med detecting that 70% of the cases had a genetic disorder.

Background   Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is the most common  genetic overgrowth disorder, with an incidence ranging 1:13,000 15,000  live births. However, as data on its epidemiology are scanty and estimates  show wide variability, there is a feeling that BWS could be more common than previously thought. Objective   We assessed its incidence in Piedmont,  Italy (4,432,571 population) locating BWS cases born in this region. Me  thods   Patient were searched through local genetic counselling services, BWS Italian Association, malformation registries and rare diseases network. Data from the Italian National Institute for Statistics was used for live births  assessment. BWS diagnosis was clinical according to Wecksbergâs criteria  and molecular testing was performed according to currently employed dia gnostic flow chart. Results   45 clear cut BWS cases (26 females, 19 males)  were born across a 13 year period (1996 2009), providing an incidence of 1:10,569 live birth. Fourty patients accepted molecular testing: 72.5% tur ned positive showing imprinting center 2 (IC2) hypomethylation (30.0%),  paternal chromosome 11p15 uniparental disomy (UPD, 25.0%), IC1 hy   permethylation (15.0%), CDKN1c mutation (2.5%), whereas 27.5% turned  negative. Mean age at diagnosis was 0.49Â±1.07 years, with 34 patients dia gnosed in the first semester of life, providing a birth prevalence of 1:13,989. Four patients of the cohort developed Wilmsâ tumor (8.9%) and 2 hepato blastoma (4.4%) during the observation period, resulting in a 14.2%cancer risk. Conclusion   We observed a BWS incidence of 1:10,569 live birth in  Piedmont.

VATER/VACTERL association refers to the non random co occurrence of the following component features: vertebral defects, anal atresia, cardiac mal   formations, tracheo esophageal fistula, renal abnormalities, and limb de   fects. Recent observations suggest that in some patients, the disorder may be inherited. The aim of the present study was to replicate these findings by investigating 116 VATER/VACTERL patients and their relatives. The preva lence of anal atresia (OR 41.7, 95% CI 15.5 112.2) and limb anomalies (OR 6.4, 95% CI 1.6 25.7) was significantly higher among first degree relatives compared to the general population. This confirms other observations of an increased prevalence of component features among relatives. The fact that the two studies report a higher prevalence for differing specific component features might be explained by the differing malformation spectra of the respective index patients.

Numerous genes associated with ID have been identified, and for several genes, mutations can result in both syndro mic and non syndromic ID. We describe a consanguineous family with three boys and one girl affected with a hitherto undescribed autosomal recessi   ve syndromic form of ID characterized by, in addition to ID, hypertelorism, broad nasal bridge with a broad and bifid nasal tip, and microcephaly ran ging from  4 SD to  2 SD.

Molecular karyotyping revealed a deletion of 102 111 kb in an individual  with intellectual disability. This finding was validated as a de novo event  by FISH. The aberration partially affects GLRB and GRIA2. Both genes are  highly expressed in brain tissues. GLRB encodes the beta subunit of the in hibitory glycine receptor. It has been associated with autosomal re cessive  hyperekplexia. No symptoms of this disorder were found in this case. GRIA2  encodes the GluR2 subunit of a glutamate receptor. Other subunits of glut   amate receptors have been associated with intellectual disability. Sequen cing did not detect any further mutation in ei ther of the two genes. Analyses  of reversely transcribed RNA from blood revealed the exist ence of GLRB/ GRIA2 fusion transcripts. We were not able to find a fragment that carried an open reading frame across the fusion site. Nonetheless, open reading fra  mes could be restored by different alternative splice events that might occur  in neuronal structures. We speculate that either haploinsufficiency of GRIA2 or a GLRB/GRIA2 fusion gene was causing the disorder.",2012

To establish an etiological basis in those patients represents a difficult challen   ge. Over the last years it has become apparent, that chromosomal rearran gements below the detection level of conventional karyotyping contribute significantly to the cause of ID.We present three patients with non specific intellectual disability who all have a microdeletion in the chromosomal region 12p12.1. In two pati   ents these deletions occurred de novo. All three identified deletions have different breakpoints and range in size from 120 kb to 4.9 Mb.

SOX5 is a member of the SOX (SRY  related HMG box) family of transcription factors shown to play roles in chondroblast function, oligodendrocyte diffe rentiation and migration as well as ensuring proper development of specific neuronal cell types. Because of these biological functions, mutations in SOX5  were predicted to cause complex disease syndromes, as is the case for seve ral SOX genes, but no such mutations have yet been identified.

Intellectual disability (ID), also referred to as cognitive impairment or mental retardation, is characterized by a substantial below average score on tests of mental ability or intelligence, and limitations in functions related to areas of daily life. Intellectual disability can range from mild to profound and can be associated with other clinical findings or can occur as an isolated trait, with an extensive genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. Taken together, syndro mic and non syndromic forms of intellectual disability affect 1 3% of the po pulation. More than a hundred genes have been associated so far to ID, and they mainly have roles in brain development, synaptic plasticity and function. The ubiquitin proteasome system plays a fundamental role in maintaining the correct balance of protein levels inside cells and any disruption to this system is likely to have severe consequences, as shown for Angelman Syndrome. Se veral types of ubiquitin ligase have been identified, the largest group being those proteins containing a âRINGâ motif. We analyzed two of these, RNF133 and RNF148, in a cohort of 36 ID patients selected from the CHERISH consor tium and negative at the array CGH analysis. A novel missense change was identified in one patient in RNF148 and was of maternal origin. The unaffec ted brother does not carry the variant. We therefore performed an expression analysis of the gene and could prove that the mother expresses only the wild type form in blood.

 Investigating KBG Syndrome: Partial deletion of ANKRD11 results in the KBG phenotype distinct from the 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome,P02.142,"M. Khalifa, J. Stein","Genetics Department, Akron Childrenâs Hospital, Akron, OH, United States","KBG syndrome (OMIM 148050) is a very rare genetic disorder characterized by macrodontia, distinctive craniofacial abnormalities, short stature, skel etal and neurologic involvement, and intellectual disability. Approximately 60 cases have been reported since it was first described in 1975. Recently mutations in ANKRD11  have been documented in patients with KBG syn  drome, and it has been proposed that haploinsufficiency of ANKRD11 is the  cause of this syndrome. In addition, copy number variation in the 16q24.3 region that includes ANKRD11 results in a variable phenotype that overlaps  with KBG syndrome that also includes autism spectrum disorders and other dysmorphic facial features. In this report we present a 2 Â½ year old African American male with features highly suggestive of KBG syndrome. Genomic microarray identified a 154 kb deletion within ANKRD11 . The deletion does  not involve other nearby genes. This childâs mother was mosaic for the same deletion (present in approximately 50% of cells) and exhibited a milder phenotype including macrodontia, short stature and brachydactyly. This family provides additional evidence that ANKRD11 causes KBG syndrome  and the phenotype seems to be dose dependent, differentiating it from the more variable 16q24.3 microdeletion syndrome. This family has additional features that could expand the phenotype of KBG syndrome.",2012

In most affected patients heteroplamic large scale mtDNA deletions can  be found. The percentage of mutated mtDNA varies between patients and from tissue to tissue within the same individual. A high proportion of mtD  NA deletions are found consistenly in the most affected tissues (e.g. central  nervous system, muscles), whereas very low or undetectable amounts are found in unaffected tissues (e.g. peripheral blood).Due to the low amount of deleted mtDNA in peripheral blood confirmation  of KSS by deletion specific PCR or Southern Blot from blood samples is not  possible in most cases. In cases in which a mtDNA deletion is confined to af fected tissues (e.g. skeletal muscle), the molecular diagnosis of KSS requires  genetic analysis of DNA form muscle biopsy. To overcome this limitation, we have established a next generation sequen cing protocol on the Roche 454J platform, which allows the detection of very  low amount of deleted mtDNA from peripheral blood samples. With this  approach we are able to test for the three most common mtDNA deletions found in approx. 80% of KSS patients.We could show that this new approach is able to characterize mtDNA dele  tions in patients with KSS from peripheral blood samples with a very high  sensitivity. It allows clincial testing for KSS without muscle biopies.",2012

All participants were tested with standardized neu ropsychological tests and 4 questionnaires investigating psychological pro blems.KS patients scored significantly lower in processing speed, working memo ry, verbal abilities and showed a selective deficit in executive function com pared to control subjects, whereas visual cognitive abilities and cognitive response inhibition was preserved. The KS patients displayed significantly  higher levels of cognitive failures, emotional distress and autism traits as reported in questionnaires. Furthermore symptoms of anxiety were also si gnificantly higher among KS patients, whereas there were no difference in depressive symptoms between KS patients and control subjects. On the NEO PI R personality test KS patients scored high on the neuroticism scale, low on the extraversion scale and low on the conscientiousness scale.Men with KS have deficits in several cognitive domains and have an alte red personality phenotype. Furthermore our results suggest that KS patient may be associated with an increased genetic vulnerability to psychiatric symptoms.

Mutations in the L1CAM gene located on the X chromo some cause the full syndrome in males while females may manifest minor features such as adducted thumbs and/or subnormal intelligence. We pre sent here a family with an unusual presentation of the L1 syndrome.The couple was referred to genetic consultation after a pregnancy which was terminated due to a diagnosis of agenesis of the corpus callosum in a male fetus. Medical history revealed that the mother was diagnosed with  hydrocephalus at 22 years that necessitated a surgical insertion of a shunt.  No other family members had symptoms consistent with L1 syndrome. Se  quencing of the L1CAM gene revealed that the mother was a carrier of a mis  sense mutation: c.791G>A which is known to be causative for L1 syndrome.

Typically patients are hypotonic  at birth, with muscle weakness and joint contractures. Many will sit inde   pendently, but less than 10% will walk. Lifespan can be shortened due re  spiratory compromise. Most children with MDC1A will have characteristic  cerebral white matter hypodensities detected by MRI after 6 months of age.  Neuronal migration defects (cortical dysplasia, polymicrogyria) are rare, oc curring in approximately 4% of merosin deficient muscular dystrophies 1.

Distinctive SLC26A4 mutations in such patients were described in some ethnic populations. Previous studies re vealed that the spectrum of SLC26A4 mutation was different in different ethnic background. For example, a mutation, H723R, was reported as the most common mutation for EVA and PS in Japanese.We investigated 18 patients from 18 unrelated families with EVA or PS to define the frequency of SLC26A4 mutations and clinical manifestations in Okinawa islands.ResultsEight patients diagnosed with PS, and 10 patients with NSEVA were exami ned in the SLC26A gene. Mutations of the SLC26A4 gene were identified in 15 out of 18 patients. Of the 15 patients, four patients were having a homo   zygous mutation of H723R, six patients were having compound heterozy   gous mutations of H723R and IVS15+5G>A, four patients were homozygous mutation of IVS15+5G>A, and one patient had heterozygous mutation of IVS15+5G>A.Among the mutations detected, IVS15+5GâA was most common, accoun ting for 61.1% (11/18) of the patients.

Clinical manife station is highly polymorphic. Mutations in the three genes (PTPN11, RAF1, and BRAF) can be responsible for LEOPARD syndrome. About 85% of all cases are PTPN11 positive.Clinical case: We did observe 17 y.o. male patient with prominent hypertro phic cardiomyopathy, left outflow tract obstruction, mitral valve insuffici   ency III IV, left atrium dilation, ventricular and supra ventricular extra sy  stoles. The heart rhythm was imposed by pacemaker, implanted in 2005 (at  13 y.o.), the battery was almost discharged. Extra cardiac symptoms include  multiple lentigines, growth retardation, pectus carinatum, and feet defor   mation. Parents were apparently healthy. Surgery treatment included mitral  valve replacement, left ventricular outflow resection, sub aortic membrane  excision, explanation of electrodes, pacemaker and ICD implantation.Genetic screening results: We did perform Senger sequencing of PTPN11,  RAF1 and BRAF genes by direct Sanger sequencing. New genetic variant  p.Thr468Met in PTPN11 gene was found in probandâs DNA sample but not in a control group. Additionally, several SNPs in RAF1 gene without clear clinical importance were found.

Background: Leri Weill Dyschondrosteosis (LWD) syndrome is characteri   zed by short stature with mesomelic disproportion of the limbs and Made lung deformity caused by SHOX haploisufficiency. The morphology of the bones is only partly described.Aim: To assess volumetric bone mineral density, microarchitecture, and strength in subjects with LWD and controls.Methods: Controls matched on sex and age. A high resolution peripheral quantitative CT scanner was used to measure volumetric BMD, bone geome try, and microarchitecture of the non dominant distal radius and the distal part of tibia. Osteoporosis was defined as a T score<  2.5 SD on the basis of a DXA scan.Subjects: Five families comprising 22 individuals (15 females) aged 38 years [IQR: 21 35] were included and controls. SHOX mutations: c.440G>T (n,2), c.657delA (n,9), del exon 3 4 (n,2), del SHOX (n,9).Results: Tibial trabecular thickness was lower in cases (0.067 vs. 0.076, p<0.05). In radius the cortical areal was larger in cases (74.4 vs. 56.5, p<0.001), cortical thickness was increased (1.16 vs. 0.82, p<0.001) and the trabecular number decreased (1.61 vs. 1.90, p<0.05). Bone strength was si milar in cases and controls. The radial cortex adjacent to ulna was absent in 5 cases. Four subjects were osteoporotic based on a T score but neither reported a previous fracture.Conclusion: These results suggest that bone microarchitecture is changed in LWD cases. The increased cortical thickness in radius may be caused by a more proximal measurement of the radius of cases due to the mesomelic forearm. 5 cases had a radial cortical defect.",2012

Thin/translucent skin with visible veins and easy bruising are also observed in EDS patients. The EDSs involve a genetic defect in synthesis and structure of collagen and collagen fibril assembly while the cutis laxa syndromes(CLs) are characteri   zed by loose/redundant skin and growth retardation and in some types de   fective biogenesis of elastic fibers have been shown.The mutations in RIN2   gene were first reported on three patients by Basel Vanagaite et al.,(2009) in two related families of Israeli Arab origin who showed macrocephaly, coarse and swollen facial appearance affecting the eyelids, lips, and cheeks, scoliosis, skin hyperlaxity and joint hypermobility. The acronym MACS; Ma  crocephaly, Alopecia, Cutis laxa and Scoliosis; was suggested for this new  syndrome related to the cutis laxa group of inherited disorders. Recently novel mutations in RIN2  gene were identified in three affected patients from  Algeria by Syx et al.(2010) who were formerly reported as EDS like syndro me in 2005 by Verloes et al.

By molecular karyotyping we identified the first de novo copy number gain to four copies on chromosome  17q21.31 including the MAPT gene but not the entire recurrent microde   letion/microduplication region. Recurrent microdeletions of this region in cluding the MAPT and the CHRH1 genes have been shown to be a relatively  frequent cause of intellectual disability, while only a few reciprocal dupli cations in patients with variable cognitive disorders have been published so far.A common inversion polymorphism in this region has been linked to a di stinct H2 haplotype and seems to be associated with an increased risk for microdeletions and  duplications. Our patient and his father were both he terozygous for the H1/H2 haplotype, whereas the mother was homozygous for the H2 haplotype. Interestingly, in our patient the dosage gain apparently occurred on the paternal H1 allele and did not involve the H2 allele as in the previously published cases.This patient further delineates the genotypic and phenotypic variability associated with copy number variants from the 17q21.31 microdeletion region.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201283 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012
 Novel mutations causing Marfan syndrome in Czech population and rare case of compound heterozygozity,P02.159,"M. Dvorakova, P . Cibulkova, E. Augste, A. Boday","Laboratory of Molecular Biology, P&R LAB a","s., Novy Jicin, Czech Republic. Background: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant connec  tive tissue disorder mainly involving the cardiovascular, skeletal and ocular  systems. The estimated incidence is of about 1:5 000   1:10 000 and appro  ximately 25% of cases are associated with de novo mutations. MFS is caused  by mutations in fibrillin 1 gene (FBN1, 15 q15 q21.1.) resulting in defective  glycoprotein fibrillin 1. Recently, there are showed that three other genes  FBN2 (5q23 q31), TGFBR2 (3p22) and TGFBR1 (9q22) influence MFS.Aims: In this study we performed SSCP analysis of all 65 exons of FBN1 gene in order to identify novel mutations in 570 unrelated patients with clinical  diagnosis of Marfan syndrome. Materials and Methods: DNA was isolated from whole blood, the molecu lar analysis includes mlpa (multiplex ligation dependent probe amplifica   tion) and separation of PCR products by SSCP (single strand conformation polymorphism). Exons with abnormal migrating patterns were sequenced.Results: We identified 87 FBN1 mutations, 53 of them have not been pre  viously described. Of the 46 were missense, 15 nonsense, 7 splicing, 17 small deletions or insertions and 2 gross deletions. Than we identified 4 patients with compound heterozygosity at the FBN1 locus, that is very rare. Conclusions: We have confirmed 107 cases of Marfan syndrome caused by  FBN1 mutation, which constitutes detection of about 19%. But mutation  screening of FBN1 should yield a result in about 80 85% of MFS patients  who meet the Ghent criteria. Our result is much lower due to sensitivity of  SSCP and because the patients involved did not meet the Ghent criteria.",2012

Steinlein1","1Institute of Human Genetics, Munich, Germany, 2Department of Surgery, Munich,  Germany, 3Department of Internal Medicine, Munich, Germany","The Marfan syndrome is an autosomal dominantly inherited genetic disor   der due to mutations in the fibrillin 1 (FBN1) gene, a gene that encodes a connective tissue protein.Consequently, mutations in this gene cause skeletal and connective tissue symptoms (pectus carinatum/excavatum, hypermobile joints, arachnodac tyly), complications of the cardiovascular system (dilatation/ dissection of ascending aorta, mitral valve prolapse), and the eyes (ectopia lentis, myopia). Patients suffering from Marfan syndrome are at risk of aortic rupture.Here we report an atypical case of Marfan syndrome.The 44 year old patient was hospitalized in 2007 with a spontaneous dissec   tion of the arteria carotis interna. Last year, an infrarenal aneurysma of the abdominal aorta was diagnosed. Physical examination showed a patient of below average size (167 cm (mother and father: 160 cm)). The arm span/ body height ratio was 0,98 (<1,05), neither skeletal nor ocular abnormali   ties were present. Thumb signs and wrist signs were negative. Thus classical characteristics of the syndrome were non existent. Family history showed that the patientâs mother died at the age of 56 due to an arterial rupture.Molecular analysis of the FBN1 gene revealed a missense mutation c.4727T>C (p.M1576T) in exon 37. This mutation leads to an amino acid exchange in the TGF beta domain of the FBN1 protein.In conclusion, the life threatening complications of Marfan syndrome can occur in patients without any of the typical Marfan features.",2012

The 15 French cytogenetic and mole cular labs were contacted and biological and epidemiological data were gathered in all cases. 71 symptomatic patients with a MECP2 duplication of  less than 4 MB were collected, including 66 boys and 5 females ranging from 0 to 24 years. The MECP2 duplication was identified in 45 patients (63%)  using a targeted analysis, and in 26 patients (37%) using an array CGH ana   lysis. The majority was inherited from unaffected mothers and the size of the duplication varied between cases. Within the 5 females, the MECP2 du  plication resulted from an unbalanced X autosome translocation (3 cases),  random X inactivation (1 case) or a partial MECP2 duplication (1 case, exon  4 only). Two cases were detected prenatally by array CGH, in a context of ge neralized lymphoedema or polymalformations (MECP2 triplication). From this study, besides the epidemiological data, we conclude that the diagnosis of MECP2 duplication can be difficult since 1/3 of cases were detected using  non targeted analysis.

Recently, a homozygous missense mutation in MED13L was found in 2 patients with non syndromic ID (without cardiac involvement) from a consanguineous family. Next to the clinical findings, studies on c. elegans imply a specific  role for MED13L in regulating transcription of the Wnt and Shh signaling targets which are crucial for embryonic development. Here, we describe 2 new aberrations of MED13L which were detected by means of molecular karyotyping. The first one is a de novo 17 kb out of frame deletion of its  exon 2 in a patient with complex congenital heart defect, ID, gross and fine motor coordination problems and dysmorphic features. The second aber ration is a 1 Mb de novo triplication in 12q24.21 including MED13L, several  non protein coding RNA genes and MAP1LC3B2, in a patient with a milder phenotype including learning difficulties and perimembranous VSD (closed spontaneously). These findings suggest that abnormal MED13L dosage af fects both, cardiac and neurologic developement. While different missense mutations result in either cardiac or intellectual problems, heterozygous copy number variants can lead to both in a dose dependent manner. Haplo insufficiency of the gene is associated with a more severe phenotype inclu   ding complex heart defect and ID where as the outcome of increased gene dosage is a milder phenotype in both systems.",2012

Background: Medullary cystic kidney disease (MCKD) is a rare autosomal  dominant renal disease characterized by medullary cysts, tubulo intertsti  cial nephritis, progressive chronic renal failure leading to end stage renal  disease in adult life and, in occasional instances, gout. Two loci have been identified: mutations in the uromodulin gene (UMOD, 16p12.3), encoding  the Tam Horsfall glycoprotein expressed in the thick ascending and distal  tubules, were found to associate with MCKD type 2 (MCKD2). Clinical sym ptoms might show inter  and intra familiar variability, making robust geno type/phenotype correlations hard to establish. Patients and methods: A 3 generation MCKD2 family was evaluated. Eight  members (7 affected, 1 non affected) were available for molecular and phe notype investigation. Immuno histochemical analyses of kidney biopsies  were performed. Genetic screenings were performed by PCR, direct sequen   cing and MLPA. Results: We detected a novel mutation in the UMOD gene in 6/7 patients  tested with intra familial variability of the phenotype. In one affected indivi dual we did not find any UMOD mutations. However, subsequent screening  of the polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) associated genes PKD1  and PKD2   in this patient revealed a novel variant in PKD1 . Conclusions: We present the clinical, immuno histochemical and gene tic results of a family demonstrating a unique finding of simultaneous ap pearance of two different cystic kidney diseases (MCKD2 and ADPKD) and  with novel mutations in the UMOD and PKD1  genes. Beside the phenotypic  variability of MCKD2, our findings demonstrate the possibility of genetic va  riety as the cause of cystic kidney disease even within the same family.",2012

The breakpoints and sizes of the duplications are different but included the ASLX1 gene (MIM612990).  ASLX1  is a human  homolog of the Drosophila asx gene which is an homeotic gene. Recently,  de novo heterozygous nonsense or truncating mutations in the ASLX1  gene  have been reported in 7 of 13 unrelated patients with Borhing Opitz syn  drome (MIM605039), a severe developmental and malformation disorder.  The finding of two other patients in the literature with overlapping 20q11 microduplication and clinical features allowed us to reduce the minimal cri   tical region to 7,4MB encompassing 173 genes including ASLX1  gene. Inte  restingly, patients display clinical features in common with Borhing Opitz syndrome, and in particular abnormal shape head. We hypothesize that the duplication of ASLX1  is responsible of a milder phenotype resembling  Borhing Opitz syndrome. These observations give data in favour of a novel microduplication syndrome and suggest a contribution of ASLX1  to the phe  notype.

NPS is caused by mutations in the LMX1B gene (LIM homeo   box transcription factor 1 beta), mapped at chromosome 9q34. The main pathogenic mechanism underlying NPS, particularly of the skeletal defects, is the haploinsufficiency of LMX1B.Material and Methods: Genomic DNA was extracted from 4 patients with the clinical diagnosis of NPS and an unequivocal autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. The 8 exons of LMX1B were amplified by PCR and sequenced in an ABI Prism 3500 genetic analyzer. MLPA technique (SALSA P289 A1 LMX1B) was used for detection of deletions and/or duplications.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201287 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters Results: Four different mutations were detected: two nonsense mutati   ons   p.Q60X, on exon 2, and p.C142X, on exon 3; one missense mutation    p.R223Q, on exon 4; and a duplication of exon 3 (dup Ex.3).

Some of these conditions, as CS, NF1 and Legius syndrome, are gene specific being caused by mutations in HRAS, NF1 and SPREAD1 genes respectively; the others syndromes are cha racterized by a considerable molecular overlapping. Two additional NS like conditions have been recently described, caused by mutations in CBL and SHOC2 genes. In particular, a specific SHOC2 gene mutation (4 A>G predic   ting the Ser2Gly aminoacid substitution), is responsible for a distinctive condition âNoonan like syndrome with loose anagen hair (NS LAH)â, cha www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 201289 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters racterized by a specific ectodermal phenotype.

The first patient presented common NS features at birth with  typical facial dysmorphisms and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. However, he had a dramatic clinical evolution in the first months of life rather resembling  that typical of CS. Central nervous system (CNS) involvement with drug re  sistant epilepsy and severe developmental delay occurred associated with significant growth delay and dystrophyc appearance. The second patient presented a distinctive NS LAH phenotype at birth, without CNS anomalies  or cardiac defects documented in the 18 months clinical follow up.

The two affected members of the fourth generation have not sustained either fractures of the tibia or radiolucent lesions, but anterolateral bowing of the tibia was a persistent feature. One of these two individuals presented with thoracic scoliosis in addition to the tibial and pectus malformation. Congenital bowing of the ti bia with the presence of radiolucent lesions or pseudoathrosis in this family is reminiscent of osteofibrous dysplasia (OFD).

Such mutations are  rare and the clinical phenotype has so far not been characterized. Nonsense  or frameshift mutations in COL1A1  typically lead to mRNA decay and haplo  insufficiency of the affected protein, resulting in mild forms of the disease. Nonsense mutations in COL1A2  which lead to mRNA decay do not cause  osteogenesis imperfecta.

Nonsense mutations  in the last exon, as it is found in our patients, are predicted not to result in mRNA decay but in the generation of a truncated protein. The respective  domain is considered to be important for the assembly of the three chains.  A dominant negative effect affecting a domain beyond the triple helix could account for the moderate clinical phenotype.",2012

Analysis using markers D7S691 and D7S1526 near GLI3 followed by sequencing of the coding sequence of the gene, demonstrated that the phe notype in this family was due to a novel c.A1802G (p.H601A) mutation in exon 12 of GLI3 abrogating one of the C2H2 type zinc fingers of the encoded protein.The study demonstrates the significant phenotypic variability of GLI3 muta   tions, with the same mutation leading to pre or post axial polydactyly.",2012

Polymicrogyria (PMG) represents a common cortical malformation and is  characterized by an excessive number of small gyri as a result of the abnor  mal neuronal migration. Up to date mutations in 35 genes are related with  various neuronal migration disorders. 13 chromosomal loci were associated with PMG. Here we present the results of high resolution array CGH analysis (Agilent  2x400k) in 21 patients with PMG.In one patient we identified de novo deletion 15q26.3 (24 Mb). Although known from the literature in association with developmental delay/multip   le malformations this locus was not previously associated with PMG.11 patients showed copy number variations (CNVs) neither listed as benign nor previously described in the literature. 7 patients had a single aberration  (4 losses and 3 gains). In 3 patients a combination of 2 CNVs and in one  patient 4 CNVs (gains) were seen. The size of the copy number losses and gains varied from 25 kb to 250 kb and from 36 kb to 250 kb, respectively. In  six patients a segregation analysis was possible. A de novo event could be  confirmed in one patient (loss). Four patients showed maternal inheritance (one mother partially affected) of the CNVs and one patient had two CNVs, one inherited from either parent. Two discovered CNVs reside within the  known PMG loci 4q22.1 and 13q22.1. In 9/21 patients only CNVs listed in Database of Genomic Variance were found. The phenotype, candidate genes, possible causative role of the rare CNVs  and further studies using NGS will be discussed.",2012

The Potocki Lupski syndrome (PTLS, MIM 610883) is a microduplication syndrome caused by a common duplication of about 3,7Mb in 17p11.2. The PTLS associated duplication is reciprocal to the common 17p11.2 deletion syndrome (Smith Magenis syndrome). Both, deletion and duplication rear rangements are caused by nonallelic homologous recombination between flanking repeat gene clusters (Zhang et al. 2010). Clinical features of PTLS  include infantile hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, autism, be  havioural abnormalities and speech delay.Here we report about two patients with PTLS who were ascertained by ka  ryotyping and array CGH analyses. Patient 1, a 5 year old boy, showed an  uncommon duplication of 4,7Mb. He demonstrated classical features like hypotonia, failure to thrive, mental retardation, speech delay, auto aggres   sive behaviour and facial dysmorphisms, but no congenital malformations.  Patient 2, a 2 month old boy, presented the common duplication of 3,7Mb  with hypotonia and additional club feet.Our study was established to design new self designed two colour FISH pro  bes for investigation the duplication region more precisely. Therefore, we  amplified two genes from proximal and distal part of the duplication by Long Range PCR with a size in total of 30kb. After fluorescent labelling with diffe  rent colours we hybridised the FISH probes on patients metaphase spreads.  Both revealed an inverted duplication due to specific signal pattern.Using our self generated protocol to establish PTLS specific FISH probes it is possible to detect how the duplicated region is arranged. Furthermore, we  demonstrate patients from the literature with similar duplication segments  in comparison of their phenotype for phenotype genotype correlation.",2012

The aim of this study is to evaluate oro dental phenotype in Prader Willi patients and recommen   ding strategies for the dental management of cases with this syndrome. Due to very low incidence of the disease in general population, the study group included 12 patients, aged between 4 and 25 years. Evaluation of dental caries was carried out according to WHO criteria. Orthopantomographies were performed. Based on the radiological appearance of 7 teeth in the left hemimandibula, a dental maturity score was calculated, which was used to determine dental age. Enamel hypoplasia was revealed in 9 cases (75%). Cavities were recorded in all cases, causing massive crown destructions in adults, with early loss of a variable number of teeth, between 4 and 7, af ter the age of 20.

Thus, PD is a class of disorders where growth delay occurs at the earliest stages of embryonic development. Unlike some of the other  forms of dwarfism where neonates may have normal growth parameters,  children with PD are born small. Here we report on two South African girls with PD, aged four and six years. Short stature was evident at birth.

Hereditary chronic pancreatitis (HCP) belongs into the group of rare di seases. HCP follows an autosomal dominant inheritance pattern with a penetrance of approximately 80%. The incidence is expected to be 3,5 10 cases/100 000 inhabitants in Europe and USA. It was shown that in appro ximately 50% of families affected with HCP , mutation of PRSS1  gene was  present.PRSS1  gene encodes cationic trypsinogen and some mutations described in  this gene lead to higher stability of prematurely activated trypsin in pan   creas or higher autocatalytic activation of inactive trypsinogen to trypsin. Another gene associated with HCP is SPINK1 . This gene encodes serin pro  tease inhibitor Kazal type I, which is markedly upregulated in the pancreas during active inflammation. Variants present in this gene may interrupt the specific inhibition of active trypsin in pancreas.Recently we have started the analysis of mutations in PRSS1  and SPINK1   genes in Slovak HCP families. Although, we have so far tested only few fa milies, several mutation carriers were already identified. One unreported variant, the p.Ile141Asn that we detected, presumably has a negative effect on the protein function. This novel variant may be specific for our populati   on and will be analyzed further.The genetic testing resulting in discovery of the mutations in mentioned genes associated with HCP may help to enroll the patients into special preventive programs.

Gsalpha is encoded by GNAS and heterozygous mutations including missense, nonsense, small inserti   ons and deletions in GNAS exons 1 13 have been reported to cause AHO. Submicroscopic deletion detected by array CGH, involving the whole GNAS locus, has also been reported. GNAS is subjected to maternal imprinting in some human tissues, including the thyroid gland, and hormone resistance (particularly for parathyroid hormone and thyroid stimulating hormone) is associated with AHO, only when the genetic defect is maternally inherited.

The prevalence of ASDs is currently estimated at 60 and 13 per 10,000 for ASDs and autism, respectively. Autistic disorder is often associated with macrocephaly; 24%  of patients have head circumference (HC) at >98th centile. Mutations in the  PTEN gene have been reported in patients with ASDs and significant ma  crocephaly (HC ranging from +2.5 SD to +8 SD). Germline PTEN mutations also cause a variety of inherited cancer predispositions like the Cowden, Bannayan Riley Ruvalcalba, Proteus and Proteus like syndromes. These  conditions may also have neurobehavioural features resembling autism as  well as overgrowth and macrocephaly. On the contrary, most macrocephalic  autistic patients with confirmed PTEN mutations were lacking the typical signs of these syndromes, at least at the time of testing. We have selected 53 autistic individuals with HC ranging from +2 SD to +4.8 SD (including  their relatives) for PTEN mutation analysis.

Ring chro mosome 18 is a rare chromosome disorder with highly variable phenotype, which probably depends on the extent of the terminal 18q and 18p deletions. A clear genotype phenotype correlation though, was hampered by the lack of exact breakpoint mapping in previously published cases. The majority of reported patients showed mild features of the 18q  syndrome. Only a mino rity of patients with ring chromosome 18 presented with clinical features of 18p  syndrome or a combination of these two syndromes.The phenotype of the 18q  syndrome is characterized by characteristic face, mental retardati on, short stature, microcephaly, abnormal male genitalia, congenital heart defect, congenital aural atresia/stonosis, hypotonia, foot deformity, and white matter abnormalities. Common features in 18p  syndrome patients are dysmorphic features, growth and mental retardation, immunological problems, skeletal abnormalities, cardiac defects, brain malformations, alo   pecia and dystonia.

 Is Roferon A ( Interferon alpha 2a) Teratogenic Risk Factor X?,P02.220,"M. A. Soylemez, A. Tafazzoli, H. Kazan, P . GÃ¼ltepe, G. Koc, G. Girgin, T . AvcÄ±lar, S. Ergunsu, M. Avsar, C. Erzik, M. GÃ¼lÃ§ebi, I. Guney","Marmara University Medical School, Istanbul, Turkey","BACKGROUND Roferon A (Interferon alpha 2a) is a pregnancy risk catego ry C drug, which has been shown to demonstrate a statistically significant increase in abortifacient activity in rhesus monkeys when given at approxi mately 20 to 500 times the human dose. A particular birth defect may have its origins through multiple mechanisms and possible exposures, including medications. A specific pathogenic process may result in different outcomes depending upon factors such as embryonic age at which a drug is administe red, duration, dose of exposure and genetic susceptibility. This case report discusses the teratogenic effect of Roferon A.CASE An infant was exposed to 1x1 1000000IU /day of Roferon A from the beginning of pregnancy until the 28th gestational week. Preterm newborn (28th week) showed the following abnormalities: Cliteromegaly, hydranen cephaly, microcephaly, hypotelorism, frontal bossing, asymmetry of head , big right ear, cleft plate, absence of nasal bridge and single alae nasi. Chro mosomal analysis of proband revealed 46,XX karyotype.CONCLUSIONS Identifying teratogenic mechanisms may not only be relevant for etiologic and post marketing research, but may also have implications for drug development and prescribing approach for women of reproductive age. Six teratogenic mechanisms are associated with medication use. Many medications classified as class X are associated with at least one of these teratogenic mechanisms. Our patient may be the first case which is possible to be related with one of these mechanisms of Roferon A. Moreover, in the  present case, teratogenic effects were observed even though the dose was  lower than in the previously reported Roferon A embryopathy cases.",2012

RTS is caused by submicro  scopic 16p13.3 deletions in approximately 10% of patients. Mutations in the CREBBP  gene (16p13.3) explain about 30% of the cases. Recently, mutations  in the EP300  gene (22q13) were reported in 5 patients. EP300  gene can be  considered as a rare cause of RTS.We report here, three patients presenting clinically with a RTS. These are two Belgian patients, a male and a female, aged respectively 29 and 11 years,  followed in the genetics and paediatric neurology clinics in Leuven and a  Tunisian patient followed in the oncology clinics of Sousse (Tunisia). The conventional karyotype was normal. We found no deletion on 16p13 by  FISH. By aCGH we detected in the first patient a terminal deletion on chro  mosome 6q and a terminal duplication on 7q. We confirmed by FISH that these submicroscopic chromosomal abnormalities were the product of an  unbalanced reciprocal translocation (6;7). The second patient has a de novo  microduplication of 500 kb on chromosome 5q11.2. We found no abnorma  lity in the third patient by aCGH at a resolution of 1 Mb. In this report, we will discuss the pathogenic relevance of these abnormali   ties and their possible contribution to the clinical phenotype. In conclusion,  we show that aCGH is a powerful tool for investigating the genetic aetiolo  gies of Rubinstein Taybi like syndrome.",2012

Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most frequent inborn heart defect. It is  associated with insufficiency and/or stenosis of the heart and results in the  pathologic changes in left ventricular structure and function as well as a  dilatation of the ascending aorta. BAV increases the risk of cardiac death. We studied a family with inherited joint dislocations and a congenital heart  disease with multiple defects (BAV with aortic root dilatation, mitral valve  prolaps, VSD, ASD). We mapped the disease to chromosome 11 and sub sequently identified hypomorphic mutations in glucuronyltransferase I (GlcAT I), the enzyme catalyzing the synthesis of the last step in the linker  region tetrasaccharide formation, which connects glycosaminoglycans and  the core protein of a proteoglycan. We showed that the mutations reduce enzymatic activity and decrease the levels of all three lines of O glycanated  proteoglycans, namely dermatan sulfate, chondroitin sulfate and heparan  sulfate proteoglycans. Real time PCR showed that GlcAT I is expressed in  heart, aorta, bone, and osteoblasts   tissues affected in the patients. Further, GlcAT I protein was present in the medial tissue of the human aorta, indi   cating that altered GlcAT I function may be involved in developmental or  degenerative aortic root dilation and aortic aneurysm. Our results point to  the proteoglycan synthesis as a candidate gene pathway for several cardio   vascular malformations as well as for congenital joint dislocations.",2012

The TWIST1  gene locus might be one of those. Mutations within the coding region of TWIST1 are associated with the Saethre Chotzen syndrome. Large deletions  encompassing TWIST1 and its neighbouring genes also contribute to this  disorder, but some patients have additional significant learning difficulties, which led to the suggestion of a novel microdeletion syndrome 7p21.1. Here we describe a three generation family, in which several members have a slight to moderate mental retardation and mild craniofacial dysmorphism. On array CGH analysis variable constellations of two different copy number changes flanking the TWIST1 gene at 7p21.1 could be detected in the affec  ted and non affected probands. One is a duplication of ~800 kb nearly 270 kb upstream of TWIST1, which contains 3 genes of so far unknown function  (TWISTNB, MIR3146 , TMEM1). The other, a small deletion of ~150 kb, is lo  cated approximately 2.9 Mb downstream of TWIST1 and encloses the gene  LOC729920. Both changes are not yet known as pathogenic or benign CNVs.

There are  four main types of EB Including: SIMPLEX, JUNCTIONAL, HEMIDESMOSAL  and DYSTROPHIC. Because of many overlapping clinical manifestations, identifying the exact type of EB is complicated. The most severe and com  mon form of EB is SIMPLEX that caused by a mutation in either of the keratin  genes, KRT5 or KRT14.The purpose of this study is to investigate of KRT5 gene common mutation in Iranian affected patients.MATERIALS and METHODS: Eighty clinically diagnosed patients as EB eva luated and their DNA extracted from blood sample.PCR reaction fallowed by direct sequencing were done using designed primers for hotspot exons of KRT5 gene including exon 1, 4, 5 and 7.RESULTS: A novel mutation was detected in codon 308 and about 18 % of patients illustrated a kind of mutation in selected regions. The most hotspots were exon 4 and 5. Interestingly the most of mutations were diagnosed in compound heterozygous form.",2012

Mutations in the human Î7 sterol reductase (DHCR7 ) gene are the genetic cause of this syndrome. In  most of the analyzed patients with distinct phenotypic features and/or bio chemical findings two mutations can be identified by sequencing of coding exons 3 to 9 and adjacent intron boundaries of the DHCR7  gene (detection  rate approx. 96%). In a small number of clinically and/or biochemically po sitive patients, only a single heterozygous mutation can be identified. We analyzed 9 of these patients by self made multiplex ligation dependent pro be amplification (MLPA) of exons 3 to 8 of the DHCR7  gene. In one patient,  we could identify a heterozygous deletion of exons 3 to 6, in addition to the heterozygous common mutation p.Arg352Trp (c.1054C>T) in exon 9 of the DHCR7  gene. The deletion leads to an almost complete loss of the gene which  is presumably disease causing. At birth the patient was small for gestational age, had short proximal limbs, syndactyly of toes 2 and 3, an atrial septal defect, horseshoe kidney, and typical facial features. During the first year psychomotor retardation, muscular hypotonia, and feeding difficulties evol ved. Plasma sterol analysis showed elevated 7  and 8 dehydrocholesterol and decreased cholesterol. Exon deletions in the DHCR7  gene have only been  reported once in a SLOS patient with holoprosencephaly. Therefore, we re commend MLPA analysis in patients suspected of SLOS harbouring only one mutation identified by exon sequencing.",2012

Rodrigues,"Department of Medical Genetics, Hospital Dona EstefÃ¢nia, Centro Hospitalar de Lisboa Central, EPE, Lisbon, Portugal","Background: Mutations in SCN9A  gene can cause three very different pain  phenotypes: Primary Erythermalgia (PE), Paroxysmal Extreme Pain Disor   der (PEPD) and Channelopathy associated Insensitivity to Pain (CIP). The first two disorders result from gain of function mutations and are charac terized by recurrent episodes of pain, but the accompanying manifestations are usually distinct.Objectives: The authors aim to present two Portuguese families with recur rent episodes of pain, in which the diagnosis between PE and PEPD was dif   ficult to establish due to overlapping clinical manifestations. The first family is one large kindred with 26 affected subjects and the second family has 3 affected members.Methods: After characterizing the clinical manifestations, we performed mutation analysis of SCN9A  gene in 17 of the 26 affected and in 2 non affec  ted members of family 1, as well as in all the affected subjects of family 2.Results: In all the affected individuals of family 1, except for one female subject, a heterozygous missense mutation c.4835T>C (p.Leu1612Pro) was identified. In family 2 complete sequencing of SCN9A  gene revealed a hete  rozygous unclassified mutation c.4880T>G (p.Met1627Arg), which is most likely pathogenic and is present in all the affected family members.Conclusion: We believe that these two families are the first Portuguese fa milies reported to have mutations in SCN9A  gene, in which the molecular  diagnosis was determining to correctly classify the clinical phenotype. This stresses the importance of performing mutation analysis in affected indivi duals to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to support pharmacological treat  ment, which can reduce the frequency of pain episodes.",2012

Introduction: Hereditary arrhythmia syndromes are found in more than  half of initially unexplained cases of sudden cardiac death (SUD) in young  persons. Additionally to autopsy findings, examination of relatives and  molecular testing if appropriate enables establishing the diagnosis.Methods: Family members of 29 SUD patients consulted our clinic. Mean  age of death was 24Â±15 years. Pedigree analysis and clinical examination in relatives was performed, followed by phenotype guided genetic testing in the deceased, if appropriate. In case of no clinical suspicion in relatives but death related to specific triggers (e.g. swimming) sequencing of the RYR2  gene resp. the 3 mostly affected LQTS genes was performed. If a mutation  was found cosegregation within the family was verified before establishing the diagnosis. Results: In n,16 cases (55%) a hereditary arrhythmia syndrome could be  found. In n,12 (75%) of these cases clinical examination of relatives led to  the diagnosis. In 3 families two arrhythmia syndromes (LQTS and CPVT ,  resp. HCM) were present. Conclusion: In case of SUD in a significant percentage of cases a postmor   tem diagnosis can be performed. When there are only unspecific findings clinical screening of relatives leads to a proper diagnosis in a large proporti   on. Genetic evaluation should follow clinical family examination because: 1. therapy should be started without waiting for the genetic result if indicated. 2. in 3 families (18%) two hereditary disorders were present and 3. in 2  families the phenotype of the deceased was untypical so that the proper dia  gnosis would not have been made without family screening.",2012

Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org102 ESHG Posters www.eshg.orgFirstly, the most common alpha thalassemia deletions were investigated  by gap PCR and the paternal side revealed homozygote alpha gene deleti  on  Î±3.7and consequently the child has inherited the  Î±3.7in heterozygous  form. The maternal side did not show any alpha gene mutation even by alpha globin DNA sequencing. Direct sequencing for beta  globin gene was  also performed and no mutation was detected for the family. Finally, multi   plex ligation probe amplification (MLPA) was subjected to detect alpha  and  beta  globin large deletions in the affected child and the results indicate a huge homozygote deletion in beta globin gene cluster with the same pattern  as Indian GÎ³AÎ³ (Î´Î²)Â° or Belgian (50 Kb) deletions. The deletion was confir   med in both paternal and maternal sides in heterozygous form. This study shows that MLPA can effectively identify different and unknown  types of beta globin gene deletions, to allow characterizing previously un  solved thalassemia intermedia genotypes, and remarks the probability of presence of beta deletions in cases that do not show significant elevations  of HbF.",2012

Hypodontia or the congenital absence of one or more permanent teeth is the most common congenital anomaly in man. The disorder is highly heri   table and occurs as an isolated anomaly or as a symptom of a large variety of syndromes, including Ectodermal Dysplasia (ED). The recent finding of hypodontia in carriers of the autosomal recessive disorder odonto oncycho dermal dysplasia due to mutations in WNT10A  (OMIM 257980; OODD) made  WNT10A  an interesting candidate gene for dental agenesis. This motivated  us to study the contribution of WNT10A mutations in comparison with mu  tations in other genes that are associated with hypodontia in isolated hypo dontia patients. We tested a panel of 34 probands that show variable severity of isolated tooth agenesis for mutations in the candidate gene WNT10A  and  the genes MSX1, PAX9, IRF6  and AXIN2 . The probands all had agenesis with  a range of 6   28 teeth. Nineteen cases with non syndromic probands (56%) showed alterations in the WNT10A gene: 8 probands were homozygous, 4 probands were compound heterozygous and 7 probands were heterozygous for a single WNT10A mutation. In individuals, tested as heterozygote for a WNT10A mutation, tooth agenesis was comparable in males (6/9; 67%) and females (7/12; 58%). In conclusion, we identified WNT10A  as a major gene  in the aetiology of isolated hypodontia. By including this gene, the yield of molecular diagnostics in isolated tooth agenesis has increased significantly from 15% to 71%. This approach will be of help in a more optimal counsel ling of patients with hypodontia and their family members.",2012

Case report: In a preterm (32 weeks) with prolonged  and cholestatic jaundice, recurrent hypoglycemia occurred at the age of 1.5  months and related to GH deficiency. There were no other endocrine or syn  dromic features. GH therapy was started at a usual dose of 25 30 Âµg/kg/d  but hypoglycemia recurred. Hepatopathy and hypogammaglobulinemia sug gested X recessive GH deficiency type 3 with non random X inactivation but resolved spontaneously. Nonetheless, a TS karyotype 45,X[75]/46,X,i(Xq) [21]/47,X,i(Xq)x2[4] was diagnosed with an apparent isochromosome fu  sion at the centromere. Upon this diagnosis, GH dose was doubled (50 Âµg/ kg/d) and blood glucose normalized consistently. In array CGH, the signal of Xp deviated more strongly than that of Xq but the relation of the signals dif   fered substantially from what the karyotype predicted. The isochromosome  fusion point was relocated to Xp11.22, distal to a block of mental retardation  genes that escape X inactivation. Conclusions:  i) TS with GH deficiency or  resistance is a differential diagnosis of hypoglycaemia in infants. ii) Array  CGH is useful in precisely delineating isochromosome structure but may be erroneous in quantification of TS mocaicism.",2012

Timely diagnosis and surgical excision of tumors is  essential to prevent severe audio vestibular morbidity as even microscopic  ELSTs can cause irreversible hearing loss. We present a case in which deaf   ness caused by a microscopic ELST possibly could have been prevented by  early pre symptomatic audiometric diagnosis. Methods Full medical records of the patientâs subjective audio vestibular symptoms, audiological examinations, and Magnetic Resonance Imagings (MRIs) of the inner ear from 1995 2011 were collected and evaluated. Results A 42 year old male VHL mutation carrier with initial normal hearing was  followed for twenty years with audiometry and MRI of the brain and inner  ear as part of a surveillance program. He reported occasional bilateral tinni  tus, but no subjective hearing loss until 2009 when in his right ear hearing began to deteriorate and progress to total deafness. Despite annual MRIs, a right sided ELST was not visible until 4 months after  onset of deafness in 2010, when it appeared as 4 x 3 mm tumor mass. Alt   hough his hearing was objectively within normal limits until 2009, a distinct audiometric pattern of low frequency hearing loss could retrospectively be  seen from first audiometry. ConclusionsPrevious reports suggest that certain audiometric patterns as seen in our  patient may indicate early ELST development. Accordingly, audiometry may  be an important diagnostic tool to detect non symptomatic ELSTs.

Consequences of over expression of X linked genes are not well known. In most male cases the consistent phenotype includes profound muscle hypotonia accompanied by severe psychomotor and growth failure, hypoplastic genitalia, seizures and craniofacial dysmorphism.

Chromosome 17q21.31 microdeletion syndrome is a genomic disorder caused by recurrent ~600 kb deletion of the region containing the common 900 kb inversion. The inversion is associated with the H2 haplotype present in ~20% of Europeans. H2 carries additional low copy repeats susceptib le to NAHR which can lead to the deletion. The syndrome is characterised by intellectual disability, hypotonia, long face, tubular or pear shaped nose, bulbous nasal tip and friendly behaviour.We present monozygotic twin sisters carrying the microdeletion and sho   wing only slightly different phenotypes. Both had disproportionate short stature, short upper and lower limbs, thoracic hyperkyphosis, low pitched voice and similar long, thin and coarse face, coarse hair, thick eyebrows, pear shaped nose, smooth broad philtrum, thick lips, mandibular progna thism, and hirsutism. Twin A had high palate and Twin B had wide spaced teeth, diastema, more severe intellectual disability, more coarse facial fea tures, strabismus, and horizontal nystagmus.The microdeletion was identified in Twin A using BAC array CGH and con firmed in both twins but not in the parents using FISH. Potential genomic differences were subsequently searched using Illumina Human CytoSNP 12 SNP arrays (~300K) and Nimblegen 2.1M whole genome CGH array. These analyses identified no differences potentially responsible for the phenoty   pic differences, which could possibly be related to a more severe perinatal history of Twin B or the variable expressivity of the disorder. The father and mother were homozygous for H1 and H2, respectively, and the maternal 17q21.31 allele was missing in the twins.

Depending on the size of the deletion different clinical symptoms have been described. Dele tions of the SLC3A1 and PREPL genes are responsible for the hypotonia cy   stinuria syndrome. Homozygous mutations in the SLC3A1 gene were found in patients with isolated cystinuria (MIM 220100). We report on a girl born preterm to non consanguineous healthy parents. At delivery, the mother was 44 years old. After birth, meconium ileus and a persistent Ductus arte riosus Botalli had to be corrected surgically. Profound muscular hypotonia was present and psychomotor development was delayed. Failure to thrive was so severe that at 2 years age tube feeding was still necessary. Karyotype on conventional cytogenetic analysis was apparently normal (46,XX). Array CGH analysis uncovered a small homozygous deletion of approximately 28.6 kb that disrupts the PREPL and the CAMKMT genes but not the SLC3A1 gene. Quantitative PCR analysis of both parents demonstrated a heterozy   gous deletion of the same size in the maternal blood only. We hypothesized that a maternal uniparental disomy could be responsible for the homozygo sity of the deletion in the daughter. A microsatellite analysis showed mater   nal isodisomy 2 in the critical region 2p21. Possibly meiotic non disjunction followed by trisomy rescue led to homozygosity for the small maternal de   letion. This case illustrates a complex multistep process leading to a disease causing genomic imbalance.

Knowledge of genetic factors contributing to variability with respect to biological drug responses could help to design better expe rimental approaches, which in turn would help to reduce, refine or even re place animal experiments. We attempted to investigate the importance and implications of genetic variation on cellular processes using genome wide information on copy number variation (CNV) and gene expression from Cynomolgus monkeys originating from three different populations used in pharmaceutical research (Mauritius, China and the Philippines). Using aCGH data and a CNV calling pipeline combining different methods for CNV calling, we quantified copy number variation among our cohorts, which we then correlated with tissue specific gene expression data from five different tissues (heart, kidney, liver, lung, spleen). We identified several loci where copy number variation is associated with changes in gene expression levels of several genes in a tissue specific manner. Of interest is, that many of the se changes occur in the kidney, which is also involved in drug metabolism. Using further downstream analyses, we will attempt to get information on the cellular processes possibly affected by these gene regulatory changes and make statements on potential implications for drug safety testing.",2012

A hypothesis considering structural and func tional alterations to genome landscape was proposed to link ectopic cell cycle events and aneuploidy. Previous experimental evidences suggest that genomic landscape in the AD brain is featured by of genomic or chromo somal instability manifesting as tetraploidy and aneuploidy. Aberrant DNA replication, leading to intracellular replication stress in the AD brain is likely to produce the accumulation of genomic instabilities in vulnerable neuro nal cells and to promote neurodegeneration. Here, we report on molecular cytogenetic analysis of aneuploidy, tetraploidy, and DNA replication events in the AD hippocampus to define the role of neuronal genome instability in AD pathogenesis. Increased aneuploidy rates (4 21%) (monosomy and trisomy) affecting chromosome 21 and chromosome X was observed in the AD brain in contrast to 1.2 3.6% rates in the unaffected brain. Howe ver, increased rates of tetraploidy and DNA replication activity in AD were  not observed. We were able to demonstrate that the incidence of aneuploid  neuronal cells affected by aneuploidy was significantly higher in degenera ting brain areas (hippocampus, prefrontal cortex) as to less affected areas  (cerebellum). This suggests that cancer like cellular behavior in the AD  brain mediates neurodegeneration via non malignant aneuploidization and represents the leading genetic factor contributing to AD pathogenesis.

Similarly, over 40% of apparently balanced chromosome rearrangement (ABCR) carriers with abnormal phenotype present copy number variants (CNVs), both at the breakpoints and elsewhere in the genome, implying a potential higher risk for DD/MCA.We present the preliminary results of an on going genome wide arrayCGH analysis (Agilent 180K) in three populations: G 1) Individuals DD/MCA and normal karyotype (n,5), G 2) ABCR carriers with DD/MCA (n,9), G 3) ABCR carriers with normal phenotype (n,6).A similar total number of CNVs per individual was present in all three groups (Table 1). However, potentially pathogenic imbalances were significantly more frequent among DD/MCA patients, independently of their karyotype (10,3% and 14,4%, in G 1 and G 2 groups, respectively), than in phenoty   pically normal ABCR carriers (1,5%). All imbalances among ABCR carriers were located outside of the breakpoint regions. Pathogenic imbalances were present in 80% G1 and 77.8% G2 of DD/MCA patients and in 16,7% in phe notypically normal group.Genomic imbalances have an important role in the pathogenesis of pheno typic abnormalities.

INTRODUCTION: Array genomic hybridization (aCGH) is being used clini cally to detect pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) in individuals with  intellectual disability (ID), dysmorphic features (DF) and/or congenital ano  malies (CA). It is now widely adopted as a first tier clinical diagnostic test.  Our aim is to review the diagnostic yield in our unit. MATERIAL AND METHODS: We performed a retrospective review of aCGH data (180 400k) of 197 patients with ID, DF and/or CA, with normal karyo  type and subtelomeric MLPA, between july 2009 and july 2011. RESULTS: We found pathogenic genomic imbalance in 28 (14.2%) of these  197 patients. Within this group, 4 patients (14.28%) had previous balanced  rearrangement in karyotype. The size of the pathogenic structural aberrati ons found varied from 17 Kb to 14.1 Mb. In 90 patients (45.68%) polymor   phic CNVs were detected, non clinically significant CNVs in 39 (19.8%) and variants of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS) in 40 (20.3%). Parental  complementary aCGH analysis was done in 39 patients. CONCLUSION: 1) The diagnostic yield of our study (14.2%) was consistent with prior reports (11 20%). 2) aCGH is a valuable tool in patients with  mental retardation, dysmorphic features and/or congenital anomalies of  unknown etiology. 3) Further investigations are needed in order to clarify  the role of VOUS in the pathogenesis since they account for a significant pro  portion of our results. 4) Effective clinical interpretation of these studies requires considerable skill and experience.",2012

In the male autistic brain, we ob served statistically significant increase of chromosome X aneuploidy rates in the cerebral cortex and cerebellum (p,0.0166) as compared to control samples. Autistic spectrum disorders currently affect four times as many males as females. Mosaic chromosome X aneuploidy in the brain may help to explain the preponderance of autism among males in addition to specific alterations of the X chromosome genes. We conclude that intercellular geno mic variation manifesting as brain specific low level mosaic aneuploidy is one of the possible genetic factors likely contributing to autism neuropatho logy.

The majority of hypertensive patients need long term administration of antihypertensive agents and that is why the duration of the pharmacological treatment requires documentation of long term sa fety and efficacy, including sensitive indices of genotoxic damage.Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are a widely used class of drugs that are growing in popularity due to the excellent blood pressure control and tolerability. However, recent concerns have surfaced about possible links between ARBs and increased cancer risk.Chromosomal aberrations (CAs) represent the most extensively used and validated biomarker in populations exposed to genotoxic agents and it is also associated with a higher cancer risk. This study aimed to evaluate the   Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org110 ESHG Posters www.eshg.orggenotoxic potential of five kinds of ARBs (candesartan, valsartan, eprosar   tan, telmisartan and olmesartan), assessed in vivo and in vitro for their capa   city of inducing CAs on lymphocytes of 55 patients and 10 controls.

Asia","Department of Genetics, Reproductive Biomedicine Research Center, Royan Institute for reproductive Biomedicine,ACECR",", Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Purpose: Complex chromosomal rearrangements (CCR) are rare events in volving more than two chromosomes and more than two breakpoints. They  are usually associated with infertility or sub fertility in male carriers. We ex   amined a 29 year oligosperm man with a history of Varicocelectomy, normal  testes size and normal endocrinology profile,who referred for chromosome analysis to genetic laboratory of Royan infertility institute.Method: Chromosomal analysis was performed from peripheral blood lym phocyte cultures and analyzed by GTG banding. Additional tests such as C banding and multicolor fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) procedure for each of the involved chromosomes were performed to determine the patterns of the segregations. Y chromosome micro deletions in the azoo   spermia factor (AZF) region were analyzed with multiplex polymerase chain reaction. To identify the history and origin of this CCR, all the family mem bers were analyzed.Result: The case was a complex chromosomal translocation; 46,XY,t(13;16;14;18) (q31.2;p13.2;q24.2;q21.2). No micro deletion in Y chromosome was detected. Just his monozygous twin brother has the same de novo reciprocal exchanges. The other siblings and parents were normal.Conclusion: CCR are associated with male infertility as a result of the disrup   tion of spermatogenesis due to complex meiotic configurations and the pro duction of chromosomally abnormal sperm. In other words, it is likely that these chromosomal rearrangements might have influence in decreasing the number of sperms. To have a chance of healthy offspring , preimplantation  genetic diagnosis (PGD) method is suggested.",2012

CCR are usually considered to include severe reproductive impairment by disturbing the meiotic process and producing unbalanced gametes responsible for high reproductive risk. Most of CCR are reported to be de novo.We report a case of a complex translocation in a 38 years old female with me nopause praecox and sterility. Conventional chromosomal analysis revealed an apparently balanced translocation involving 13, 15 and 16 chromosomes.This balanced complex translocation (BCT) involves three chromosomes and three different breakpoints. Molecular cytogenetic analysis with whole chromosome probes , centromeric and locus specific FISH probes showed breaks at 13q21.2, 15q26 and 16q23. Carriers of balanced complex translo cation have a high risk of having spontaneous abortions or a child with an unbalanced karyotype. Our patient was informed by genetic counsellor.",2012

They are contributing to the development of congenital anomalies, intellec  tual disabilities, spectrum autism disorder and other psychiatric disorders. It is known that the prevalence of psychiatric disorders among adults with  intellectual disability is higher than in control population. Methods: We analyzed a cohort of 100 adult patients affected by mild/mode rate intellectual disability associated with psychiatric disorders and minor dysmorphic features. Genetic analysis included array comparative genomic  hybridization (aCGH) (Agilent 400K), performed in 45 cases at present. Results: We detected 89 rare and potentially pathogenic CNVs in 37 cases, with an average of 2,4 CNV/case (1 8). These CNVs include 184 genes (2,07  genes/CNV). At present, we can correlate known CNVs with intellectual  disability and/or psychiatric disorders in 13 patients (31,1%). Deletions and duplications found in these cases are: del2p12, del2p16.3, dup3q29,  del12p12.1, dup15q11q13, del15q13.1q13.3, dup15q25.2, del15q26.2,  dup15qter, dup17q24.1q24.2, del22qter, and dupXq22.1. Genes responsible of psychiatric disorders and some of them also with intellectual disability are: CTNNA2, NRXN1, PAK2, SOX5, GABRB3, CHRNA7, ADAMTSL3, MCTP2,  APOH and SHANK3. Del2p16.3 is present in three patients and is the only  recurrent CNV associated with psychiatric disorders. NRXN1 gene is related  with susceptibility to autism, schizophrenia and mental retardation. Conclusion: We most emphasise the high frequency of rare CNVs associated  specially with psychiatric disorder in patients with mild/moderate intellec tual disability.This work was supported by a grant of FIS (PI080778).",2012

We re examined ten patients with normal and/or abnormal karyotypes and dysmorphic features, associated with Mental Retardation, Autism and/or Epilepsy. We applied a fast BAC Genome Array  CGH platform (Cytochips Blue gnome, Techno genetics   Bouty). Cyto Chips are high quality BAC microarrays (4898 BAC Clones spotted in quadruplicate 0.6 Mb). This ap proach led us to discover further cryptic chromosomal rearrangements, pre viously undetected by conventional cytogenetic procedures. We identified two genes: SLC8A3 (human gene for member 3 of solute carrier family 8), a  sodium calcium exchanger electively expressed in the brain, and a possible candidate gene for Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2010) and the CSMD1 gene (Cub  and sushi multiple domains 1) a candidate gene for Autism associated with Mental Retardation (MR) and Epilepsy (Nucaro et al 2011). This approach allows us to better delineate the genotype/phenotype correlation in our pa tients.

Some cases can be explained by the cumulative inheritance of susceptibility genetic variation, including unbalanced genomic rearrangements.Clinical ReportThe proband, a 2 year old boy, born to consanguineous parents (r,1/8), was referred to the medical genetics clinic due to global psychomotor de   velopment delay, unspecific facial dysmorphisms, oesophageal atresia and failure to thrive. Since there was a family history of learning difficulties, the parents and the siblings were also studied. The etiologic investigation revealed a heterozygotic 19q13deletion on subtelomeric MLPA analysis in the proband, in both affected parents and in the two healthy sisters, and a 19q13nullisomy in the older brother. As this was the more severely affected member an arrayCGH was performed which revealed a 1p33tetrasomy and a 3p21.31duplication. The parentsâ arrayCGH identified a 1p33duplication in both parents and a 3p21.31duplication in the mother.Proper cognitive assessments were performed to all members and array   CGH analysis is being carried out to the proband and his sisters.Discussion/ConclusionCo inheritance of genomic abnormalities may explain the developmental disorders and cognitive deficits in this family. The affected genomic regions include putative relevant genes, such as CHMP2A,  which participates in cell  cycle progression regulation, NSUN4 , which interferes with DNA methylati   on and TREX1  that interferes in cell apoptosis.

The modern genome wide analysis tools (such as array   CGH) have led to the discovery of novel copy number variations (CNVs); many of them are known to be associated with diseases.

We present a 5 year old girl, who was born with microcephaly, navel cord hernia, and mild dysmorphic features (deep set short nose, small chin, low hairline, and low set ears). A neuropsychological examination revealed mild  psychomotor retardation and speech delay. The proband suffers from fre  quent febrile convulsion, dental caries and frequent respiration infections.G banded karyotyping at 550 bands resolution defined the karyotype of the  proband as normal. An approximately 1.79 Mb deletion in chromosome band 2q13 (chr2:111415137 113194067 bp, hg19) was identified by arrayCGH and  verified by real time quantitative PCR (qPCR).

Here we report on microarray analysis of a large de  novo inverted 10q duplication & subtelomer deletion.Case report. The female patient was term born, small for gestational age, referred because of growth and psychomotor delay, microcephaly, severely  handicapped vision due to right sided microphthalmia, coloboma of the iris  and choroidea, small palpebral fissures and bilateral ptosis, ventricular and atrial septum defect. Lab results. GTG studies with a lymphocyte culture showed an extended long  arm of chromosome 10. FISH using wcp 10 and subtelomeric probe 10q re  vealed the extra material to be exclusively derived from chromosome 10 and  lack of the subtelomeric region 10q, respectively. Microarray investigation  affirmed the 10q24.1>q26.3 duplication and adjacent subtelomeric deletion including a 6kb single copy stretch within the duplicated segment. Conclusion. The clinical severity of chromosome 10q duplication seems to  depend particularily on the involvement of 10q24 suggesting a dosis effect  in the respective genes. The subtelomeric deletion most likely does not in fluence the phenotype. This report adds to the still few patients with 10q  duplication delineated by array methods and the increasing understanding  of genotype phenotype correlations. Also, our results provide molecular evidence for the inverted low copy repeat model postulated by Bonaglia  (2000).",2012

In females, a normal phenotype should be expected if the abnormal X chromosome is preferentially inactivated. Recently, duplications of Xp en  compassing band p11.2 were found in females with developmental delay  and other anomalies. Unexpectedly, most of them showed preferential acti vation of the duplicated X chromosome.Clinical Report and Genetic Findings:We describe female twins of twentyfive months of age with developmental delay, seizures, EEG and MRT abnormalities, and facial dysmorphism. Both children were sociable and smiled frequently. The first child had a small atri al septum defect, the second had a patent foramen ovale and a dilated renal pelvis. SNP Array analysis in one child and both parents showed a de novo  ~5 Mb duplication of Xp11.23 p11.3 in the child. Subsequent FISH analysis confirmed this duplication in both children. The twins showed selective in activation of the normal X chromosome in more than 80% of blood cells.Discussion:The described twins have phenotypic features in common with other males and females carrying a partially overlapping Xp duplication. These individu als have developmental delay, seizures, EEG abnormalies, similar behavioral phenotypes and facial dysmorphism. The described twins as well as almost all reported affected females show selective inactivation of the normal X chromosome, suggesting that increased expression of a gene within the common duplicated region leads to skewed X inactivation. Functional diso   my for genes within the duplication results in the described phenotype.",2012

PCL FISH was  established as 24 different chromosome specific probe sets and can be used in two  up multicolor FISH approaches. PCL FISH enables the determinati on of a chromosomal breakpoint with a resolution between 1 and ~10 me  gabasepairs and is based on locus specific bacterial artificial chromosome  (BAC) probes. Thus, PCL FISH leads to a better resolution than most FISH banding approaches. To approve the result eight of the in 29 sSMC cases  were studied by array CGH; the used sSMC specific DNA was obtained by  glass needle based microdissection and DOP PCR amplification. Results obtained on 29 sSMC cases and 5 larger derivative chromosomes are pre  sented and discussed.

Kessler","Reutlingen Research Institute, Process Analysis and Technology, Reutlingen University,  Reutlingen, Germany","Staining techniques are routinely used to identify metaphase chromosomes  based on their unique banding pattern. Advanced molecular cytogenetic  techniques like Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (FISH) provide a more  sensitive tool for complex and small structural aberrations. In both cases a broad expert knowledge is necessary to understand and diagnose diseases. We have developed a new technique for fast and label free karyotyping using  a Hyperspectral Imaging System (HSI) which can easily be integrated into a standard light microscope. With this system we measure the stray light interference pattern of an unstained chromosome or substructures of the  chromosome with a diode array spectrometer. The complex spectra can be  interpreted as spectra of ânanostructured particle arraysâ of different size and refractive indexes. The signature of each spectrum is due to the super   position of the interference pattern of the different layer thicknesses, the spectral interference of the band pattern and changes in refractive indexes along the chromosome axis. The hyperspectral data can be analyzed using multivariate data analysis and the chromosomes can be classified by their individual spectral features.The results are confirmed with model particle array measurements. The   se measurements show strong correlation with calculated Mie interference spectra. Furthermore, FDTD (Finite Difference Time Domain) simulations of model chromosomes confirm the photon diffusion pattern as well. Sub   structures of chromosomes can also be analyzed by Near Field Spectroscopy (imaging beyond diffraction limit) measuring the stray light pattern of sub structures of chromosomes as small as 50 nanometers.",2012

Although most cases are isolated, a subset is associated with  other anomalies and linked to already known syndromes involving cleft lip  or palate (CL/P), such as van der Woude syndrome. Until now, a number of genes have been suggested to be involved in clefting events, but they account  for small proportion of the recognized etiology. With the implementation of  array CGH for diagnostics purposes, among the mechanisms leading to clef ting, microdeletions have been hypothesized to play a significant role.Herein we present a study of 33 patients with isolated CL/P with the use of  whole genome Agilent 180k microarray with mean resolution of 16kb. We  have found 10 copy number variations (CNV) overall (9 deletions and 1 du plication), ranging in size from 27 kb up to ~8Mb. Microaberrations found in the study are not covering any known microdeletion/microduplication syndrome regions. The summary of all cases and genotype phenotype cor   relation will be presented. The most interesting ones will be presented in details, i.e del 17q12 where only SLFN12  is deleted. Our results demonstrate that a high resolution array CGH is an efficient tool in diagnostics of patients with patients with isolated cleft lip/palate.

Klinefelter syndrome is the first human sex chromosomal abnormality to be reported. The majority of Klinefelter syndrome patients have the XXY karyo type. Approximately 15% of Klinefelter patients, however, are mosaics with variable phenotypes.A 39 year old male was investigated for primary infertility. Clinical ex   amination showed an intelligent man with normal facial appearance and small firm testes. Testicular histopathology revealed marked atrophy of the testes with no spermatogenesis and absence of germ cells. Hormo   nal profile showed elevated levels of FSH, LH and low levels of testoste rone. Chromosome analysis from whole blood culture showed cells with 48,XXXY/47,XXY/46,XX/45,X/46,XY mosaicism. The predominant cell line was 47,XXY (86.66%). This was confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridi   zation (FISH) using a dual color X/Y probe. In our case, FISH also detected the presence of a small population of cells with the 48,XXXY and 45,X ka ryotypes not previously detected in the initial 30 cell GTG banding analysis. 46,XY/47,XXY mosaicism is not uncommon. However, mosaicism of multiple sex chromosome aneuploidy is rarely observed. Thus, this case illustrates the utility of FISH as an adjunct to conventional cytogenetics in assessing the chromosome copy number in each cell line of a mosaic. Because most infertile individuals with Klinefelter syndrome may wish to reproduce with the aid of modern reproductive technology, it is important that accurate estimation of the frequency of abnormal cells be obtained for accurate risk estimation and genetic counseling.",2012

Chromosomal abnormalities are the most common cause of spontaneous  miscarriage during the first trimester. We performed a comparative study of abnormal karyotype frequency and type in miscarriages following natural conception (group I, n,558) and assisted reproductive technologies (ART) (group II, n,121). Standard karyotyping was made on QFH/AcD banded metaphase chromosomes, obtained from chorionic villi samples. The rate of abnormal karyotypes was 66,5% in group I vs. 50,4% in group II. The difference is explained by the lower percentage of abnormal karyotypes in miscarriages from patients under 35 in group II compared to group I (36,5% vs. 63,1%). In miscarriages from patients over 35 the frequency of abnormal karyotypes was higher compared to normal in both groups: 76,7% vs. 23,3% in group I and 65,5% vs. 34,5% in group II). This tendency was registered when the terms of miscarriages were analyzed: in miscarriages under 7 weeks of gestation from group II the frequency of chromosomal pathology was lower, than in their counterparts from group I (45,6% vs. 66,2%). In miscarriages over 7 weeks from group II the frequency of abnormal karyo types increased up to 57,7%.

In this study we prospectively screened 150 patients with DD/ID with or without dismorphic features or additional congenital abnormalities using SALSA MLPA P036, SALSA MLPA P070 and SALSA MLPA P245 kits, which are specifically designed to detect subtelomeric chromosome imbalances and 21 microdeletion syndromes respectively. The aim of the study was to determine the ability to detect chromosomal abnormalities in patients with DD/ID using a combination of MLPA kits and to analyze the feasibility of the use of additional MLPA specific telomere and microdeletion probe mix as an additional confirmatory test. The MLPA screening revealed chromo some aberrations in 21 (14%) cases: 11 subtelomeric rearrangements (3 deletions: del4p, del15q and del22q, 4 duplications: dup 9p, dupX/Yp, 3 deletions and duplications: dup3p/del8q, dup8p/del18q, del 12p/dup22q and one del/dup19p) and 10 microdeletions (5 DiGeorge syndrome, two 17q21.31 microdeletions, one 15q24 microdeletion and one Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome).

Markova; Federal State Budgetary Institution âResearch Centre for Medical Geneticsâ of RAMS, Moscow, Russian Federation. GTG banded karyotyping provides gold standard in clinical cytogenetics which is widely used in medical genetic consultations, despite of develop ment and adoption of up to date molecular methods. However, GTG method often is limited in sensitivity. Accuracy of cytogenetic diagnostics of chro mosomal rearrangements increases with using FISH, which is an excellent approach to this aim. We used FISH method with different DNA probes and have developed the algorithm of investigations. We analyzed the karyoty pes of 31 patients with dysmorphic features and congenital malformations. When the analysis of GTG karyotypes at level 550 bands revealed presence of chromosomal structural rearrangements (deletions or duplications), we investigated parentsâ karyotypes to establish the origin of aberrations. In 27 cases these aberrations arised de novo, and in other cases were non balan ced variants of parentsâ translocations. For identification of chromosomal rearrangements we used FISH with different DNA probes: WCP , PCP , CEP , subtelomeric probes, LSI, and also multicolor technologies mFISH, mBAND, m cenFISH. In cases of deletions we used appropriate chromosome specific subtelomeric probes. In cases of additional material of unknown origin we used mFISH, subtelomeric probes then mBAND. When derivate chromoso mes were revealed chromosome specific CEP and then mFISH was used. In cases sex chromosome abnormalities we used PCP X long and shot and LSI SRY. In cases supernumerary chromosomal rearrangements m cenFISH, WCP , then subtelomeric probes. In result of the application of listed FISH probes the patientsâ karyotypes were verified and breakpoints were estima ted. The FISH tests developed algorithm utilization allows to determine the origin of rearrangements and to reduce research time and costs.

We report here an 11 year old autistic girl showing clinical features consistent with the syndrome. Conventional cytogenetic analysis of the patient showed a normal female karyotype.

He has thin,  fine hair and a preauricular tag, but otherwise no dysmorphic features. Ma   gnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the brain revealed a subarachnoidal cyst.  A de novo 3.8 Mb duplication involving chromosome 14q22.3q23.1 was de   tected by aCGH analysis (chr14:55331483 59107556 bp, hg19). There are no previous reports of patients carrying a duplication of similar size in this region, which in addition to the relatively high number of genes involved make genotype phenotype correlations challenging. Among the 32 RefSeq genes affected by the duplication, genes of potential interest are OTX2, ARI  D4A, GCH1 and DACT . OTX2, orthodonticle homeobox 2, is a homeodomain  containing transcription factor expressed in brain, whose haploinsufficiency is linked to ocular developmental anomalies and developmental delay. ARI  D4A, AT rich interactive domain 4A, is a gene involved in chromatin remo  deling, therefore likely to have pleiotropic effect. GCH1, GTP cyclohydrolase 1, partially duplicated at the proximal border of the imbalance, causes dopa responsive dystonia and malignant hyperphenylalaninemia with autosomal recessive inheritance, although the patientâs phenotype is not consistent with this syndrome. DACT , dapper, antagonist of beta catenin, homolog 1,  partially duplicated at the distal border, is involved in the Wnt  mediated developmental processes.We suggest that increased dosage of OTX2 and ARID4A might have a rele  vant role in the emergency of the clinical phenotype in our patient.",2012

There were no other findings on SNP array to suggest different reasons for the girlâs symptoms. SNP arrays on both parents were also performed. The mother had a duplication (Xp22.11 Xp22.2) matching the duplication and LOH segment in the girl. The father had no deletions or duplications. G band karyotypes from the girl showed visible aberrations in both X chromosomes; one with a duplication in Xp and one with a deletion in Xp (46,XX,dup(X)(p22.1p22.2)mat,del(X)(p21p22.2)dn)Results of additional FISH analyses, using probes corresponding to the du plicated segment Xp22.2, the segment containing LOH (Xp22.11 Xp22.2) and the deleted segment (Xp21.1 Xp22.11), showed that the paternally deri   ved X chromosome did not harbour any of these three segments, suggesting that the unbalanced complex duplication/LOH was a result of inheritance of two derivative X chromosomes. A maternal derivative X chromosome with a duplication segment corresponding to the LOH region combined with insertion of the paternal duplication segment and a derivative paternal X chromosome with a deleted segment encompassing all three regions.We speculate that the reason for this complex rearrangement could be a post zygotic mitotic recombination, perhaps caused by an inverted duplica   tion on the maternal X chromosome, although this could not be verified.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012125 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

Background: Two syndromes, each characterized by a distinct cluster of  clinical features, segregated in 11 individuals from one kindred. All affec ted children were the products of non consanguineous matings. However, all affected individuals shared a common progenitor. The diagnosis of un balanced chromosomal abnormalities was sought. Yet, cytogenetic studies were reported to be normal. Molecular cytogenetics tools were undertaken to further investigate this prototype of abnormalities. Methods: Following signed informed consent (parental), blood samples were drawn, for DNA extraction, from all available patients (n,10) and parents (n,6), pertaining to three nuclear families, from one kindred. Clini cal, neurological and developmental assessments were undertaken in selec ted patients and two distinct phenotypes, A and B were deliniated, marked by mental retadation, either moderate or severe, respectively, and salient dysmorphic features associated with early scenescence (phenotype B). Whole genome SNP array analysis using the âHumanCytoSNP 12v2.1 DNA Analysis BeadChip Kit (Illumina)â was undertaken on two affected individu als demonstrating distinct phenotypes.Results: Whole genome SNP array analysis identified an unbalanced cryptic  translocation involving a terminal 5 Mb deletion (100273988 106353482) of 14q32.2 14Q32.3 and a terminal 5 Mb duplication (125708 5329074) of 10p15.3  10P15.1 in patient with phenotype A.

The number of reported  deletions is much higher than the number of duplications, which likely re  flects both ascertainment bias and limitations of available diagnostic me thods. Duplications may result in milder phenotypes, or certain characteri   stic features that are different to those of the corresponding deletions, and consequently, patients may not present for clinical evaluation.

From 60 to 90% cases of RTT usually demonstrate point or frameshift muta   tions of MECP2. In the remainder, the cause of the disease is usually uniden tified. Occasionally reported cases of Xq28 deletions encompassing MECP2 suggest that at least a small proportion of MECP2 mutation negative RTT cases might result from submicroscopic subtelomeric Xq losses. Using ar ray comparative genome hybridization (array CGH) with a higher coverage of chromosome X, we have tested whether submicroscopic Xq28 deletions (encompassing MECP2) contribute to the etiology of RTT in âMECP2 mu tation negativeâ cases. We have found that 4 girls among 28 RTT females without MECP2 mutations (addressed by direct sequencing) exhibited sub microscopic Xq28 deletions. The size of the deletions was estimated to be approximately 603kb. It is noteworthy that all the deletion cases demon   strated almost exactly the same breakpoints located at 153.25 and 153.86 Mb of chromosome X according to NCBI Build 37.3. Clinical manifestations in these cases resembled to classical RTT with additional clinical manifesta tions such as atypical facial dysmorphisms, congenital heart malformation, intrauterine growth retardation, congenital eye malformations probably due to losses of other genes located at Xq28. Two deletion cases were as sociated with late onset regression (at 24 and 38 months). Our data indi   cate that about 14% of MECP2 mutation negative RTT cases can arise from submicroscopic Xq28 deletions.

A genetic imbalance induced by the presence of a sSMC (Small Supernumera  ry Marker Chromosomes)  is the major reason for clinical symptoms in sSMC  carriers, although the 44% of prenatally ascertained cases with sSMC are familial cases without clinical effect. Nevertheless, the risk of an abnormal phenotype associated with a de novo sSMC is 7% 28%. sSMCs cannot be easily characterized by conventional cytogenetic banding techniques generating a lot of diagnostic problems, nevertheless, the recent application of new molecular techniques have resolved the limitations of those techniques and therefore increased the right prognosis for all pati   ents.Here we report a 2 months old girl who showed at birth a weight of 2050 gr p(<3), an OFC of 32cm p(<3), and a length of 43,5 cm p(<3), together  with hypotonia. She was the second child of a healthy couple with a previous  healthy child and 3 previous miscarriages. Her evolution at home was with no gain weight and after 2 months, an intrathoracic stomach with duodenal  bulb infradiaphragmatic, a light colpocephaly and corpus callosum hypopla   sia were diagnosed. After surgery she is having good evolution, getting oral  alimentation and at 4 months old she weights 4110 gr. She had a normal prenatally karyotype: 46,XX but a postnatal karyotype showed a âde novoâ small marker in all cells: 46, XX + mar.

Introduction: Gonadal dysgenesis are characterized by absence or under   development of the gonads which produce sterility (infertility) and sexual characteristics remain underdeveloped. They are caused by numerical and structural abnormalities of the sex chromosomes.Material and methods: Our group is formed by 23 patients with structu ral abnormalities of the sex chromosomes diagnosed in Medical Genetics Center Iasi, Romania, between January 2001 December 2010 from a num ber of 2362 karyotypes. Chromosomal analysis was done using cultures of lymphocytes and GTG bands. In selected cases we used fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) postnatal and in one case antenatal FISH discover the abnormality.Results: There were 20 cases with X chromosome structural abnormalities and just 3 of the Y chromosome, in all cells or in mosaic form. For X chromo some, the abnormalities were: isochromosome (12 cases of q arm isochro mosome), ring (5 cases) and deletions (2 for p arm and 1 for q arm). For Y chromosome there were three abnormalities: dicentric, ring and marker chromosome.Conclusions: Structural abnormalities of X and Y chromosome are less com mon than aneuploidy in gonadal dysgenesis and the most frequent clinical picture for female gonadal dysgenesis is Turner syndrome. The karyotype and FISH are useful for cytogenetic characterization of these abnormalities.",2012
 Subtelomere deletion and additional chromosomal segments in mental retardation,P03.126,"A. M. Mohamed1,2, A. K. Kamel1, M. O. El Ruby1, I. H. Mazen1, H. A. Hussein1","1National Research cetre, Cairo, Egypt, 2National Research Centre, Cairo, Egypt","The prevalence of mental retardation is estimated to be 1 to 3% of the gene ral population. Mental retardation has many etiologies which can be broadly classified into genetic and environmental causes. The condition is common and the cause of MR is still largely unknown in 30 50% of cases.We reported on three female cases with mental retardation and multiple congenital anomalies and have additional (add) chromosomal segments. The  parents of the three cases have normal karyotype. Karyotype in the 1st case  was 46,X,add(X)(q), the second 46,XX,dd(2)(q), the third case 46,XX,add(21)(q). Using the total subtelomere (Vysis), case 1 has an additional segmene of chromosome 7(q31 36) and deletion of chromosome Xq subtelomere. Case  2 has additional segment of chromosome 15(q25 26) and del of chromoso   me 2q subtelomere. Case 3 has additional segment of chromosome 17q(22  25) and deletion of 21 subtelomere. Deletion of the subtelomere may be  the underlying mechanism of these abnormalities. The FISH technique can  identify to a certain limits the sites and extent of deletion and duplication. We recommend array CGH to detect the exact copy number of deletion and  duplication and this can explain the relation of genotype/phenotype.",2012
 Molecular screening for subtelomeric aberrations in Thai patients with idiopathic mental retardation and autism by multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA),P03.127,"S. Rujirabanjerd, O. Plong on, T . Sripo, P . Limprasert","Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, Hat Yai, Songkhla, Thailand","Chromosomal rearrangements involving telomeres have been identified to account for approximately 5 10% causes of mental retardation (MR). This  finding leads to the suggestion that all cases of undiagnosed MR should be  screened for subtelomeric aberration. Nevertheless, resolution of standard karyotyping using G banding is limited and cannot detect this anomaly.  Therefore, in this study, multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) technique, was used to screen 129 patients with idiopathic MR.  Twelve of them were also diagnosed with autistic disorder. We identified 5 patients (3.87%) with subtelomeric aberration. All have MR with normal ka ryotypes. One patient has a submicroscopic deletion at 1p36.33 which was  confirmed by real time PCR. There are two patients with subtelomeric du  plication at 15q11.2 and 11p15.5 subsequently. Two patients have the same  duplication at Xp22.33. Results were confirmed by using additional MLPA probes. Parental samples were also examined when available. Interestingly the deletion at 1p36.33 and duplication at Xp22.33 fall into the regions whe  re copy number variation (CNV) have been reported. However the patholo   gic effect of these aberrations is still inconclusive. Further characterization  of these aberration boundaries and screening in normal population should be performed. Nonetheless this study shows that MLPA technique is able to detect subtelomeric aberration in patients with idiopathic MR and may  increase diagnostic yield especially where array facility is unavailable.",2012

Hence chromosome analysis may not be thought of. Cases are most easily ascertained through chromosome and fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) studies.Method: A three year old girl from a bilingual family was investigated. She  had hypotonia, a modest speech delay and unsteady gait due to a foot defor   mity. Different genetic methods such as chromosomal analysis, FISH, Mul   tiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA), array comparative genomic hybridization (ACGH) and single nucleotide polymorphism array (SNP array) were used to elucidate her phenotype.Results: The results will be presented at the meeting.

 Increased risk of trisomy 21 (T21) in offspring of carriers of balanced non contributing autosomal rearrangement (Rea) is not accounted for by interchromosomal effect (ICE). A post fertilization effect of paternal Rea on segregation of maternal chromosomes is suspected,P03.133,N. V. Kovaleva,St,"Petersburg State Pediatric Medical Academy, St. Petersburg, Russian Federation. Recent studies showed that chromosomal rearrangement could affect the behavior at meiosis of other chromosomes (interchromosomal effect). If ICE makes any appreciable contribution to etiology of aneuploidy, one may expect an incidence of balanced Rea in parents of aneuploid offspring is in creased over population figure.Objectives: Meta analysis of own and published data on incidence of autoso   mal balanced Rea in patients with T21, in parents of offspring with T21, and in newborn controls. Meta analysis of own and published data on parental and cell origin of T21 in offspring of carriers of autosomal balanced Rea.Results: An increase in incidence of reciprocal translocations and inversions  (but not of robertsonian translocations) in parents of offspring with T21 (7.1â° and 2.7â°) compared to controls (1.5â° and 0.4 â°), p<0.001 and p<0.01, correspondingly. Absence of typical female predominance among carrier parents (12 females/13 males) and a predominance of paternally derived Rea in patients with T21 (5 maternal/9 paternal). Similar propor   tion of T21 of maternal origin in the affected progeny of both maternal and paternal Rea carriers. However when the Rea was maternal, a typical preva lence of errors in the 1st meiotic division of oogenesis was observed while in cases where the Rea was paternal, the profile of errors in oogenesis was different, with a high proportion of errors in 2 nd meiotic division. Conclusion:  We did not find evidence of paternal ICE.

Fifty seven percent of the motherÂ´s blood cells manifested the de   letion, revealing a mosaic state. aCGH and SNP array analysis provided no calls for mosaicism.CONCLUSIONS:We have reported three patients with 20p12.3 microdeletion, without com  plete penetrance for WPW syndrome and cognitive impairment. Mosaicism  might escape detection by array based karyotyping techniques. This un  derscores the importance of employing FISH analysis whenever mosaicism is suspected.",2012

We describe our experience with female carriers of Xp deletions. Method: Families of female Xp deletion carriers were assessed. Family hi  story was obtained and clinical evaluation of family members was prefor   med. Karyotype was analyzed for available family members, as well as in the setting of prenatal diagnosis. Assessment of the X inactivation pattern was evaluated when possibleResults: Three families were assessed. Family 1 consisted of multiple fema  le carriers of an Xp22.1 deletion. All had short stature and some had addi   tional problems such as delayed motor & speech development, emotional oversensitivity, excessive weight gain and attention deficit disorder. Prena  tal diagnosis was declined. CMA analysis is pending Family 2 was ascertai  ned during pregnancy with a complex fetal heart malformation. The female  fetus had a terminal deletion at Xp22. The pregnancy was terminated. Both mother and maternal grandmother, who had short stature, had the same deletion, as well as 2 female fetuses in subsequent pregnancies. All had a skewed X inactivation pattern. Family 3 presented in pregnancy with fetal  short femurs at 22 weeks. Fetal karyotype showed a maternally inherited terminal deletion at Xp21.3.

In a subset of patients ovotesticular DSD is caused by 46,XX/46,XY chimerism or mosaicism. To date only few monogenetic causes are known to be associated with XX and XY ovotesticular DSD like mutations in RSPO1, SRY and SOX9.We performed high resolution array CGH (comparative genomic hybridiza   tion) in a female patient with 46,XY ovotesticular DSD with testicular tissue at the one side and an ovary harbouring germ cells on the other. We iden   tified in the patient a small deletion affecting exons 3 and 4 of the DMRT1  gene. Results obtained by array CGH were confirmed by RT qPCR (quanta   tive PCR).To this point of time, deletions and missense mutations of DMRT1 are asso   ciated only with XY gonadal dysgenesis. But according our present findings we conclude that haploinsufficiency of DMRT1 can cause both, XY gonadal  dysgenesis and XY ovotesticular DSD.

Clinical background are the low pregnancy and baby take home rates after in vitro fertilisation techniques (IVF). Major reason is the high frequency  of chromosomally abnormal (i.e. aneuploid) oocytes. Selection of euploid  oocytes is thus an attractive strategy to increase the number of live births following IVF. The ploidy status of oocytes can be indirectly investigated by analysing the  chromosome content in polar bodies (PB) I and II which are results of the first and second meiotic division before and after fertilisation; errors in meiotic divisions are due to chromosome non disjunction and early sister  chromatid separation. Therefore investigation of the chromosome content  of PB I and II requires techniques which allow investigation of all chromoso   mes at the resolution of chromatids. In contrast to microarray formats we count chromatids directly   molecular  copy number counting (MCC) applied to a single cell, i.e. polar body. MCC is based on limiting dilution of the DNA to a concentration of less than one  molecule per PCR reaction and digital PCR. The number of chromatids per  chromosome is analysed by counting the numbers of positive PCR reactions representing target sequences on all chromosomes. To investigate all chro mosomes with several markers we run a multiplex PCR followed by single marker PCRs with the BioMark system from Fluidigm.This method is simple and applicable to monitor not only meiotic but also mitotic cell divisions, copy number changes in general and to establish ha plotypes for regions of interest in any given single cell.",2012

Spontaneous abortion (SA) is the most common pathology in obstetrics  with incidence of 10 15% among clinically recognized pregnancies. The oc  currence in three or more consecutive pregnancies is defined as recurrent  SA with incidence of 0.5 3% in women trying to conceive. The etiology is di verse and multifactorial (uterine abnormalities, autoimmune, infectious, en  docrine, and genetic factors) but still the major part of it (50 60%) remains  idiopathic. The male factor has been poorly evaluated in SA. The aim of this study was to determine the association of Y chromosome AZF deletions/duplications with spontaneous pregnancy loss. One hundred and seven men  from couples experiencing two or more SA, and 116 fertile men were en  rolled in this study. DNA extracted from whole blood was tested for presence of sex chromosome aneuploidies, AZF deletions, partial AZFc deletions and  duplications using 13 plex quantitative fluorescent PCR and subsequent ca  pillary electrophoresis on ABI 3130 Genetyc Analyzer. In total, three partial AZFc deletions (1 gr/gr and 2 b2/b3) and 21 AZFc duplications (12 b2/b4  and 9 b2/b3) were detected. Partial AZFc deletions were slightly more fre  quent among men with SA (1.87%) in comparison to controls (0.86%), while the AZFc partial duplications were more frequent among controls (12.07%) than in men with SA (6.54%). None of the men with SA and controls had any  sex chromosome aneuploidy or complete AZF deletions.

Variation in length of heterochro  matin regions, stalks, satellites are described as phenomena without phe  notypic effects, but relationships between chromosome polymorphism and reproduction are under investigation. We present the data of chromosome heteromorphism variants (ChrHV) de   tected in couples, referred to ART . Among 2148 patients, examined by standard karyotyping during 2010 2011 years, ChrHV were revealed in 460 cases (22%, sex ratio 1:1).

There is a large population of children conceived via Assisted Reproductive Technology (ART), which continues to increase worldwide, without a clear understanding of associated long term outcomes. There is growing evidence that ART children seems to be different from naturally conceived children. For routing throughthese differences, we evaluated cytogenetic results occurring in children born after ART , using their cord blood lymphocytes.We investigated the ka ryotypes of 110 samples From January 2010 till January 2012, using stan dard GTG banding. 5 (4.5%) chromosomal alterations were detected among these children. 3(2.72%) of theseaberrations were diagnosed in one of the parents, and 2(1.81%) were de novo changes. In comparison with the frequency of these abnormalities in newborns of general population (0.5% 1%), our results shows a slightly higher incidence of chromosomal changes among children born after ART . There is no much higher riskof chromosomal abnormalities due to ART . Therefore, these alterations could be correlated with the underlying parentalrisk of abnormalities and not with the ART procedure itself. Although ART is now accepted as the treatment of choice for severe infertilities, concerns about its safety and the potential risks for the offspring remain.",2012

Several genes are connected with the disorder, but in ~70% of the cases the genetic cause remains unresolved. Sema3a and Sema7a mutant mice have a reduced number of GnRH neurons  in their brains, Sema3a being essential for the patterning of vomeronasal  axons while in Sema7a mutants the olfactory system remains unaffected.

In the final step of mentioned process, this integral membrane enzyme catalyzes the removal of 19 methyl group of the A ring of androgens in an irreversible manner, resulting in conversion of androgen to estrogen which  named aromatization. In human, aromatase gene is expressed in a tissue  specific manner, in the way that expression of Cyp19A1  has been reported in  organs such as gonads, brain, skin, placenta and adipose.Embryonal carcinoma (EC) cells derived from testicular tumors are valuable tools for investigating embryogenesis and developmental biology processes.

Dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) is a folate enzyme which reduces dihydro folate into tetrahydrofolate in the presence of NADPH. DHFR was previously  thought to be the only enzyme capable of this reaction however we show  that humans have a second dihydrofolate reductase enzyme encoded by the former pseudogene DHFRL1 (dihydrofolate reductase like   1), located  on chromosome 3.We demonstrate that the DHFRL1 gene is expressed and  shares some commonalities with DHFR. Recombinant DHFRL1 can comple ment a DHFR negative phenotype in both bacterial and mammalian cells. Enzyme kinetics shows that the Km for NADPH is similar for both enzymes  but DHFRL1 has a higher Km for dihydrofolate when compared to DHFR,  indicating a lower affinity for the substrate. Localization of DHFRL1, visua lized using confocal microscopy, shows that DHFRL1 has a strong presence  in the mitochondria, where it is proposed by Anderson et al (2011) to par  ticipate in de novo thymidylate synthesis to support mitochondrial DNA re plication. We also found that DHFRL1 has the ability to bind its own mRNA  in the same translational auto regulation method as DHFR; with both enzy   mes capable of replacing each other. Methotrexate (MTX), a potent inhibitor  of DHFR, is known to disrupt this regulation mechanism. We demonstrate that DHFRL1, which has a lower binding affinity for MTX, requires a high  er concentration of the drug to disrupt the protein: RNA binding complex.  The identification of a second dihydrofolate reductase enzyme encoded by a previously unrecognised retrogene will have a major impact on previous research surrounding DHFR.",2012
 Maternal stress factors associated with Down syndrome birth,P04.14,"S. K. Dey, S. Ghosh","West Bengal University of Technology, Kolkata, India","Down syndrome due to trisomy 21 is the most common human chromo somal abnormality. In order to gain insight into maternal stress factors responsible for nondisjunction, we genotyped 12 microsatellite markers spanning along 21q from centromere to telomere in 138 individuals with free trisomy 21 and in their parents and analyzed the association among re duced recombination, maternal age and nondisjunction. The approach was informative for 119 families in determining parental origin with 89.91% being maternal and 10.09% is paternal. The distribution of nondisjunction in maternal meiotic I and meiotic II stages were 81.19% and 19.81% respec   tively. The mean maternal age of nondisjunction in our Indian population is 27.58Â±6.4 years which is significantly lower than that of Caucasians. We created a genetic map of long arm (21q) in maternal meiosis I nondisjoined chromosome 21. The distribution of chiasma shows a difference throughout the length of 21q with more recombination towards telomeric end in com parison to control data. The telomeric exchange is found to be a significant risk factor for meiotic I nondisjunction, irrespective of the age of the mother. An increase in both zero  and one exchange events in younger mother (< 29) suggests reduction of recombination. The linkage map of 21q (39.58cM) was significantly shorter than the control female linkage map, indicating an overall reduction of recombination.

Polymorphisms of genes that encode Glutathione S trans  ferases (GSTs), a group of phase II enzymes that detoxify endogenous and  exogenous electrophiles, can affect the biotransformation of toxic com  pounds to which the male productive system is exposed. Some reports at   tested the association of GSTs gene polymorphisms with male infertility. In  order to investigate whether there is an impact of genetic variations of GSTs  on semen quality and male fertility, we studied three genetic polymorphis   ms in GSTT1, GSTM1 and GSTP1 in infertile men and controls from Tunisia. Methods: Participantâs were 159 men with idiopathic infertility and 102 fer   tile men. Basic semen analysis was performed including total sperm count and concentration, motility and morphology. Genotyping of GSTM1 and GSTT1 polymorphisms were performed using the multiplex PCR. The GSTP1 Ile 105 Val polymorphism was determined using PCR RFLP .Results: GSTM1 null genotype (GSTM1 0/0) was significantly associated with reduced sperm count in infertile men semen (oligozoospermia) (P,.001) and GSTT1 null genotype (GSTT1 0/0) was significantly associated with low sperm motility (P,.001). However, infertile men had a higher pre valence of the wide type of GSTP1 allele (GSTP1 Ile 105) than the fertile group (80.5% and 72.54%, respectively; P,.034) and the presence of the homozygote mutant genotype (GSTP1 Val/Val) was less common in infertile men than in fertile group.Conclusion. Our results suggest that both GSTM1 and GSTT1 gene polymor   phisms have a negative impact on semen quality and are associated with male infertility in Tunisia.",2012

Introduction : PGD is widely used for cancer predisposition mutations with  variable penetrance and additional late onset diseases. The number of fami lies affected by these conditions that opt for PGD increases continuously as molecular techniques are advancing. Nonetheless, the indication for PGD in these cases keeps raising ethical issues.Aim: to summarize our experience in PGD for couples affected with late on set diseases following the evaluation of each case by a quantitative Scoring System (SS).Methods : PGD was performed by embryo biopsy, followed by single cell  multiplex nested PCR for the familial predisposition mutation and for 4 8 flanking polymorphic markers. The devised SS considers disease characte ristics (onset, severity, penetrance, inheritance pattern) and patient clinical variables (carrier status, infertility, objection to terminate pregnancy, addi   tional genetic syndrome) resulting in an absolute numeric value for every patient.Results : the evaluation of 31 couples by the SS showed that some conditions  such as FAP or Huntington definitely justify PGD while others like BRCA or HNPCC require the contribution of patient variables in order to justify inclu   sion into PGD program. Seven healthy pregnancies were achieved.Conclusion : the employment of a SS that takes into account the disease cha  racteristics as well as the patientsâ clinical variables allows for the objective determination wherein PGD is justified. We envision that the continuous discovery of cancer predisposition and late onset mutations will highlight PGD as the most appropriate reproductive option for preventing the perpe   tuation of severe inherited predisposition in families with several affected or deceased members.",2012

Therefore, we looked for the presence of copy number variations (CNVs) in 9 infertile men with a matura tion arrest of spermatogenesis and in 20 control males with normal sperm parameters. After several elimination steps, 7 regions remained. These re gions, including four deletions and three duplications, were further investi gated by qPCR in patients and in a large number of controls. The 4 deletions were present in heterozygous form and contained the SLC25A24, FAM82A1, C17ORF51 and SIRT4 genes. By sequencing no mutations were detected in the non deleted copies of these genes. The three duplications involved the genes THRAP3+C1ORF113, SYT6 and PLSCR2. Due to their known function the genes SYT6, PLSCR2 and SIRT4 have a potential role in male infertility but are presumably not involved in maturation arrest at the spermatocyte stage. SLC25A24 has two transcript variants of which only variant 2 is testis specific. Besides multiple heterozygous deletions of the start codon region, we detected one patient with a maturation arrest of spermatogenesis (not  tested by array CGH) who was having a homozygous deletion of this region.  More patients and controls are being investigated. In addition, immunohi stochemistry is performed to determine the localization of the SLC25A24  proteins in testicular tissues.

Notably, one differently methylated CpG site, which was located in the S shore region of PIWIL2 showed a significantly lower methylation level in patients as compared to controls (p<0.01). Remarkably, DNA methylation at this site showed a bimodal distribution with very low levels in a subgroup of 8 patients (mean methylation , 37.8% vs. 83.7% in controls).

In 60 80% of cases they are caused by chromosomal changes in  the embryo/fetus. The present study displays frequency and spectrum of chromosomal abnormalities in embryos derived from missed and sponta  neous abortions in the western regions of Ukraine. Methods: The study population consisted of 102 embryo tissues from wo men with the final diagnosis of missed (99 cases) or spontaneous (3) abor tions. Cytogenetic analysis was performed in the uncultured chorionic villi  samples, using standard G banding. Results: Karyotype results were obtained in 50 of 102 cases (49%), one of them from spontaneous abortion. Among the abortions the gonosomal constitution of XY prevailed (n , 36), followed by XX (n,14). Chromosomal abnormalities were found in 25 cases (50%): autosomal trisomies in 9 ca ses (36%), gonosomal trisomies 47,XXY in 2 cases (8%) and triploidy in 14 cases (56%) (9 XXY : 5 XXX).

Oliver Bonet","Hospital Universitari Son Espases, Palma, Spain","In the last seven years genetics and molecular biology have begun to uncover  the role of PRDM9 in mammalian meiosis as a major determinant of meio   tic recombination hotspots. PRDM9 contains an N terminal KRAB domain, a central SET domain and a C terminal tandem repeat zinc finger array. It is known that the zinc finger array serves for binding to the DNA and mar  king the hotspots and that the H3K4 trimethylase activity of the SET domain  could be responsible for activating these hotspots by chromatin remodeling. The zinc finger array is coded by a variable microsatellite (differences in nucleotides and number of microsatellites). Due to its role in homologous recombination, mutations/variations in  PRDM9 might be associated with different pathologies of meiotic origin. Mutations in any of its domains could be the cause of some cases of infer   tility. Moreover, according to several authors, variation within the PRDM9 zinc finger domain might be involved in the mechanisms responsible for de novo genomic disorders that result from unequal meiotic exchanges at mi nisatellites.Therefore, the PRDM9 gene has been sequenced in 3 distinct groups (controls,83, infertile,14, transmitting parents of de novo rearrangements,20) in order to analyze the presence of mutations/variati ons associated with infertility and the origin of de novo genomic disorders. Preliminary results show the presence of SNPs and uncommon variants of the zinc finger array in all groups. However, this presence has not been as sociated with any statistical significance.Further studies including a bigger number of analyzed samples will contri bute to determine the role of PRDM9 in pathologies of meiotic origin.",2012

Patients were subdivided in three groups: normozoospermia, moderate necrozoospermia and severe necrozoospermia. DNA fragmentation was detected by TUNEL assay, approximately 500 cells were counted, and DNA fragmented index (DFI) was calculated. Results: The DFI was 9.28 Â± 2.98 % in patients with normal level of dead spermatozoa, 20.25 Â± 3.21 % in patients with moderate necrozoospermia, and 35.31 Â± 5.25 % in patients with severe necrozoospermia.

The gene SLC6A14, encoding for amino acid transporter related to appetite  control has been found to be in association with X linked obesity. The re  sults of several studies point to an increased likelihood of abnormal semen  parameters among overweight men. Possible association of three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC6A14 gene and male infertility  was the subject of our study. We have analyzed 123 infertile males of diffe  rent ethnic origin (83 Macedonian, 30 Albanian, 10 of other origin) which have previously been diagnosed either with idiopathic azoospermia (50) or oligozoospermia (73) in comparison to 127 fertile men (98 Macedonians  and 29 Albanians) as controls. The methodology included multiplex PCR fol  lowed by single nucleotide extension reaction and capillary electrophoresis on ABI 3130 Genetic Analyzer for detection of SLC6A14 303 A/T (SNP1),  20649 C/T (SNP2) and 22510 C/G (SNP3).

Introduction: pregnancy is the process from the fertilized ovum to the fetus  with capability of extra uterine survival. Pregnancy loss is the most common complication of pregnancies. About 1 in 300 couples and 0.5 2% of women are involved in repeated pregnancy loss (RPL). Various etiological factors involve in RPL and the main part of them remains unknown. Among them the thrombophilic factors are important.Material and methods: Genetic counseling program was done for 158 coup les suffering from RPL. Three molecular genetic variations were investiga ted in main thrombophilic agents: G20210A in factor II, G1691A in factor V and C677T in MTHFR gene. The method was PCR RFLP .Results: No G20210A mutation was found in Factor II gene. Heterozygote G1691 mutation in factor V gene was found in 3 women (1.94%). But, C677T polymorphism in MTHFR gene was found in 33 women (21.3%). Among them, 4 cases (12.12%) were homozygote and 29 cases (87.88%) were he terozygote.Discussion: Assessment of variations in thrombophilic related genes can be useful in etiologic evaluation and planning of effective treatment in RPL women. Genetic counseling, clinical aspect of abortions and genotype phe notype correlation should be considered for request of molecular thrombo philic tests in RPL.",2012

The method used to assess sperm DNA fragmentation was the terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase mediated dUTP nick end labeling (TUNEL) assay.DNA fragmentation frequency in sperm from donors was 0,26Â±0,09%, whereas that from translocation carriers was 0,91Â±0,53%. Significantly increased rate was seen among oligoasthenoteratoozoospermia patients: 46,XY,der(13;14)(q10;q10) and 46,XY,t(2;3)(q33;q29) (1,4% and 1,35%, re spectively). Sperm DNA fragmentation rate in 46,XY,t(6;19)(p22;q12) and46,XY,t(1;5)(p22;q32),t(6;12)(q15;q21) teratozoospermic patients in both www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012143 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters cases was 0,45%. In the present study, the DNA fragmentation rates were  significantly different between the carriers of a chromosomal structural ab   normality with abnormal and normal spermogram (p,0,0007). Therefore, the present results suggest that the DNA fragmentation rate may depend not only of the presence of a structural abnormality but also on the spermogram  parameters. In conclusion, the infertility of men carrying a chromosomal structural ab   normality could be explained by the poor quality semen, and/or the eleva ted rate of DNA fragmentation.

There has   Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org144 ESHG Posters www.eshg.orgbeen an increasing trend among women to delay childbearing, a characteri   stic in the most countries, including Croatia. The reason is associated with  the increasing number of women wanting to receive higher education and to  achieve financial independence.During the last two decades the average age of mothers at birth of their child  in Croatia increased by 3.3 years. Our results show that the average age of  pregnant women who undergo amniocentesis follows the increasing trend of maternal age by four years, from 33 to 37 years of age. At the same time, the percentage of pregnant women with the single indication for the amnio  centesis of advanced maternal age (AMA) is slightly decreased, while those  with pathological ultrasound and/or biochemical screening increased. Alt   hough the majority of pregnant women who performed amniocentesis were  aged 35 years or older, during the 15 year period, the proportion of women  under 35 increased from 17.5% to 23%.These results are evidence of an increased access to prenatal diagnosis of  younger women in Croatia at increased risk for fetal chromosomal aberra  tion.

Sinclair Bourque1","1CHEO, Ottawa, ON, Canada, 2University of Ottawa, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Chromosome analysis has been gold standard for prenatal detection of an euploidies for decades. To supplement this procedure many diagnostic labs have introduced QF PCR as a rapid aneuploidy screen for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X or Y. There is also an increasing use of microarray testing for more complex prenatal cases with ultrasound abnormalities. In Sept 2011, the So ciety of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists of Canada (SOGC) and the Canadi an College of Medical Geneticists (CCMG) published a joint clinical practice guideline that supports replacement of conventional karyotyping with QF PCR whenever prenatal testing is performed solely because of an increased risk of aneuploidy for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X or Y. Implementing this major change in analysis criteria at the same time as increased availability of prenatal microarray brings its own set of challenges: it is highly desirable to maintain a DNA source for all pregnancies with normal QF PCR results to enable possible downstream molecular testing. Retention of a DNA source also facilitates testing should anomalies be detected later in the pregnan cy, necessitating microarray. We have developed an algorithm for prenatal testing of pregnancies at risk for trisomy vs those at risk for other genetic imbalances which allows for the maintenance of a DNA source without ex   tensive culturing. Our approach reduces chromosome analysis of cultured amniocytes by 75% while maintaining clinically appropriate testing. This approach and its implementation are discussed.",2012

To assess the feasibility of offering CMA for prenatal diagnosis as a first line diagnostic test, a large scale prospective study was  performed on a cohort of 2800 consecutive prenatal samples, with parallel  processing for both CMA and conventional cytogenetic analysis.Methods: Women undergoing amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling  (CVS) for standard karyotype were offered CMA. A total of 2800 prenatal  samples were processed in parallel using both CMA and G banding for stan  dard karyotyping.Results: Clinically significant copy number variations (CNVs) were identi  fied in 94(3.4%) samples, 70(74.5%) of which were also detected by con ventional karyotyping. In 24 cases (0.9%), CMA identified pathogenic CNVs that would have remained undiagnosed if only a conventional karyotype  had been performed, 16 of which were concerning well established syndro  mes.

However, many genetic syndromes are often associated with sub microscopic dele tions or duplications. Array CGH is a modern method, which allows detec tion of small variations in the genome. Its application is mainly in postnatal diagnosis, where it helps to clarify diagnosis, prevention and prognosis. In prenatal diagnosis it has limited use. This is mainly because a number of aberrations detected by array CGH have not been described and their cli nical significance is unknown. Due to this fact we use a BAC based array (BlueGnome), which is focused on areas in the genome having demonstrable connection with 110 microdeletion syndromes described in the OMIM da tabase.We used array CGH to detect sub microscopic aberrations in carefully selec ted 67 prenatal cases, which were primarily indicated for conventional cytogenetics based on serious ultrasound findings.

Simultaneous determination of imbalances at high resolution and genome wide heterozygosity state was performed on a targeted CGH+SNP 8x60K microarray (BlueGnome, Cambridge, UK). Results were juxtaposed to those of a second panel displaying aneuploidies. Copy number imbalance and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) findings were compa red to cases reported in the literature to determine their clinical relevance.There was no difference in the type or frequency of microimbalances bet   ween the group of samples with aneuploidies and the group of samples with normal karyotypes. Most small imbalances could be identified as copy number variations, only few unknown variants remained and were equally distributed to cases with and without aneuploidy.

The clusters of mutations of CYP21A2 gene in one chromosome: Q318X+R356W (5%), I172N+Q318X (1%), delA2orLGC+V281L (1%), were found in 7 CAH patients.Furthermore, we identified two additional mutations of CYP21A2 gene in CAH patients. In one patient with salt wasting form (SW) of CAH we found previously described missense mutation R426C in exon 10. The other al   lele carried the I2splice mutation. In another patient with SW we found previously unreported deletion of 3 nucleotides in exon 9 of CYP21A2 gene that led to the deletion of isoleucine in 384 amino acid sequence. The novel mutation delIle384 was identified in heterozygous state with delA2/LGC of CYP21A2 gene.In conclusion, previously described diagnostically significant CYP21A2 gene mutations were present in about 72.3% of unrelated CAH alleles. The new mutation corresponds to 0.5% of mutant alleles in our cohort of 101 pati   ents. The discovery of the novel mutation increases our knowledge of CAH caused by 21 hydroxylase deficiency.",2012

Begovic","Division of Genetics, Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia","Double trisomy is extremely rare in liveborns, but it is a relatively common event in pregnancies ending in early abortions and usually involves at least one nonviable trisomy. Prevalence of double trisomy is higher within first trimester spontaneous abortions (~2%) than within the second trimester pregnancy (~0.01%). Double trisomy is associated with advanced maternal age and mean gestational age has been described to be significantly lower for double trisomy cases than that reported for single trisomy ones.Our results of only two double trisomy cases from samples of amniocentesis, using routine cytogenetic analysis of cultured amniotic fluid cells with GTG banding confirm the fact that double trisomy in second trimester of pregnan cy, also in liveborns, usually involves the sex chromosomes in combination with potentially viable autosomal trisomies such as 21, 18 and 13. Both of them were in mosaic form (48,XXX,+21/46,XX and 48,XXY,+21/47,XY,+21).Double trisomies within first trimester of spontaneous abortions, in regular and mosaic form, were present in 1.86% of cases. These cases were lethal in first trimester of pregnancy due to the presence of nonviable autosomes in double trisomies or combination of autosomal and gonosomal trisomies.Our cases emphasize the importance of genetic counseling to assess the re current risk of double trisomy.",2012
Investigation of MTHFR and MTHFD polymorphisms as maternal risk factors for Down syndrome,P05.20,"L. C. Bohiltea , R. Cretu, D. Neagos","Genetic Department, UMF Carol Davila, Bucharest, Romania","Members of the family of B9 vitamins are commonly known as folates. A number of studies have associated polymorphisms found in genes involved  in folate metabolism to an elevated maternal risk for Down syndrome (DS).  Central role in this process is played byMTHFR, MTR, RFC1 and MTHFD genes. In this study, we evaluated the role of  three common polymorphisms in folatemetabolizing genes as possible risk factors for having a child with DS. The prevalence of these variant genotypes in mothers of DS children (case mo thers) (n,26) was compared with controls (n,46). Investigated polymor   phisms include methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) 677C>T and  1298A>C and methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase (MTHFD) 1958 G>A. Present results indicate that none of the, MTHFD 1958G>A, MTH  FR 677C>T , and MTHFR 1298A>C polymorphisms is an independent risk  factor for a DS offspring at a young maternal age. The combined MTHFR  1298CC/MTHFD 1958GG, MTHFR 1298(AC or CC)/ MTHFD 1958GG, MTH  FR 1298AA/MTHFD 1958GA, MTHFR 1298CC/MTHFD 1958GA and MTHFR  1298CC/MTHFD 1958AA genotypes compared with the MTHFR 1298AA/ MTHFD 1958GG genotype was associated with increased DS risk (with rela ted P values: 0.019, 0.038, 0.046, 0.05 and respectively 0.019).

Introduction: Chromosome euchromatic variants most commonly result from copy number variation (CNV) of gene and pseudogene containing poly   morphic genomic segments that became visible at the cytogenetic level. In trachromosomal rearrangements of the proximal short arm of chromosome 16, leading to 16p+ morphology can raise interpretation problems because both euchromatic variants (16p11.2v) and unbalanced duplications have been described in this region.Case report: An amniocentesis performed at 16  weeks gestation, due to maternal age, revealed a de novo 16p+ chromo   some by GTL banding. C banding and N/DAPI staining were negative. WCP labeled all 16p+ chromosome. MLPA analysis with eleven probes for 16p11  (kit P343) was normal, while, array CGH pointed to a 1.9 MB duplication in  16p11.2. Fetal ultrasound did not show any morphological defects. Postnatal  FISH study with a panel of RP11 BACs confirmed the presence of a duplica   tion involving the CNVs regions of proximal 16p11.2 (euchromatic variant) and no evidence of a duplication in the autism or development delay regi on 16p11.2. Discussion: The occurrence of de novo structural euchromatic  chromosome abnormalities presents a genetic counseling dilemma, parti cularly when ascertained in the prenatal setting, as the prognosis can be more reliably discussed when the chromosome abnormality is transmitted by a phenotypically unaffected parent. Fetal ultrasound, postnatal clinical reports, molecular cytogenetic analyses may all contribute with critical data to the genetic counseling. Professionals involved in prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling should be aware of the euchromatic variant 16p11.2v in order to establish the differential diagnosis and provide parents with proper information.",2012

Prenatal diagnosis is usually performed by collecting fetal samples through amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. However, these invasive proce   dures are associated with some degree of risk to the fetus and/or mother. Therefore, in recent years, considerable effort has been made to develop non invasive prenatal diagnostic procedures. One potential non invasive ap proach involves analysis of cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma or serum. The objective of our study was to investigate the feasibility of using fetal DNA in maternal plasma for prenatal diagnosis.For this experimental study, to develop a nested PCR technique for fetal SRY gene identification using cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma. Peripheral blood samples were obtained from 32 pregnant women at the gestational period from 8 to 13 weeks and cell free DNA was extracted by the phenol/chloroform method from plasma. The nested PCR was carried out to amplify the fragment of SRY gene by two sets of PCR primer pairs. Analysis was then performed on the PCR product.Specifically, the presence of Y  chromosome sequences in maternal blood plasma indicates that the fetus is male, whereas lack of a signal will indicate that the fetus is female.Among the 32 pregnant women bearing male fetuses, SRY sequences were detected in 16 plasma samples after nested PCR amplification, while the 18 women bearing female fetuses had the positive results. The sensitivity were 87.5% (28/32). The nested PCR amplification of SRY sequence is a conveni ent and low cost approach for the noninvasive early prenatal diagnosis of sex linked inheritant.",2012

Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) are structurally ab   normal chromosomes that cannot be identified or characterized unambi   guously by conventional banding techniques alone (Liehr et al. 2004). Fluo rescence in situ hybridization (FISH) with centromeric and subcentromeric probes enables the rapid identification of sSMCs originating from pericen  tromeric regions. We report on a fetus with up to 5 markers of different origin in one cell.  Amniocentesis was undertaken for the reason of advanced maternal age.  Chromosome analysis revealed the occurrence of one to six sSMCs (mean 2.6 per cell) in both independent cultures. Molecular karyotyping using an  SNP Array (Affymetrix) revealed amplification of 6.7 Mb from 4p12 q12  (arr 4p12q12(46.567.172 53.241.307)x3). FISH using a centromeric probe confirmed the homology to chromosome 4 of one of the sSMCs. The largest marker amongst the other sSMCs, probably a ring chromosome, originates  from chromosome 9 and includes mainly the heterochromatic band of the  long arm: min(9)(:p12âq12:). The remaining markers are very small and contain centromeric material from chromosomes 6, 14 and 22 only. Due to  the fact that phenotypic abnormalities have been described in patients with  duplications of the 4p12 region, the couple decided to terminate the preg nancy. The aborted fetus could not be investigated. Chromosome analyses of  the parentsÂ´ lymphocytes were inconspicuous. The maternal origin of markers from the amplified 4p segment and the diffe rent centromeric origin of the sSMCs, point to the possibility that the degra ding second polar body had been incorporated into the zygote.

HNF1B analysis by sequencing showed no mutation but MLPA revealed a heterozygous deletion of the complete gene. For precise characteriza   tion of the extent of the deletion Array CGH analysis was done showing a deletion of at least 1,3 Mb corresponding to the cytogenetic region 17q12 (arr17q12(34437534x2, 34817422 36168104x1, 36473175x2). This contiguous gene deletion syndrome comprises 11 OMIM genes, including HNF1B.Involvement of the HNF1B gene causes cystic renal disease and maturity on set diabetes of the young (Renal cysts and diabetes syndrome, RCAD, OMIM 137920). According to data of the literature and DECIPHER database, pati   ents with microdeletion 17q12 may exhibit cognitive impairment, speech delay, seizures, autism and psychiatric disorders, possibly due to haploin sufficiency of the LHX1 gene. Dysmorphic features are reported to be only mild.The pregnant woman decided to continue pregnancy. Delivery date is in March 2012. The pregnancy outcome will be reported.This case report underlines the importance of Array CGH analysis in the dia gnostic work up of prenatally detected fetal anomalies.",2012

At the 500 600 band level the resolu tion for detection is about 5 Mb. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique can unveil submicroscopic aberrations (<5Mb), which increases the detection rate an additional 4 8% in the etiology of MCA/MR. Molecular techniques can identify abnormalities <5 Mb.The clinical findings of MCA/MR cases can guide the clinician toward syn drome specific FISH probes. However, this is usually limited for prenatal cases. Multiple Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) extends the boundaries of the diagnosis of chromosomal anomalies that are undetectab   le by classical methods.In this study, we aimed to search for subtelomeric aberrations and syndro me related microdeletions/duplications by using SALSA P070 and P245 probe sets of MLPA in 66 samples of fetuses with major ultrasonographic abnormalities carrying normal karyotypes with conventional methods.Two microdeletions (18p11.3 >pter and 7q11.23) and one microduplicati   on (18q23) were identified (4.5 %   3/66) by MLPA.

Quan   titative Fluorescence PCR (QF PCR) is a rapid assay used to identify most common aneuploidies of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, Y. This method uses highly DNA polymorphic markers (STRs) specific for each chromosome, to determine the number of alleles of the analyzed chromosomes. In this rare case a sample of amniotic fluid was referred for prenatal diagnosis with a high risk indication 1:2 for Edwards Syndrome after combined first trime ster screening, in the absence of any detectable fetal malformation. QF PCR was followed by cytogenetic analysis of cultured cells. The results of QF PCR revealed an abnormal pattern of allele ratio suggesting mosaic of three full copies of chromosome 18, whereas cytogenetic analysis revealed a 50% mo saic of a supernumerary centromeric marker 18. Due to the discrepancy of these results, genetic counseling advised to continue the investigation with a second sample either fetal blood or amniotic fluid. Also, array CGH was recommended to clarify these unusual results. The results of the second am niotic fluid sample confirmed the presence of extra marker 18. After coun seling about the associated risk of abnormal outcome, parents decided to continue the pregnancy. Postnatal blood karyotype revealed a third cell line of full trisomy 18 in 5% of peripheral cells, confirming the QF PCR findings.QF PCR technique is a trustworthy method for detecting aneuploidies and even mosaics in a low percentage.

HLA PGD is, however, a multistep, technically chal  lenging procedure at every stage. To address the aspect of genetic analysis  through simplifying patient work up and PGD application, we developed a fast, reliable, accurate HLA PGD protocol, to allow minimal work up time and high flexibility for combination with any SGD. Recent HLA PGD requests included 11 families to treat Î² thalassaemia and  1 family each for Diamond Blackfan anaemia, Chronic Granulomatous disea   se, Sideroblastic anaemia and preimplantation HLA typing only. For HLA haplotyping we selected 22 short tandem repeats distributed  across the entire HLA locus (4Mb) following published guidelines. PCR pri mers were designed with properties allowing multiplex analysis in any com  bination. The resulting one step, single tube, multiplex fluorescent touch  down PCR, was minimally modified to incorporate multiplex protocols for  direct and indirect genotyping of the SGDs, supporting concurrent SGD ex   clusion and HLA typing.

In conclusion PN_BoBs has additional informational value over QF PCR as it also detects common microdeletions and therefore it better complements karyotyping.",2012
 24 chromosomes in 24 hours: Validation study of a new assay for rapid detection of aneuploidies and terminal imbalances of all chromosomes in chorionic villous samples,P05.53,"S. Zahn, S. Kerber, R.

In general, results are available 10 12 days after sample reception. To bridge this gap, rapid testing for common aneuploi   dies using QF PCR or FISH is performed. In chorionic villous samples (CVS), direct or short term incubation preparations are recommended to obtain an early complete chromosome analysis. However, the labour input is sub  stantial and the results are often of poor quality. As the likelihood for chro  mosomal aberrations other than trisomies 21, 18 and 13 in CVS is higher as compared to amniocytes, we evaluated the KaryoLiteâ¢BACs on Beadsâ¢  technology (Perkin Elmer, Turku, Finland) as an alternative testing method  for aneuploidies and terminal imbalances of all chromosomes within 24 hours. Endpoints of the study were analytic sensitivity and ease of use. This molecular karyotyping assay consists of 91 BAC coupled beads provi  ding information about the dosage of proximal and terminal regions of each chromosome arm using comparative hybridisation.In this validation study, we investigated 102 CVSs with known aneuploidies  (n,93, autosomal,69, gonosomal,24), polyploidies (n,3) and terminal im  balances (n,6) previously analysed by QF PCR and karyotyping.From our data we conclude that Karyolite TM BoBsTM provides correct and  rapid results on all aneuploidies and   if covered by the assay   terminal im  balances, based on minute (<50ng) amounts of DNA in a single assay.

Her mother had breast cancer at age 46; no other case of cancer in the family was reported.This case history stimulates several questions. How personal and family  history of cancer should be regarded in the context of PGD/PND; does the  gender of the fetus, or the carrier status (whether due to a BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutation) should be considered; is it ethical to allow PGD or PND for late onset diseases with incomplete penetrance.PGD/PND for hereditary breast ovarian and bowel cancer was considered in 2006, in UK. Israel and Germany advocate and ban, respectively, PGD/PND for cancer susceptibilities, whilst other Western countries are some   where in between. The criteria that each country adopts in favor or against PGD/PND, for late onset diseases may reflect the complex social and family ethical values regarding the technology of assistance reproduction.

This is im portant for setting up a good pre test counseling.Methods: We performed HumanCytoSNP 12 array (Illumina) analysis of un cultured amniotic fluid cells and LTC villi in 344 cases of fetal anomalies after exclusion of the common aneuploidies and triploidy. For correct in terpretation, simultaneous analysis of both parents was performed in most cases. According to our policy, only clinically relevant copy number variants (CNVs) were reported to the clinical geneticist who counselled the parents.Results: On a total of 344 arrays, 36 (10,5 %) CNVs were found that were interpreted as clinically relevant based on current knowledge. 24 (7 %) were most probably causative explaining the ultrasound abnormalities and 12 (3,5 %) were so called âunexpected findingsâ that are most likely not di rectly associated with the fetal anomalies. In the latter cases the involved CNVs were risk factors for mental disability, autism spectrum disorder, schi   zophrenia etc. CNVs involving genes like DMD or BRCA2 were not found so far.Conclusions: These findings stress the importance of a pre test counseling with special attention for this type of risk factors, taking into account that risk figures are based upon postnatal studies and that the prenatal manife station of such factors is not yet studied. In our opinion, the pregnant wo man should get the opportunity to decide whether she wants to be informed about these CNVs, which may potentially complicate decision making on continuation or termination of the pregnancy.",2012

Due to differences in individual re sponses to the treatment, various genetic factors have been investigated in  the etiology of ROP . We investigated the gene polymorphism of plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI 1) 4G/5 as a risk factor of ROP development. METHODS:  73 neonates with ROP and 101 controls were enrolled to study.  The mean gestational ages were 29.4Â±0.8 weeks and 30Â±1.4 weeks, respec   tively. The mean birth weight was 1322Â±431 g and 1414Â±313 g, respec   tively. Genotyping was analyzed using real time polymerase chain reaction  methods. RESUL TS: We found no significant differences in allele frequency of the PAI 1  genes between control group and neonates with ROP (p,0.540 and p,0.527, respectively). The proportion of 4G/4G, 4G/5G and 5G/5G genotypes did not differ statistically between the ROP and control groups (p>0.05). Having PAI 1 4G/4G genotype polymorphism seems to developed the risk of ROP (OR ,0,702; 95% CI: 0.300 1.639) less than PAI 1 4G/5G polymorphisms (OR ,1.064; 95% CI: 0.469 2.410). 4G/4G genotype frequency was decrea sing as the stages of ROP were increasing though there was no statistically significant difference between proportion of genotypes and ROP stages.CONCLUSION: This study showed that PAI 1 4G/5G genotype which is known as a risk factor for angiogenesis is not a predisposing factor for ROP development.

Its prevalence among all pregnancies has been estimated to be approximately 1% to 3%. Triploidy may be the result of either digyny (extra haploid set from mother) or diandry (extra haploid set from father).Two distinct phenotypes observed in triploid fetuses have been shown to be associated with parental origin of the triploidy (McFadden and Kalousek 1991). The diandric phenotype is characterised by a normally sized or mild ly symmetrically growth retarded fetus with normal adrenal glands, and is associated with an abnormally large, cystic placenta with histological fea  tures known as partial hydatidiform mole (Type I). The digynic phenotype  is characterised by marked asymmetric intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR), marked adrenal hypoplasia, and a very small, non molar placenta  (Type II). We present chromosomal, fetal ultrasound and pathological findings in two cases of triploidy diagnosed prenatally. The parental origin of the additional  haploid chromosome set was determined based on a range of highly poly   morphic microsatellite markers. In the first case, the fetal karyotype was  69,XXY and the histological investigation showed bilateral cystic renal dys plasia.

Material and method: During ian.2010 dec.2011 we examined a number of 947 pregnant patients. We performed a number of 86 invasive procedures  in order to determine fetal karyotype: 15   advanced maternal age; 20   bio  chemical risk + maternal age; 51   ultrasound criteria + maternal age Â± bio  chemistry.The calculated risk was estimated by introduction of data in the software Astraia. The cut off level for the 1 st trimester screening was set at 1: 150 and  for the 2nd trimester   at 1:250. Results: Prenatal diagnosis revealed 10 chromosomal abnormalities (T21   4, T18   3, T13   2 and 1 case of triploidy). All this cases belong to the group with ultrasound exam. For the same rate of detection, the FPR is 8% for all invasive procedures. If we exclude the invasive diagnosis on demand, the FPR is 6.44% and if we analyze only the cases (51 pregnancies) with ultra sound screening   the FPR is 4.3%.Conclusion: We observe that if we analyze pregnancies including ultrasound screening, the FPR drops almost to the half value (from 8% to 4.3%).",2012

 Concordant change of the 5 hydroxymethylcytosine status and mRNA expression at the LZTS1 loci in breast cancer,P06.002,"W. Liou, M. Wielscher , W. Pulverer, A. WeinhÃ¤usel","Austrian Institute of Technology, Vienna, Austria","Analysis of 5 methylcytosine (5 mC) patterns in DNA for the identification of epigenetic dysregulation in cancer is well established whereas elucida tion of the role of 5 hydroxymethylcytosine has yet to be unravelled. TET proteins convert 5 mC, usually found in CpG context, to 5 hmC, which is assumed to be involved in gene expression regulation and might prove to be intriguing for cancer diagnostics. DNA samples from breast cancer tis sue (n,6) and blood samples from healthy patients (n,6) were glucosylated with 5 hydroxymethylcytosineglucosyltransferase and digested with the re striction endonuclease MspI. As control reaction each sample was treated with MspI without prior glucosylation. Thus, the selective glycosylation of 5 hmC to glucosyl 5 hydroxymethylcytosine (glu 5 hmC) enabled us to distinguish between 5 hmC and methylated or unmodified cytosine. After digestion, the samples were analysed for 5 hmC in 325 loci by a targeted microarray. Through this approach the detection of one potential gene loci with a significant difference (P<0.05) was achieved. The marker LZTS1was validated with qPCR on breast cancer samples (n,32) and normal tissue (n,6), showing a higher level of 5 hmC in normal breast tissue. As next step the mRNA expression of LZTS1 was monitored in the validation set, which enabled us to detect a significant decrease of mRNA expression of the tumor suppressor gene LZTS1 in cancerous tissue. Our detection of 5 hmC DNA changes might contribute to understand possible functions of 5 hmC as an epigenetic regulator, because to our best knowledge we are the first that show a direct connection between 5 hmC alterations and a changed mRNA expression on experimental basis.",2012

We compared the sex and BRCA allele transmission ratios from 305 descen   dents assuming an equal (1:1) distribution.Results: We found a 2.2 fold excess of female births (101 females vs 49 ma  les for BRCA1 and 110 females vs 45 males for BRCA2) in our pedigrees. We  observed that the mutated BRCA1 allele segregated more often than the wild  type allele (ratio 3:1) in the female offspring and that the number of carriers was higher than expected (74% carriers vs 24% non carriers). Interestingly,  in the male offspring the wild type BRCA1 allele segregated more often than  the mutated allele (37% carriers vs 63% non carriers).

Multiplicomâs MASTR assays allow multiplexed PCR amplification of nu merous target sequences and therefore substantially reduce processing cost  and front end workload in combination with massive parallel sequencing  (MPS) platforms. This is demonstrated by the fast uptake of the BRCA MA   STR assay in European clinical diagnostic laboratories resulting from the  facts that (i) only 5 robust PCR reactions are required to amplify all coding  exons of BRCA1/2 and (ii) multiple DNA samples can be processed simulta   neously. Additionally, processing cost is reduced by a factor 2 5, compared to Sanger based sequencing resulting from the combination of highly spe  cific amplification (> 96% on target specificity) and a narrow spread factor  (i.e. average number of all reads divided by the read number of the lower   most amplicon) of 2,5. To increase the accessibility of MPS in clinical diagnostics, we worked out  and performed a protocol to sequence the BRCA MASTR assay amplicons on an Ion PGM Sequencer. Hereto, amplicons from each of 14 DNA samples  were enzymatically sheared followed by ligation of individual PGM adap  ters.

As expected for hereditary BC gene, the BLM heterozygotes tended to be  overrepresented in patients with family history of the disease, younger age  at onset, or BC bilaterality. Unlike BRCA1 related hereditary tumors, BLM associated BC were frequently hormone receptor positive (13/18, 72%).  While virtually all BC arising in BRCA1/2 carriers contain somatic deletion  of the remaining wild type allele, none of BLM driven cancers demonstra ted loss of heterozygosity at BLM locus. 5 patients carrying BLM mutation  were treated by neoadjuvant therapy and therefore were available for im  mediate evaluation of tumor chemosensitivity: 3 showed nearly complete  pathological response, and 2 experienced partial clinical response. Elevated  frequency of BLM Q548X mutations in Russian (Slavic) subjects allows to expect noticeable occurrence of Bloom Syndrome in Russia and neighboring countries; absence of appropriate clinical records in major Russian genetic centers suggests that at least some of these patients remain undiagnosed and/or have relatively mild presentation of this disease.",2012

SULT1E1 was expressed stably in various cell lines in order to analyze its effects on telomerase activity, telomere length and senescence using telomerase PCR ELISA kit, telomere length kit and Ã galactosidase staining, respectively.Results and Conclusions:The mRNA expression level of SULT1E1 was significantly (p<0,05) lower in CxCa as compared to CIN2/3 or normal tissue. Only low levels of SULT1E1 were detected in the cervical carcinoma cell lines SiHa, ME180 and SW756. Reconstitution of SULT1E1 via lentiviral mediated gene transfer in these cell lines resulted in a slightly decreased telomerase activity in SiHa and ME180 cells. Telomere length assays and senescence tests are still ongoing.Our first results thus far suggest that SULT1E1 maybe a putative telomerase suppressor gene and loss of its function may contribute to the transforma tion process.",2012

As  the apoptotic pathway mediated by FAS FASL was found to be involved in no  tochordal cells regression, we studied their expression in 34 chordomas and observed that most of them express FAS, but not FASL. To verify a possible  implication of FAS/FASL pathway dysfunction during development leading  to tumorigenesis, we started in vivo studies on zebrafish, firstly investiga ting fas fasl horthologue genes expression by RT PCR in whole embryos and larvae. While fas was maternally and zigotycally expressed, fasl showed a stage specific expression. Following microinjection of a GFP construct acti vated by the twhh promoter, we specifically sorted by FACS the GFP positive notochordal cells at different developmental stages in which we studied fas fasl expression by means of RT PCR. We observed that fas was expressed at all the analyzed stages, while fasl is modulated during development. Immu   nohistochemical experiments showed notochord fasl expression at 48 hpf, 3 and 5 days post fertilization (dpf) and at 9 mm. fasl expression seems to decrease when notochordal cells disappear during chord regression, sug gesting the activity of apoptotic mechanisms fas fasl mediated. Studies on fas and fasl silencing, by means of morpholino oligos injections, allowed us to observe notochord anomalies such as packed notochordal cells, curved body and bent tail. Further analysis will be performed to verify whether the reactivation of fas fasl pathway might rescue the normal phenotype, allo   wing to unravel the role of this mechanism in chordoma development.",2012

Imatinib, an ATP competitive selective inhibitor of BCR ABL, has unprecedented efficacy for the treatment of CML. Nevertheless resistance to imatinib is observed in over 30% cases of CML. Several cellular and genetic mechanisms of imatinib resistance have been proposed, including overexpression of the BCR ABL gene, the tyrosine kina   se domain mutations, pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic factors.The purpose of this study was to investigate the mechanisms of resistance to imatinib in CML patients. We have analyzed mRNA level of BCR ABL gene by quantitative real time RT PCR in 114 patients and have studied BCR ABL mutations in patients with high level of expression of fusion gene. Muta   tion status was studied by direct sequencing of BCR ABL cDNA samples. BCR ABL mutations were founded in 16 (32%) patients with resistance to imatinib treatment. The mutation spectrum included four missense mutati   on: M351T (7 cases), T315I (4), T315I+M351T (2), M244V (1) and H396R (1). Next we conducted a search for microRNAs specifically targeting 3âUTR of BCR ABL, using the miRBASE program to scan human genome (http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/) and analyzed microRNAs expression profile. The down regulation of miR 203 b (25 fold), mir 323 (4 fold) and miR 196 b (2 fold) in the group of patients with resistance was discovered. In conclusi on, our data showed that mutations in the BCR ABL kinase domain may cau se, or contribute to, resistance to tyrosine kinase inhibitors in CML patients, but resistance mechanisms might also be regulated by microRNAs.",2012

The first line therapy of  CML is Imatinib mesylate, which targets Bcr Abl protein. The gold standard for diagnosing CML is cytogenetic analysis, a direct not sensitive method to  detect Ph positive cells. The real time reverse transcriptase PCR (qRT PCR)  is a sensitive quantitative manner to monitor residual leukemia, evaluating levels of BCR ABL1 transcripts. Undetectable levels of mRNA, however, can reflect either an effective elimination of leukemia cells, or the presence of  quiescent leukemia stem cells transcriptionally silent. We developed a novel highly sensitive method to identify quiescent leuke mic cells through quantitative real time PCR (Q PCR) based on the DNA. We monitored eight CML patients in the early chronic phase and in follow  ups up to 8 years under Imatinib treatment. We carried out patient specific Q PCR assays to monitor minimal residual disease, testing the same samples  in parallel by cytogenetic analysis and by standard qRT PCR. In all positive  samples for chimeric transcript we measured positive levels of correspon   ding genomic DNA. In 13% of samples, with undetectable levels of mRNA, we showed the persistence of quiescent leukemic cells with Q PCR.

Classic Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is a lymphoid malignancy characterized  by the presence of Reed Sternberg cells. Approximately 40 60% of cHL have  been associated with Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infection. Transcription fac  tors of the B lineage are not expressed in RS cells but these may express other markers of hematopoietic cell lines. In an effort to identify the par  ticipation of Pax5, NOTCH1 and the latent state genes of EBV involved in  the cHL oncogenic process, 58 lymph node samples of Mexican pediatric patients were analyzed. Detection and genotyping of EBV was performed by PCR and in situ hybridation. Expression of NOTCH1, Pax5 and LMP1B was  identified by immunohistochemistry and immunofluorescence. NOTCH1 ex   pression was detected in 85.3% of cHL cases. 80% of cases of cHL were po  sitive for EBV, B subtype had the highest presentation. With these results we  concluded that RS cells have an aberrant immunophenotype in comparison  to their cells of origin (B lymphocytes), due to molecular mechanisms invol ved in the loss of expression of transcription factors of B lineage (Pax5). The  expression of LMP1 and LMP2 that constitutively activate Notch1 signaling  pathway, induces changes in the identity of B cells, a mechanism suggested in animal models and cell lines. The presence of B subtype in the majority of the cases may suggest a poor prognosis, as it enhances proliferation and  immortalization of RS cells. We identified 4 cases with A and B subtypes in  the same sample, which is very interesting since this has only been reported in HIV patients.",2012

Intravenous fluorouracil (5 FU) has been used for the treatment of colo  rectal cancer over 40 years. Lately, oral 5 FU prodrugs have been additio   nally developed. However, only a fraction of the administred capecitabine reaches its target cells and is transformed into active metabolites which cause permanent inhibition of the enzyme thymidylate synthase (TYMS)  and further DNA synthesis. Polymorphisms in TYMS and MTHFR genes pre  sumably affect the clinical response of 5 FU.Retrospective pharmacogenetic study was performed to investigate germ line polymorphisms of the two genes involved in fluorouracil pathway and  their potential association with toxicities in patients treated with capecita   bine. The germline DNA of 36 patients treated with capecitabine was genotyped  for two variants (677C>T; 1298A>C) in MTHFR gene and one variant in  TYMS (28 bp tandem repeat) gene. The 28 bp tandem repeat was geno typed by PCR amplification to discriminate between 2R and 3R alleles, PCR  fragments were separated by eletrophoresis on 2.5% agarose gels. MTHFR  polymorphisms were genotyped using APEX based microarray.Adverse events were more frequent in patients heterozygoys for TYMS 2R/3R. Patients carrying the 1298C/C genotype had a low risk of develo  ping side effects compared to patients with the A/C or A/A genotype when  treated with capecitabine. Similarly, diplotype (CA CA) showed a negative  effect on the incidence of adverse events. In contrast, MTHFR haplotype (677C 1298C) showed a protective effect.In conclusion, in colorectal cancer patients, the incidence of side effects induced by capecitabine might be genetically predicted. However, these preliminary findings must be confirmed in larger and prospective clinical studies.",2012

Background: Identification of genetic markers to complement clinicopatho logical evaluation in cancer diagnosis and selection of appropriate treat ment is a major challenge for molecular oncology today. Loss of heterozi   gosity (LOH) at several chromosomal regions harboring tumor suppressor  genes or oncogenes, is one of the most promising molecular markers with  prognostic significance for colorectal cancer (CRC).Aim: To evaluate the involvement of 18q LOH in colorectal carcinogenesis and its value as a prognostic molecular marker. Materials and Methods: A total of 314 randomly selected patients under   going colon and/or rectum resection for pathohistologically confirmed CRC  were included in the study. LOH analysis was performed using fluorescence  multiplex PCR with 4 microsatelite markers: D18S46, D18S58, D18S61 and  D18S535, and subsequent capillary gel electrophoresis on AbiPrism310.Results: LOH at 18q defined as loss at any of the evaluated markers is detec  ted in 57% of tumor samples. Most efficient molecular marker is D18S46,  conferring LOH status to 65% of cancers with this type of chromosomal instability. Cancers with 18q LOH are prone to development of distal meta  stases (OR,6.35, 95%CI,1.183 34.042, p,0.02), which is considered a pa  thohystological criterion for poor outcome. LOH at this chromosomal region is also associated with tumor size, though without statistical significance (p,0.25). Conclusion: Our results identifying association between 18qLOH and deve  lopment of metastases indirectly support the hypothesis that 18qLOH is a molecular marker of poor outcome in CRC. Further studies investigating the  5 year survival in our patients will be performed to confirm these findings  and provide additional details for the observed association.",2012

Thus the re is great need to identify novel biomarkers for diagnostic improvements of CRC. Patients at risk for CRC are identified by screening programs using the FOBT (fecal occult blood test) which provides 61 96% sensitivity and 91 98% specificity. However recall rate due to many false positives are leading to unnecessary colonoscopy and anxiety. This causes also a high workload for confirmatory initial diagnosis by colonoscopy. There remains a need for a minimally invasive, cost effective procedure that could be used alongside FOBT screening and eventually prior colonoscopy to improve screening sen sitivity. To improve CRC initial diagnosis we have elucidated a panel of can didate DNA methylation biomarkers from tissue DNA testing (tumors: n,18; normal tissue: n,18) using a targeted DNA methylation microarray. The top 24 candidates were then subjected to qPCR based confirmation of microar ray data. DNA from blood (n,8) was also included in qPCR analyses; based on these data the minimal set of markers for perfect classification could be reduced to a single gene enabling 100% correct classification (AUC,1). Further we designed qMSP for bisulfite based confirmation of findings. By qMSP 96 100% of all different samples were classified correctly. Thus we have elucidated candidate markers which should be validated on different sample cohorts and might be good targets for minimal invasive CRC testing using cell free DNA from serum.

Tumor (n,197) and normal (n,20) colon tissues were analy   zed for the panel of eight markers used to assess the CpG Island Methylator Phenotype (CIMP): RUNX3, CACNA1G, IGF2, MLH1, NEUROG1, CRABP1,  SOCS1, and CDKN2A. This study was approached by Methylation Sensitive  MLPA. Microsatellite instability (MSI) and BRAF  V600E mutation were also  analyzed.We found 22.84% (45/197) of tumors with CIMP+ (cutoff: five positive markers); 5.08% (10/197) with BRAF  mutation and 9.64% (19/197) with  MSI. None of the 20 matched normal tissues analyzed from patients with CIMP+ tumors showed significant methylation (10 patients older and 10 younger than the median age). CIMP+ tumors were associated to older pa tients (OR,2.23; p,0.022); proximal location (p,0.002); BRAF  mutation  (p<0.001) and MSI (p<0.001). Tumor methylation age dependent was given by RUNX3 (OR,3.53; p<0.001); CDKN2A  (OR,2.26; p,0.007) and CACNA1G  (OR,2.46; p,0.018).Our results suggest that methylation at RUNX3, CDKN2A  and CACNA1G genes   is tumor specific and age dependent in CRC patients. The epigenetic landsca pe of CRC might be different depending on patient age.",2012

Consequently, alterations in the methylome are a typical hallmark of cancer, contributing the malignant phe notype, e.g. in CRC [3]. In this study we included genomic DNA isolated from 117 CRC tissue samp  les and the corresponding control tissue from the same patients.

Recently, we could show that inhibi  tion of the RTKs insulin like growth factor I receptor (IGF IR) and epider   mal growth factor receptor (EGFR) in CRC cells by siRNA approach or by small molecule inhibitors NVP AEW541 and erlotinib, respectively, results in decreased proliferation and induction of apoptosis, with having additive effects when both receptors were blocked simultaneously. In the present study we analysed the effect of RTK inhibition in the context of 5 Fluorou racil based radiochemotherapy (RCT). Inhibition of IGF IR and EGFR using NVP AEW541 and erlotinib results in a sensitization of CRC cells (DLD 1, SW837 and Caco 2) to RCT and a poor survival in therapy treatments. In addition, dual blockade of both receptors in CRC cells enhanced the therapy success. To identify the molecular mechanisms underlying this sensitization of CRC cells we analysed the DNA repair mechanisms. Phospho H2AX stai ning as marker for double strand breaks revealed impairment of DNA repair in single inhibitor treatments 24h after RCT and even more pronounced effects were observed when both receptors were inhibited simultaneously. Furthermore, we could show using proximity ligation and co immuopreci pitation assays that IGF IR and EGFR form heterodimers in CRC cells in a ligand dependent manner. Taken together, these results indicate that the RTKs EGFR and IGF IR play important roles in the resistance of CRC patients to neoadjuvant RCT and that simultaneous treatment of RCT resistant pati   ents with a combination of RTK inhibitors can circumvent these problems.",2012

To investigate the apparent discrepant re sults between these methods for three samples we used commercial TheraS creen KRAS Kit (DxS Ltd, Manchester, England). Specificity and sensitivity of allele specific RT PCR were 100 % (34/34) and 96.4 % (27/28) respectively and with the use of ACRS or SSCP  94.1 % (32/34) and 100 % (28/28) re spectively. Falsely positive findings were absent with allele specific RT PCR, but were discovered in two cases with ACRS or SSCP analysis (5.9 %).

In miR   base V15, we identified few human microRNA genes with mono  or di nu  cleotide repeats (n,27). Out of the 24 microRNA genes successfully studied,  15 were found unstable in a large series of MSI CRC cell lines and primary  tumors. Frequencies of instability ranged from 2.5% to 100%. Following a maximum likelihood statistical method, microRNA genes were separated into two groups that differed significantly in their mutation frequencies and in their tendency to represent mutations that may be or not under selective pressures during MSI tumoral progression. The first group included 21 ge nes that displayed no or few mutations in CRC. The second group contained 3 genes with frequent (â¥80%) and sometimes bi allelic mutations in MSI tumors. For hsa mir 1303 , the only miR expressed in colonic tissues, no di   rect link was found between the presence or not of mono or bi allelic altera tions and the levels of mature miR expression in MSI cell lines.

Per patient, we validated an  average of 45 candidate pathogenic variants by Sanger sequencing , and te sted parental DNA to reveal the modes of inheritance.In one child a paternal BRCA2 mutation and a maternal change in PARP1   were identified. The co occurrence of these two mutations appears relevant, since both proteins are involved in DNA repair. The second patient, a child of distantly related parents, carried a homozygous SEC31B variant. In yeast,  Sec31p is involved in cell cycle progression and therefore might play a role in cancer development.

In colorectal cancer (CRC), an inherited susceptibility risk affects about 35% of patients, whereas high penetrance germline mutations account for < 6% of cases. A considerable proportion of sporadic tumors could be ex   plained by the coinheritance of multiple common low penetrance variants. We assessed the susceptibility to CRC conferred by 14 polymorphisms and the allele specific expression (ASE) of TGFBR1  in a case control designed  study (504 controls and 521 patients with sporadic CRC). Polymorphisms were genotyped with the iPLEX Gold (MassARRAY  Sequenom) technology. Descriptive analyses of the polymorphisms and association studies were performed with the SNPator workpackage. No relevant associations were detected between individual polymorphisms or haplotypes and the risk of CRC. The TGFBR1 *9A/6A polymorphism was used for the ASE analysis by  fragment analysis using cDNA from normal tissue. The relative level of al   lelic expression was extrapolated from a standard curve. ASE was found in 25.4% of patients and 16.4% of controls. No significant differences between the ASE values of patients and controls were identified. Interestingly, a com bined analysis of the polymorphisms and ASE for the association with CRC occurrence revealed that ASE positive individuals carrying one of the most common haplotypes (H2: 20.7%) showed remarkable susceptibility to CRC (RR: 5.25; 95% CI: 2.547 5.250; p < 0.001) with a synergy factor of 3.7. In our study, 54.1% of sporadic CRC cases were attributable to the coinheri  tance of the H2 haplotype and TGFBR1 ASE.

Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency syndrome (CMMR D) is a rare autosomal recessive disease, first reported in 1999. It is characterized by  hematological malignancies, brain tumors and tumors of the large intestine  with an early formation. Skin maculae with diffuse margins and irregular pigmentation are similar to cafÃ© au lait present in neurofibromatosis 1, and  they may occur together with hypopigmented areas. Development of this syndrome is caused by biallelic mutations in genes that are associated with Lynch syndrome (hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer   HNPCC). MLH1, MSH2, MSH6  and PMS2 genes belong to the mismatch repair system  and play a basic role in the genome integrity. In the heterozygous state, the mutation of one of these genes causes HNPCC. Biallelic mutations of the afo rementioned genes are characterized by occurrence of the first malignan   cies (brain tumors, leukemias) at the age of 2 and occurrence of other types of tumors with increasing age.

To determine the genetic stability and sensitivity of MSCs to the ROS mediated DNA damage, we have studied spontaneous and dioxidi  ne induced DNA damage in cultured human MSCs from adipose tissue and  compared it with cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes.Dioxidine is a mutagen with prooxidative type of genotoxic action.

Chemical mutagens can lead to genes mutations and chromo somal aberrations as well as to epigenetic changes. Toxins and other exo genous agents can cause nonspecific (whole genome DNA hypomethylation and histone deacetylation) and specific (hypo  and hypermethylation of se   veral genes) modifications of genome. Dioxidine is well studied agent with proved mutagenic activity. Frequency of chromosomal aberrations in peri   pheral blood lymphocytes increases from spontaneous level of 2.25Â±0.17% to 8.06Â±0.37% and 17.00Â±0.86% after dioxidine exposure in concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml respectively. The aim of this study was to estimate  dioxidine influence on whole genome methylation status in human peri   pheral blood lymphocytes. Materials and Methods . Samples of peripheral  blood were obtained from 14 healthy donors. DNA methylation was analy   zed using methyl sensitive Comet assay with additional step of restriction by HpaII and MspI enzymes. DNA methylation in lymphocytes was esti  mated before cultivation, after 25 hours cultivation without dioxidine and with dioxidine addition in final concentrations of 0.01 and 0.1 mg/ml after 24 hours cultivation of whole blood. DNA methylation level was defined as the ratio of mean of DNA value in cometâs tails after HpaII restriction to  that after MspI restriction. Results. DNA methylation levels in lymphocytes  before and after cultivation didnât differ (45.28% and 44.80% respectively p>0.4). Lymphocytes after the cultivation with low dioxidine concentration have shown the increased DNA methylation level up to 46.14% (p<0.001) however high dioxidine concentration causes DNA hypomethylation down to 42.31% (p<0.001). Conclusion.  Nonspecific hypomethylation caused by  dioxidine exposure can result in genome instability and diseases including cancer.",2012

Background: There is a lack of suitable markers for the early and reliable detection of malignant tumors, including non small cell lung cancer (NS  CLC). Weâve performed a genome wide analysis in early NSCLC to find DNA  methylation based biomarker candidates.Methods: Weâve analysed samples from 48 patients with stage I NSCLC and  18 matching cancer free lung samples using microarrays that cover the pro  moter regions of more than 14,500 genes. DNA methylation changes were correlated with gene expression levels. In addition, survival analysis was performed. The gene expression and DNA methylation changes were valida   ted with real time qPCR analysis and bisulfite sequencing with HiSeq 2000 instrument (Illumina).Results: We observed hypermethylation of 496 CpGs in 379 genes and hy   pomethylation of 373 CpGs in 335 genes in NSCLC. 378 of 869 (43.5%) CpGs discriminating the NSCLC and control samples showed the expected inverse correlation between CpG methylation and gene expression levels. As a result  of a survival analysis, we found 10 CpGs in 10 genes, in which the methylati   on level differs in different survival groups. Conclusions: We have identified a set of genes with altered methylation in NSCLC. We also found a set of genes that associated with the survival of the  patients.

Polymorphisms in DNA repair genes have been associated to repair DNA damages, and might contribute to the individual susceptibility to develop different types of malignant hemopathias. One of the most studied DNA re pair system in humans is nucleotide excision repair pathway. The XPD gene  (xeroderma pigmentosum group D) is involved in nucleotide excision repair system. An XPD  variant in exon 23 leading to a Lys751G1n aminoacid substi  tution has been associated with reduced DNA repair capacity.To investigate the possible association between the XPDLys751G1n and the risk of myelodisplastic syndrome in a Romanian popu lation, we analyzed DNA samples from a case control study of 26 MDS cases and 50 healthy subjects as a control group.The XPD  codon 751 genotypes were determined using a PCR RFLP techni   que. No statistically significant difference was found for the genotypic and allelic distributions of the polymorphisms in the XPD  gene between the pa  tients and the control subjects. In conclusion polymorphism in XPD codon  751 is not associated with the development of MDS.Acknowledgement: This paper is partly supported by the Sectorial operatio nal programme human resources development (SOP HRD),financed from the European social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the contract number POSDRU 60782.",2012

The X ray repair cross complementing group 3 (XRCC3), has an important role in homologous recombination (HR), one of the main pathways for the repair of DNA double strand breaks and maintenance of genomic integrity. Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is characterized by genetic instability. We hypothesized that polymorphisms in the XRCC3 repair gene may lead to ge  netic instability and subsequent AML. The aim of this study was to deter   mine the frequency of the XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphisms among AML  patients. Therefore we performed a case control study including 50 de novo AML patients and 50 healthy subjects as a control group.Genotyping was performed by polymerase chain reaction restriction frag ment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP), with the digestion of restriction endonuclease NlaIII. The restricted products were analyzed on 2% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and analyzed under UV light. We found a significantly higher frequency of the polymorphic variants XRCC3 Thr241   Met genes in AML cases, when compared with controls (P , 0.04; odds ratio ,2.54). XRCC3 241Met allele is associated with an increased risk for AML.  In conclusion, we consider that polymorphism XRCC3 Thr241Met polymor   phism may be a risk factor for the development of AML.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012175 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters Acknowledgement: This paper is partly supported by the Sectorial operatio  nal programme human resources development (SOP HRD), financed from  the European social Fund and by the Romanian Government under the con  tract number POSDRU 60782.",2012

Cancer cells have countless behaviors of pluripotent embryonic and germ line cells, such as unlimited proliferation and the capacity of self renewal as well as migration. Active embryonic genes in tumor cells may be asso   ciated with invasiveness and indefinite growth of such cells. Developmental pluripotency associated 2 (DPPA2) is implicated in regulatory pathways maintaining the pluripotency of embryonic stem cells. DPPA2 expression in human germ line and early stage embryo is also being extended to a signi ficant subset of malignant tumors. However, its expression in CRC remains to be clarified. In this study, the expression level of DPPA2 in 38 CRC samp les was compared with related normal tissues by real time PCR assay. Ex   pressional analysis represented the overexpression of DPPA2 in 31.5% of tumor specimens. In the advanced stages (III/IV) of tumor development, the overexpression of DPPA2 was significantly correlated with the lymph node metastasis of tumor cells (p<0.05). These results not only emphasize on the probable role of DPPA2 gene overexpression in the development of CRC tu   mors through advanced stages but also draw attention to the possible func tion of this gene in epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT) of colorectal tumor cells. In summary, having revealed the clinical relevance of DPPA2 expression in CRC, we extrapolate the potential of this gene as a promising marker to evaluate the risk of lymph node metastasis and a possible thera peutic target to prevent functional metastasis.",2012

Their structure and function is well described as well as their involvement  in the resistance of cancers to therapy. Despite being one of the best stu  died protein families with important effect on the cancer therapy, the ABC transporters are not routinely diagnosed in clinical practice. This has many  reasons, one of them being lack of relevant clinical data or their inconclu  siveness. The main aim of this study was to collect more information about the relevance of the relationship between the drug resistance genes and therapy response. We have analyzed expression of selected ABC transporter  genes in the tissues of breast and colon cancer patients. Analysis was perfor   med in over 200 patient samples, with diagnoses ranging from benign lesi  ons to invasive cancers. Our real time PCR based analysis revealed frequent  overexpression of certain ABC genes in all types of cancers. Most frequent  ly overexpressed genes included ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC5 and ABCC11.

This process can be occurred in present of prolonged infections or irritants. Now,  it is clear that tumor microenvironment is accompanied by inflammatory  cells which their production including cytokines can promote tumor pro gression. In previous study, we showed that chronic inflammation is involved in de   veloping of esophageal cancer, esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC),  in Iran. The incidence of ESCC is high in northern Iran. Environmental ex   posure to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) has been suggested to  provoke inflammation. They are easily distributed throughout the human  body and produce PAH DNA adducts which are risk factors for ESCC. Also, it is shown that human papillomavirus (HPV) genome integrate into the host  cell chromosome and lead to malignant cell transformation. This infection  can be contributed to carcinogenesis by inactivating the p53 protein in oral  cancers through p53 gene mutation.We assessed the HPV infections in ESCC tissues. The samples (tumor and control tissues) were collected from Tehran and the HPV infections were  determined by in situ hybridization analysis.

Defects in this gene cause Familial Adenomatous Polyposis (FAP), an autosomal dominant pre malignant disease that usually progress to mali   gnancy. Its main characteristic is the large development of pre cancerous colonic polyps in the intestines, which invariably evolve for the installment of cancer. The goals of this project are the screening for mutations in the APC gene (GenBank M74088) using High Resolution Melting technique and DNA sequencing, and the search for deletions using MLPA. The research includes 16 patients with clinical suspicion of FAP which were attended at the Uni versity Hospital and have signed for the consented forms.

We examined abnormal me thylation and methylation index (MI) in 106 gastric cancer patients. Me thylation index (MI) was defined as the ratio between the numbers of me thylated genes to total number of examined genes in each sample. Statistical significance was evaluated using the Mann Whitney U test.There was a significant difference in the frequency of hypermethylation of these genes among different clinical groups of patients. Abnormal methyla   tion of CDH1 and N33 genes is related to the progress of gastric cancer and  metastasis to lymph nodes (p < 0.05). Abnormal methylation of CDH1 is spe  cifically associated with diffuse type GC (p< 0,05).

Commonly lost in these tumors is also PTEN, an inhibitor of the PI3K signaling pathway activated by EGFR.In this study, we aimed to characterize the molecular alterations of EGFR and PTEN in 60 patients diagnosed with primary glioblastoma. We analyzed mutational status of PTEN and EGFR tyrosine kinase domain; we evaluated EGFR amplification and PTEN deletion by FISH and we determined EGFRvIII expression by RT PCR.20.8% patients showed pathogenic mutations in PTEN and 68.2% tumors presented PTEN locus deletion. 20% patients with PTEN deletion showed additionally PTEN mutation. Regards to EFGR, no mutations were detected in the tyrosine kinase domain, whereas 32.7% glioblastomas showed EGFR amplification and 31.7% expressed EGFRvIII truncated variant. 46.1% pati   ents with EGFRvIII expression showed EGFR amplification, resulting in the overexpression of constitutively active EGFR lacking I and II extracellular domains. Furthermore, we have found 5 novel EGFR non canonical splice variants in the extracellular domain. Four were truncated proteins and only one generated an in frame protein lacking aminoacids 20 251 in a tumor with EGFR amplification. In summary, 73.3% of glioblastomas analyzed pre sented any alteration in PTEN and/or EGFR.Finally, we investigated the prognostic impact of these alterations in pati   ent outcome. EGFRvIII expression was a significant prognostic factor (HR , 2.56, 95% C.I. 1.17 5.57, p , 0.018). Patients with EGFRvIII variant expressi   on had a higher median survival than those without it (16.7 months vs. 10.1 months)(Supported by FIS PI10/00219).",2012

Therefore, we investigated dif   ferent foci in multifocal GBM by an integrative approach in order to identify  markers of tumor initiation and progression as well as potential therapeutic  targets. We combined high resolution array CGH and expression arrays on fresh frozen tissue from 11 tumor foci from 6 patients with spectral karyoty   ping (SKY) on corresponding primary cell cultures. Moreover, PTEN Sanger  sequencing was performed. Array CGH analysis detected multiple aberrati ons in the tumors investigated. Additionally, SKY  analysis revealed multiple translocations including complex rearrangements. We found that different tumor foci derived from the same patients shared the majority of aberrati ons detected, indicating that these aberrations had probably emerged early in tumorigenesis. Interestingly however, some of the aberrations differed between the tumor foci from the same patient and thus must have occurred later in tumor development. These observations support the hypothesis that different tumor foci in multifocal GBM are of monoclonal origin and then de   velop independently of each other by clonal evolution. In accordance with this hypothesis, some of the tumor foci from the same patient shared the same PTEN mutation whereas others displayed different PTEN mutations.  We are currently analyzing the expression data which will also be presented. Taken together, multifocal GBM provide an excellent model for investigating tumor progression and might help distinguishing between driver and pas senger alterations in GBM.",2012

Background: High grade gliomas have poor prognosis. Only 3 5% survive more than five years being referred as long term survivors. Factors determi   ning this outcome are largely unknown.Aim: Identify specific genetic parameters that might be associated to long term survival. Methods: Evaluation of genomic imbalances by chromosomal CGH and of  MGMT and MMR genes methylation levels (%) by MLPA analysis in 3 groups of patients. Group 1: 13 long term survivors; Group 2: 17 patients with an overall survival (OS)< 5 years and MGMT av â¥ 25%; Group 3: 29 patients  with OS<5years and MGMTav<25%. Statistical analysis was performed using  Mann Whitney and Fisherâs Exact tests with p value adjustment for multiple  tests (Bonferroni). Results: Multiple chromosomal imbalances were observed in all groups  being gains at 7p/q regions the most frequent alteration. None of the long  term survivors had 7p12 (EGFR) amplifications and loss of 10q23 (PTEN)  region were significantly less frequent: 23,1% in group 1 v.s. 88,7% and  86,2% in groups 2 and 3. MS MLPA analysis revealed that MGMT and 4 of the MMR genes were significantly more methylated in the long term sur vivor group than in the others.

A 29 years old woman came to our attention with the suspicion of Gorlin Syndrome (GS). At age 15 she had undergone unilateral oophorectomy for a large mass of the right ovary and excision of several masses of the left ovary, diagnosed as fibromas; at age 18 she had multiple fibromas of the left ovary removed and two years later she underwent surgery for an uterine septum. Recently, she has undergone left oophorectomy for a large cystic mass: pathological examination revealed a granulosa cell tumor with theca cell areas.Maternal family history was unremarkable, whereas paternal family history was largely unknown, except for hysterectomy in her grandmother. The pro band has two healthy younger brothers (27 and 18 years old); her mother had three spontaneous miscarriages. Physical examination showed coarse face with hypertelorism and three skin lesions, of recent onset, which were removed and diagnosed as basal cell carcinomas. To confirm the suspicion of GS, the search for germline mutations in PTCH1 gene was carried out, which detected the heterozygous mutation c.1067_1067+3>TT , already re ported in GS patients. Although ovarian cysts and ovarian fibromas, often bilateral, are reported in 25 50% of GS female patients, to our knowledge, this is the first case of a granulosa cell tumor associated to multiple ovari an fibromas in a GS patient, whose clinical manifestations were mainly and heavily affecting ovaries.Other investigations (X rays of the skull and ortopantogram) are ongoing, as well as molecular analysis in parents and sibs.",2012

The Wilms tumour protein 1 (WT1) is essential for male sex determination. Not much is known about itâs expression and function in the embryonic and  adult female genital tract and if WT1 can trigger ovarian tumorgenesis. To this end, we generated two different conditional mouse models, both based on an inducible Wt1 tTA knockin effector line carrying a tetracycli  ne dependant activator (tTA) in place of the first exon of the endogenous  murine Wt1 locus. In the first model, tripel transgenic animals bearing a tetracycline responsive transgene for Cre recombinase, and the Cre repor   ter line ROSA26 lacZ, the fate of WT1 positive cells was followed in vivo by  tetracycline administration using beta galactosidase to identify cells and  tissues derived from WT1 positive precursors. In tripel transgenic animals of the second model, the Wt1 tTA knockin effector line and the tetracycline  responsive Cre recombinase should excise the third exon of Ctnnb1 (Î²Cat  Flox Ex3), which may in that case trigger ovarian tumorgenesis.Histochemical staining of embryos demonstrated earliest Wt1 expression in  the urogenital ridge at day 10.5 post coitum (d.p.c.). When the fate of Wt1  positive cells was analysed in the ovaries of adult mice, beta galactosidase activity could be detected in oocytes, stromal and granulosa cells. Tripel transgenic mice of the second model developed huge ovarian carcinoma.  Molecular and histological analysis suggested that this is due to Ctnnb1 ove  rexpression and that the carcinoma were granulosa cell tumours.Our results show that WT1 has an essential function in the female genital tract and present a new mouse model for granulosa cell tumours.",2012

In this study, we aimed to identify microRNAs affected by histone deacetylation and to understand functional consequences. ME   THODS: HCC cell lines and immortalized liver cell lines were treated with the histone deacetylase inhibitor TSA. Differentially expressed mRNAs and miRNAs were identified using mRNA and miRNA expression profiling. Fin dings were validated by siRNA mediated silencing of HDAC1 3, transfection of miR 449 into a HCC cell line, Western blotting and by luciferase reporter assays. RESULTS: Here we show that HDAC1 3 are consistently up regulated in primary HCC. MiRNA profiling identified hsa miR 449a to be significantly up regulated after HDAC inhibition. c MET encoding the receptor tyrosine kinase for hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) is a putative target gene of miR 449. Indeed, HDAC inhibition and miR 449 transfection resulted in reduced expression of c MET . Increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation after histone deacetylation and miR 449 upregulation confirmed the miR 449 tumor suppressive role. MiR 449 was found to bind directly to c MET .

We  characterized 30 distinct BRCA1 variants, which have not been sufficient  ly described before on transcript level, by quantitative PCR and sequencing  using mRNA extracted from blood lymphocytes. 13 variants disrupt invari ant splice sites, resulting in exon skipping and/or activation of cryptic splice  sites. Experimental analysis of more distant intronic or exonic variants is  mandatory and can be supported by in silico analyses. Ten intronic muta   tions were tested using the Human Splicing Finder prediction algorithm  and analyzed for aberrant splicing.

In this study, we assessed the Hiwi  mRNA expression in 38 CRC patients (20Male/18Female, Mean age 56) by  comparative real time PCR. Overexpression of Hiwi mRNA transcripts ob served in 35% (13/38) of patients. There was not any significant correlation between mRNA expression and patientsâ survival, tumor size and location. However, it was observed that the stage of tumor has a significant correlati   on with hiwi expression, in which the hiwi overexpression prohibits the tu   mor extension toward the higher stages (P,0.034). Furthermore, significant correlations were observed between overexpression of either Hiwi and self renewal marker SALL4 (p,0.002) or HIWI and cancer testis antigen DPPA2 (p,0.019).

Both HBD1 and HBD2 have been shown to induce the migration of immature den drite cells (DC) and memory T cells. Fms like tyrosine kinase 3 (FLT3) provi  des an important stimulus for resident DC production in vivo and indicating its important in migratory DC generation. We then analyzed the frequency distribution of promoter polymorphisms and determined the effect of these base changes on transcriptional activity of the HBD1 promoter and the pre valence of FLT3 mutation in patients with various AML.METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from a BM slide or BM aspiration with various 47 AML patients and 43 controls using QIAamp DNA kit (Qia gen, Hilden, Germany). The PCR products of hBD 1 gene were then digested by the restriction enzymes NlaIV, HgaI, and ScrF I, respectively. RESUL TS: AML patients had significantly different mutation frequency of at  position  44 and  20 in the 5â UTR (, p,0.000, p,0.05, respectively). Of the 47 patients with AML, alterations in FLT3 gene were detected in 13 (27.6%) patients. These mutations included FLT3/ITD in 9 (19.1%) and FLT3/TKD mutation in 4 (8.5%) patients. Statistically significant differences for  44 al   lele frequencies were found between patients with AML with the mutation of FLT3/ITD and the wild types of FLT3/ITD.CONCLUSIONS: These data suggest that HBD 1 is a potential tumor sup pressor gene for AML.

Non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) represents more than 80% of lung can  cers and is sub grouped in squamous cell carcinoma (SCC), adenocarcino  mas (ADC) and large cell carcinoma(LCC). SCC accounts for about 30% of all cases of patients with NSCLC. Mutations in ras oncogens appear to play  a significant role in the development of NSCLC. The role of HPV infection  in the development of carcinomas was also demonstrated. The aim of this study was to determine the association between HPV infection and K ras mutations in patients with SCC. DNA was isolated from Fifty patients with  histologically confirmed SCC. HPV typing was done by Nested PCR and di  rect sequencing. High risk HPV was detected in 9 (18 %) patients. HPV 18 was the most frequent type in the cases. To investigate gene  virus interac  tions, DNA from the 9 HPV positive and 9 HPV negative patients, as controls,  were subjected to mutation analysis in exons 2 and 3 of the K ras gene using direct sequencing. Among the two K ras exons tested, no mutation was  found in two groups. Our overall findings demonstrate that the HPV infec  tion has a significant impact on NSCLC. However, due to the small number of patients, our finding could not demonstrate a positive association between HPV infection and K ras mutation in patients with lung SCC. Our results are  preliminary and larger cohorts are needed for better understanding the  contribution of genetic alternations and HPV infection in lung SCC.",2012
 Comparison of Methylation Specific qPCR (MS qPCR) and pyrosequencing for the analysis of p16/INK4a in lymph node samples,P06.122,"L. De Chiara1, V. Leiro FernÃ¡ndez2, M. Botana Rial2, C.

Introduction: Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor gene p16/IN K4a has been found in a wide variety of neoplasia, suggesting in some cases its utility as diagnostic or prognostic tool. The aim of this study was to compare two methods (MS qPCR and pyrosequencing) for the quantitative methylation analysis of this gene.Methods: 62 patients with confirmed diagnosis of non small cell lung cancer were included (56.9% with ganglionar metastasis). DNA from lymph nodes was extracted and sodium bisulfite modification, required for both techniques, was accomplished. The same portion of CpG island containing 11 CpG sites was independently analyzed using both techniques. For the MS qPCR, pre amplification with universal primers followed by TaqMan based qPCR with methylation specific primers and probe was used. The relative methylation percent was estimated based on a standard curve build with variable proporti ons of fully methylated/unmethylated control and using MYOD1 to normalize the DNA input. On the other hand, templates for pyrosequencing were obtai ned amplifying bisulfite treated DNA with biotinylated primers. Methylation percent was calculated by averaging across all CpG sites interrogated.Results: Differences in the methylation percent were found between the two techniques, resulting in different cut offs for MS qPCR and pyrosequencing (2.25 and 9.95 methylation percent, respectively). According to MS qPCR, p16/INK4a promoter was considered hypermethylated in 33.33% of the cases with metastasis, and in 24.24% for pyrosequencing.Conclusion: Pyrosequencing and MS qPCR show good linearity for known me thylation percents. In this cohort positive predictive value was 100% for MS qPCR and pyrosequencing.FIS ISCIII PI09/90, ConsellerÃ­a Industria 09CSA053905PR, Samples from RE TIC FIS ISCIII (RD09/0076/00011).",2012

New advances in genetic pro  filing of sCRC suggest that the primary tumor may comprehend a cell popu  lation with metastatic potential. Here we compare the cytogenetic profile of primary tumors from metastatic versus non metastatic sCRC. Patients and Methods: We prospectively analyzed the frequency of numeri  cal/structural abnormalities of chromosomes 1,7, 8, 13, 14, 17, 18, 20, and 22 in 58 sCRC patients (31 non metastatic vs. 27 metastatic) through FISH analysis. Results: From a total of 18 probes, significant differences emerged only for  17p11.2 and 22q11.2. Patients with metastatic sCRC showed an increased frequency of del(17p11.2) (10% vs. 67%;p<.001) and del(22q11.2) (0% vs.  22%;p,.02) as compared to non metastatic cases.

Background: Pedigrees from Lynch families often include cases of cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is however not defined as an extra colonic cancer in Lynch syndrome. Therefore we set out to investigate if cervical cancer could be a part of the Lynch syndrome.Materials and method: We used data from the Danish HNPCC register on wo men from Lynch families with in situ carcinoma in cervical tissue (CIN III) or cervical cancers. We obtained tissue samples from 20 out of 29 patients. We conducted immunohistochemical staining for MMR genes (MLH1, PMS2, MSH2 and MSH6). We used a HPV (human papilloma virus) genotyping ana   lysis to identify infection.Results: Among the cervical cancers 5 were adenocarcinoma and 2 were squamous cell carcinoma. There were full correlation between the muta   tion in the family and the loss of either MLH1 or MSH2 expression. Loss of  expression of MMR genes was found in 5 of 7 (71%) cases of cervical carci  noma but in only one of the carcinoma in situ (p,0.007). All samples positive  of HPV were detected in squamous cell carcinoma in situ. Conclusions: The results indicate a relation between the MMR mutation found in families and  loss of MMR genes in cervical tumors. Our data also suggest that women  with Lynch syndrome are at higher risk of developing adenocarcinomas than the background population. Loss of MMR gene expression seems to  be a late event in the carcinogenesis of cervical cancer.

Therefore, we aimed to identify novel glioma relevant on cogenes located on 1q. We screened glioblastoma cell lines by array based  comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) and detected an amplifica   tion in 1q21.1 encompassing the ALC1 (amplified in liver cancer 1) gene in  LN308 cells. ALC1 (syn.: CHD1L) encodes the chromodomain helicase DNA  binding protein 1 like protein, a chromatin remodeling enzyme implicated as an oncogene with a major impact in hepatocellular carcinoma develop  ment. To explore whether ALC1 is of relevance for the tumorigenesis of ma  lignant glioma, we analyzed ALC1 copy number, mRNA and protein expressi   on in 28 glioblastomas and 11 glioblastoma cell lines, and functional effects  of ALC1 overexpression. Array CGH detected a copy number gain of 1q21.1  including ALC1 and increased ALC1 mRNA levels compared to astrocytes in  around 20% of glioblastomas, and protein expression was significantly in  creased in glioblastoma cell lines compared to astrocytes. While ALC1 ove  rexpression showed a significant increase in viability of glioblastoma cells,  which was reversible by RNAi, no significant influence on proliferation was  detected by determination of growth curve and cell cycle analysis, and col  ony formation and migration capacity were decreased in some glioblasto ma cell lines. No regulatory effects of ALC1 overexpression were observed  on epithelial (E cadherin, Î± E catenin and Î² catenin) or mesenchymal (N  cadherin, vimentin, fibronektin, Î± SMA, snail and slug) marker expression.

Several MC1R variants are associated with increased risk of malignant mela   noma (MM) in a variety of populations. The high diversity within the MC1R  gene observed in populations living in higher latitudes is explained by either  relaxation of selective pressure or by selection for lighter pigmentation in countries with reduced ultraviolet radiation. We aim to examine the influ  ence of the MC1R variants (red hair colour, RHC: D84E, R151C, R160W and  Non RHC: V60L, R163Q, T314T) on the MM risk in Caucasians and then re  strict the analysis to a well defined population (Canary Islands), adjusting for the main phenotypic pigmentation features. Methods: 938 Caucasian individuals were genotyped for MC1R variants by  SNaPshotÂ® and direct sequencing. 447 were MM patients (350 with three  generation of Canarian ancestors) and 491 were healthy control subjects  (296 Canarians) from general population. The analysis was adjusted for age,  sex, hair colour, eye colour, skin phototype and ancestry.Results: Carriers of the R151C and R163Q variants were at an increased risk  of melanoma (OR,2.78 (1.58 4.90) and OR,5.45 (2.44 12.18), respectively)  in the overall cohort. We observed similar results In the Canarian sample for  carriers of the R151C variant but the R163Q variant showed even a higher risk for MM (OR,7.15; 2.38 21.52). The risk of carrying RHC variants was 3.12 (1.92 5.05) in the Caucasian population and 2.27 (1.31 3.91) in the Ca  narian individuals. Conclusion: R151C and R163Q variants confer an increased risk of MM in  the analysed population.

 Identification of a new frameshift mutation in the MEN I gene,P06.140,M. Hedayati,"RIES, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Multiple endocrine neoplasia type 1 (MEN1) is an uncommon autosomal dominant cancer syndrome. The classical form of MEN1 is characterized by tumors of the parathyroid, pituitary, and pancreas. MEN1 is a tumor suppressor gene whose germline mutations have been reported in MEN1 syndrome. Although hyperparathyroidism in MEN1 syndrome is the most common manifestation, parathyroid carcinoma is rare. This study aimed to identify mutations in an Iranian pedigree with MEN1. In this report, we presented a male patient who was diagnosed at 44 year old with a primary  hyperparathyroidism (PHPT), parathyroid tumor, recurrent renal stones,  maxilla giant cell granuloma, thymic tumor, diabetes mellitus, and develo ped Cushing syndrome secondary to hypersecretion from neuroendocrine  tumor. Genetic analysis revealed a novel germline frame shift mutation in  exon 10 of the MEN1 gene, c.1642 1648dup. This heterozygote mutation is a duplication of seven nucleotides (GGTCCAG) which results in a prema ture termination codon at 558 (p.Val550fs). Three generation of his family  members were also evaluated for MEN1  gene, and the same mutation was  detected in one of his sons. Menin truncated protein due to the premature  stop codon in MEN1 gene seems to prevent interaction with various cellular  proteins, inhibiting tumor suppress activity of menin protein and increa  sing the potential for tumorgenesis. Finding the same mutation in a younger member of this patientâs family allows for prophylactic thymectomy and ho  pefully the avoidance of the malignant course seen in this patient. We sug  gest that in patients with ACTH producing thymic NETS, the possibility of MEN1 should be considered.",2012

It has proven that E cadherin to be widely down regulated and tightly as  sociated with tumor invasion and metastasis in multiple human cancer ty   pes. Recent researches have shown that aberrant methylation around gene promoter region attributes to E cadherin silencing. However, the detailed information about this epigenetic inactivation in squamous cell carcinoma  of esophagus (SCCE) is rare. For this reason, we studied for methylation at  the E cadherin gene promoters on 44 fresh tumor tissues and 19 non tumor adjacent normal tissues, obtained from 44 patients affected by squamous cell carcinoma of esophagus in Iran. Up to now, we have done DNA extrac  tion with phenol  chloroform method on tissue samples and the bisulfate  treatment on DNAs for carrying up methylation specific polymerase chain reaction assay (MS PCR). MS PCR has done with two set of specific primers  for methylated and unmethylated status of E cadherin gene promoter. Mo  reover, we have examined the expression of this gene by RT PCR with two set of specific primers for and Î²  actin. For this step, we tried to synthesis the cDNA on RNAs Extracted from above tissues. Though, we have finished the se experiments on most of samples, the results showed the 40%Methylation at the E cadherin gene promoter in the tumor samples, while none of the non tumor tissues exhibited the aberrant methylation. Also, RT PCR experi ments confirmed the expression of E cadherin in all of non tumor samples and unmethylated tissues. These data suggest that epigenetic silencing via aberrant methylation of the E cadherin promoter is a common cause of in activation of this gene in SCCE.",2012

In addition, 15 normal voided urine samples from sex  and age matched (Â±5) controls were included.Results: Methylation of TWIST1 was detected in %98.2 (55/56) of the ca  ses and methylation of NID2 was detected in %96.4 (54/56) of the cases in urinary bladder tumor tissues. Furthermore, methylation of TWIST1 and NID2 could be detected in %87.5 (21/24) and %95.8 (23/24) of the voided urine samples of bladder cancer patients, respectively. In 15 normal urine controls, no aberrant methylation was detected except for TWIST1 methyla   tion in only 1 normal urine sample (%6.6).

O 6 methylguanine DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) gene encodes a DNA repair protein that removes alkyl groups from the O6 position of guanine. Epigenetic modifications, such as hypermethylation along the promoter re gion, are a cause of gene inactivation and they are associated with better prognosis and benefit from alkylating agents. Assessing promoter hyperme   thylation of MGMT is therefore of great interest because it might have pro gnostic value, or be a predictive marker for therapy responses. We examined the promoter methylation status of 103 glioma patients by  Methylation Sensitive High Resolution Melting (MS HRM). After DNA ex   traction from paraffin embedded tumour tissues, genomic DNA was bisulfi  te modified. Initially a PCR was run using primers specific for modified DNA  but with no effective CpG nucleotides, then the HRM was performed. Finally, the data were statistically analyzed. MS HRM demonstrated positive methylation of MGMT in 80 patients (77.7  %) and no methylation in 23 patients (22.3%). In the group of long term survivors MGMT methylation frequency was even higher (14 out of 15 pa  tients, 93.3%). However, no statistical significance was reached comparing  the methylated and unmethylated groups according to the overall survival   the median survival was 10.5 and 8.2 months for the methylated and the un methylated group, respectively (p>0.05). Also, no significant survival benefit  was found in the methylated group of patients treated with chemotherapy  or radiotherapy.Our results agree with the high MGMT methylation frequency shown in ana   logue reports but contrary to them the methylated group in our study did not show any survival benefit.",2012

Burdenko Main Military Clinical Hospital, Moscow, Russian Federation, 4N.N. Blockin  Russian Research Center for Oncology, Moscow, Russian Federation. Sensitivity of gliomas to alkylating agents is determined to a great extent by the activity of the DNA repair protein O 6 methylguanine DNA methyltrans  ferase (MGMT) in the tumor cells: high activity of this protein forms the re sistant phenotype of the tumor. The MGMT gene located on chromosome  10q26.3 is a classic tumor suppressor gene. It is known that methylation of the MGMT promoter leads to both inactivation of the gene and increase of the  tumorâs sensitivity towards alkylating drugs. Methylation of the MGMT gene  promoter is currently considered to be the main marker of the tumourâs sen sitivity to the alkylating agent temozolomide. Deletion of 10q26.3 locus con taining the MGMT gene can be an alternative mechanism of its inactivation.  We have been the first to conduct a targeted analysis of loss of heterozygo sity (LOH) at the MGMT gene region on chromosome 10q26.3 in gliomas. A  panel of microsatellite markers to detect LOH in the area under study, which includes four intragenic and five flanking microsatellite polymorphisms, has been developed and characterized. Frequency of LOH evaluated by this assay in gliomas equals 51% (18/35). In all cases the deletion size excee   ded that of the MGMT gene. Thus, the deletion of the MGMT gene happens  more frequently than the methylation of the geneâs promotor. Substantial frequency of the MGMT geneâs deletions calls for more detailed research as  a potential marker of the gliomas sensitivity to alkylating drugs.",2012

Lynch syndrome is caused by germline mutations in DNA mismatch repair  (MMR) genes predisposing for early onset colorectal cancer/associated tu   mors with microsatellite instability, negative immunohistochemical staining and dominant inheritance, but in ~10 15% without germline mutation de   tection. The recessively inherited MUTYH associated polyposis (MAP) shows a va  riable phenotype which can overlap with Lynch syndrome. We analysed the two common MUTYH mutations p.Tyr197Cys and p.Gly396Asp in 83 MMR gene mutation negative patients with MSI H tumours showing loss of MMR  protein staining. We detected the pathogenic MUTYH mutation p.Tyr197Cys homozygously in one patient with clinical presentation of two adenocarcinomas and rectal  adenomas (56 years), urinary bladder carcinoma, sebaceous gland carcino  ma (revealing loss of MSH2 and MSH6 proteins and MSI H) (66 years) and positive family history. Tumor sequencing of the sebaceous gland carcinoma  showed two somatic pathogenic transversion mutations in MSH2, other tu   mors had transversions in KRAS. In three patients with MLH1 deficient tumors a heterozygous, monoallelic mutation in MUTYH was identified, but no second mutation or deletion in  MUTYH, OGG1 and MTH1. The incidence of 1,2% for biallelic MUTYH mutations in unsolved patients shows that two somatic mutations in MMR genes due to a base excision re pair deficiency is rare, but can mimick Lynch Syndrome.",2012
 Promoter hypermethylation of tumor suppressor genes in serum as potential biomarker for the early diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma,P06.155,"F. Tian, S. P . Yip, W. C. Wu","The Hong Kong Polytechnic University, Kowloon, Hong Kong","Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a common head and neck cancer in Southern China. Studies have shown that promoter hypermethylation of tu   mor suppressor genes may serve as a promising epigenetic biomarker for early diagnosis of NPC, which is of great significance in improving patientâs survival rate. Resulting from DNA leakage due to tumor necrosis or apopto sis, cell free circulating DNA in blood has been proven sharing a similar hy   permethylation status as the primary tumor. Therefore, cancer derived DNA in serum may be used for promoter hypermethylation status screening of tumor suppressor genes.In this study, cell free circulating DNA is extracted from 40 NPC patients be fore treatment and 40 age  and sex matched healthy subjects. Promoter hy   permethylation status of five tumor suppressor genes (RASSF1A , CDKN2A ,  DLEC1, DAPK and UCHL1) was assessed by methylation specific polymerase  chain reaction assay (MSP) after sodium bisulfite conversion. Differences of methylation status of five tumour suppressor genes and clinicopathological parameters (staging, age) between NPC patients and healthy subject would be compared.To date, promoter hypermethylation status of four genes has been analy   zed in 19 NPC samples. RASSF1A , CDKN2A , DLEC1 and DAPK  were found  to be methylated in 5.3%, 0%, 5.3% and 5.3% patients, respectively. Hy   permethylation of at least one gene was observed in 15% of the patients. Preliminary data suggest that the sensitivity of promoter hypermethylation detection of these fours genes in serum samples was low.

Double strand breaks initiate localization of DDR proteins such as gammaH2AX, 53BP1 and MDC1 forming nuclear foci which provide a platform for subsequent assembly of signalling proteins and disappear af ter successful double strand break repair. Here we comparatively analysed the DNA damage response in two different breast cancer epithelial cell lines from patients with germ line mutations in BRCA1 or NBN, respectively. We performed immuncytochemical assays to monitor the cellular response after irradiation with different doses (1.5Gy, 6Gy) and after different time points (0.5hrs, 24 hrs, 48hrs). There was a dramatically reduced level of  gammaH2AX and MDC1 foci formation in NBN deficient breast cancer cells  at 30 min after irradiation in comparison to wild type, while 53BP1 foci  were two fold reduced but clearly detected. BRCA1 deficient breast can  cer cells, in comparison with wild type and NBN deficient cells, showed a  heightened response to irradiation with an up to two fold increase of gam maH2AX, 53BP1 and MDC1 foci formation 0.5 hrs after treatment (1.5Gy, 6Gy). In addition, these cells showed a prominent delay in repair kinetics  after irradiation. In summary, the present results indicate a defective DNA damage response in two breast cancer cell lines with genetic mutations in double strand break  repair pathway genes. However, these deficiencies manifest at differential  stages and time points, suggesting that breast cancer can be functionally dissected according to the underlying germ line mutations.",2012

It is generally assumed that NAHR is mechanistically similar to allelic homologous recombination (AHR) between homologous chromosomes during meiosis. AHR associated crossovers are processed by Holliday junction intermediates. Where interacting homologous DNA se   quences exhibit nucleotide differences, mismatches in the recombining he teroduplex DNAs are to be expected. Recombination associated mismatch repair is typically biased, with the unbroken DNA strand being used as a mismatch repair template. This results in regions of marker loss in the bro www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012189 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters ken DNA strand, which are termed conversion tracts. Since mismatch repair  frequently proceeds via an excision based mechanism, AHR associated con  version tracts are usually continuous. However, the breakpoint regions of  several meiotic NAHR mediated rearrangements have been shown to exhi bit a pattern of discontinuous or âpatchyâ conversions. In order to investigate  whether patchy gene conversion is also a feature of mitotic NAHR events,  we investigated the sequence characteristics of the breakpoint regions of 25 type 2 NF1 microdeletions mediated by postzygotic (mitotic) NAHR bet   ween the SUZ12 gene and its pseudogene, SUZ12P . However, instead of pat   chy gene conversion, we observed precise transitions between sequences derived from SUZ12P and SUZ12, respectively, as evidenced by the analysis of paralogous sequence variants and SNPs. Further, we did not observe di  stinct types of breakpoint spanning fragments which would have been in  dicative of uncorrected mismatches resulting from the recombination. We conclude that recombination associated gene conversion events resulting  from heteroduplex associated mismatch repair are likely to be differently  processed during meiotic versus mitotic NAHR.",2012

In particular recurrent NF1 micro deletions have been investigated in detail. However, the mechanism under   lying non recurrent (atypical) NF1 microdeletions are not well delineated. NF1 microdeletions with non recurrent breakpoints are heterogeneous in terms of their size, breakpoint position and number of deleted genes. Fur thermore, extended sequence homology is not observed in the respective breakpoint regions. In this study, we have analysed 12 atypical NF1 dele tions using high resolution custom made array CGH. We could assign the breakpoints to regions of 1.2 6 kb. In six of these 12 atypical NF1 deletions, we identified the breakpoints at basepair level. Four of these six deletions were mediated by non homologous end joining (NHEJ) as concluded by the absence of or only minor (1 2bp) homology at the breakpoints. Two of these six NF1 deletions exhibited microhomologies of 24 and 33 bp at the bre akpoint sites indicative of microhomology mediated end joining (MMEJ) as underlying mechanism. We conclude that NHEJ or MMEJ are the prevailing mechanisms underlying non recurrent NF1 deletions that lack any comple xity at the deletion breakpoint sites. However, three of the 12 NF1 deletions investigated by us represent complex rearrangements most likely caused by replication associated erroneous template switches. Our study indicates for the first time, that also non recurrent NF1 microdeletions are mediated by a variety of mutagenic processes including mechanisms of double strand re pair such as NHEJ and replication based mechanisms such as Fork stalling and template switches (FoSTeS).",2012

Whereas 95% of all NF1 patients harbour mutations within the NF1 gene, 5% of NF1 patients exhibit large deletions of the NF1 gene and its flanking regions (termed NF1 microde   letions). Four types of NF1 microdeletions have been identified (type 1, type 2, type 3 and atypical) that differ with respect to breakpoint localiza   tion and the underlying causative mechanism. Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) has frequently been employed to identify NF1 microdeletions. However, the unambiguous typing of NF1 deletions is im possible in many instances due to the spacing of the probes included in the currently available MLPA kit (P122 C1, MRC Holland). Indeed, distinguis  hing between type 2 and certain atypical NF1 deletions is impossible using  this MLPA kit. In this study, we have developed an improved set of MLPA  probes that allows the unambiguous identification of type 2 NF1 deletions and potentiates breakpoint mapping by PCR. Using a combination of this  improved MLPA technique and breakpoint spanning PCR, we analysed 29  NF1 microdeletions initially considered to be type 2 deletions according to results obtained with the MLPA kit P122 C1. We determined that 23 of the  29 deletions were indeed classical type 2 microdeletions, with breakpoints  located in the SUZ12 gene and its pseudogene SUZ12P . However, 6 deletions turned out to be atypical exhibiting only one of both breakpoints within the  SUZ12 sequences. Taken together with 16 previously identified type 2 de   letions whose breakpoints have been localized, the analysis of a total of 37  type 2 NF1 deletions revealed a significant clustering of breakpoints within the SUZ12 sequences.",2012

BRCA1 and BRCA2 are the most important breast cancer susceptibility ge nes. The conventional BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation screening, performed by heteroduplex analysis and/or Sanger sequencing, is time consuming and has relatively high costs due to the absence of hot spots and to the high num ber of exons per gene. Usually, several months are necessary to complete the diagnosis. To overcome these limitations and to reduce the time needed for diagnosis, we designed a next generation sequencing protocol enabling simultaneous detection of variants in the two genes.For resequencing BRCA1 and BRCA2, we used Multiplex Amplification (MA   STR by Multiplicom) and the 454 GS Junior DNA sequencing instrument (Ro che Diagnostics), which is based on pyrosequencing. Bioinformatic analysis was performed by two complementary approaches: Our pipeline (which comprises mapping and comparing reads against the reference sequence, aligning reads, classifying and identifying of SNPs and mutations), and by the Amplicon Variant Analyzer (AVA) software from Roche. We successfully validated this technology with a set of 6 cases carrying known mutations previously detected by Sanger Sequencing, and a reference HapMap sample (NA12144).The application of this technology in 51 cases with suspected hereditary breast cancer, allowed the identification of 11 pathogenic mutations (3 mis sense, 1 novel nonsense, 6 frameshift and 1 splice variant), 6 unclassified variants and a high number of polymorphisms.Massive parallel resequen   cing of the BRCA1/BRCA2 genes is effective as a high throughput, rapid and cost effective methodology for routine diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.",2012

Unfortunately NIS expression is of   ten reduced in thyroid cancer; in many cases also his functionality is dama ged. Since PARP 1 is supposed to be part of a multimeric repressor involved in cancer NIS uderexpression, in this study various human thyroid tumour  cell lines (TPC1, BCPAP , FRO, WRO) were treated with the PARP inhibitor  PJ34, and the effects on the expression of NIS and several thyroid specific transcription factors, together with the activity of NIS promoter, were eva luated. PJ34 treatment didnât affect thyroid specific transcription factors ex   pression, whereas we observed a strong increase in NIS mRNA levels in all the cell lines. Accordingly, in transfection experiments performed in TPC1 cells, treatment with PJ34 increased NIS promoter activity. It is well known  that post translational histone modifications are involved in the control of  gene transcription. Thus, we have also investigated the epigenetic status of NIS promoter after PJ34 treatment in TPC1 cell line. In addition to an increa  se of activatory histone modifications (H3K9K14ac, H3K4me3) surprisingly  we observed also an increase of H3K27me3, a classical repressive mark.We concluded that PJ34 action, that implies mechanisms acting on epigene tic marks, is specific on NIS expression, suggesting it as a potential strategy to induce radioiodine sensitivity in human thyroid tumours.",2012

Introduction:  Non Small Cell Lung Carcinoma (NSCLC) is one of the most  serious cancers. For targeted biological treatment, sensitive and specific identification of genetic changes is necessary. Identification of genetic chan ges (mutations) within EGFR, KRAS and ALK oncogenes, associated with NS CLC, allows choosing the patients, which benefit from biological therapy.Material and Methods: DNA is isolated from biopsy and cytology speci   mens with verified histological diagnosis. Mutation detection is performed by real time PCR, fragment analysis, primer extension analysis and mutant enriched PCR. Wt EGFR patients (e.g. with no mutation detected) are tested for ALK gene rearrangement, causing the EML4 ALK fusion gene formation. Analyses are performed on histological slides using the FISH method.Results: Since 10/2010 till 12/2011, 199 DNA samples were analyzed. Out of these, 12 patients (6 %) were found to be positive for activating mutations within EGFR gene. Since 07/2011 till 12/2011, 54 patients were analyzed  for ALK gene rearrangement. This change has been proven in 2 cases. Discussion: Activating mutations of the EGFR gene correlate with therapeu  tic response to tyrosin kinase inhibitors. Frequency of mutations within the EGFR gene is 5   20 %. ALK gene rearrangement can predict therapeutic re  sponse for ALK inhibitors. These rearrangements are found approximately  in 5 % of NSCLC patients. Our results correlate with abovementioned fin dings . Occurrence of certain mutations, e.g. T790M, as well as KRAS gene  mutations and ALK gene rearrangements predicts resistance to TKIs the  rapy. Conclusions: Determination of tumor mutational status can provide power   ful tool for setting up strategy and therapeutic protocols in NSCLC patients.",2012

These patients are predisposed to develop a myeloproliferative myelodysplastic syndrome (MPD), the juvenile myelo monocytic leukemia (JMML). To date, few data concerning its incidence and prognosis are available.Methods 562 patients carrying a germline mutation of PTPN11 have been studied. JMML was diagnosed in 21 of them (NS JMML). In 11 other patients, hematologic anomalies suggestive of a MPD have been noted. Cytologic, ge netic and clinical features of these 2 groups of patients have been compared with 24 patients presenting a PTPN11 associated sporadic JMML.Results Hematological anomalies are found in 32/562 (5.7%) of NS patients and encompass a broad phenotypic spectrum ranging from transient MPD to JMML. Hematologic presentation of NS MPD and NS JMML is not different from sporadic JMML but the overall survival is considerably altered in NS JMML patients and boys. The mutation D61H of PTPN11, never reported in NS, is found in 2 patients with a particularly severe neonatal course. More generally, the spectrum of PTPN11 mutations is narrower in NS MPD and NS JMML patients than in the whole cohort of NS patients, with an increased incidence of mutations of the 61, 139 and 506 codons. We were not able to identify additional recurrent genetic alteration with the SNP array analysis of 12 NS JMML patients.Conclusion Some PTPN11 mutations are associated with an increased risk of JMML.

Genotype fenotype corre lations in patients with NF1 and ONG help to determine the risk group for developing a severe form of NF1.Materials and methods: We evaluated 51 Slovak patients with NF1 and divided then into two groups 1) with ONG (21 patients), 2) without ONG (30 patients). All of them underwent a clinical examination and molecular diagnostics of NF1 gene using protocol based on RNA. Results: In the group with ONG patients, there was a significantly higher  incidence of freckling (95%), brain hamartomas (71%) and neurofibromas (70%), compared to group without ONG. A half of mutations in the ONG group were located in the first 5âtertile (first 16 exons) of the NF1 gene. The   re were 15 novel mutations identified.Discussion: Our results confirm  the clustering of mutations in the 5â tertile  of NF1 gene in patients with optic nerve glioma and sugguest the incidence  of a more severe form of NF1.

Besides technologic advances, the genetic mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis and progression of this disease are still not clear; thus the improvement in the diagnosis and treatment is limited, which means scarce benefit to the patients. The main goal of this study was to characterize the genetic profile of the OSCC by Multiplex Li   gation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA). We also applied array CGH, not only to corroborate the MLPA results but also to identify putative key regions associated to OSCC. To achieve these purposes, biopsies of tumor and biopsies from resection margin of the same patient, were acquired from 23 patients with diagnosis of OSCC. Tissue from healthy donors was used as control. The array CGH from tumor biopsies was performed using a 4x180K  oligonucleotide microarray. With the MLPA we detected frequently losses in chromosomes regions of 3p, 4q, 5q, 8p, 9p, 11q and gains in chromosomes regions of 3q, 6p, 8q, 11q, 16p, 16q, 19q and 20q. The analysis of the tissue from resection margin identified alterations spread over several chromo somes, namely in 6p, 9p, 16p, 17p, and 19q. With array CGH we detected imbalances in all chromosomes. In conclusion, this kind of studies improves the understanding of these devastating tumors through identification of key chromosomal regions involved in tumor biology, which may be very useful to the follow up of these patients and also allows the development of novel therapeutic targets.",2012
 Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism as prognostic indicator for oral cancer,P06.170,"K. Zeljic1,2, G. Supic2, M. Stamenkovic Radak1, Z.

Among numerous iden   tified polymorphisms in the VDR gene, FokI (rs2228570) is considered as functional polymorphism and results in synthesis of 427 amino acids long protein, while mutated form results in synthesis of protein shorter for three  amino acids. It could be assumed that this functional polymorphism has in  fluence on survival and may be used as oral cancer prognostic indicator. The goal of this study was to investigate the association of VDR FokI polymor   phism with oral cancer survival. The study was performed in 110 patients  with diagnosed oral cancer. Genotypes were determined by the PCR RFLP  method. All data were statistically analyzed using the SPSS software. The VDR FokI polymorphism was associated with a decreased overall survival  (p,0.042, log rank test). Patients with wild type ff genotype had significantly  worse survival (p,0.012, log rank test) compared to the heterozygous and  mutated variants together. Stratified analysis by the lymph node involve  ment and tumor stage revealed that wild type ff genotype was associated  with the poor survival in groups with and without lymph node involvement  (p,0.025, p,0.040, respectively) and in stage III tumors (p,0.026).

Through gene expression profile analysis of 22 epithelial ovarian cancers coupled with purification of cancer cell population by laser microbeam microdissection (LMM) on a microarray, we identified a num ber of transcripts that were over expressed in ovarian cancers. Altogether, we identified 273 transcripts that were commonly up regulated and 387 transcripts that were down regulated in ovarian carcinomas. Among these 273 transcripts identified, only 87 (31.9%) transcripts were reported as up regulated genes in previous microarray studies, in which bulk cancer tissues and normal ovarian tissues were used for the analysis. We further propose a number of genes probable to be good candidates for a target therapy of ova rian cancer. Among them we focus on CHMP4C (chromatin modifying pro  tein 4C) that was over expressed very commonly in ovarian carcinoma, but were not expressed in the normal human tissues examined.

Heterozygous PMS2  germline mutations are associated with Lynch syndro  me. Up to one third of PMS2 mutations are genomic deletions. Their detec  tion is complicated by a pseudogene (PMS2CL), which owing to extensive in terparalog sequence exchange closely resembles PMS2  downstream to exon  12. A recently re designed multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) assay identifies PMS2 copy number alterations with improved relia  bility when used with appropriate reference DNAs. We used this assay to study 13 patients with PMS2 defective colorectal tumors. Three presented deleterious alterations: (i) An Alu mediated deletion strengthening the view  that the high frequency of PMS2  deletions is related to a high density of Alu  elements within the genomic sequence of the gene. (ii) A 125 kb deletion encompassing at least two further genes with tumor suppressing functions in a young colorectal cancer patient. This raises the possibility that PMS2   mutations of this type may confer a higher penetrance of tumor suscepti bility.

The prevalence in Europe and the USA has been rising constantly over the last decades. Yet, therapeutic options are limited. The BMBF supported project âIndividuaLIVERâ aims at establishing an individualized immunothe  rapy for primary liver cancers. This approach is based on the detection of somatic mutations in tumor tis sue. Hence, we sequenced a pair of tumor tissue and blood sample in one pa  tient suitable for vaccination. Both samples were conditioned and sequen   ced using a targeted whole exome resequencing approach. The on target  ratio was 0.79 / 0.77 (tumor / blood), overall coverage at a depth of 10x was 91.6 % / 90.44 %. With stringent filter criteria, we were able to detect a to  tal of 23 somatic sequence changes suitable for vaccination. The laboratory  turnaround time is estimated to be 6 7 weeks. Validation was carried out using a second bioinformatic analysis method and a deep sequencing ap  proach with customized targets (av. depth: 728x). We were able to confirm  12 somatic variants. All sequence changes were further prioritized by an HLA allele specific SYFPEITHI score. Taken together a total of 3 sequence  changes were rated suitable for HLA and mutation specific vaccination. Using this approach, we are able to detect somatic sequence changes within tumor tissue that might lead to successful individualized immunotherapy within a reasonable time frame.

Despite intensive scientific efforts basic molecular reasons mostly remained obscure. Lately, it became evident that alterations in the DNA methylation pattern can be one of the leading causes for tumour formation. Therefore, we initiated the first high throughput sequencing study investigating geno me wide DNA methylation patterns in a large cohort of 104 human prostate tissues including normal controls using MeDIP Seq. Comparative analyses identified more than 147,000 cancer associated epigenetic alterations, af fecting more than 75% of homeobox genes and 50% of the known cancer associated genes in their promoter region.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012195 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters We could show that the increased expression of EZH2, originating in about  50% of prostate tumours in an ERG involving fusiongene (TMPRSS2:ERG),  might explain the remarkable differences in DNA methylation between tu   mour and normal tissues. The methylation patterns, however, are strikingly  more dissimilar in TMPRSS2:ERG fusiongene negative samples to normal  prostate tissues than those in fusiongene positive tissues. We identified a  mechanism of hypermethylation of miRNA 26a as an alternative pathway of ERG independent EZH2 activation which in turn can explain the observed increase in differential methylation in fusiongene negative tumours.",2012
 Interaction of the RAD51 paralogs in the mammalian 2/3 hybrid system,P06.186,"D. Endt, A. Niklaus, D. Schindler","Department of Human Genetics, Wuerzburg, Germany","The five RAD51 paralogs, RAD51B, RAD51C, RAD51D, XRCC2 and XRCC3, play an important role in homologous recombination, a process crucial for  the error free removal of DNA double strand lesions. These proteins share  20 30% homology and interact with each other and the RAD51 recombi nase, an ortholog of E. coli RecA. Previous investigations in the yeast two  hybrid system, co immunoprecipitations from human cell extracts and co  expression in the baculovirus system have shown that the paralogs form two complexes, RAD51C/XRCC3 and RAD51B/RAD51C/RAD51D/XRCC2. RAD51B has been reported to stabilize the interaction of RAD51D and  XRCC2. Here we aimed at extending these findings in a human cellular envi  ronment. For that purpose we used the mammalian two  and three hybrid system (M2/3H). We cloned full length cDNA of each of the five RAD51 pa ralogs into the pM and pVP16 vectors. In M3H studies, the additional ex   pression vector pCMV Tag3b was used. Firefly luciferase (pGl4.31) served as reporter gene for the assay. As control for transfection efficiency we co transfected renilla luciferase (pRL null). As internal standard and positive control we employed the reported interaction of FANCA and FANCG. In M2H studies the previously reported interactions were confirmed, except that of RAD51C and RAD51D. This weak interaction required the presence of RAD51B for activation or stabilization, whereas XRCC2 did not boost it. Li   kewise, some of the other interactions were be influenced by a third paralog in M3H studies. Additional RAD51 protein seemed not to effect interactions of RAD51C/RAD51D and RAD51D/XRCC2 but those of RAD51C/XRCC3 and RAD51C/RAD51B.

The ubiquitin ligase VHL triggers the degradation of  the hypoxia inducible factor Î± (HIFÎ±) under normoxic conditions. HIF is the major transcription factor reacting to hypoxia. As in the majority of cases  this tumour is resistant to chemotherapy. Therefore, the aim of the study  was to identify possible new diagnostic and therapeutic target genes, like VHL, in the HIF pathway in 24 RCC cell lines derived from patient tumour tissue. The cell lines were characterized with respect to mutations in VHL,  the expression profile of HIF associated genes (HAF, FIH, VEGF, CMET , MITF,  EGFR, TGFÎ²R) at RNA and protein level, proliferation, anchorage indepen   dent growth and activation of signalling pathways. The cell lines show a high  variability concerning generation time in general and with respect to serum  reduction and anchorage independent growing. The identified expression profile of HIF associated genes reveals possible target candidates for dia  gnostics. VHL sequencing identified both known and unknown mutations.  Most of the VHL mutations were found in exon 1. 11 of 18 analysed cell li nes had no VHL mutations in exon 2 and 3. First results gained by linking immune blots and expression profiling suggest a correlation of FIH protein  expression with HIF target gene vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)  expression.

In germinal retino  blastoma (40% of all retinoblastomas) a germline RB1 cancer predisposing   mutation is present in all of the bodyâs cells. Therefore molecular diagno stics of germinal retinoblastoma is performed by PCR assays targeting the RB1 gene with genomic DNA, obtained from peripheral blood. Mutational  analysis of RB1 transcripts obtained from peripheral blood using current se   quencing standard   Sanger capillary sequencing (which sensitivity is about  15%) is complicated by the nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD), an mRNA surveillance pathway that ensures the rapid degradation of mRNAs  containing premature translation termination codons. The Next Generation  Sequencing (NGS)   technology Roche 454 is based on pyrosequencing. It means that each sequenced fragment is clonally copied. This allows increa  sing of sensitivity under 1% Method: In amplicon covering transcript of RB1 gene we applied the 454 Titanium chemistry assay (454 Life Sciences) to perform ultra deep sequen   cing of specific cDNA PCR products using the GS Junior System sequencer from Rocheâs 454 Life Sciences. In median, 5 446 reads per amplicon were generated, thereby allowing a highly sensitive assessment of mutational burden in RB1transcripts of retinoblastoma patients. To assess sequencing  error rates, we included a control amplicon from the normal transcript.

PÃ©rez de  Nanclares1","1Hospital Txagorritxu, Vitoria Gasteiz, Spain, 2Hospital Santiago ApÃ³stol, Vitoria  Gasteiz, Spain","The succinate dehydrogenase complex subunit D (SDHD) gene, located on  chromosome 11q23, encodes an anchoring subunit of the mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II. It functions as a tumour suppressor gene and causes hereditary paraganglioma type 1 when mutated. Renal tumours have also been associated to SDHD mutations.Mutations in SDHD exhibit a clear parent of origin effect, with autosomal dominant paraganglioma occurring only with paternal transmission, though maternal transmission has been rarely described. Since the maternal allele of SDHD is not methylated, a number of hypothetical mechanisms have been suggested to explain the observed transmission pattern: 1) an unidentified tumour suppressor gene is inactivated in the imprinted region on chromo some 11p15; 2) the maternally derived SDHD is partially inactivated; 3) tis sue specific quantitative imprinting of SDHD confers subtle allele specific expression differences.Our aim was to characterise the inheritance pattern of SDHD Trp5Stop mu tation in a 4 generation family, mainly affected with paraganglioma.Twelve microsatellite markers on 11p15 and 11q13 q23 were genotyped in germline DNA from 15 mutation carriers, as well as in tumoral DNA from the 6 patients (4 paraganglioma, 1 pheocromocytoma, 1 renal tumour). All the tumours, except the renal one had paternal inheritance of the mutation and showed LOH of the twelve microsatellites. The mutation was inherited from the mother in the patient with a renal tumour, who also had prostate cancer. In the latter, LOH of the twelve microsatellites was found in the renal but not in the prostate tumour, which confirms that maternal inheritance of SDHD mutations can cause this disorder.",2012

It has been proposed as a candidate gene to encode transcription factors regulating downstream genes in the human testis with an antiapoptotic effect. Its expression in can cer cell lines has implied a similar role for it in the process of tumorigenesis. Method: The human breast cancer cell lines MDA MB 231 and MCF 7 were cultured in DMEM medium supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum,100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 Î¼g/ml streptomycin. Cells were transfected with pGFP V RS plasmid having RHOX1 specific shRNA cassette and plasmid with scrambled sequence cassette as the negative control. Transfection efficien   cy was monitored by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) 24 hours post transfection. RNA was extracted from cells 48 hours after trans fection and cDNA was synthesized. Quantitative real time RT PCR was per formed for RHOXF1, CASP8, BCL2 and HPRT genes. Results: Decreased RHOXF1 expression was confirmed in cells after trans  fection. shRNA mediated knock down of RHOXF1 resulted in significant  decrease in BCL2 expression in both cell lines but no change in CASP8 ex   pression. Discussion: RHOXF1 can mediate transcriptional activation of the BCL2 in  cancers, so render tumor cells resistant to apoptotic cell death induced by anticancer therapies. shRNA targeting RHOXF1was shown to specifically mediate the RHOXF1 gene silencing. shRNA mediated knock down of RHO  XF1 can be effective in induction of apoptotic pathway in cancer cells via  BCL2 downregulation, so it can have potential therapeutic usefulness in hu man breast cancer.",2012

We are currently investigating the contribution of aberrant splicing of  BRCA1/2 genes to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer. A powerful approach  to study the splicing outcomes of DNA variants is a splicing reporter mini gene especially when patient RNA is not available. We constructed a single  minigene of 8 BRCA2 exons (19 to 26) in a pSPL3 derived plasmid in 5 clo  ning steps, which is, as far as we know, the largest BRCA2 minigene ever reported. The genomic fragment from exons 19 to 26 is more than 27 kb in length that was reduced to a final insert of 4.7 kb with internal deletions of  introns 20, 21, 24 and 25.This construction was transfected in HeLa cells  and we observed a main RNA isoform of the expected size of 1.5 Kb that con tained the vector constitutive exons and BRCA2 exons 19 to 26. Several spli  cing variants of each exon were generated in the wild type minigene by PCR  mutagenesis and assayed to demonstrate the usefulness and reliability of this large construction. Splicing reporter minigenes are straightforward and  robust tools to distinguish between pathogenic mutations and innocuous  variants. The use of minigenes with several exons facilitates the analysis of putative splicing variants in a single minigene and emulates the physiologi   cal genomic context where the splicing reactions take place.

Since HRM characte rizes nucleic acid samples based on their disassociation (melting) behavior, the nucleotide sequence of amplicon is an important factors affecting the melting curve.The STK11 gene encodes a member of the serine/threonine kinase and regulates cell polarity and function as a tumor suppressor gene. The germ line mutations in this gene are associated with Peutz Jeghers syn drome. The patients with this syndrome are prone to some types of neo plasm.Genomic DNA was extracted from the whole blood samples of 56 patients with various gastrointestinal cancers. The nucleotide changes in the entire STK11 gene were analyzed by Real time PCR and HRM technique.The nucleotide screening by HRM technique showed two types of SNPs in introns 6 and 7 of STK11 gene in 10 patients. Four patients had C / T substi tution [cluster id/dsSNP/rs9282860] with homozygous genotype in intron 6, and six patients showed a C/G substitution [cluster id/dsSNP/rs2075607] with heterozygous genotype in intron 7.

Synovial sarcoma (SS) is an aggressive type of tumor, comprising approxi mately 10% of soft tissue sarcomas. Over 90% of SS cases are characterized by the t(X;18)(p11.2;q11.2) translocation, which results mainly in the for  mation of oncogenic SS18 SSX1 or SS18 SSX2 fusions. In a typical SS18 SSX  fusion transcript, exon 10 of SS18 is fused to exon 6 of SSX1/2. However, se   veral variant fusion transcripts have been already described. In the present study, we examined the fusion transcript type in a series of 40 primary un treated SS tumor specimens using reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (RT PCR). We detected SS18 SSX1 transcript in 22 (55%) patients  and SS18 SSX2 transcript in 17 (42,5%) patients, while in one patient none of SS18 SSX1/2 fusion transcripts were identified. Among the cases under study, two tumors carried novel SS18 SSX1 and SS18 SSX2 variant transloca   tions that were allegedly created by an alternative splicing and in additional case an unusual translocation variant previously described by other group was found. Our data suggest that alternative splicing may play an important  role in novel fusion transcript formation and additionally we show that it  may be a recurrent event in SS.

In 43 cases with features of T PLL acquired over the last 25 years we identified TCRAD breaks in 93%, TCL1 breaks in 74% and MTCP1 breaks in 14%. TCL1 and MTCP1 breaks were mutually exclusive. Two cases contained a TCRAD break with a partner other than TCL1 and MTCP1 and 3 cases did not show breaks in any of these three loci. To determine the pattern of secondary genetic changes on a base pair level we have performed custom full genome sequencing of flow sorted T PLL cells and corresponding non T cells of the same patients using Complete Genomics* technology. Initial analyses of the first three pa tients suggest the genomic landscape of T PLL to be highly complex with a mean number of 150 protein changing somatic single nucleotide mutations and in dels.

White1","1Monash Institute for Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia, 2Erasmus MC, Rotterdam,  Netherlands","MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are endogenous small non protein coding RNAs which regulate basic cellular processes. There is considerable evidence that  expression of miRNA genes is deregulated in human cancer, and specific  over  or underexpression has been shown to correlate with particular can cer types. Testicular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are the most common malignancy af  fecting males between the ages of 15 and 45 years, and are associated with significant morbidity including infertility. These cancers are most common ly formed from undifferentiated fetal germ cells contained within the testis. There are several methods for identifying variants in DNA. High resoluti  on melting curve (HRM) analysis and multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) are two sensitive, cost effective and high throughput  techniques for rapidly screening a large number of DNA samples. To identify  point mutations we performed HRM analysis on eight miRNA loci implica   ted in either testis cancer and/or pluripotency. To identify deletions and du  plications we developed an MLPA mix containing probes that recognize 50  miRNA sequences that have been identified as being deleted or duplicated  in tumours. We have carried out a pilot study using these two approaches on 48 TGCT samples. To date we have identified a number of potential variants that we  are currently confirming with independent techniques. Given the success  of this initial screen we plan to study an additional 100 DNA samples. Our  findings will give a better understanding of the genetic basis of testis cancer,  and may lead to improved diagnostic or therapeutic protocols.",2012

The main aim of our study is to analyze the function of TGIFLX  protein. One way to analyze transcription factors in eukaryotic cells is to  study their nuclear localization, as reported for various organisms such as human and land plants using pEGFP N1 vector, a eukaryotic expression vec  tor encoding EGFP . Methods: We cloned entire coding sequence of TGIFLX gene into above  plasmid and subsequently, SW48 and Caco2 colorectal cancer cell lines was  transfected with the recombinant vector harboring TGIFLX cDNA.

Since 5% of these nodules are malignant, all thyroid nodules have to be clinically evaluated to discern benign from malignant cases. The current method of choice for diagnosis is based on fine needle aspiration (FNA) followed by cytological evaluation. Despite many advances in the diagnosis and treatment of thyroid nodules this method has a high rate of suspicious or indeterminate (e.g. follicular neoplasia) diagnosis. Patients with such a suspicious diagnosis will undergo surgery. The consequence is an extensive overtreatment of patients, as only approximately 20% of the indeterminate cases will be identified as mali   gnant at surgery.In the present study we address the call for minimally invasive diagnostics based on state of the art molecular techniques to clearly discriminate bet   ween the different benign and malignant thyroid entities.

Therefore, we used miRBase Sequence database to identify  microRNAs that potentially regulate C1orf24 expression. miR106b was selected for further validation by quantitative PCR in 64 thyroid nodules (09 CVPTC, 18 FVPTC, 11 FTC, 11 HCA and 15 FTA). The data obtained by  qPCR showed that the expression of miR106b was down regulated in mali   gnant lesions compared to benign lesions (p value 0.0060), while C1orf24  expression presented high levels in malignant ones (p value 0.0018). There  fore, to investigate whether miR106b modulates the C1orf24 expression,  miR106b was transiently transfected into a follicular thyroid carcinoma cell line (WRO), which we have previously show to have high levels of C1orf24  expression. The results showed that the ectopic expression (30nM at 72hr)  of miR106b decreases both C1orf24 mRNAs (p value < 0.05) and proteins le vels when compared to negative control. These finds suggest that miR106b may modulate C1orf24 gene expression and may play an important role in thyroid tumorigenesis.

Additionally, we could demonstrate  that VPA specifically induces re expression of cyclin D2 in human colorectal and mammary gland adenocarcinoma cell lines, whereas VPA treatment has  no effect in NIH/3T3 fibroblasts. Moreover, the intensity of re expression is  dependent on the inhibition of proliferation, because for NIH/3T3 cells no inhibition of proliferation after VPA treatment was observed.The re expression of cyclin D2 can also be achieved by other HDACis. The conclusion that cyclin D2 re expression observed in cancer cells after the treatment with VPA is activated by an increase of histone acetylation was shown by chromatin immunoprecipitation studies for the promoter region of the cyclin D2 gene.

Pharynx tumors presented overexpression of VEGFxxx. VEGFxxxb was underexpressed in oral cavity tumors. Overexpres   sion of both VEGF isoforms was observed in aggressive tumors. There was a positive correlation among ASF/SF2, SRp55 and SRp40 proteins and both VEGF isoforms, and among SRPK1 protein and ASF/SF2, SRp55 and SRp40 in tumor tissues. The results suggest that both VEGF isoforms play a role in angiogenesis promotion in head and neck tumors. VEGF isoforms present differential expression related to the anatomic sites of tumor and tumor ag gressiveness. ASF/SF2, SRp55 and SRp40 proteins are involved in the regu lation of the VEGF gene splicing mechanism.",2012
 The additional effect of VHL and PTEN mutations in tumour development,P06.217,"R. Keppler, C. Steinwender, K. Reicherter, B. Zabel, E. Lausch","Centre for Paediatrics and Adolescent Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany","The von Hippel Lindau (VHL) protein is well described as an ubiquitin E3 li gase for HIFalpha subunits but plays also a role in microtubule stability, ECM formation and cilia assembly. Due to germline mutations in the VHL gene patients develop retinal and CNS haemangioblastomas (HBs), pheochromo cytomas (PCCs) and clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCCs). Interestingly, cy   stic lesions of VHL patients possess an increased activation of phosphoino   sitide 3 kinase (PI3K) pathway and downstream mTOR signaling. The PI3K pathway is negatively regulated by PTEN which is one of the most frequently inactivated tumour suppressor genes. Partial deletion of Pten in mice results in tumour formation in a tissue specific manner. As PCCs are also part of the PTEN associated tumour spectrum, we hypothesized that VHL and PTEN may interact functionally in tumour suppression.Here, we present two Vhl knockin mouse models with endogenous tumour formation. The effect of Vhl type IIB (V2B) and type IIC (V2C) germline mu tations was analyzed over several generations. Additionally, Vhl knockin mutations were also combined with hemizygous inactivation of Pten, and  the impact on tumour spectrum, incidence and tumour progression was in  vestigated in over 300 mice of the distinct genotypes at the ages of 3 to 12 months. Pten knockout mice developed various tumours at 9 to 12 months  independent of the Vhl genotype. Furthermore, V2B mice displayed a clear  Vhl genotype dependent effect on the development of renal cysts. Additio   nally, we observed a significantly increase in incidence and tumour mass of  PCCs in V2B and V2C compound hemizygous mice.",2012
 Variability in von Hippel Lindau disease Manifestation rate throughout life,P06.218,"M. M. Poulsen , E. Budtz JÃ¸rgensen, M. Bisgaard","Department of Cellular and Molecular Medicine, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen  N, Denmark","Background Clinical management and counseling of von Hippel Lindau (vHL) families is  complicated by variable phenotypic expression. Natural history of disease  progression is not fully understood, and better knowledge of specific fac torsâ influence would greatly benefit vHL management. We aim to describe  the variability in vHL manifestation development throughout life and to as  sess association to gender and genotype.MethodsFull medical records were collected from 52 VHL mutation carriers, 26 fe  male and 26 male. Patients were followed from birth, and age dependent manifestation rates were analyzed using Poisson regression. Relative rates between age groups were compared using robust standard errors which al   lowed for heterogeneity between patients. Effects on manifestation rates of  gender and genotype (truncating mutation versus missense mutation) were  determined. ResultsOverall, 381 manifestations were diagnosed in 42 subjects, while 10 were asymptomatic mutation carriers. Maximum manifestation rate was reached  in the 30 34 year age group with 0.880 manifestations per year ((95% CI:  0.57 1.36). Compared to the 30 34 year group, the relative rates of espe   cially the younger, but also of older groups were lower. We found a trend  of a higher relative manifestation rate among patients with truncating VHL  mutations compared to those with missense mutations (p, 0.060) and less  when comparing men and women (p, 0.58). Conclusions Rate of manifestation development is associated to age, increasing from birth to the 30âies. Also, truncating VHL mutation carriers seem to have a  higher rate of tumor development. Better knowledge of factors influencing  phenotypic variability will facilitate surveillance targeting and counseling  of affected families. P07. Cancer Cytogenetic",2012

Rearrangements of the CIZ gene result in attachment of  various 5â partner gene sequences to form CIZ fusion genes. The CIZ gene  has three known partners: TAF15  at 17q12 (16 cases), EWSR1  at 22q12 (4  cases), and E2A  at 19p13 (3 cases).

However, recurrent aberrations of other regions of chromosome 11 without identification of al   tered gene have been described. The aim of this study was characterization  of chromosome 11 aberrations in bone marrow and peripheral blood cells  of AML patients and mapping of recurrent breakpoints using conventional and molecular cytogenetic methods (FISH with BAC probes, mFISH, mBAND and aCGH). During years 2006 2011, chromosome 11 aberrations were proved in 55  (17%) out of 318 newly diagnosed AML patients. We identified approximate ly 30 different chromosome 11 breakpoints, 13 as recurrent (in chromoso   mal bands 11p15, 11p13, 11p12 p11.2, 11q13.2, 11q14.2, 11q21, 11q22.3, 11q23.3) and two altered genes: MLL (11q23.3) and  NUP98  (11p15). In conclusion, chromosome 11 aberrations are the most frequent cytoge netic abnormalities in AML with many repeated as well as sporadic break   points on both short and long arm. The  MLL gene is famous for the great  number of partner fusion genes. We identified two new MLL gene transloca  tions. The breakpoint localization in chromosomal regions without known gene associated with leukemogenesis predicts their involvement in mali   gnant process. However, the reason for breakage and role of genes localized at the breakpoint for cancer origin and progression is still under discussion. Therefore, the significance of new chromosomal breakpoints could be re vealed by further studies only.Supported by grants MZOUHKT2005, MZOVFN2005, COST EuGESMA.",2012
 Do vessel forming endothelial cells in B cell lymphomas carry the hallmark chromosomal translocation and belong to the tumor cell clon?,P07.03,"K. Korte1, W. Klapper2, R. ZÃ¼hlke Jenisch1, R. Siebert1","1Institute of Human Genetics, University Hospital Schleswig Holstein Campus Kiel/ Christian Albrecht U, Kiel, Germany, 2Institute of Pathology, University Hospital  Schleswig Holstein Campus Kiel/ Christian Albrecht University Kiel, Germany, Kiel, Germany","Angiogenesis is one of the hallmark features of cancer. Recently it has been suggested that vessel forming endothelial cells in B cell lymphomas could be derived from clonal tumor cells (Streubel et al., 2004). This hypothesis was based among others on the observation that the hallmark chromoso   mal translocations in these lymphomas, i.e. t(14;18) in follicular lymphoma, t(8;14) in Burkitt lymphoma and t(11;14) in mantle cell lymphoma, were de   tectable in microvascular endothelial cells of various B cell lymphomas. To independently corroborate these findings we here investigated vessel nuclei by means of interphase FISH for the presence of t(8;14)(q24;32), t(14;18)(q32;q21) or t(11;14)(q13;q32) in 28 B cell lymphomas known to carry these characteristic translocations. Simultaneous immunofluorescence stai ning of endothelial cells using a vWF antibody and of B lymphocytes using a PAX5 antibody was performed to accurately distinguish these cell populati   ons from each other. All investigated samples carried the hallmark translo cations in a significant number of B lymphocytes. Additionally, we observed FISH patterns suggesting presence of these translocations in cells surroun ding blood vessels as well as in some vascular intraluminal and intramural nuclei. Nevertheless, we failed to unambiguously distinguish nuclei from en dothelial cells from lymphocyte nuclei. Thus, we investigated whether clonal B lymphocytes invading blood vessel carrying the entity typical hallmark translocation could be mistaken for endothelial cells. Indeed, immunofluo rescence staining showed intramural and intraluminal PAX5 positive cells in vessels and vessel walls. In summary, we failed to unambiguously assign clonal cells carrying the lymphoma specific translocations to endothelial cells. Instead, nuclei with lymphoma specific translocations in vessels could  exist due to vessel invading neoplastic lymphocytic cells.",2012

Currently, high throughput methods such as array  comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH) together with single nu  cleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays are available to study genome wide aberrations. We identified highly complex large scale alterations of 13 cervical tumors  (spinocellular carcinoma stage IA IIIB) using genome wide microarrays (Agilent). The most common regions of copy number gain were 3q22qter (6/13), 20q11q13.3 (5/13) and 8q21.3qter (4/13) and of copy number loss  13q11q21.2 (4/13), 3q and 4q (3/13). Patients with lymph nodes positive  for metastases had often duplications in regions 2p, 5p and 19p and deletion at 3p compared to patients with lymph nodes negative for metastases. However, array CGH was not able to detect gains at 3q26 and 8q21 in four  patients as compared to results obtained by Cervical FISH Probe Kit (Ab bott). This kit allows simultaneous identification of HPV infected cells and  copy number aberration of the hTERC (3q26) and MYCC  genes (8q21). Fai  lure of array CGH in detecting these aberrations can be probably explained  by their presence in HPV infected cells only whose abundance was very low in the four patients. Array CGH represents a perspective method for whole genome screening  and identification of potential biomarkers, which may enable a better risk stratification of HPV positive women. Nevertheless, reliable determination of DNA copy number aberrations re  quires either tissue sections from representative regions of tumor or FISH analyses of selected genes.

The parallel presence of two clones with the different forms of 13q14 deletion has been  noticed only once so far. By detailed metaphase analysis (G banding, FISH)  on IL2 and DSP30 stimulated CLL cells, we revealed the translocation form of 13q14 deletion in 13 of 135 patients with 13q14 deletion (13/135; 10%).

The main characteristic is the Philadel phia chromosome and the tyrosine kinase inhibitor imatinib mesylate is the  treatment of choice.Purpose: To investigate whether intermittent dosing of imatinib is also an  effective treatment in minimizing the adverse effect. Material Method: A 6 year old girl presented with abdominal pain, leu  kocytosis (27.8x10 9/L) and thrombocytosis (1.072x109/L). Bone mar  row studies suggested the diagnosis of CML. Cytogenetic studies revealed 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11). The translocation was confirmed by FISH and RT PCR. Treatment with imatinib was initiated at 400mg/m 2/day, followed  200mg/m2/day when minimal residual disease (MRD) was undetectable. MRD reappeared positive, so the dose was adjusted to 400mg/m 2/day but  the patient experienced dry skin and significant hair loss. To avoid toxicity, the drug was given on alternate months (one on/one off).Results: MRD is undetectable and the patient is in stable remission three  years following the end of the treatment.Conclusions: No guidelines exist regarding dosage and duration of treat ment with imatinib, especially for childhood CML.

Hospital Clinic, Barcelona, Spain. INTRODUCTION: Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is characterized by va  riable clinical course. The most frequent chromosomal abnormalities are trisomy 12, deletion of 13q14.3, 11q22.3 and 17p13; all of these are a rele vant prognostic factor. Clonal evolution (CE) is defined as acquired aberrati on during the disease course.The goal of this study is to determine the frequency of CE in CLL patients using conventional and molecular cytogenetics and its relationship with prognostic markers such as CD38 and ZAP70.MATERIAL AND METHODS: Seventy three patients with CLL were analysed  by conventional and molecular cytogenetics (FISH) at diagnosis and during follow up. Median time of observation after first analysis was 32 months (range 5 116). The second study was undertaken at follow up (n,34), at cli nical progression before treatment (n,24), and at relapse after treatment (n,15).   RESUL TS: CE was observed in 38/73 (52%) of the patients using both tech   niques. The 70% (14/20) of patients with CE by conventional cytogenetics had normal karyotype at diagnosis. On the other hand, the 63% (19/30) of patients with CE by molecular cytogenetics had FISH abnormalities at dia gnosis.CE was detected during follow up (14/34); at progression before treatment (12/24); and relapse after treatment (12/15) which was correlated with CE (p,0.042). In relation to ZAP 70, it was differentially expressed in patients with CE (p,0.039).CONCLUSION: Clonal evolution is a significant event in CLL patients.

Introduction: Cell cytoskeleton is composed of microtubules formed by po  lymerization of tubulin. Antitumor drugs that perform on the microtubules are divided in three groups according to the zone of interaction: Vinca, Col chicine and Taxan binding domain. First and second one prevent tubulin po lymerization. Paclitaxel is a microtubule stabilizing agent. We have studied the effect of three new molecules that bind on the colchicine domain in two cell lines of colon cancer.Experimental design: Cell lines were treated with drugs A, B and C, derived from the isocombretastatin and Paclitaxel with a concentration of 50 nm. The cells were collected at times 24, 48 and 72h after incubation with the drug, using as negative control untreated cells (0h). Protein were removed from each culture and we prepared cultures for immunofluorescence analy   sis. Expression studies of tubulin was performed by Western Blot. We per formed a study of cell death by flow cytometry. Finally, we made a study of immunolocalization and stability of microtubules by immunofluorescence.Results: Our results show that none of the new drugs reduce or increase the amount of tubulin. The viability study showed that Drug A and B not induce apoptosis, however, Paclitaxel and Drug C significantly increased apoptosis after 24 hours of exposure. Drug A does not induce changes in the microtu bules at 72h, Drug C and Drug B produce a destabilization of microtubules and inhibit tubulin polymerization.Conclusion: None of these drugs improve the effect of paclitaxel.Supported by FIS PI 10/00219",2012

Subsequently, she developed graft versus host disease in 1990, suggesting possible rejection of donor cells. Afte rrelapse in 2000 her chromosome analysis demonstrated the karyotype 46,X, X, t(1;7)(p10;p10), add(4)(p16),t(9;22) (q34;q11.2), 15,+3mar[16]/46,XX,der(9)add(9)(p24)t(9;22)(q34;q11), add(18)(p11.3), 19,der(22)t(9;22)[4]. Since Gleevec treatment was unsuccessful due to intolerance, follow up studies in 2006 revealed persistence of known Ph+ clones and an additional Ph+ clone.

Subsequent studies demonstrated donor cells  with T8 in 15 35% of metaphases. Constitutional T8 was ruled out as the  donorâs blood karyotype was normal. T8 is an additional anomaly in 10% of  CML cases emerging at the time of acute transformation and after imatinib treatment. Although engraftment is an immediate response, the cytogenetic  evidence of donor cells did not become apparent due to the proliferative do   minance of Ph+ clones. Dasatinib treatment in our patient effectively remo  ved the dominant Ph+ clones, facilitating the detection of donor cells with T8. Since the etiology of DCL and the significance of the T8 in donor cells in  our patient are unclear, the patient is monitored closely for secondary MDS  /AML.",2012

Background: Chromosomal abnormalities are important prognostic factors in chronic lymphocytic leukaemia (CLL). Interphase FISH (I FISH) is stan dard method for detection of important aberrations in CLL. However, pro gress in cultivation technique such as application of CpG oligonucleotides and IL 2 as B cell mitogens allows to reveal another chromosomal aberrati ons. Recently, gain of the short arm of chromosome 2 (2p) was found as one of recurrent aberrations.Aims: Metaphase cytogenetic and molecular cytogenetic analyses were per formed in 477 CLL patients from 2008 to 2011 to find out gain of 2p.Methods: Conventional cytogenetics was performed on peripheral blood or bone marrow samples cultured in medium with stimulants. I FISH was per formed on unstimulated cells for detection of trisomy 12, del(11q), del(13q), del(17p). Gain of 2p was confirmed by multicolor FISH, the range of the gain was determined by multicolor banding.Results: Gain of 2p was detected in 20/477 (4,2 %) cases. In 17/20 cases, the partial trisomy of 2p was identified as a result of unbalanced transloca   tion with other chromosomes and direct duplication of 2p was presented in 3/20 cases. Four of all these cases had jumping translocation of 2p (in one case together with direct duplication of 2p). I FISH revealed aberrations in 19/20 cases. The most frequent abnormalities were del(13q) and del(11q).Conclusion: Mitotic stimulation using CpG oligonucleotides and IL 2 is an efficient method that can improve quality of cytogenetic analysis. Detection of another aberrations i.e. gain of 2p provide new prognostic information in CLL. These findings can significantly modify prognosis of patients evaluated by FISH.",2012

Purpose: To present the case of a pediatric patient with BCR/ABL1 positive  CML who was treated with imatinib and achieved remission, but transfor   med to lymphoid blast crisis (BC) with detected deletion of Ikaros within  205 days following diagnosis. Material Method: A 12,5 year old girl presented with leukocytosis and  bone marrow (BM) studies suggested the diagnosis of chronic phase (CP) CML. Cytogenetic analysis demonstrated 46,XX,t(9;22)(q34;q11). The pati   ent was treated with imatinib (400mg/m 2/day) and achieved remission. Results: On the 205th day, the blood test revealed a 73% blast count and BM  studies suggested a diagnosis of B cell ALL. Cytogenetic findings revealed  46,XX,der(3)t(1;3)(q12;p26),t(9;22)(q34;q11). FISH analyses were negati  ve for translocations, but three copies of PBX1 were detected. MLPA analysis revealed a deletion in Ikaros, including exons 4 8, and in the EBF1 gene, in  exon 1. No copy number variation was found in the BM sample from the CML  diagnosis. The patient received chemotherapy according to the ALL IC BFM 2009 protocol plus imatinib (400mg/mÂ²/day), but failed to achieve comple te remission and the duration of survival from the onset of BC was 75 days. Conclusions: Abnormalities of Ikaros are associated with a very poor out  come and a high rate of relapse in childhood leukemia. Deletion of Ikaros was not detected in CP CML, but was identified as an acquired lesion in the  BC CML sample. This finding suggests that alterations in Ikaros contribute  to the pathogenesis of BCR/ABL1 ALL.",2012

The exact pathogenesis of MB remains unclear.  Up to date multiple molecular dysfunctions are known to be responsible for medulloblastoma formation, including aberrant activation of the Sonic  Hedgehog or Wingless signaling pathways as well as mutational inactivation  of DNA repair genes results in genome instability. The most common genetic alterations identified in medulloblastoma is isochromosome 17 (currently reported in 30 50% of patients).

Identification of copy number aberrations (CNAs) in genome of PCs plays a key role in MM pathogenesis and is supposed to have important prognostic significance for MM patients. Combined utilization of array CGH technique and FISH proved to be a po werful toll in MM diagnostic. There are two major genetic entities in MM. Hyperdiploid group (H MM), which include about 50% of MM patients and have is commonly characterized by gains of odd numbered chromosomes and lower prevalence of IgH translocations. Non hyperdiploid (NH MM) ca  ses are connected with frequent incidence of one of several recurrent IgH  translocations: 4p16 (FGFR3 and MMSET), 11q13 (CCND1) or 16q23 (MAF)  and are associated with adverse prognosis. Using combination of array CGH and FISH technique, we found CNAs in 100% of cases (106/106). Most com mon CNAs were found in 1p, 1q, 6p, 8p, 13q, 14q, 16q and 22q along with gain of extra copies of odd numbered chromosomes. Hyperdiploidy was found in nearly half of the cases (48%) with subgroup of cases with +11 and with gain(1q) and del(13q) Translocation t(4;14)(p16;q32) was found in 12% (14/81 cases)and it was more common in non hyperdiploid cases (P,0.041), deletion TP53  was observed in 14% (15/106). Most common  homozygous deletions were found 1p32.3, 11q22, 13q14 and 16q22.

INTRODUCTION: Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a group of clonal haematopoietic stem cell diseases characterized by cytopenia(s), dysplasia in one or more of the major myeloid cell lines, ineffective haematopoiesis, and an increased risk of developing acute myeloid leukaemia (AML).  Chro  mosomal abnormalities are detected in half of patients with the novo MDS.  The infrequency of balanced translocations in MDS makes their identificati  on and reporting imperative for the recognition of the recurrent ones. This increases the likelihood of identifying which genes are possibly involved in  the pathogenesis of the neoplasia. OBJECTIVE: Identify the frequency of balanced translocations in a series of 1,850 patients with MDS included in the database of the Spanish group of myelodysplastic syndromes (GESMD). RESULTS: Two hundred and twelve (11%) balanced translocations were  diagnosed in 1,850 SMD patients. The chromosomes more frequently invol ved were chromosome 1 (n,34), 2 (n,31), 3 (n,30) and 5 (n,16). All chro  mosomes were involved in the translocations, with the exception of chro  mosomes 19, 20 ,22 and Y. Half of the translocations were found as a part of a complex karyotype (>,3 chromosomal abnormalities). One hundred and  seventy six (83%) translocations were not previously described neither in  MDS nor AML. Nine new apparently recurrent translocations were found in our series.CONCLUSION: Balanced translocations were found in 11% of MDS patients,  half of them being involved in complex karyotypes.",2012

Imatinib CML therapy have shown the high effectiveness but primary and secondary resistance is observed in some cases. The aim of this study was  to elucidate the influence of low level clones of BM cells with BCR ABL gene amplification (GA) to the results of CML imatinib treatment.Bone marrow samples from 174 CML patients (pts) were analyzed by cyto genetic and FISH analysis. 200 interphase nuclei were analyzed after hybri dization with dual color/dual fusion BCR ABL gene probe (âVysisâ) in each case. According to the ELN criteria (2009) 51 pts have achieved optimal or suboptimal response, 86 pts have failure and 37 pts have loss of achieved response.FISH did not revealed BCR ABL GA in pts with optimal and suboptimal re sponses. Additional copies of BCR ABL gene (from 1 to 7) were found in 32 (37,2%) pts with primary resistance and in 12 (32,4%) pts with secondary resistance. The probability of complete cytogenetic response (CCyR) achie vement in pts with BCR ABL GA was significantly lower than in pts without it (31,6% vs. 63,8%, p,0,000025). All Pts with additional copies of BCR ABL gene were subdivided in 4 quartiles (Q) in accordance with % of BM cells with BCR ABL GA. The probability of CCyR achievements in pts of Q1 Q2 (1 6% BM cells with BCR ABL GA) do not differ from pts of Q3 Q4 (7 72% BM cells with BCR ABL GA) (p,0, 86454).In conclusion, the pts with low level clones with BCR ABL GA have the same unfavorable prognosis as well as pts with high level clones.",2012

Sperling1","1Institute of Medical and Human Genetics, Berlin, Germany, 2The ChildrenÂ´s Memorial  Hospital, Warsaw, Poland","The chromosomal instability disorder, Nijmegen breakage syndrome (NBS), is characterized by microcephaly, growth retardation, immunodeficiency, hypersensitivity to X irradiation, and predisposition to malignant tumours, especially lymphomas. Nibrin, the product of the NBN gene, is part of the  MRE11/RAD50 complex, which is involved, amongst others, in the repair of DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). The majority of NBS patients are of Cen   tral and Eastern European origin and carry the common founder mutation in the NBN gene, 657del5. Skin fibroblasts, derived from a 9 year old NBS  patient showed a mosaic of normal diploid cells and those with an unbalan   ced translocation, resulting in partial monosomy for 6q and 13q21âqter, and partial trisomy for 20q11.2âqter, as confirmed by G banding, CGH and chromosome painting. The relative proportion of these aberrant cells in creased during propagation of the cell line. This was due to a faster cell cycle, as shown after BrdU labelling and is paralleled by a shorter telomere length, as demonstrated by T/C FISH (telomere/centromere FISH). Moreover, after treatment with 0.5 and 1.0 Gy the aberrant cells showed significantly more chromosomal aberrations than the diploid cells in the same flask. This chan ce observation proves that the aberrant cell line has a selective advantage and thus may represent a first step in malignant transformation.",2012

Acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is the most  likely SMN to occur during the first 5 years following treatment.Purpose: To describe the case of a pediatric patient with Neuroblastoma  (NBL) stage III, who developed secondary AML at 4 years following cessa   tion of treatment. Material Method: A 2,5 year old boy was diagnosed with stage III NBL on  the adrenal and received chemotherapy. No cytogenetic study to NBL was  performed. The mass progressively decreased and 1 year later the follow up  was negative. Eight months after the cessation of treatment, a local relapse of NBL was revealed and treated with partial resection, radiotherapy and  chemotherapy. One year later, a second local relapse was revealed and a to  tal resectomy of the mass achieved complete remission.Results: Four years following the cessation of treatment (eight years after  NBL diagnosis), the patient was admitted with anaemia (Hb 7,3 gr/dl) and  thrombocytopenia (PLTs 5000/Î¼l). A secondary AML was diagnosed. FISH analysis revealed MLL rearrangement in 60% of the nuclei and cytogenetic analysis showed 46,XY,t(11;19)(q23;p13.3). The patient received chemo   therapy according to AML BFM 2004 protocol and MLL rearrangement was detected in 29.4% on the 15th day of treatment.Conclusions: NBL is the most common solid tumors in childhood. However, little is known about the factors that determine the long term risk of SMN following this type of cancer.

To achive a better understanding of telomere length and its possible impact on development of chromosome aberrations, we analy   zed the telomere length of the karyotypically well characterized HeLa cell line. HeLa cells have a hypertriploid chromosome number with specific numerical deviations and clonally abnormal chromosomes known as HeLa signature chromosomes. Karyotypic heterogenity is also present exhibiting âsharedâ and âuniqueâ karyotypic alterations. To measure the telomere length of individual chromosomes we did sequential analysis of metaphase spreads using telomere/centromere fluorescence in situ hybridisation (T/C FISH) as well as multi colour FISH (M FISH) to identify the marker chromosomes unequivocally. In the present study, individual telomere length was highly heterogeneous. Telomere length was associated with both frequency and type of chromosomal aberrations. The telomere length of derivative chromo somes, which were present in almost all metaphases did not differ from the average telomere length. However, derivative chromosomes appearing only in few cells showed great variability in telomere length (0% up to +643%) compared to the average telomere length. Regarding the type of chromo some aberration small marker chromosomes and isochromosomes showed significantly longer telomeres than deletions and complex translocations.Our results imply that recurrent aberrations have passed the point of short telomeres and high instability. Their telomeres may be stabilized and even increase in length possibly depending on the type of aberration. P08. Statistical genetics, includes Mapping, linkage  and association method",2012

Pathogenesis of abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA)  is connected with abnormal extracellular matrix remodeling with the assi   stance of extracellular matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs) inhibit their activity. Any imbalance in the MMPs/TIMPs ratio may cause various disorders. A decrease of tissue inhibi  tor of metalloproteinases 2 (TIMP2) gene expression was detected in AAA  patients. Recently, a  418 G/C (rs8179090) polimorphism of the TIMP2 gene promoter, influencing the transcription rate of the gene has been described. The aim of this study was to investigate whether  418 G/C gene polimor  phism was associated with AAA in the Polish population. Methods. TIMP2 gene promoter polymorphism was evaluated by polyme rase chain reaction followed by restriction enzyme analysis and pyrose   quencing in 128 patients affected with AAA and 180 individuals treated as references. The control group was directly matched to patients according to common risk factors of vascular diseases. Results. The genotypes distribution was 17 CC, 5 CG, 106 GG in the 128  AAA cases and 12 CC, 0 CG, 168 GG in the 180 control subjects. The fre quency of the C allele was significantly higher in the AAA patients than in the control group (P,.0005, OR,2.516).

One of very few confirmed genetic association findings differentiating alcoholics from non alcoholics is with variants in the inhibitory gamma amino butyric acid a2 receptor subunit (GABRA2 ) gene. Also according to the recent genome  wide association study variation in autism susceptibility candidate 2 gene (AUTS2 ) was strongly associated with alcohol consumption. Population  stratification and ancestry differences within populations may compromise the success of association studies. Therefore analysis of genes variants in homogeneous ethnic groups is of great importance.We designed a classical case control association study for two polymorphis   ms: rs279858 in GABRA2  and rs6943555 in AUTS2  that were tested for asso   ciation with alcoholism. 307 men with ICD 10 diagnosis of alcoholism (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs), and matched control groups were typed for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique.In Russian population the frequency of individuals carrying the *G allele of  rs279858 polymorphism was significantly higher in patients with early onset alcoholism as compared with the healthy controls (p,0.03;OR,1.40).

So far, over 90 loci and 40 genes have been mapped for autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL).One of the loci related to ARNSHL, DFNB49, is located on the long arm of chromosome 5. The gene responsible for the hearing loss in this locus is MARVELD2 , which encodes an essential protein called TRIC. DFNB49 was first described in our neighboring country, Pakistan, and is estimated that approximately 1.06% of the causes of ARNSHL in this popu lation, is due to MARVELD2  gene mutations. To determine the contribution of MARVELD2  gene in Iranian deaf populati   on, one hundred and forty four ARNSHL families with two or more affected individuals originated from different ethnic groups of Iran were chosen for the screening of this geneâs mutations. Among these families, which were subjected to homozygosity mapping using flanking STR markers of MAR   VELD2 , one family showed linkage to DFNB49. TRIC gene sequencing in this  family led to the identification of a novel mutation (c.1543delA) in exon 6 which causes a premature stop codon [p. (Lys517ArgfsX16)].According to our result, it is computed that 0.7% of families with ARNSHL in our country manifest hearing loss due to mutations in the MARVELD2  gene  and it shows the low contribution of this gene in Iranian population.

There is a need to communicate to the medical community this variation and reasons for the differences.Methods: Using a NYC cohort (N,1,857 women) we evaluated the model  performance between two prediction models including non genetic and genetic risk factors (BCRAT and IBIS), by assessing accuracy through the Hosmer Lemeshow goodness of fit statistic and discrimination by the area under the receiver operating (AUC) characteristic curve. We assessed dif   ferential model performance (accuracy and discrimination) in subgroups defined by broad covariates.Results: We observed substantial difference between the two models in  estimating lifetime risk: IBIS was better calibrated and showed greater discrimination than BCRAT . Additionally we compared the discrimination and accuracy of the two models for covariate specific subgroups. The obser   ved/ predicted ratio was better for IBIS than for BCRAT for all subgroups except those defined by race. In addition, IBIS was better than BCRAT in identifying women who went on to develop cancer except for the subgroup of women with at least one breast biopsy.Conclusion: There is a need for a single accurate model that performs well for all women. In our cohort, we found that overall prediction was better in IBIS for almost all covariate specific subgroups of women, including women who were not gene carriers and who had a more limited family history. Thus, enhancing existing models such as IBIS with additional risk factors (number of biopsies and race/ ethnicity) may further improve the performance.",2012

For the purpose of a genome wide association study (GWAS) 127 CBE pati   ents of Central European ancestry were genotyped using Illuminaâs Bead chips and compared to 525 ethnically matched population based controls.  After standard Quality Control (QC) procedures the data set was subjected  to imputing based on 1000 Genomes Project reference panels. After app   lying post imputation QC, single marker analysis was conducted using a lo  gistic regression (additive model). Our analysis yielded promising results,  including a genome wide significant finding (P , 4.55 x 10  8) for a SNP near  the SALL1  gene. Interestingly, mutations in SALL1  have been reported to  cause Townes Brocks syndrome, a rare genetic disease with (among others) anorectal and urogenital/renal malformations. Currently, replication of the top associated SNPs (n,88) is been carried out in additional 200 cases and ethnically matched controls (n,500).Our data provide the first GWAS for CBE patients in a reasonable large co hort with this rare malformation. While our top finding SALL1  represents an  excellent candidate for urogenital malformations, further studies are war ranted to verify these findings.",2012

While carrying three copies of ge nes or other functional genomic elements on chromosome 21 increases the risk for CHD, trisomy 21 itself is not sufficient to cause CHD. Thus additio   nal genetic variation and/or environmental factors could contribute to CHD risk. Here we use association studies to identify genomic variations that in concert with trisomy 21, determine the risk for CHD in DS. This case control GWAS includes 187 DS with CHD (AVSD,69, ASD,53, VSD,65) as cases, and 151 DS without CHD as controls. Chromosome 21 specific association study revealed rs2832616 and rs1943950 (both cis eQTLs for KRTAP7 1 gene) as CHD risk alleles (adjusted p values < 0.05). Furthermore rs2183593 and rs7282991 (both cis eQTLs for ADARB1 gene) were identified as risk fac tors for ASD. Since DS is likely to be a disorder of gene expression, 2 locus interaction was applied for whole genome eQTLs. A pair of interacting eQTL on chr2 and chr11 was identified. Furthermore, a search for chr21 risk CNVs for CHD was performed using a customized chr21 array of 135K probes across 55 DS CHD and 53 DS controls. It revealed two CNV regions (FDR,0.04) located in the region previously associated with CHD risk in DS and another CNV region (FDR,0.03) upstream of POFUT2 gene.

We show that a meta analysis on different types of data can be performed to increase statistical power, permitting us to identify significant associations to 3504 unique genes. We compared the eQTLs that had been identified using RNA seq and array based data and observed a concordance of 95% in allelic directions, indica ting highly consistent results.Our study indicates that different types of RNA seq datasets can be well combined and that meta analysis of RNA seq is a logical step forward to gain better insight into the genetic regulation of gene expression variation.",2012

Schindler1","1Department of Human Genetics, University of Wuerzburg, Wuerzburg, Germany,  2Laboratory of Genetics, National Institute on Aging, National Institutes of Health,  Baltimore, MD, United States","Fanconi anemia (FA) is a rare autosomal or X chromosomal recessive disea   se that can be regarded as a model for genomic instability, premature aging and tumorgenesis. Each of the 15 genes, whose products are members of the FA/BRCA pathway for genomic maintenance, have been identified to be causative for FA. FAAP100 is an additional member of the FA core complex but has not yet been found to be mutated in FA patients. It forms a subcom plex with FANCL and FANCB and protects both components for proteolytic degradation. After siRNA depletion or gene knockout FAAP100 deficient cells show features comparable to other FA cells defective of FANCD2 mo noubiquitination. Because FAAP100 is a FA candidate gene, we screened se   ven FANCD2 monoubiquitination deficient cell lines by Sanger sequencing of all exons and adjacent introns portions. We detected eight common SNPs registered in the dbSNP database and a non annotated heterozygous syn onymous single base substitution in exon 9 which cannot be causative for FA. Additionally, we found an alternative splicing event via sequencing cDNA of the FA cell lines. This event occurs because of the presence of a cryptical splice donor and results in skipping of 414 bp (c.1760_2173del414). In or   der to test an association with FA we examined FAAP100 transcripts in a control cell line. Since we detected the same alternative splicing event in the control it seems not likely to be causative for FA. The alternative transcripts could be involved in cell cycle dependent or tissue specific gene regulation, a role that will be studied in further experiments.

Genetic variants near the FC gamma receptor (FcÎ³R) locus are associated  with several immune related diseases. However, most FcÎ³R genes are loca  ted in complex regions of segmental duplications (SD) and they are there  fore not well covered by the genotyping platforms. To be able to identify copy number variants (CNVs) in this locus, we first developed a method to  analyse CNVs using principal component analysis of the raw intensity values  of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped on the Immunochip platform. This platform includes 1,159 SNPs in the SD block of FcÎ³R genes; of these 1,019 (88%) failed our quality control for SNP analysis but their  intensity values are informative for the CNVs estimation. We identified se   veral CNV loci in the FcÎ³R block. Second, we confirmed our results via an  independent method   arrayCGH genotyping   and observed a perfect cor   relation in CNV estimation between both methods. Third, we applied our method to an RA cohort (3,326 cases; 3,397 controls). We found no asso   ciations between these CNVs with RA (p > 0.05). We are now applying our  method to cohorts of celiac disease and inflammatory bowel disease, in total  ~20,000 subjects. Fourth, by performing functional studies we observed a  correlation between the number of FCGR3A gene copies and FCGR3 (CD16) expression on T cells.Conclusion: We have developed a method to accurately estimate CNVs based on SNP intensity data that can be extended to other SD loci in the human genome.",2012

Higher quality genotype calls and better call rates will reduce time spent on quality control and decrease Type I and II error in genome wide association studies.We present a Bayesian mixture model for genotype calling from array al   lele signal intensities, with parameter estimation and calls augmented by genotype likelihoods from sequence data. The method successfully identi fies and discards spurious data and is capable of handling individuals with missing values, for example, a subset of individuals may have only been as sayed on an array and not sequenced.

We have previously presented initial penetran ce data for four families with over 400 individuals, mainly resident in one region, who carry the same Factor H mutation [c.3643 C>G (p.

Methods: The samples were genotyped with the Affymetrix 5.0 array. We  randomly masked 5% of the markers directly genotyped on chromosome 12 (n,1,046) and compared the imputed genotypes with the microarray geno  type calls. The concordance rates between imputed and observed genotypes  reflect imputation accuracy and the proportion of non missing genotypes indicate imputation efficacy.Results: Using an INFO threshold of 0.9 to define valid genotypes, the single  step imputation approach produced slightly higher concordance rates than  the two step strategy (99.1% vs. 98.4%   HapMap phase II combined panel), but at the expense of a lower proportion of non missing genotypes (85.5%  vs. 90.1%). The 1,000 Genomes panel produced similar concordance rates  to the HapMap phase II panel (98.4%), but increased substantially the pro portion of non missing genotypes (94.7% vs. 90.1%). The average INFO  scores of alleles with frequencies <1% was much lower than the scores for  alleles >5%.Conclusions: The program IMPUTE had an excellent imputation perfor   mance for common alleles. Genotype concordances were higher than 98.4%  using all the imputation strategies. The best balance of imputation accuracy  and efficiency was obtained with the 1,000 Genomes panel.

Various genetic po lymorphisms have been reported that they might be associated with OA. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) is a critical component of the renin angiotensin system, and a large body of evidence indicates its proinflamm atory role. The aim of the present study was to examine the possible role of angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) insertion/deletion (I/D) gene poly   morphism as a risk factor in the development of knee OA.Meterial and Method:In this study, we studied 102 (60 women, 42 men) patients with knee OA and 150 (87 women, 63 men) healty control groups.

 A robustness study of parametric and non parametric tests in Model Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction for epistasis detection,P08.28,"J. M. Mahachie John, E. S. Gusareva, F. Van Lishout, K. Van Steen","Montefiore Institute, University of Liege, Liege, Belgium","Model Based Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MB MDR) is data mining technique that enables the fast identification of epistasis, without the need to make restrictive assumptions about the modes of inheritance. The most commonly used implementation of MB MDR involves testing one multi locus genotype cell versus the remaining cells. By construction, this procedure creates two imbalanced genetic groups that subsequently need to be compared. To date, for continuous traits, we have adopted a standard F test to make such group comparisons. However, when either the assump tion of normality or homoscedasticity or both are violated, highly inflated type I errors and false positives are to be expected. In this study, we assess, through simulations, the effects of aforementioned model violations on the performance of MB MDR to detect epistasis signals, and propose remedial measures in order to maintain efficiency. Since important lower order ge netic effects can also give rise to inflated type I errors or false positive epi static effects, we restrict our simulation study to pure epistasis models. In particular, we consider normal, chi square and t distributions with constant and non constant phenotypic variances. In all simulating settings, we apply the standard F test , as well as a novel implementation based on the Welchâs F test .The original traits were either left untransformed or first transfor   med into new traits via rank and logarithm transformation, or via a rank transformation to normality.In conclusion, when performing MB MDR screening for gene gene interac tions with quantitative traits, we recommend to first rank transformtraits to normality, prior to classical F testing.",2012

The main symptom MSD pati   ents suffer from is pain. As prior studies have demonstrated that genetic polymorphisms of different proinflammatory cytokines are associated with pain, our goal was to find out whether cytokine polymorphisms are also as sociated with MSD. Blood from 148 MSD patients and 149 demographically matched healthy controls was used for genotyping of nine polymorphisms located on seven cytokine genes. Thereafter statistical analysis was perfor   med. In addition to the examination of possible associations with MSD, we searched for correlations with individual thermal and mechanical detection and pain thresholds, which were determined by quantitative sensory testing (QST). Association with MSD was found for alleles and genotypes of rs16944 (interleukin 1Î²), rs1800629 (tumor necrosis factor Î±) and rs909253 (lym www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012215 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters photoxin Î±).

The results of  our previous studies showed that frequency of MYF6 964TT genotype and  964T allele was significantly higher in endurance athletes in comparison with control subjects. The 964T allele carriers had 5% bigger cross sec   tional area (CSA) of m. rectus femoris in comparison with 964CC genotype carries. In the present study the DNA of 8 young healthy physical active males and  26 elite ice skaters was genotyped using PCR RFLP method. Histomorpho   logical and immunohistochemical analyses were conducted. Percentage  composition and CSA of muscle fibers were measured. Average CSA of muscle fibers in young males was almost two times larger among TT genotype carriers (41385 Â± 14636 mkmÂ²) in comparison with CC homozygotes (23065 Â± 20691 mkmÂ²) and heterozygotes (25642 Â± 20084 mkmÂ²), (P < 0.0001). Content of fast muscle fibers in ice skaters was 40.7 Â± 2.4% and content of slow fibers was 66.4 Â± 2.5%, which did not differ among MYF6 genotypes. In TT homozygotes average CSA of both types of muscle fibers was larger than in CC homozygotes and heterozygotes (TT   6278.8 Â± 1560.4 mmÂ², CC   5500.7 Â± 852.7 mmÂ², CT   5195.4 Â± 1278.8 mmÂ²; P , 0.04).In conclusion, the results of this study in two independent samples have shown the association of 964TT genotype with larger CSA of muscle fibers.

Little is known about the molecular bases of normal hearing function and age related hearing loss (ARHL) or presbycusis. Thus, research still needs to study hearing as a complex trait and to understand genetic factors un derlying ARHL. To reach this goal an integrated strategy has been designed based on: A) GWAS on hearing quantitative traits as well as on ARHL qua litative traits, and B) expression studies in wildtype mice (at 4 and 5 days postnatal) using immunohistochemistry and confocal microscopy of genes identified by the GWAS. Up to now, for hearing quantitative traits we have run 2 meta analyses of GWAS data (one with 6 isolated European populati   ons and 1 adding samples from Caucasus and Central Asia), while for ARHL (qualitative traits) a candidate gene analysis has been performed. Matching all the data we defined a list of 27 candidate genes that have been chosen for expression analysis. 5 candidate genes show strikingly specific expression in the cochlea (e.g at the top of sensory hair cells and in the marginal cells of the stria vascularis) while the other 12 are located in multiple cell types in the cochlea. Additional studies now in progress include the identification of variants in genes confirmed by expression analysis, the development of mouse models, and replication of the data.In conclusion, preliminary results prove the useful combination of GWAS and expression studies in providing new insights into the molecular basis of hearing function and ARHL, and may suggest new targets for hearing im pairment treatment and prevention.",2012

Its etiology is multifactorial, with both genetic  and environmental factors contributing to this craniofacial malformation. Several genes have been suggested to play a role in NSCL/P development. However, only the IRF6 gene has shown a convincing degree of consistency  across studies. Recently, the forkhead box E1 (FOXE1 ) gene on chromosome  9q22 has emerged as promising candidate gene (Moreno et al., 2009). In that study, comprehensive genetic analyses in NSCL/P samples from diffe rent ethnicities revealed two markers, located inside a 70 kb LD block con  taining FOXE1, to be strongly associated with NSCL/P . Also, Foxe1 knockout  mice show a clefting phenotype, providing further evidence for FOXE1  being  a susceptibility gene for NSCL/P . However, so far, the genetic findings on FOXE1 i n NSCL/P have not been convincingly replicated.

Several fast implementations of the  score test, including approximate ones, have been developed recently. These  methods differ in their computational speed and the accuracy of the SNP effect estimation. We compared the running time of the different implemen  tations of score test (mmscore, EMMAX, FaST LMM, GRAMMAR Gamma),  using simulated data. The GRAMMAR Gamma implementation provides the fastest means to run genome wide association study using mixed models. Compared with EMMAX and the FaST LMM, GRAMMAR Gamma achieved a  speed up of more than 30 and 10 times, respectively, for the data studied.  The more individuals and genetic markers are analyzed, the larger is the ex   pected speed up of GRAMMAR Gamma compared to other methods.

We offer an implementation of correspon   ding extensions to variable threshold (VT) tests using a method based on permutations. Combined with permutation based determination of p value, this approach promises maximized power without overcorrection for mul   tiple testing while accounting for LD structure. All rare variant tests operate on bins, physically continuous chromosomal  segments. Bins can be created algorithmically, using on distance or number of (rare) SNPs.

This kind of studies generally contain data from a number of subjects, each of whom has been observed on one or more times, with a binary or continuous response and possibly some covariates recorded for each subject on every time. Thus, the issue of the correlation of repeated measures in a single subject has to be taken into account in statistical analysis.  For binary outcomes with re  peated measurements, one of the most commonly used analysis methods is generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) and the parameter estimation in GLMM typically involves maximum likelihood. However, for small samp le sizes, likelihood based estimation can be unreliable and their variance components are difficult to estimate. To overcome such problems, we ap ply the Bayesian framework in the GLMM by assigning prior distributions for the fixed effects, random effects as well as for variance components.

Sleep apnea/hypopnea syndrome (SAHS) is a common condition affecting approximately 0.3 4% of the middle aged population and is defined on the  basis of symptoms of daytime sleepiness and objective measures of disor   dered breathing during sleep. . Several studies have identified SAHS as a risk factor for hy   pertension, but a direct etiologic link between these disorders has not been established definitively.Aims: Evaluate the influence of polymorphisms on the APO E gene and the I/D polymorphism on ACEI in the presence of hypertension (HT) In Sleep Apnea   Hipoapnea Syndrome patients.Methods: APO E and ACEI I/D genotypes were obtained from 99 controls and 114 patients with a diagnosis of sleep apnea hipoapnea sindrome after polysomnography in the Sleep unit of the Rio Hortega Hospital.Results: There were not any difference in the APO E alleles frequency bet   ween patients and controls, but SAHS patients carrying the APO E Îµ4 allele showed an increased frequency of HT 3,145 higher than Îµ3 homozygous and Îµ2 carriers(CI 1.269 7.79 ). These findings keep significant even after correction for sex . The ACE I/D genotypes were in Hardy Weinberg equili brium (p<0.05) and they seem donÂ´t have any influence on the development of HT in these patients (DD OR 0,478 (CI 0,21 1,08)Conclusions:. Our results demonstrate that the presence of the Îµ4 allele in creases the probability to develop HT in Sleep Apnea patients. We suggested that this allele could be useful as a biological marker for identification of a subgroup of SAHS patients who are more likely to have HT .",2012
 SVM based generalized multifactor dimensionality reduction approaches for detecting gene gene interactions in family studies,P08.43,"Y. Chiu, Y. Fang","Institute of Population Health Sciences, National Health Research Institutes, Zhunan, Taiwan","Gene gene interaction plays an important role in the etiology of complex diseases, which may exist without a genetic main effect. Most current sta tistical approaches, however, focus on assessing an interaction effect in the presence of the geneâs main effects. It would be very helpful to develop me thods that can detect not only the geneâs main effects but also gene gene interaction effects regardless of the existence of the geneâs main effects while adjusting for confounding factors. In addition, when a disease variant is rare or when the sample size is quite limited, the statistical asymptotic properties are not applicable; therefore, approaches based on a reasonable and applicable computational framework would be practical and frequently applied. In this study, we have developed an extended support vector ma chine (SVM) method and an SVM based pedigree based generalized mul   tifactor dimensionality reduction (PGMDR) method to study interactions in the presence or absence of main effects of genes with an adjustment for covariates using limited samples of families. A new test statistic is proposed for classifying the affected and the unaffected in the SVM based PGMDR ap proach to improve performance in detecting gene gene interactions. Simu lation studies under various scenarios have been performed to compare the performances of the proposed and the original methods. The proposed and original approaches have been applied to a real data example for illustration and comparison. Both the simulation and real data studies show that the proposed SVM and SVM based PGMDR methods have great prediction accu racies, consistencies, and power in detecting gene gene interactions.

A. Moosavi, M. Karimipoor;  Molecular Medicine Department,Biotechnology Research Center,Pasteur Istitute of IRAN,  Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Î² thalassemia is the most common monogenic disorder in Iran, and one of  the challenges in the screening of the carriers is the coinheritance of alpha  thalassemia mutations. Alfa thalassemia acts as a secondary modifier in cli  nical manifestations of beta thalassemia. In the view of high prevalence of alfa   thalassemia mutations in many parts of the country, its coinheritance  with beta thal may cause misdiagnosis. The aim of this study was to determine the carrier frequency of alpha dele tions in carriers of beta thalassemia with known mutations in beta globin gene and compare some data of them to interpret the importance of these  coinheritances. The study includes families referred from different primary health care cen ters with microcytic hypochromic anemia [MCV<80fl; MCH<27pg] and A2>  3.5. After providing informed consent, genomic DNA was extracted from  peripheral blood leukocytes by salting out method. Allele specic PCR was exp;oited for common Î² mutations. Then common alpha deletions ( Î±3.7,   Î±4.2,  Î±20.5 and   MED) were screened by multiplex gap PCR.Among 227 Î² thalassemia minor individuals we found alfa thal mutations in 43 cases: 37 heterozygote  Î±3.7(16.3%), 5 homo  Î±3.7 (2.2%)and 1  MED  (0.44%). The results show the high prevalence of the coinheritance of alfa  and beta thal in a selected Iranian population and the changes are different. There fore, it is highly recommended that physicians and genetic counselors in  volved in the screening program of beta thalassemia major in the country  consider this phenomenon.",2012

Disturbances in FGF signalling can lead to abnormalities in odontogenesis, resulting in alterations in the formation of the normal number of teeth. Sprouty family members function as a negative feedback regulator of FGF signalling.Therefore, our aim was to study for the first time the involvement of SPRY2 and SPRY4 genes in MLIA susceptibility and to explore a possible gene gene interaction.A case control study, in a total of 306 individuals, is underway; a case control ratio of 1:2 was achieved in order to increase the study statistical power. We selected 10 tagging single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which were genotyped by SNaPshot, using a multiplex approach.We found that the GA genotype of rs504122 in SPRY2 gene leads to an in creased risk in individuals with MLIA (p,0.008). Noteworthy, we uncovered a strong synergistic interaction between these two genes and MLIA liabili   ty.Although the molecular mechanisms involved in tooth agenesis remain unknown, our results provide the first evidence of the involvement of sp routy genes in MLIA susceptibility, leading to a better understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying this trait.

The case control study was designed, in which the series of 535 patients  with abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA), 365 patients with aortoiliac occlu sive disease (AOID) and 316 persons without symptoms of vascular diseases were analyzed. Associations between studied alleles/haplotypes and the in  termediate traits related to the vascular diseases were also examined. The frequency of VEGF +405C allele carriers in the AAA (50,6%) and AIOD  (49,3%) groups was 1,4 fold higher than that in the control group (41,6%;  p,0,01 and p,0,048, respectively). AIOD patients significantly differ from  the other groups in the frequency of HMOX1  413T allele carriers; the ob  served frequencies were: 61,8% (AIOD) << 71,3% (AAA, p,0,003) < 74,8%  (controls; p,0,0004). In patients, weak positive correlations between dose  of HMOX1  413T allele and fasting glucose (Î²,0,074; p,0,037) and triglyce  ride (Î²,0,070; p,0,04) levels were found (adjusted for age, gender and type of vascular disease). However those associations should be considered ca  refully because there was a deviation in HMOX1 genotype distribution from  HWE in two out of three studied groups. In conclusion, 1) VEGF +405C allele is the risk factor of large arteries di   seases, 2) HMOX1  413T allele may be involved in AAA pathogenesis by in  creasing the predisposition to diabetes and dyslipidemia.

Destructive remodeling of extracellular matrix and histological signs of chronic inflammation associates both of these pa thologies.ICAM1 and chemokine CCR5 are mediators of inflammatory process. The CCR5_32 deletion genetic variant was found to be associated with AAA in Italian population. The ICAM1 (K469E) genetic variant was characterized as potentially affecting the autoimmunity process.The purpose of the pre sent study was to determine if there is an association between the ICAM1 (nt+469) or CCR5_32 deletion gene polymorphisms and susceptibility to AAA or AIOD in Polish patients. Genotyping was performed by PCR and gel electrophoresis for CCR5 and by pyroseqencing for ICAM1 in three selected groups: 300 patients with AAA and 305 patients with AIOD who underwent surgery; 310 individuals from control group. Genotypes were compared with demographic and clinical data of subjects and analyzed in relation to risk factors.

The distribution of ACE DD, ID, and II genotypes in malnourished  patients were 32; 50 and 18%, respectively; while for the control group  were 44; 44 and 12% respectively. Compared with control subjects, I allele  frequency and I/D+I/I frequency of ACE gene were higher in malnourished children (43% and 68%, respectively; P>0.05). Malnourished children had significantly lower body weight, height, mid arm  circumference, skinfold thickness, mean serum IGF 1 levels compared with healthy subjects (P<0.05).Conclusions: There is polymorphism of the ACE gene in healthy and mal   nourished children. Malnutrition is characterized by the important de   creases in the IGF 1 level. ACE polymorphism is not a significant factor for nutritional disorders and does not contribute to the odds of malnoutrition  in children.

It is a neurodegenerative disorder in which the neu rons of the myenteric plexus are lost, leading to dysfunction of the lower esophageal sphincter (LES) and to a derangement of esophageal peristalsis. In the final stage of achalasia, esophageal motility is irreversibly impaired, and complications ensue because of the retention of food that is no longer transported into the stomach. The cause of achalasia is mainly unknown, but autoimmune processes appear to be involved in individuals with a genetic susceptibility. In the present study, we performed the first systematic asso   ciation analysis for achalasia using IlluminaÂ´s Immunochip (Trynka, G. et al.,  Nature Genetics 2011), enriched for immune relevant loci. To the best of our knowledge, we analyzed the largest achalasia case control sample that has been studied so far. The sample consisted of 633 cases with ideopathic acha lasia and 2,653 population based controls from Germany, Belgium, and The Netherlands. After quality control 126,899 markers from the Immunochip remained for association testing and the analysis yielded a total of 24 mar kers reaching genome wide significance.

Chronic alcohol abuse and dependence are associated with dysfunctional  dopaminergic neurotransmission in mesocorticolimbic circuits. Genetic and  environmental factors have been shown to modulate susceptibility to alco  hol dependence, and both may act through epigenetic mechanisms that can modulate gene expression, e.g. DNA methylation at CpG sites. Recent studies  have suggested that DNA methylation patterns may change over time. Ho   wever, few data are available concerning the rate of these changes in specific  genes. A recent study found that hypermethylation of the promoter of the dopamine transporter (DAT) gene was positively correlated with alcohol  dependence, and negatively correlated with alcohol craving. The aim of the  present study was to replicate these findings in a larger sample of alcohol dependent patients and population based controls matched for age and sex.  No difference in methylation level was observed between patients and con  trols, and no difference in methylation level was observed before and after alcohol withdrawal in patients. However, patients with more severe craving  showed a trend towards lower DAT methylation levels (p,0.07), which is  consistent with previous findings. Furthermore, in our overall sample, DAT methylation levels increased with age. Interestingly, a separate analysis of patients suggested that this finding was mainly driven by the patient group.  Although the present data do not clarify whether chronic alcohol abuse is  responsible for this phenomenon or merely enhances an aging specific pro cess, our findings suggest that hypermethylation in alcohol dependent pati   ents is a consequence, rather than a cause, of the disorder.",2012

The presence of an APOE epsilon4 allele is a well established  genetic risk factor for AD, with a higher percentage of epsilon4 allele in patients with AD comparing to general population. Recent genome wide association studies also have identified the other loci of interest including CLU, TOMM40 , EXOC3L2, GAB2 , A2M , CR1 , BIN1  and PICALM, as putative ge  netic determinants of the late onset form of AD. The aim of the work was to develop biochip for simple and rapid genetic tests of allelic variations in these genes in population and AD cohorts. The genotyping assay has been developed employing multiplex PCR and allele specific hybridization of the amplicon probes on low density gel based biochips. In total, set of 235 case control subjects of Russian origin have been tested to validate the sensitivity and specificity of the biochip. The genotype data are in agreement with de   scribed associations in both Russian and other European origin populations showing association of APOE epsilon4 allele and CLU C allele (rs11136000)  in AD (OR , 2.34, 95%CI, 1.22 4.47, p,0.01 and OR , 1.6, 95% CI,1.06 2.4, p , 0,024, respectively).

Likewise it has been shown that inflammatory reactions play a si gnificant role as well. Inflammatory mediators such as complement, che   mokines and cytokines activators and inhibitors can release from activated microglia and astrocytes, causing neuronal dysfunction and death. One of the most important cytokines is tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF Î±). This study was designed and carried out to determine the association between spora dic Alzheimerâs disease and the human TNF  Î± and APOE gene variations in  Iranian population.Materials and Methods: In this case   control study, the role of TNF Î± gene  polymorphism was determined in 167 sporadic AD patients and 163 healthy controls. Genomic DNA was extracted and TNF Î±  850C/T promoter poly   morphism was genotyped using PCR/RFLP technique. Comparing the ge notype and allelic frequencies were analyzed using chi square and logistic regression tests by SPSS 11.5.Results: The obtained results indicated that the frequency of TNF Î±  850  heterozygote genotype (CT) was significantly higher in AD patients com paring healthy controls (p,0.038).

DNA samples were genotyped using an Illumina Human 610 quad array as a part of the GABRIEL project. After QC filters, 550 915 SNPs genotyped in 330 cases (141 Russians, 120 Tatars,   Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012 www.eshg.org222 ESHG Posters www.eshg.org69 Bashkirs) and 348 controls (145 Russians, 111 Tatars, 92 Bashkirs)  were used for testing the association of SNPs to asthma. Some markers on  chromosome 5q33 showed the most significant association with asthma in  Bashkirs (p<5xl0 7). The maximum association was at the SNP rs9324750 (p,4,25x10 7) in the second intron of GRIA1.

Opisthorchis felineus is a common helminth infection in Siberian region of  Russia. So far, no information on genetic component of susceptibility for this  infection was published. To investigate whether the same genes are involved  in predisposition to asthma and O. felineus invasion, we analyzed 10 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) of immune response modifying genes in 107 asthma patients, 103 individuals infected by O. felineus, 100 persons  with combination of asthma and O. felineus infection, and control group of  126 healthy people.The PIAS3  rs12756687:G/G genotype was associated with symptomatic O.  felineus infection (P , 0.02), while the C/C genotype was associated with  asthma (P , 0.033).

Treatment of asthma patients decreased VEGF levels and inhibiting VEGF in mice diminished asthma symptoms. Therefore, polymorphisms in  VEGF might be associated with asthma treatment response. Methods: This study enrolled 131 children with asthma. They were treated  with inhaled corticosteroid (ICS) fluticasone propionate or leukotriene re ceptor antagonist (LTRA) montelukast. We analyzed association between  improvement of lung function, assessed by measurement of FEV1 â % of  predicted, FEV1/FVC after 6 and 12 months of treatment and asthma con trol after 12 months of treatment, and polymorphisms, rs2146323 and  rs833058, in the VEGF gene.

The formation of the atrial septum during cardiac development is a com plex process being vulnerable to a wide range of dysmorphogenesis. A ge netic link and anatomical continuum between secundum atrial septal defect (ASDII) and patent forame ovale (PFO) have been suggested by murine and human studies. While ASDII and PFO occur commonly and represent a signi ficant burden to health resources, the genetic complexity of such conditions is not fully known. PFO incidence in inbred mice, as we reported earlier, is strongly correlated with quantitative parameters of atrial septum. We pre viously mapped quantitative trait loci (QTL) underlying such parameters using F2 intercross between QSi5 and 129T2/SvEms, parental strains with extremes of septal dysmorphogenesis. Subsequently, breeding of parental strains continued for 12 further generations to establish an advanced inter   cross line (AIL). We genotyped 150 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) markers at an average interval of 2cM in 400 F14 mice. AIL confirmed the F2 QTL and significantly improved confidence intervals of the QTL. After   ward, we performed whole genome sequencing of the parental strains and identified variations between the sequences. The genome was partitioned into high and low SNP rate intervals and the genes within high SNP rate regions of the QTL confidence intervals were identified. As a confirmatory method, we used mouse HapMap imputation genotype resource. The list of candidate genes was prioritized according to sequence and expression profiles. In conclusion, integrating QTL mapping and genomic technology form a powerful approach to dissect genetic complexity underpinning atrial septal abnormalities.",2012

A parental study was done in 10 families for 14 aberrations : 12 rearrangements were inherited and 2 were de novo with a 6q26 deletion (gene PACRG) and an isochromosome Yp (deletion of NLGN4Y) both considered of uncertain clinical significance (VOUS). Five CNVs were previously reported in autism: 1q21.1,3p26.3q26.2 (CNTN4), 15q13.3 (CHRNA7), 16p11.2 and Xp22.31. Three aberrations in 3p26 (dup) and Xp22 (del/dup) seemed more specific to autism as not present in our cohort of 400 patients with intellectual disability.In conclusion, the aetiologic diagnosis was found in 11% of autistic child ren.",2012

Although it is one of the most heritable neuropsychiatric disorders, the underlying genetic factors remain largely unknown.A recent study reported rare mutations in the X linked gene PTCHD1 (pat   ched domain containing protein 1)in patients with autism spectrum disor   der (ASD) and ID (Noor et al. 2010), suggesting a possible role of this gene  in cognitive development. PTCHD1 is highly expressed in brain regions and  encodes a transmembrane protein containing a patched related domain. It has been suggested that PTCHD1 plays a role in the hedgehog signaling pa  thway.In this study we aimed to investigate the possible contribution of common variants in PTCHD1 to ASD through a case control association study. The  study sample consisted of 595 Caucasian autistic patients (270 Spanish, 247 Dutch and 78 German) and 680 gender matched controls (320 Spanish, 269 Dutch and 82 German). Twenty eight tagSNPs were selected on the basis of linkage disequilibrium (LD) patterns. A significant association, that over   came the Bonferroni correction for multiple testing and permutations was obtained with the marker rs7052177 (p, 6.13e 4). Furthermore, in order to evaluate the possible participation of PTCHD1 rare variants in ASD and  ID, we are currently performing a mutation screening in the Spanish ASD cohort, and in an additional sample of 200 individuals with ID.

We recently reported that a small duplication on 10q11.22 including  GPRIN2 gene, a regulator of neurite outgrowth, and PPYR1, a gene involved in energy homeostasis is a candidate modifier for Rett syndrome. Specifi   cally, duplications were found in the Zappella variant, the Rett variant with recovery of speech, and lacking the typical growth delay, underweighting and autistic features. Since PPYR1 knockout mice display underweight and reduced white adipose tissue an overexpression of PPYR1 due to gene du plication may be responsible for the higher body weight characterizing Zap pella variant. We concluded that duplication at 10q11.22 may play a role in protecting from both underweighting and autistic features in Rett patients. We now report more convincing evidences that dosage balance at GPRIN2 locus plays a role in autism spectrum disorders (ASD). We observed 6 pati   ents affected by ASD with an overlapping small deletion including the two genes (and extending to MAPK8 in one patient). We then compared a group of 164 ASD patients with a group of 180 syndromic and non syndromic intel lectual deficit (SID/NSID) patients and 160 controls. Seven deletions were identified in the ASD group. On the contrary, no deletion has were found in SID/NSID nor in control group (p,0,005 and p,0,008).

The disease has endemic distribution in the Danube river regions in several Balkan countries.DNA methylation is a primary epigenetic modification that is involved in major processes such as cancer, genomic imprinting, gene silencing etc. Epi genetic tests can prove to be the bridge between environmental factors and genetic background in BEN development.MATERIALS AND METHODS: Age matched pools of 45 female BEN patients and 45 healthy controls were created. Weâve performed high resolution www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012225 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters genome wide methylation array analysis. Weâve analyzed the methylation  status of 27 800 CpG islands of both groups to identify significant methyla   tion profile differences.RESULTS: Our experiments show significant disparity of the methylation status of several group of genes. Significant hypomethylation in the patient  group was discovered for the following genes: ADRA2A, B3GNT4, BTBD6,  C1orf183, GCH1, KCNK12,NEO1, REXO1, SHROOM2, SSPO, TTC9B.The ge nes ADNP , C11orf63, ACTG1, RNF187, C4orf32, MIR153 2, TM6SF1, SSR4, HNRNPH1, EVI5L, TAL1, EBF3, C3orf21, IQSEC1, MSL2, FAM123A, RBMY1B,  RBMY2EP showed significantly higher level of hypermethylation in pati   ents. CONCLUSIONS: Data obtained from our experiments suggest that dysregula   tion of cytoskeletal proteins, transcription factors, transmembrane ion chan nels as well as proteins involved in secretion processes, cell adhesion, DNA splicing and cell proliferation can be key mechanism in BEN pathogenesis.

In this study we wanted to identify de novo CNVs in bipolar affective disorder (BD). We used Illumina OmniExpress microarrays to genotype 119 BD offspring from 114 complete parent offspring families passing strict QC criteria. CNVs were called by PennCNV. We excluded CNVs <10kb, covered by <10 probes, overlapping segmental duplications and with a frequency >1%.The initial analysis identified 41 putative novo CNVs. Subsequent validation by a Z Score calling algorithm, and manual inspection of the logRratios of the trios, reduced this to seven de novos in six probands. This rate of 5% is higher than the reported rates in controls (~1 2%), but similar to studies in schizophrenia and BD. The median size of de novo CNVs was 189kb. Two of the de novo CNVs did not intersect any genes. We find one de novo deletion intersecting an exon of DLG2, and one large duplication intersecting 27 ge  nes at 16p11.2, both regions having been implicated in de novo CNV studies of schizophrenia and BD.

The bladder exstrophy epispadias complex (BEEC) represents an anterior midline defect with variable expression of phenotype comprising a spec trum of malformations involving the abdominal wall, pelvic floor, urinary tract, genitalia, and occasionally the anus and spine. Most of the BEEC cases are classified as non syndromic, and the etiology is still unclear. The overall birth prevalence for the complete BEEC spectrum in children of European  descent has been estimated to be 1 in 10 000. In this study, we aimed to  identify copy number variantions (CNVs) that contribute to BEEC. An array based molecular karyotyping, utilizing 1,134,514 SNPs (single nucleotide  polymorphisms), was performed to screen 75 individuals with BEEC for  causative de novo events. SNP fluorescence intensity was analyzed with QuantiSNP using an Objective Bayes Hidden Markov model for calling puta   tive CNVs. The SNPs were filtered according to various criteria by use of the Cartagenia Bench software, by in silico analysis, and by comparison with 531 healthy controls.

Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) is one of the most com mon chronic lung diseases associated with very preterm birth. Major risk factors are lung immaturity and inflammatory lung injury. As a result of im proved treatment methods, increased infant survival has arisen the ânewâ BPD among the most immature infants. Based on twin studies, genetic fac tors play an important role in BPD susceptibility. However, the genetic back   ground is still poorly understood.Aims. Because glucocorticoids are important in the process of lung matu   ration, the genes encoding glucocorticoid receptor (NR3C1) and Kit ligand (KITLG, involved in hematopoiesis and cell migration) were investigated as candidates for BPD.Materials and methods. Total of 259 infants with gestational age <31 weeks born in Oulu University Hospital during 1997 2010 were studied. Of these, 61 were diagnosed with BPD. All infants were of Finnish origin. Eight KITLG  and 23 NR3C1 tagging SNPs were genotyped.Results. Six SNPs of KITLG (rs11104906, rs10858753, rs17424193,  rs4842477, rs11104948, rs869408) associated with BPD. The frequencies of two haplotypes including all the 8 SNPs were significantly different bet   ween infants with BPD and those without BPD. There was no association with NR3C1 SNPs and BPD. Conclusion. We are the first to show evidence that the polymorphisms of KITLG associate with susceptibility to BPD. This raises the possibility that transcription products of KITLG, expressed in endothelial cells or lung fi  broblasts, are important in early lung growth. Present results remain to be confirmed.",2012

The GWAS signal in chromosome 6:128.0 128.4 kb pointed to THEMIS and PTPRK as possible candidate genes, both with immune related function. The signal was narrowed to the PTPRK region in the subsequent study, but functional confirmation is pending.The aim of this work was to determine the influence of associated SNPs on THEMIS and PTPRK gene expression in the intestinal mucosa of active and treated CD patients and controls.We assessed the correlation between qPCR expression levels and SNP genotypes of the top SNPs in both studies (rs802734, rs55743914 and rs72975916) and those most strongly associated in our CEGEC population (rs10484718 and rs9491896).THEMIS showed higher expression in active CD compared to treated pati   ents and controls, while PTPRK showed lower expression.

However, host genes determining the intestinal microbiota composition are largely unknown. Recently, we (Wacklin et al. 2011) and Rausch et al. (2011) have showed that polymorphism in FUT2, which  defines the expression of  ABH and Lewis histo blood group antigens in intestinal mucus and other secretions, affects intestinal microbiota composition. The FUT2 gene en  codes fucosyltransferase 2 enzyme. Non functional enzyme resulting from nonsense mutation (rs601338, NM_000511.5:c.461G>A) in FUT2 gene leads  to the non secretor phenotype (AA). Celiac disease is chronic inflammatory enteropathy occurring in genetically predisposed individuals after dietary gluten consumption. It is classically manifested in gastrointestinal tract (di   arrhoea, malabsorption), but extra intestinal symptoms, such as dermatitis herpetiformis (DH) are also common. In spite of several well known gene tic risk factors for celiac disease, environmental factors, e.g. microbiota, are  suggested playing role in development of celiac disease. Interestingly, FUT2  association with celiac disease was detected by Dickey et al. (1994), but not  by Heneghan et al. (1996). Thus, it is possible that host genes could indirect  ly via microbiota composition be involved in manifestation of disease.

AIM: To study the expression of SOCS3 in affected tissue in relation to  rs4969170 genotype and to replicate the genetic association. PATIENTS AND METHODS: Gene expression was analyzed in 29 CD biopsy pairs, taken at diagnosis and after 2 years on gluten free diet, and 12 con  trols. SNP rs4969170 was genotyped in 512 celiac patients and 607 controls  from the CEGEC collection. TaqMan gene expression and genotyping assays were employed. RESULTS: Gene expression showed statistically significant differences when  comparing celiac patients before and after treatment, and also with healthy controls.

It is strongly associated to the HLA DQ2/DQ8 genes, which explain 35% of the heritability. Genome wide association studies for CeD identified a further 39 non HLA loci that explain another 5%. To identify more risk genes, we performed whole genome linkage in a four generation Dutch family segregating for CeD. We mapped a dominant ly inherited linkage region at chromosome 9p21 13 and another region at 6q25 using a model free approach.We hypothesize that these regions may contain causal mutations for CeD and applied whole exome sequencing to two affected individuals from the family to look for mutations. As CeD segregates in the dominant like matter, we looked for heterozygous changes present in both individuals. We selec ted all non synonymous, nonsense and splice site changes of unknown or low frequency (MAF<5%) using datasets from 1000 Genomes, an NHLBI exome sequencing project, and a set of 500 Dutch controls.Two missense variants, on chromosomes 9p21 13 and 6q25, were further investigated and were both predicted to be damaging. However, the 6q25 variant was also present in one spouse and the family grandmother, both of whom did not carry the risk haplotype. The 9p21 13 variant showed perfect co segregation in the family and is in a gene of largely unknown function, although it is highly expressed in epithelial tissue. This opens up the exci ting possibility that it might be involved in barrier function. Further studies should investigate the gene function and its involvement in CeD pathoge nesis.",2012

The identification of gene  variants contributing to this inter subject variability will help to elucidate  molecular mechanisms underlying brain functions.In the present study, we focused on cortical thickness which is a heritable  quantitative trait. Moreover, it is undergoing changes in many neuropsych  iatric disorders. We analyzed 98 healthy volunteers using a 3T magnetic resonance imaging scanner, obtained T1 weighted images, and performed genome wide genotyping (HumanOmniExpress/HumanOmni1S). Thick   ness data were extracted using the FreeSurfer software. To determine those data which explain most of the thickness variability, we applied a principal component analysis (PCA) on the pooled data from all cortical regions. We  selected the first 15 principal components which together explained 80% of  the total variance and performed genome wide association studies (GWAS) on each component. Across PCA GWAS, SNP P values were combined using a meta analysis approach. Overall, 31 SNPs showed P values of less than 1E 04.

This study attempted to clarify the molecular and cellular mechanisms un derlying the premature ossification of calvarial sutures in non syndromic craniosynostoses (NS CRS), highly prevalent craniofacial malformations with an unclear etio pathogenesis. Calvarial specimens of patent and fused sutures were collected from 8 patients during surgery. Total RNA and cal   varial cells were isolated from tissues. RNAs from matched samples of each patient was used for comparative microarray analysis using exon arrays enabling both gene  and exon level analyses. Gene level analysis allowed identifying 114 significantly modulated genes, mainly involved in cell adhe sion, cell matrix interaction, matrix mineralization, osteogenesis, and tissue development. Exon level analysis produced a list of over 150 genes with si gnificant differentiallly expressed exons suggesting tissue specific alternati ve splicing events occurring at the dysmorphic site. These showed selected splice variants of the ciliopaties associated genes that were differentially expressed in fused versus unfused suture calvarial tissues. Interesting the list included IFT88 and BBS9 genes which are associated with ciliopathic conditions in craniofacial disorders.Calvarial cells isolated in primary culture from the suture specimens were analyzed morphologically using confocal microscopy. Fused suture derived cells displayed a constitutive tendency towards the osteogenic commitment, increased growth kinetics, reduced primary cilia and abnormally orientated mitotic spindles. These resembled tumor like features, confirmed in vitro by demonstrating a higher clonogenicity and a higher invasiveness in vitro of fused suture derived cells. These suggest that a somatic alteration of cen trosome derived structures in the osteo progenitor cells, could underlie the overworking osteogenic process at the site of calvarial suture fusion.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012229 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common lethal autosomal recessive disease with prevalence of 1:2500 newborns. The cause of death in 90% is respi   ratory insufficiency due to chronic inflammation caused by bacterial infec tions.Mannose binding lectin (MBL) protein is an important mediator component of the innate immune defense system. It has been shown that MBL2 vari  ant alleles causing low MBL serum levels are associated with an increased risk of infections. In exon 1, three single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and one in promoter region cause independently low MBL serum levels. We therefore investigated whether MBL2 gene variants are associated with pul   monary function or susceptibility to infection in Slovak CF patients.DNA polymorphisms were typed by single base primer extension assay (SNaPshot) in 91 patients and 100 controls. The concentrations of protein were determined in 34 patients by a sandwich enzyme linked immunosor   bent assay, also spirometric and microbiological data were collected from medical records.In this study we found that MBL2 genotypes were associated neither with  earlier acquisition of bacterial infection nor with reduced pulmonary func tion among patients. Although MBL2 genotypes were associated with the  MBL2 protein serum level, results were statistically significant only for po lymorphisms in exon 1, with p,0.0008.The role of the MBL2 gene in lung disease severity in CF patients represents  a very complex phenomenon where both genetic and environmental fac tors play an important role. Understanding this complexity requires further studies based on a broader scale of genetic factors involving both a whole genome approach and a larger patient cohort.",2012

The process of hemodialysis (HD) itself is not  without the influence on patientÂ´s immune system, additionally impaired immune functions are documented in DM patients. Elevations of cell free DNA (cfDNA) concentrations during HD sessions were reported in nu merous studies regardless of an applied therapeutic protocol. In this study, we focus on methylation status of promoter of immune response genes at the level of plasma cfDNA and their changes iniciated by the process of he modialysis in DN patients.Methods: We isolated plasma cfDNA from 20 patients with DN before and af ter a HD session. The extent of promoter methylation of 24 genes involved in immune response was examined using the Methyl Profiler DNA Methylation PCR Array System and cluster analysis (SABiosciences, Qiagen).Results: We discovered significant changes in methylation profiles that were promoted in consequence of patientÂ´s blood contact with artificial surfaces of dialyzer. According to the character of methylation profiles it seems that Th17 cells related immunity may play role in the response of DN patients to HD.Conclusion: The method provides the new tool for evaluation of immune system activity in HD patients and its results can be further correlated with clinical data to bring new insights in the complex pathogenesis.Supported by grants no.

Delayed motor performance, weak muscle strength and exercise limitation observed in individuals with Down syndrome are not yet understood and remain a challenging issue. They have been attributed to impaired coordinated input due to cerebellar dysfunction, but might have a more complex origin. Phenotypic investigation of mouse models of trisomy (Ts2Yah) and monosomy (Ms3Yah) for the Stch App regi  on revealed the existence in this region of genes sensitive to dosage that are controlling muscle strength, motor function and endurance. A transcripto me analysis of skeletal muscle in Ms3Yah mice revealed up regulation of ge nes implicated in mitochondrial function and in the oxidative phosphoryla   tion pathway, a finding that was confirmed by the visualization of increased number of oxidative fibers. The opposite down regulation was observed in Ts2Yah mice, although with less effect. In addition, myopathy like muscle fiber and mitochondria damage was observed in the Ms3Yah model. Our findings demonstrate that one or more gene(s) present within the Stch App  region are implicated in the regulation of muscle energy metabolism and integrity, and point at a defect in the mitochondrial respiratory chain.

Our results suggest that aging may alter epigentic status in the genes involved in common diseases such as diabetes, dyslipidemia, cardiovascular disorder and cancer.",2012

The disorder is termed male pattern baldness (AGA) in men, and fe male pattern hair loss (FPHL) in women. Although the precise etiopatho genesis of FPHL remains unknown, one likely hypothesis is that sex steroid hormones are crucial for the development of FPHL. However, we could not demonstrate significant association for any of the 32 genotyped variants of the hormone receptor genes aromatase gene (CYP19A1), progesterone receptor (PGR), steroid 5 alpha reductase alpha polypeptide 1 and 2 (SR   D5A1, SRD5A2) and estrogen receptors 1 and 2 (ESR1, ESR2). Another likely hypothesis is that FPHL and AGA share common disease causing mechanis   ms and a common genetic background. The two major susceptibility loci for AGA are the X chromosomal locus AR/EDA2R; and a locus on chromosome 20p11. We performed a fine mapping study of AR/EDA2R and genotyped five SNPs from the chromosome 20p11 region that reached genome wide si gnificance in a recent GWAS of AGA. No significant association was obtained for any of the 20p11 variants, assuming that this locus do not influence sus ceptibility to FPHL. At AR/EDA2R, seven markers showed significant asso   ciation in the subgroup of early affected UK patients, suggesting that the AR/EDA2R locus may be specifically involved in the pathogenesis of early onset FPHL. Enlargement of the collective of 230 patients (145 UK; 85 German) and 329 controls (179 UK; 150 German) as well as a genome wide associa   tion study might help to understand the role of AR/EDA2R and to identify further genes contributing to the development of FPHL.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012231 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

Carlos, Instituto de InvestigaciÃ³n Sanitaria San Carlos  (IdISSC), Madrid, Spain. Genome wide association studies have identified 26 non HLA risk loci for  celiac disease (CD), a common autoimmune disorder. The SNPs in most of  these loci are in very high linkage disequilibrium, which makes fine mapping  difficult. To refine the association signals we used Immunochip, a custom made array that includes common and rare variants with a dense coverage  of known immune related loci. We were able to fine map more than 50% of  CD loci and identified 13 new risk loci. The most significant signal mapped to an intronic region of 70 kb in the LPP gene (rs2030519, p value 3x10 49). Upon conditional analysis on this SNP , the association within this locus dis   appeared, indicating association to a single common haplotype.Our aim was to refine the associated region in the LPP locus by comparing the risk haplotype across four independent populations of European origin, using the Cross test, a haplotype association algorithm. We have shown that risk haplotypes in the four populations are derived from the same common ancestor and thus might carry the same causal variant in all four populati   ons. By comparing risk haplotypes to non risk haplotypes, we were able to narrow down the region from 70 kb to 18 kb.To investigate functional regulatory elements at this region, we used EN CODE annotation to indicate the most likely candidate variants. We suggest that deregulation of transcription factor binding properties might be a cau sal mechanism underlying the association of the LPP region to celiac disea   se. These variants should be studied further by functional means.",2012

Among these women, 56 of them were obese (BMI>,27), 108  with overweight (24,<BMI<27) and 260 with normal weight (BMI<24). We found the rs9930506 SNP was significantly associated with obesity in  our postmenopausal cohort (p , 0.041). The women carrying with the GG  or GA genotypes of the rs9930506 was associated with increased risk of obesity as compared with those with the AA genotype (42.9% v.s. 26.9%, p , 0.014).

We recently showed that ABCG2/BCRP is a high capacity urate exporter and that its dysfunction is a major cause of hyperuricemia  and gout. Here we evaluated how ABCG2 dysfunction affects urate excretion  pathways.Clinical parameters for urate handling including urinary urate excretion were examined in 644 male outpatients with hyperuricemia. Severity of  ABCG2 dysfunction in them was estimated by genotype combination of  two common ABCG2 variants, nonfunctional Q126X (rs72552713) and half  functional Q141K (rs2231142). We investigated the relationship between ABCG2 dysfunction and urinary urate excretion, and evaluated urate excretion pa thways between Abcg2 deficient and wild type mice treated with uricase inhibitor, oxonate.Unexpectedly, urinary urate excretion was inversely associated with ABCG2 excretion function. Mild, moderate and severe ABCG2 dysfunctions signi ficantly raised the risk of overproduction hyperuricemia (overproduction type and combined type). In abcg2 deficient mice, serum urate levels and renal urate excretion were increased, while intestinal urate excretion was decreased, compared to those of wild type mice.Together with high extra renal ABCG2 expression, these results suggested that a decrease in extra renal urate excretion, especially in intestinal excre tion, by dysfunctional ABCG2 is a common mechanism of hyperuricemia, of   ten misunderstood as urate âoverproduction.â Thus, âoverproductionâ hype ruricemia in the current classification should be renamed ârenal overloadâ hyperuricemia, which is caused by two mechanisms, âextra renal urate un derexcretionâ and genuine âurate overproduction.â",2012
 Contribution of Genetic Profiles to the Risk for Inflammatory Bowel Disease Patients in Slovenian Population,P09.072,"U. PotoÄnik , K.

The sin gle SNP has a limited contribution to disease risk as most of the reported odds ratio (OR) values do not exceed 1.5. This study tested if genetic profiles composed of different numbers of most significant SNPs included in genetic profiles could better describe contribution to disease risk.We have genotyped 650 Slovenian IBD patients and 400 healthy controls for 34 SNPs previously reported in GWA studies to be most significantly asso   ciated with IBD. We confirmed 21 SNPs associated with at least one disease sub phenotype in our patients, including 5 SNPs associated exclusively with refractory Crohn disease and 4 with ulcerative colits. The highest calculated OR for the genetic profiles reached values between 10 12 for the profiles composed from 10 20 SNPs with more than 90% of disease aleles in tested SNPs included in profiles. The predictive models using combination of 10 12 associated SNPs with highest OR showed above 95% specificity in patients with 90% disease alleles however only a few patients would have 90% di sease alleles resulting in low sensitivity usually below 20% of such genetic test. On the other hand, most of the patients would have between 50% 60% of disease alleles however the specificity of genetic test in this case would be less than 15%. These results suggest more complex predictive models need to be developed for better risk prediction in IBD.

Background: Cleft lip and palate is most common congenital malformation  with prevalence of approximately 1 in 700 live births worldwide, the fre  quency also differs by laterality   there is a 2:1 ratio of left to right sided  clefts among unilateral cleft lip cases. Mutations in IRF6  gene cause Van der  Woude syndrome and it has been reported that polymorphisms in IRF6  gene  are associated with nonsyndromic CL/P .The aim of the study was to evaluate the relevance of IRF6  gene in etiology  of nonsyndromic clefts.Materials and methods: Seven SNPs were analyzed for allelic association  with nonsyndromic clefts. The data set consisted of 116 nonsyndromic cleft  lip/palate samples and 148 control samples. Out of all cleft cases, 28 had CP and 88 had cleft lip with palate or cleft lip only (CLP). Results: CP patient group showed the stongest association with rs658860  (p,0.873x10  7, OR,0.093, 95% CI,0.033 0.264). In patient group with CLP  two SNPs showed significant association (rs642961, p,0.011, OR,1.844,  95% CI,1.148 2.962; rs658860, p,0.24x10 5, OR,0.376, 95% CI,0.249  0,568). Similar results we found according to cleft lip side: patient group with CL on left side (n,45) showed strong association with rs658860  (p,0.485x10 4, OR,0.332, 95% CI,0.192 0.574) and patients group with CL on right side (n,18)   with rs642961 (p,0.014, OR,2.589, 95% CI,1.187  5.644). Conclusion: The results of this study suggest that IRF6  gene contributes to  etiology of nonsyndromic clefts. Our data provide evidence that some varia  tions in IRF6  gene showed decreased risk to nonsyndromic clefts and futher  studies have to be made to clear it.",2012
 The genes in irritable bowel syndrome research network Europe (GENIEUR),P09.074,B. Niesler,"Institute of Human Genetics, Heidelberg, Germany","Irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) is a highly prevalent functional gastrointe stinal (GI) disorder with a major impact not only on the healthcare system but also on the patientâs quality of life. Genetic factors contributing to the pathogenesis of IBS have not further been specified and knowledge is still poor. The search for genetic factors in IBS is mainly hampered by the fact that only a few groups worldwide have just recently started to perform ge netic analyses in small cohorts.Consequently, contradictory results have been reported due to low stati   stical power. The GENIEUR network will foster the establishment of a pan European, interdisciplinary network with the major goal being the creation of guidelines for patient / control recruitment as well as phenotypic cha racterization by defining quantitative traits as intermediate phenotypes for the following identification of genetic factors in the pathogenesis of IBS. The network will not only focus on genetics but also epigenetics and micro biomics. In line with this, a biobank will be established in which we collect patient material (blood, saliver, colon biopsies, stool samples) for detailed analyses. This represents a solid basis for novel diagnostic and herapeutic approaches and will significantly improve the insight into IBS pathophysio   logy, and, hence, help identify new targets for treatment with the ultimate goal of increasing quality of life of affected patients.",2012

Pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH; OMIM 178600) is a rare and pro gressive vascular disorder characterized by pulmonary vascular resistance increase, vascular remodelling and right heart failure. Approximately 75% of patients with the familial form of PAH have a mutation in the gene enco ding bone morphogenetic protein receptor type II (BMPR2). However, some other candidate genes have been advocated, including the KCNA5 gene that codifies for a potassium voltage gated channel. This gene is located on chro mosome 12p13, with a single exon of 2865 bp and 613 aminoacidic resi   dues.We included 30 patients with PAH and 50 controls. The DNA extraction was  performed with the Qiagen DNA kit FlexiGene. The KCNA5 gene was ampli   fied by PCR and sequenced. A total of 10 sequence changes were identified in 11 of the 30 patients with PAH, and none were detected in a panel of 100 chromosomes from normal  individuals. From all the mutations and polymorphisms found in this analy   sis, eight of them had not been previously described. Five of the mutations  are missense (p.L42H, p.P46T , p.P169R, p.R184P , p.R577K). Also found a  nonsense mutation (p.E208X) and one synonymous change (p.L159L). We  found three different mutations in the KCNA5 gene 3Â´UTR region, which do not produce changes in the structure of the protein (c.2093T>G, c.2123T>G,  c.2579A>T). In conclusion, the mutations in KCNA5 gene indicated that this gene is the second most important gene implicated in the development and worsening of PAH familiar, idiopathic and secondary.",2012

Telomere length (TL) declines with age and, these decreases are associated with increases in coronary artery disea   se, obesity and insulin resistance. Both TL and various lipid particles have been associated with longevity. Here, we study the relationship between TL in white blood cells, measured by quantitative PCR, and plasma levels of 24 sphingomyelins (SPM), 9 ceramides, 57 phosphatidylcholines (PC), 20 ly   sophosphatidylcholines (LPC), 27 phosphatidyletanolamines (PE) and 16 PE based plasmalogens, assessed using mass spectrometry. A total of 784 persons were included from the Erasmus Rucphen Family Study and ana   lysed using variance component analyses (SOLAR version 4.3.1), adjusting for age, sex and batch effects. After Bonferroni correction, TL was strongly associated with 11 PC species (smallest P value , 2.31 x 10 09, with PC 40:3), SPM 23:0, SPM 23:1 (P value , 1.16 x 10 04 and 2.39 x 10 04), LPC 22:0 (P value , 3.16 x 10 09) and PE 42:7 (P value , 1.81 x 10 04). Results remained significant after adjusting for plasma HDL C and LDL C. Backward regression analyses showed that four of the initial fifteen lipid species (LPC 22:0, PC 38:1, PC O 42:6, PE 42:7) were independently associated with TL. Our findings suggest a link between TL and phospholipid metabolism that may help to explain the role of fatty acids and lipids in longevity as showed in animal and family based studies.",2012

About 30% of longevity is genetically endowed, and there have been repea ted observations that long life clusters in families. Presently, it is still unclear whether long life results1) from the absence in some individuals of genetic variants that would pre dispose to a range of diseases;2) or in addition or instead, from a set of alleles that positively and specifi   cally promote healthy old age.Genetic studies in cosmopolitan populations have been at best inconclusi ve in addressing these questions: perhaps the major reason is that âcente nariansâ are rare, and it is reasonable to suppose that alleles involved in conferring longevity are rare as well. These analyses would be simplified by focusing on isolated founder populations, having a high prevalence of centenarians and hence most likely enriched in powerful pro longevity and âanti frailtyâ alleles.At the geographic centre of Sardinia is located a mountainous, hilly isolated region named Barbagia Mandrolisai, where many centenarians live and con tinue to be active. We focused our attention on about 250 healthy 90 year olds, from a cluster of 13 villages.

Numerous studies have unequivocally identified two major genetic risk loci: the X chromosomal androgen receptor  (AR)/ectodysplasin A2 receptor ( EDA2R ) locus and the paired box 1 ( PAX1 )/ forkhead box A2  (FOXA2 ) locus on chromosome 20. Although these loci ex   plain a significant fraction of the overall genetic risk for AGA, additional ge netic risk factors still await identification. Here, we performed a GWAS using a German sample of 581 severely affected cases and 617 partially unaffected controls. The best association signal was obtained for rs756853, located in tronically in the histone deacetylase 9 (HDAC9) gene on chromosome 7p21.1.  A fine mapping analysis within the case control sample and a family based analysis revealed rs756853 and rs2249817, respectively, as primary asso   ciated SNPs. The association finding for rs2249817 was confirmed within an independent Australian sample (P,0.026). A combined analysis of seve rely affected German and Australian cases (N,639) and unaffected controls (N,384) for rs2249817 revealed a strong association signal of P,9.09x10 8, odds ratio 1.63 [1.36 1.95]. Tissue expression studies demonstrated HDAC9  expression in various tissues, including AGA relevant tissues. Genotype specific expression as well as splice studies revealed no strong genotypic effects, although smaller effects cannot be excluded. Pathway analyses ho   wever support the hypothesis that HDAC9 plays a functional role in AGA via  interaction with the AR gene. The genetic data of the present study thus pro  vide strong evidence that HDAC9 is the third AGA susceptibility gene.",2012

Several studies showed that migrai ne is influenced by genetic and environmental factors. The female to male ratio of migraine prevalence is 3  to 4 fold higher among women than men.The role of common variants of GABA genes in the X chromosome in migrai ne susceptibility was assessed, aiming to explain the differences in disease frequency between males and females.An association study with 188 unrelated cases and 287 migraine free con trols age  and ethnic matched was performed. The case control ratio was 1:1.5.Candidate genes were selected based on their possible role in pathophy   siology of migraine. Twenty one tagging SNPs were selected in three genes (GABRE, GABRA3 and GABRQ) and genotyping was performed by SNaPshot. Allelic, genotypic and haplotypic frequencies were compared between cases and controls and multiple testing corrections were performed. Also, gene gene interactions were analyzed.The results for allelic associations revealed five nominal significant associa   tions and three trends for association. In what concerns genotypic frequen cies, four noteworthy results were found in GABRE  and GABRA3 genes. After multiple testing correction, two allelic associations remained significant  (GABRA3 and GABRE) and one genotypic association resisted to Bonferroni  correction (GABRE ), all in the females group.

In the pathogenesis of migraine  several mechanisms are involved such as neurogenic inflammation, with the  release of neuropetides (like substance P , neurokinin A or CGRP).Our aim was to unravel the role of three candidate genes related to neuro  genic inflammation processes   F2RL1, TAC1 and CALCRL  in migraine sus  ceptibility. CALCRL encodes the CALCRL receptor of CGRP and F2RL1 gene encodes PAR2; PAR2 agonists increase SP and CGRP release. Additionally we have also selected TAC1 which encodes protachykinin 1 that can normally  undergo alternative splicing to generate both SP and NKA. A case control association study was designed and performed, using a sample of 188 unrelated migraineurs and 287 healthy controls, age  and gender matched with cases. SNPs on candidate genes were selected based on a data dump from The  International HapMap Project. From the three candidate genes 14 tagging  SNPs were obtained and genotyped by the SNaPshot technique.Allelic, genotypic, and haplotypic frequencies were compared between ca ses and controls and multiple testing corrections were applied. Also, gene  gene interactions were assessed using multifactor dimensionality reduction  (MDR) method. Four SNPs in the CALCRL gene showed nominal significant genotypic asso   ciations and one significant haplotype association. Importantly, a significant interaction was found between three SNPs of TAC1 gene. The results obtained reinforce the importance of neurogenic inflammation  in migraine susceptibility. Deepening these genetic susceptibilities will be  crucial, contributing to public health research and to develop more effective therapeutic strategies.",2012

The C677T polymorphism of the MTHFR gene (involved in DNA methylation) was shown to be associated with reduced 5,10 Methylenetetrahydrofolate  reductase activity. We therefore hypothesized that carriers of the MTHFR T  allele may have DNA methylation deficiency, and as a consequence, increased skeletal muscle mass and predisposition for high level athletic performance. To test this hypothesis, we examined the MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism  in 1,819 Russian athletes and 1,041 controls. We also investigated the as  sociation between the MTHFR polymorphism and muscle fiber characteri   stics in 47 physically active healthy men. Genotyping for the C677T variant was performed by PCR RFLP . Muscle fiber characteristics of m. vastus late ralis was determined by immunohistochemistry. The MTHFR TT genotype (9.5 vs. 6.6%; P,0.0088) and T allele (30.3 vs. 26.3%; P,0.0015) frequen cies were significantly higher in athletes compared with control subjects. Furthermore, the highest frequencies of the MTHFR TT genotype (13.9%: P,0.0003) and T allele (34.1%; P,0.0009) were found in a group of highly elite athletes (n,223).

 Investigation of relationship Between ATP5Î² gene expression and multiple sclerosis disease,P09.087,"J. Motaei, M. Sanati, a. mirmiran",1,"Department of Medical Genetics, National Institute of Genetic Engineering and  Biotechnology (NIGE, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran. Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an inflammatory, demyelinating, neurodegenera  tive disorder of the central nervous system (CNS) with unclear exact cause;  However studies confirmed the role of environmental and genetic factors in  MS etiology. Disease onset usually occurs in young adults and it is more com mon in women. A number of studies have reported mitochondrial defects in  MS and implied a pathogenic role for mitochondria in axonal degeneration.  Mitochondria respiratory chain are the most efficient produces of ATP and defects in ATP synthesis may be an important factor in neurodegenerative disease such as Parkinon, Alzhimers and MS. Analysis of the mitochondrial  proteomin experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) mous mo  del of MS reveal decrease expression in 5 protein mitochondrial respiratory chain (COX5b, COX5a, ATP5b, NDUFS8, NDUFV2) . One of these proteins was  Î² subunit of complex V with ATP synthase activity. ATP5Î² encodes a subunit  of mitochondrial ATP synthase. In this study, we tested the altered expres   sion of ATP5Î² in LCLs derived from 30 patients with MS and 31 controls. A significant reduction of ATP5Î² mRNA expression was seen in MS patients (P> 0.05). According to our results, we suggest that ATP5Î² can be used as a biomarker for early diagnosis of MS. However, more researches are neces   sary to reach this goal.Keywords: Multiple Sclerosis, Mitochondria respitoray chain, EAE model, ATP5Î², Real Time PCR",2012
 Does miR 634 play a role in multiple sclerosis predisposition?,P09.088,"E. M. Paraboschi, V. Rimoldi, T . Tabaglio, G. SoldÃ , S. Duga, R. Asselta","Dipartimento di Biologia e Genetica per le Scienze Mediche, UniversitÃ  degli Studi di Milano, Milano, Italy","Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neurological disorder characterized by chronic inflammation, demyelination, and axonal damage, probably caused by an al   tered immune response.The protein kinase C alpha gene (PRKCA, encoding a protein critical for T lymphocyte activation) was the first non HLA gene demonstrated to be involved in MS both by linkage and association studies, and subsequently replicated in 4 populations. This gene produces at least 2 alternative tran scripts with different 3âUTRs, and hosts a microRNA, miR 634, in its intron 15. Since several miRNAs have recently been implicated in MS pathogenesis, and our preliminary results suggested that both PRKCA and miR 634 are differentially expressed in MS patients vs healthy controls, we decided to better characterize miR 634 expression and function.The PRKCA and miR 634 discordant expression profiles in different human tissues suggested the presence of an independent miRNA promoter and/or the possible miR 634 mediated silencing of PRKCA. Transfection experi ments followed by both luciferase based and RT PCR assays demonstrated the existence of a miRNA specific promoter. Co transfection of a vector ex   pressing the wild type pre miR 634 hairpin into HeLa cells, together with a construct containing the luciferase cDNA coupled to each of the two PRKCA 3âUTRs, showed that miR 634 does target the PRKCA shorter 3âUTR. The specificity of this interaction was confirmed by site directed mutagenesis of the miR 634 target site.In conclusion, we demonstrated that miR 634 expression is driven by an in dependent promoter and we suggest that this miRNA, by modulating PRKCA expression, may be involved in MS pathogenesis.",2012

Schmidt","University of TÃ¼bingen, TÃ¼bingen, Germany","Neurodegenerative disorders are a large category of conditions all caused by a loss of structure or function of neurons, often resulting in progressive  neuronal death. Of these conditions, Machado Joseph Disease, or Spinoce  rebellar Ataxia Type 3 (SCA3) is an autosomal dominant, late onset neuro muscular disease associated with a coding expansion of a CAG repeat in the  Ataxin 3 gene. The expanded unstable CAG repeat encodes for an abnor  mally expanded polyglutamine (polyQ) track which in turn causes protein misfolding and aggregation. The most recent research in polyQ disorders has focused on protein transport mechanisms responsible for the traffik   king of disease proteins. The ability of proteins to be shuttled between the cytoplasm and the nucleus confers on them the capability to affect cellular transcription in the nucleus and avoid the cellular clearance machinery of the cytoplasm. For disease proteins such as expanded Ataxin 3, localizati   on of protein aggregates to the nucleus has been shown to worsen disease phenotype and increase symptoms in SCA3 animals. In this work we use microscopy, cell viability studies and the filter trap assay to analyze the pos sible partners of Ataxin 3 which affect the localization, aggregation, patho genicity, and protein trafficking of this protein. With further understanding of the pathways involved in the progress of SCA3, it will be possible to de   termine potential targets of therapy to mitigate the course of the disease in patients.",2012

Thus, in the mul   tifactorially determined addiction, enzymes responsible for dopamine me tabolism and polymorphisms of their genes may be involved. The rs4680 functional polymorphism of COMT (catechol O methyl transferase) due to a ValâMet substitution results a high (H, G1497) and a low activity allele (L, A1497). It has been suggested that carriers of the H allele might present an increased risk to develop dependence, however, results have been contra dictory, and no study in this respect has been carried out in our population.In a case control study of 113 smokers and 84 non smokers, we assessed ni cotine dependence by NDSS, HSI and FNDS adapted for the local population, and genotyped for rs4680 by PCR RFLP using NlaIII.Allele frequency in the smoker and non smoker study group was 53.1 and 46.9 versus 44.4 and 55.6, respectively.

To date,  heterozygous causal variations in TERT, hTR, SFTPC, SFTPA2  that account for  2 20% of IPF in various populations have been documented. Recently, Sei  bold et al identified a promoter variant (rs35705950) upstream of MUC5B  that is associated with IPF in US populations.A TaqMan SNP Genotyping assay and a 7900HT Real time PCR analyzer were used to genotype rs35705950 in our cohort. A case control analysis was carried out using 110 affected individuals and 277 healthy controls  from the Newfoundland population. Our results showed that there was si   gnificant association between rs35705950 genotypes and IPF. The odds ra  tio for individuals affected with IPF who were heterozygous for the variant  allele of this promoter polymorphism was 5.4 (95% confidence interval, 3.3  to 9.6, P < .001). The odds ratio for individuals affected with IPF who were homozygous for the variant allele was 12.2 (95% confidence interval, 3.3 to  44.7, P < .001). Furthermore, some of our cases displayed familial segregati  on of the variant allele with the phenotype.This study supports the suggestion that the minor T allele of rs35705950 is a contributor to the pathogenesis of IPF. The MUC5B gene encodes for  a major gel forming mucin macromolecule in respiratory secretions and is upregulated in some other lung diseases.

We analysed seven SNPs (rs10494112, rs4294134, rs2458413, rs1561570, rs10498635, rs5742915, rs3018362) associated with PDB in a recent GWAS in 771 patients without SQSTM1 mutations from the PRISM study (Albagha et al;Nat Gen, 2011). The study population was divided by the number of  risk alleles carried (<14, n,254;14 16, n,254;>16, n,259). Total disease se   verity score was significantly increased in patients carrying >16 risk alleles  (6.24Â±0.10vs5.57Â±0.16, p<0.0001). They had a greater number of affected bones (1.45Â±0.04vs1.23Â±0.07, p<0.009); and received previously a greater  number of treatments for PDB (2.01Â±0.04vs1.74Â±0.07 p<0.001). Deafness  due to skull involvement was also increased (10% vs. 5.8%, p,0.037). There was no difference between the groups in quality of life scores. We found that  the novel risk alleles interacted with SQSTM1 mutations to affect disease se   verity. Patients with SQSTM1 mutations carrying >16 risk alleles had a 44%  increase in disease severity score, compared with SQSTM1 negative patients  carrying <16 alleles (7.82 Â± 0.50 vs. 5.40 Â±0.11, p<0.001). We conclude that  the novel risk alleles identified recently not only predispose to the deve lopment of PDB but also significantly influence disease severity both alone  and in combination with SQSTM1 mutations. They could identify patients  at high risk of complications and this, in turn, could target therapy more effectively.",2012

As multiple genes with small effect size are assumed to play a role, considering multiple SNPs within the same analysis might increase the explained phenotypic variance, thereby boosting the po wer of genetic studies. We investigated whether a pathway based analysis, considering SNPs within the same biological pathway simultaneously, could bring us closer to unraveling the underlying genetic component of ADHD.Biological pathways involved in dopamine, serotonin and noradrenalin neu rotransmission as well as genes involved in neurite outgrowth, were investi gated for pathway based association to ADHD using data from the Interna tional Multicentre ADHD Genetics (IMAGE) study. The DSM IV inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity scales of the Connersâ Parent Rating Scale were used to assess ADHD symptom severity in the 931 probands. From the imputed and pruned genome wide data 6501 SNPs were selected and used for the association analysis.Combined analysis of the four pathways showed significant association with the hyperactive/impulsive score (p,0.0049), but no association for inatten tive or combined scores (p>0.05). Post hoc analyses showed contribution of three pathways (p<0.05) to the hyperactive/impulsive score, only the dopa mine pathway showed less nominal significance (p,0.07).The current analysis specifically finds association to the hyperactive/im pulsive component of ADHD, suggesting similar underlying mechanisms for the studied pathways. Other mechanisms may be involved in the inattentive component of the disorder. These findings show that pathway based asso   ciation analyses may overcome power problems in association testing by taking into account allelic heterogeneity.",2012

Allelic imbalance in retinal expressed disease genes: a common phenomenon?,P09.109,"S. Balendran, B. Wissinger, S. Schimpf Linzenbold","Institute of Ophthalmic Research, Tuebingen, Germany","In retinal dystrophies, reduced penetrance and variability in disease ex   pression with respect to onset, course, and severity is a well documented feature. This makes reliable genotype/phenotype correlations as well as  individual disease prognosis difficult. Although the basis of this variability is largely unknown, it is commonly accepted that secondary genetic factors  (modifier genes) are key factors for this phenomenon. We hypothesize that cis acting variants governing gene expression levels  play a crucial role in phenotypic variation and disease penetrance in here ditary retinal disorders. The aim of this project is the identification of such cis acting gene variants  and the determination of their impact on disease expression. To demonstrate if and how common allelic imbalance (AI) in retinal ex   pressed genes are, experiments were done in crossbreeds of five different inbred mouse strains as a proof of principle experiment.Up to now more than 25 different retinal genes were screened for hetero  zygous cSNPs applying PCR and sequencing. We applied Pyrosequencing as says on RT PCR amplified cDNAs generated from retinal RNA to determine allelic expression differences based on the identified cSNPs.Using the Pyrosequencing technology, we identified an AI in 7 retinal disea   se genes. In two of those genes we can see the AI already on genomic level  suggesting a copy number variation. Screening of the Pde6c gene revealed  a 116 bp insertion on cDNA level that results in a premature termination  codon leading, due to the nonsense mediated mRNA decay, to a downregu lation of the mutant transcript. For the remaining genes the cause of the AI has to be verified.",2012

We have recently reported three mutations in the proximal promo ter of the human calreticulin (CALR) gene at positions  48C,  205T and  220A that co occur with the spectrum of psychosis, in  cluding schizophrenia, schizoaffective disorder, and bipolar disorder type I. The frequency of those mutations was estimated at <0.0007, and none of those mutations have been detected in the control population (p<0.005). Mutations  48C and  220A were found to increase the expression of the CALR gene. The third mutation at  205C>T was detected in an isolate case of schizoaffective disorder.In this paper, the functional implication of mutation  205T was studied in the human neuroblastoma cell lines BE(2) C and LAN 5, and HEK 293 cell lines. In contrast with other mutations in the promoter region, which increa se expression of the gene, the  205T mutation significantly decreased gene expression in those cell lines in comparison with the wild type  205C nu   cleotide (p<0.0005, p<0.001, and p<0.017, respectively). Treatment of the cells lines with the anti psychotic drug, valproic acid, showed synergistic increase in gene expression in the cell lines with the mutant  205T allele vs. wild type  205C constructs (p<0.001). We propose that a deviation from normalcy in the level of CALR in either direction is associated with major psychiatric disorders.",2012

Many genome wide association studies were performed and multiple RA susceptibility loci and autoimmune susceptibility loci have been iden   tified. These studies suggested that multiple genes and its functions were related with disease causing and development.Previouly, peptidylariginine deiminase type 4 (PADI4) was identified as a  susceptibility gene for RA in a Japanese population by case control associa   tion study. PADI4 is a member of the PADI gene family and converts arginine residue (peptidylarginine) to citrulline residue (peptidylcitrulline). PADI4 is highly expressed in bone marrow, macrophages, neutrophils and monocyte. Peptidylcitrulline is an interesting molecule in RA, because it is an antigen of ACPA and only PADs (translated protein from PADI genes) can provide peptidylcitrullines, via modification of protein substrates. To evaluate the importance of PADI4 gene in the progression of RA, we generated Padi4  /  C57BL/6 (B6) mice by speed congenic method. We used Padi4 /  mice to show that PAD4 is affected to development and progression of collagen induced arthritis (CIA), well known as an RA model animal. Padi4 /  B6 and WT mice were immunized with Chicken type II collagen (CII) for CIA. Clini cal disease score was reduced and the incidence of WT and Padi4 / mice were 56% and 44%, respectively. Padi4 /  mice also significantly reduced concentrations of serum anti CII IgM and IgG compared with WT mice.

Recent studies have shown that rare,  highly penetrant variants account for a fraction of the overall genetic risk. Some of these disease associated rare variants have been identified several times in sporadic cases as independent de novo mutations and are obviously  subject to negative selection. These findings support the hypothesis that the  recurrent de novo occurrence of risk variants may compensate for risk vari ants that constantly disappear from the gene pool by negative selection.It is reasonable to assume that schizophrenia susceptibility genes identi  fied by de novo mutations in patients might carry additional risk variants,  such as other rare single nucleotide mutations but also rare copy number variants (CNVs). We tested this hypothesis by starting from 34 potential  schizophrenia susceptibility genes that were reported to carry de novo mu  tations by Xu et al. (2011). Using Illumina BeadArray data of 1,637 patients with schizophrenia and 1,627 population based controls, we investigated  whether CNVs at these loci might contribute to the allelic spectrum in schi   zophrenia.

We report the identification of a translocation 600kb upstream of  SOX9 in a patient with classical features of ACD. In parallel, we identified a  deletion in a PRS family that overlaps a deletion reported in a patient with the same phenotype.

It is the end result of a complex interaction of genetic factors and unknown environmen tal influences. Three subgroups can be distinguished, morphea, limited and diffuse SSc. SSc is 3 (diffuse SSc) to 9 (limited SSc) times more frequent in females than in males which has been discussed to be due to elevated ratios of skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) in female patients.Previously, we investigated the XCI patterns in a cohort of 205 patients with limited SSc and 97 patients with diffuse SSc using the human androgen receptor (AR) gene (HUMARA) assay. This analysis identified 34 patients (11%) that were homozygous for the CAG polymorphism in the AR gene, thereof 17 patients belonging to the limited SSc subgroup (17 of 205, 8.3%) and 17 patients belonging to the diffuse SSc subgroup (17 of 97, 17.5%). To verify if homozygosity of the CAG polymorphism in these patients is due to a deletion of the AR gene, we determined the gene dosage at the AR locus in these patients as well as heterozygous female and hemizygous male con trols using genomic qPCR. Two of the 34 patients belonging to the limited SSc group displayed copy number changes ; one had a deletion and one a du plication at the AR gene. These data let us speculate that changes at the AR gene itself might contribute to the female predisposition for SSc indicated by elevated ratios of skewed XCI.

Background: Telomere length plays an important role in the maintenance  of DNA and chromosomal stability. Telomeres undergo progressive shorte  ning in replicating cells that lack active telomerase. Ageing, oxidative stress  and inflammation are related to shorter telomere length. The objective of the present study was to explore the association between plasma levels of  antioxidants and leukocyte telomere length (LTL). Methods: Relative LTL was measured by quantitative Real Time PCR in 907 participants of the Austrian Stroke Prevention Study, a community based cohort study on brain aging. Levels of plasma antioxidants including as  corbate, cryptoxanthin, canthaxanthin, lycopene, Î± carotene, Î² carotene,  retinol, Î³  & Î±  tocopherol and zeaxanthin were measured by HPLC in 614 subjects. Association between plasma antioxidants and LTL was analyzed  using multiple linear regression by adjusting for age and sex (Model 1) and  additionally for hypertension, diabetes, cardiac disease and BMI (Model 2).Results: There was a significant association between LTL and ascorbate (Mo  del 1:Î²,0.003;95%CI:0.002,0.005;p<0.001), lycopene (Î², 0.192;95%CI:  0.338, 0.045;p,0.01), retinol (Î², 0.045;95%CI: 0.084, 0.005;p,0.029) and Î² carotene (Î², 0.052; 95%CI : 0.104,0.000;p,0.050). After adjusting for  vascular risk factors (Model 2) the significance of the associations and the effect sizes remained unchanged.Conclusion: This is the first study investigating the association between plasma antioxidants and LTL in a healthy elderly population. Our results suggest a protective role for ascorbate and an opposite role for lycopene, retinol and Î² carotene in maintaining telomere length. The effect of these antioxidants on LTL is not mediated by vascular risk factors.",2012

Results: The respective frequency of the AA, AG and GG genotypes of the  patients were 24%, 29% and 47 %, whereas they were 54%, 36% and 20%  for the controls. The frequencies of the patient group showed statistically difference from that of the controls (p<0,05). When AA genotype was used  as the reference group, G allele frequency was found to be statistically high  er in patients when compared to controls (p<0,05).Discussion: The risk of NS CL/P was statistically increased as the number of the G allele of the TGF Î² IVS5+104 increased. The results of this study are  in agreement with the previous studies. This gene locus suggested to be an  informative screening marker for NS CL/P in Turkish patients.",2012

The 2458 individuals who died during the follow up of 7 18 years were selected as cases.A Cox proportional hazards model was used to estimate the association of the genotyped variants with total mortality. The genomic region within 1Mb of the top mortality variant was studied further for association to other di sease end points and to 22 mortality and cardiovascular risk factors in MOR   GAM and in two subcohorts of the FINRISK 2007 Study (n,3950+694).ResultsA rare SNP (MAF,0.0022 in MORGAM) on chromosome 11 was associated with total mortality (p,2.93*10 8, HR , 4.6, 95% CI 2.7 7.9). The SNP sho   wed association to mortality also in independently analyzed MORGAM subsamples: men, women, two Finnish cohorts and the combined non Finnish cohorts. Furthermore, the SNP was associated with CVD, CHD and cancer mortality (p<10 4) and with CVD and CHD events (p<0.05). None of the SNPs studied for association with risk factors survived correction for multiple testing.ConclusionsThe genome wide significant association of a rare variant on chromosome 11 with mortality is highly interesting as it does not seem to mediate through common risk factors. Replication of the association in multiple subcohorts and disease end points gives strength to the original finding.",2012

First degree rela   tives (FDR) of T1D patients have an increased risk to develop the diseases as well. In the Czech republic we screen FDR (children under 18 years of age) of T1D patients and we provide HLA genotyping and annual screening for T1D associated autoantibodies (Abs).Methods: In our programme (established in 2001) 724 children were HLA genotyped (by PCR SSP method), 170/724 children developed at least one autoantibody during their follow up, in 37/740 tested persons T1D was dia www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012247 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters gnosed. We check by using RIA method for antiinsulin (IAA), antiGAD65 (ga  maglutamyltransferase) and IA2 (antityrosinphosphatase) autoantibodies  and we successfully attended the last international Diabetes Autoantibody  Standardisation Programme (DASP).Results: Within carriers of risky DQA1 DQB1 haplotypes (DQA1*03  DQB1*0302 resp. DQA1*05 DQB1*02) autoantibody(ies) positivity was  observed more frequently (55,9% resp.45,3%) in comparison with carriers of protective haplotype DQA1*01 DQB1*0602 where only 7,1% of children were Abs+ at least once during their follow up. The presence of the most  risky genotype (DQA1*03/05 DQB1*02/0302) was connected to shorter  period from the occurrence of positivity of the first autoantibody to the di sease diagnose (p,0,005). Conclusion: Screening of FDR of T1D patients allows early disease diagnose  which has a protective effect to the resting pancreatic beta cell mass and also it is useful for designing of future immunointervention strategies (for  the selection of their suitable candidates).

Variants predisposing to obesity have been demonstrated to con tribute to the risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D), although this has been mostly explained by BMI mediated effects. Association between polymorphisms in the FTO and T2D has been asserted across different populations, however impact of the variation downstream TMEM18 on T2D risk remains elusive. Our aim was to investigate relationship between variants in or near FTO and TMEM18 genes and T2D in the population of Latvia.For this study we selected SNP rs7561317 located near TMEM18 and rs9939609 and rs57103849 along with other two in the FTO. SNPs were genotyped in 1080 controls and 983 cases by performing TaqMan SNP ge notyping assays.Three of the SNPs in the FTO and rs7561317 showed positive association with BMI and T2D. Furthermore association between the FTO variants and T2D remained significant after adjustment for BMI. We found no correlation between rs57103849 genotype and BMI or T2D, however rs57103849 and rs7561317 were strongly associated with younger age at diagnosis of T2D in a BMI independent manner.In the current study we confirm that genetic variation in the loci comprising FTO and TMEM18 contributes to higher risk of obesity and T2D in the po pulation of Latvia. Our data support the evidence that obesity susceptibility variants may have an impact on T2D risk through the mechanisms unrelated to those involved in the BMI regulation.",2012

Genetic susceptibility is known to play a large part in the pre  disposition to ulcerative colitis (UC). The past years have witnessed remar  kable success in the identification of low penetrance, high frequency sus  ceptibility variants in inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). However, a large part of the genetic variance in IBD is still unaccounted for. Thus, we aimed to  investigate the role of the IBD associated genetic variants in a Methods. We performed a replication study in 447 Lithuanian and Latvian  UC patients and 1,154 controls. In total, 77 SNPs that showed moderate or  strong association in five GWAS were studied. Single marker case control, genotype phenotype association analysis, and SNP SNP epistasis analysis  were performed. Results. After correcting for multiple testing, we confirmed associations at 21q21.1 (rs1736135, P , 8.01E 06), 6q21 (rs7746082, P , 6.41E 05), JAK2 (rs10758669, P , 8.08E 06) , RNF186 (rs3806308, P , 2.40E 06) , and  ORMDL3 (rs2872507, P , 1.24E 06).

One third of VCFS patients develop schizophrenia during early adulthood. The incidence of schizophrenia in patients with VCFS is thirty times higher than in the general population; thus making the 22q11.2 deletion an important risk factor for schizophrenia.Based on the high incidence of schizophrenia in these individuals, we hypo thesized that some patients with VCFS develop schizophrenia due to allele specific hemizygosity of one or more critical regions in the 22q11.2 locus.Paired end libraries were prepared from 37 VCFS patients, 21 with schizo   phrenia, schizoaffective disorder or psychotic symptoms, and 16 without.

Radiation induced side effects may affect treatment outcomes and lead to  postponement of RT . Studies have shown that genetic variations in genes that control cellular processes may act as potential markers to detect radia  tion hypersensitivity in normal tissues. Blood samples were collected from local Chinese NPC patients treated with RT to extract genomic DNA. Patients in control (n,34) and case groups (n,34) were matched based on age, sex, staging, treatment regimen, and  severity of mucositis. Severity of mucositis was graded by oncologists based  on radiation morbidity scoring criteria published by Radiation Therapy On cology Group (RTOG).

The major allele (A) of rs12983047 at the 3â  flanking region of TGFB1 was found to be associated with increased risk of  developing radiation induced mucositis with an odd ratio 2.16 (95% con fidence interval 1.06 4.41, p,0.0328, chi square test). No significant diffe rence was found in all tag SNPs of XRCC1 (rs25487, rs3213344, rs1001581,  rs12611088, rs3213282).XRCC1 did not show association to radiation induced mucositis while TGFB1  maybe a potential marker for exploring individual variation of radiation sen sitivity in normal tissues. The remaining tagSNPs (rs1800469, rs1800470) of TGFB1 will be genotyped for haplotype analysis. Complete analysis of all  tag SNPs in TGFB1 may provide support for our hypothesis. P10.

We  also observed C9orf72  repeat expansion in 0.2% (1/382) of controls inclu  ded in the study. Survival time was shorter in patients carrying the repeat expansion and a prevalence of bulbar onset was also observed. Our findings suggest that C9orf72 hexanucleotide repeat expansion can be  considered the most common cause of FALS in Italian population with large  impact even on sporadic forms, according to previous studies conducted on  cohorts of different origin.",2012
 Molecular characterization of the ancestral centromere of chromosome 2,P10.05,G. Chiatante,"University of Bari Aldo Moro, Bari, Italy","Human chromosome 2 is the product of a head to head fusion of two acro centric ancestral chromosomes, IIp and IIq, which remained separated in chimpanzee and gorilla. The dicentric chromosome originated from the fu sion reached stability by inactivating one centromere corresponding to the IIq, through the loss of alphoid DNA, via poorly understood mechanisms. Unlike the fusion point, the ancestral centromere mapping at 2q21.1 2q21.2 has been poorly investigated.Here we performed comparative in silico and molecular analyses in chim panzee, gorilla, orangutan and macaque genomes in order to shed light on the genomic organization of the 2.1 Mb region encompassing the ancestral centromere. This approach allowed us to track precisely the evolutionary history of the ancient centromere and the corresponding pericentromeric region, whose assembly is still complicated by segmental duplications. In particular our data invalidated the hypothesis of the neocentromere forma tion occurred in macaque lineage and confirmed the pericentric inversion occurred in the common ancestor of human, chimpanzee and gorilla. In this study we provide the patterns of segmentally duplicated regions among chromosomes for each analyzed species and propose a two steps model to explain the rearrangements occurred in the region flanking the ancestral centromere, highlighting species specific deletions and duplications.",2012

We have examined the allele frequency spectrum of common variants, and compared genomic characteristics across these po pulations and also with populations from the 1000 Genomes Project. It is usual to identify population structure in such studies using only common variants with minor allele frequency (MAF)>5%; we find that this may re sult in highly informative SNPs being discarded, and suggest that instead all SNPs with MAF>1% should be used.

Until now there are no molecular breakpoint data available for this species. The aim of this study was a molecular characterization of 44 of these euchromatic breakpoints compared to the human genome. Therefore we combined glass needle based microdissection with high resolution ar ray CGH; i.e. HLA chromosomes of interest were painted by specific labelled DNA probes and FISH microdissection of the chromosomes or chromoso   mal regions encompassing breakpoints was done. The obtained DNA libra ries were DOP PCR amplified and used in array CGH. Applying this method we were able to narrow down the breakpoints to a mean resolution of 26 kb; they were analysed in detail and as a result we could show that most of the breakpoints are localized in copy number variant and/or segmental duplcation regions.

Introduction. We have reported earlier the centriole staining with the anti titin monoclonal antibody, named MAb Titl 5H1.1 (Mikelsaar et al, 2010). This antibody was developed using the synthetic peptide N AVNKYGIGEP   LESDSVVAK C corresponding to an amino acid sequence in the A band of the titin molecule as immunogen. Now we have further studied the binding of the antigen of MAb Tit1 5H1.1 (titin) with centrioles in association with some other relevant proteins and in connection with the evolution of titin molecule.Results. We have restricted the epitope of MAb Tit1 5H1.1 by subpeptide mapping to a hexapeptide. According to the data in protein databases this amino acid sequence is located in the COOH terminus of several different Fn3 domains in the A band of titin molecule both in human and several other organisms. Our immunohisto  and cytochemical studies with MAb Tit1 5H1.1 in human, mice and zebrafish showed a striated staining pattern in muscle cells and also staining of centrioles, cytoplasm and nuclei in non  muscle cells. Conclusions.  The data prove our previous findings that titin has in addition  to the known roles in muscle cells also an important role in non muscle cells  as a centriole associated protein, and this phenomenon is highly conserved  in the evolution .

OBJECTIVE: To deter   mine geographical distribution of hearing loss focused to congenital sen sorineural hearing impairment. METHODS: Analysis of the Mexican popu lation censuses (1895 to 2010) about deaf people and their geographical distribution. RESULTS: The proportional increasing in general population and people with hearing loss between 1900 and 2010 was 730.87% and 5,450.93% respectively. The Mexican Revolution produced a demographic declination that required nearly three decades to return to the previous le vel. Nevertheless, deafness showed a few changes with persistence in some areas. DISCUSSION: Genetic composition, founder effects and genetic drifts seem to have decisive influence on the persistence of such problems where the inheritance is recognized.

Nucleotide changes are observed with a variable frequency among different populati   ons of deaf persons. Among the known mtDNA mutations, the A1555G is the most common genetic cause of deafness, with variable frequency of 0.4 up to 5.4%, described both among nonsyndromic sensoryneural hearing loss (SNHL) patients and aminoglycoside induced SNHL. The aim of this  study was to determine the presence and frequency of the most common  mtDNA mutations among 130 Macedonian patients with nonsyndromic hearing loss. A SNapShot analysis for screening of the five mitochondrial  mutations associated with deafness (A827G, 961delT+Cn, T1095C, C1494T  and A1555G) was performed. None of analyzed deafness associated muta   tions were identified in the studied patients. Additionally MTRNR1 gene of  10 patients with only one GJB2  mutation was sequenced in order to detect  other variants that could influence the pathologic effect of the GJB2  muta   tion.

FAP ATTRV30M is an AD systemic amyloidosis, due to a point mutation in the transthyretin (TTR) gene. A wider variability in age at onset (AO) has been uncovered, including among Portuguese patients [17 82 yrs]. Early (less than 40) and late onset(greater than 50) cases are not separate enti www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012253 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters ties, often coexisting in the same family, with offspring showing anticipati   on   a much earlier AO than their affected parent. The âprotectionâ seeming  to exist in late onset cases may be lost in just one generation, raising the  hypothesis of a closely linked modifier. Therefore, our aim is to identify ge netic modifiers closely linked to the TTR locus that may in part explain the  observed AO variability. Haplotype analysis is on going in 100 families, using intragenic SNPs and flanking STRs for extended haplotypes.Fifteen tagging SNPs were selected based on a data dump from the HapMap  Project and using Haploview v4.1, with a minor allele frequency (MAF) of  0.1% and covering 60 Kb around the TTR locus. SNP genotyping is currently underway by SNaPshot, using a multiplex approach. Eight microsatellite markers were also selected, encompassing 11.4 Mb.  STRs genotyping is being performed by PCR, using fluorescent labelled pri mer pairs and genotypes is being determined using GeneMapper v4.0 soft  ware. In a preliminary group of five families analysed so far, no differences were found in the disease extended haplotypes. In the total sample of 100 fami lies, we expect to find some variants or regions that may confer protection  to some TTR V30M carriers (late onset patients or aged asymptomatic car  riers).",2012

FMF is an auto inflammatory autosomal recessive disorder characte  rized by recurrent and self limited attacks of fever, abdominal pain, synovi tis and pleuritis which are caused by altered pyrin due to a mutated MEFV gene. The most severe complication is amyloidosis, which can ultimately lead to renal failure. FMF is predominantly found among the Mediterranean population, as well as Armenians, Turks, Arabs and Jews. The MEFV gene majority of mutations found on exons 2, 3, 5 and 10. To date, 180 mutations and polymorphisms have been reported with varying prevalence according to the population studied. Our aim was to identify the distribution and the frequency of the MEFV gene mutations in FMF patients in the North  west of Iran .Five hundred unrelated patients with clinical manifestation of FMF were screened for MEFV mutations in exons 2, 3, 5 and 10 using direct sequen   cing. The most frequent mutation, M694V, represented only 26.25% of the alleles examined, followed by E148Q in 24.75%, V726A in 11.25% and M680I in 10.75%, respectively. Two novel missense mutations, P313H in 11.47% and P313S in 5.05% were found in heterozygous state in exon 3.

First described in Portugal by Andrade (1952) as a disease of young adults (o.<40yrs), Portuguese patients have been cha racterized by early onset (35.1), unlike patients from Sweden (56.7) and Balearic Islands (45.7) who bear the same mutation. However, late onset patients (o.>50) and aged asymptomatic carriers have been increasingly ascertained.While in Portuguese series women had later onset than men, the same was not found either in Swedish or Balearic samples, what raises interesting questions concerning gender and age at onset distribution(s). So far, age at onset in Portuguese series has only been analysed using information on patients. For the first time we use survival analysis methods, including in the  sample age at last observation of asymptomatic carriers, as censored data.  Survival curves of patients and carriers were compared by gender using log rank test.Our sample consisted of 2424 patients (1283 men) and 433  (144 men) proven asymptomatic carriers regularly followed up by the same  group of neurologists.Conventional t test for independent samples showed significant differences  in mean age at onset between men (33.1) and women (37.5) patients  (p<0.001), whereas in the asymptomatic group no significant age diffe rences were found (37.9 vs. 37.1).The use of survival analysis showed overall different gender distributions  and also when considering individuals with onset/age<40yrs. However, for  late onset cases (onset/age>49 yrs), no differences were found.Further studies are necessary to correct for possible confounding factors  and better understand if we are in presence of different underlying gender  distributions.",2012
 How contemporary human reproductive behaviours influence the role of fertility related genes: the example of the P53 gene,P10.24,"R. M. Corbo1, G. Gambina2, E. Broggio2, R. Scacchi3","1La Sapienza University, Rome, Italy, 2Hospital of Verona, Verona, Italy, 3CNR Institute of  Molecular Biology and Pathology, Rome, Italy","Recently numerous polymorphic fertility genes have been associated with reproductive system diseases causing infertility/subfertility. Investigations  carried out in populations at natural fertility suggest that some fertility ge  nes have acquired clinical relevance only in the last decades due to the inter   action with contemporary reproductive behaviours (birth control, delayed childbearing, and spacing birth order among others). In recent years, a new physiological role in human fertility regulation has emerged for the tumor suppressor p53 gene (P53), and the P53 Arg72Pro polymorphism has been associated with recurrent implantation failure in humans. In order to detect a possible interaction between fertility gene P53 and reproductive patterns, in present investigation we examined the impact of Arg72Pro polymor   phism on fertility in two samples of Italian women collected from popula   tions with different (premodern and modern) reproductive behaviours, not selected for impaired fertility. Among the women at near natural fertility (n,98), the P53 genotypes were not associated with different reproducti ve efficiency, whereas among those with modern reproductive behaviours (n,68), the P53 genotypes were associated with different mean numbers of children (Pro/Pro <Pro/Arg <Arg/Arg, p,0.056) and a significant negative relationship between the number of children and P53 Pro allele frequencies (p,0.028) was observed. These results are consistent with those of clinical studies reporting an association between the P53 Pro allele and recurrent implantation failure. These findings seem to support the hypothesis that some common variants of fertility genes may have become âdetrimentalâ following exposure to modern reproductive patterns and might therefore be associated with reduced reproductive success.",2012

The size of the investigated populations was more than 3 million inhabitants (about 3000 HDs of OMIM could be identified by this research). Genetic differentiation between populations of different hier   archical levels by estimated load of HDs was established. On the contrary, the differences between the populations by the load of AD and AR diseases appear statistically significant. First, the load of both AD and AR diseases is always 2 times higher in rural populations as compared with that in urban populations. Secondly, the differences are also seen while comparing the load of the autosomal HDs in various ethnic groups. For example, the load of AD and AR pathology among the Maris, Chuvashs, Bashkirs, Tatars and Udmurts is higher than that among the Russians. The load of AD diseases va ried between populations from 1.01 to 15.66 per 1000 persons. The load of AR diseases varied from 0.85 to 6.33. The differences between the populati   ons in their load of X linked diseases are no significant.

In this work we evaluate the ability of a Genetic Risk Score (GRS) to explain the variation in coronary event rates across European po pulations. Methodologically, we generated a GRS from 68 SNPs in the nitric oxide synthase (NOS1, NOS2A and NOS3) gene regions that contributed to the discrimination between affected and non affected from the Mycardial  Infarction Genetics Consortium (MIGen) samples and a Spanish case control  study. We also tested the correlation of mean GRS values in 8 populations across Europe (North Spain, South France, North France, Central Italy, North  Bosnia Herzegovina, East Germany, Poland and Scotland) with variation in  coronary event rates in these 8 European populations reported by the WHO MONICA Project. As a result, 8 SNPs in NOS1, 3 SNPs in NOS2A and 2 SNPs  in NOS3 contributed to discriminate affected and non affected people. The  AUCs of discrimination in the different case control samples ranged from 0.538 to 0.584. Mean GRS values of the 8 European populations samples  ranged from 3.8 to 4.2, being North Spain and East Germany the samples  with the lowest and the highest score, respectively. Mean GRS values corre lated with mean CHD mortality rate, non fatal rate and total coronary events rate with correlation coefficients from 0.3 to 0.6 without reaching statistical  significance.

Bonilla, D. A. Lawlor, D. Gunnell, A. R. Ness, Y. Ben Shlomo, S. M. Ring, G. Davey Smith, S. J. Lewis","University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom","Brain development occurs most rapidly in utero and in young children. Con   sequently, it places a high demand on the supply of nutrients from the diet, since adequate nutrient concentrations are required for cell growth, syn apse formation and myelination. Nutrient deficiency during this time could influence a childâs cognitive ability later in life. Because lipids are vital for membrane biogenesis during cellular growth, a relationship between lipids and cognitive ability has been suggested. It is not possible to infer causality from conventional observational studies as associations between nutrition and cognitive ability are confounded by lifestyle and environmental factors. To overcome this problem we used Mendelian randomization, a method that exploits genetic variation associated with a modifiable exposure to examine the causal effects of that exposure on the outcome of interest.We examined six SNPs, that have been previously associated with plasma lipids, in mothers and children from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC). We detected an association of an APOE linked SNP in the mothers with offspring IQ (mean difference in IQ, GG vs AG/AA:  5.6; 95%CI  9.8,  1.4). Among children we identified effects of SNPs located in APOA5 (mean difference in IQ per minor allele:  1.1; 95%CI  2.3,  0.01) and LIPC (mean difference in IQ per minor allele:  0.9; 95%CI  1.5,  0.3), where alleles associated with higher total cholesterol were risk factors for a lower IQ. Lipid levels might be important for brain development in children, thus  the role of this pathway on cognitive function deserves further investigati  on.",2012

Imputation is the conventional approach for avoiding loss of SNPs in meta  analysis (MA) of genome wide association studies (GWASes) with differing  SNP panels. Here we present an alternative, fast method to avoid forfeiting  SNPs present in only a subset of studies, without relying on time consuming imputation. This is accomplished by using reference linkage disequilibrium  (LD) data from 1,000 Genomes/HapMap projects to find proxy SNPs to  gether with in phase alleles for SNPs missing in at least one study. MA is conducted by combining association effect estimates of a SNP and those of its proxy SNPs. Our algorithm is implemented in the MA tool YAMAS (Yet  Another Meta Analysis Software). Association results from GWAS analysis applications can be used as input files for MA, tremendously speeding up MA compared to the conventional  imputation approach. Furthermore, analysis of sex chromosomal markers  with YAMAS is readily available, while it can otherwise pose difficulties be cause of lack of universal implementation in imputing tools.We show that our proxy algorithm is well powered and yields valuable ad hoc results, possibly providing an incentive for follow up. In addition, it is more robust if the data contains cohort specific LD patterns. We propose our method as a standard approach for studies without available reference data matching the ethnicities of study participants. As a proof of principle, we analyzed six dbGaP Type II Diabetes GWAS and found that the proxy al   gorithm clearly outperforms naÃ¯ve MA on the P value level.",2012

Significant differences in haplogroup frequencies between the old people and modern Romanians were found. Low values of internal standard genetic diversity indices suggested reduced genetic variability within old human populations from the Bronze and Iron Age from Romania, in contrast to all modern European populations and also modern Romanians, which showed higher mitochondrial haplogroup diver   sity values.

The study of low frequency and rare variants can be empowered by focu  sing on isolated populations, in which rare variants may have increased in  frequency and linkage disequilibrium tends to be extended. Sequencing is  efficient in isolates, because variants are shared in extended haplotype con texts, supporting accurate imputation. Here we assess sample sets collected  from two Greek populations: the Pomak villages are a set of religiously isola  ted mountainous villages in the North (population size 11,000); Anogia is a mountainous village on Crete, with high levels of longevity (population size 4,000). 747 and 1118 individuals respectively were typed on the Illumina  OmniExpress platform. We calculated genome wide IBS statistics to assess  the degree of relatedness and compared it with the general Greek populati   on (707 samples with OmniExpress data, TEENAGE study). We additionally  calculated the proportion of individuals with at least one âsurrogate parentâ  as a means for accurate long range haplotype phasing and imputation, as proposed by Kong et al, Nature Genetics 2008. We find 1 1.4% of individual  pairs with pi hat>0.05, and ~0.4% with pi hat>0.1 in the isolates compared  to 0% in the general Greek population. We also find that ~80% 82% of sub jects have at least one surrogate parent in the isolates, compared to ~1% in the outbred Greek population.

In Europe, about 87.5 thousand people died from HNSCC in 2008. In Brazil, the mortality rate is estimated in 12 thousand deaths per year. While the genetic basis of sus ceptibility to HNSCC has not been defined, an increasing number of studies report its association to genetic risk factors. However, the polymorphism frequencies often vary between ethnic groups. Population stratification can cause spurious relations in population based association studies. For mini mizing spurious association, studies recommend adjusting for population stratification. Ethnic categories are usually based on self reports or complex phenotypic evaluation, but those are pointed as poor predictors of genomic ancestry. This study intends to evaluate the presence of stratification in a population of 28 patients diagnosed with HNSCC and 74 paired healthy con trols from Brazil. A twenty Ancestry Informative Markers (AIMs) set based on InDelâs markers were selected based on high allele frequency divergence between different ancestral. The samples were genotyped by High Resoluti on Melting analysis followed by DNA sequencing. Population structure was inferred using STRUCTURE software. The 20 AIMs set was able to distin guish individuals from different parental populations. The population samp le of cases exhibited a proportion of 0.349, 0.226 and 0.425, for Ameridian, European and African contribution, respectively. As for the control populati   on, it was found the proportions of 0.041, 0.822 and 0.137, respectively. The ancestral proportions in cases and control population diverged, confirming the importance of population stratification inference in case control paired association studies.

Structural variation has played an important role in the evolutionary re structuring of human and great ape genomes. We generated approximately 10 fold genomic sequence coverage from a western lowland gorilla and in tegrated these data into a physical and cytogenetic framework to develop a comprehensive view of structural variation. We discovered and validated over 7,665 structural changes within the gorilla lineage including sequence resolution of inversions, deletions, duplications and mobile element inserti   ons. A comparison with human and other ape genomes shows that the goril la genome has been subjected to the highest rate of segmental duplication. We show that both the gorilla and chimpanzee genomes have experienced independent yet parallel patterns of structural mutation that have not oc curred in humans, including the formation of subtelomeric heterochromatic caps, the hyperexpansion of segmental duplications, and bursts of retroviral integrations. We present here a comprehensive overview of inversions, de   letions, segmental duplications and retrotranspositions within the gorilla genome.

The A388G and T521C polymorphisms of the SLCO1B1 gene affect the activity of OAT   P1B1, which result in muscle myopathy, derangements in hepatic function  and psychiatric adverse drug reactions. To improve the predictability of  inter ethnic and inter individual differences we studied the genetic variabi lity of SLCO1B1 polymorphisms in Roma and Hungarian populations. Geno   types of 470 Roma and 442 Hungarian healthy subjects for the rs2306283 (A388G) and rs4149056 (T521C) polymorphisms were determined by PCR RFLP assay. Comparing the genotype and allele frequencies of Roma and Hungarian populations differences were found in the SLCO1B1 388 AA  (24.5 vs. 45.5%), AG (42.1 vs. 36.6%), GG (33.4 vs. 17.9%) genotypes and in G allele frequency (0.545 vs. 0.362) between the studied groups (p<0.02). Futhermore, the frequency of SLCO1B1 521 TT (67.0 vs. 65.2%) was higher  in Roma than in Hungarian samples (p,0.05). Similarly to other Caucasian populations, the 388G allele is the minor allele in Hungarians, while in Roma the 388A was found to be the minor allele.

Studies con  ducted in the âoldest oldâ often find no significant association with longevi ty, possibly due to reduced variability in TL with age, leaving these studies underpowered. The most important age related association for TL is with cardiovascular disease (CVD).We measured TL in the Erasmus Rucphen Family (ERF) study (n , 2,769) to study several characteristics of TL: first, we estimated the heritability of TL using POLY, second, we tested for the equality of variances to compare TL va riability in different age categories, and third, we investigated the relation   ship of TL with known metabolic risk factors for CVD including adipokines.TL was highly heritable (h 2 , 0.65, p value , 1.45*10 61). Over the entire age  distribution (18 to 88 years), we observed a significant reduction in TL va riance with age, ranging from 0.150 in younger individuals to only 0.053 in older individuals (p value , 4.23*10  6). Descendants of the âoldest oldâ had  above average TL, suggesting that the âoldest oldâ themselves had above average TL when they were young. Of the 18 metabolic traits tested, only adiponectin was associated with TL after correction for multiple testing (p value , 5.94*10  5). In conclusion, we found that TL has a significant and large heritability and that the variability of TL decreases with age, pointing to a survivor effect. Of all the CVD related traits we tested, only adiponectin was significantly associated with TL suggesting a relationship between adiponectin and TL in the development of CVD.",2012

VKORC1 is the key enzyme of the vitamin K cycle and a molecular target of coumarins, which represent the most commonly prescribed drug for therapy and prevention of thromboembolic conditions. CYP2C19 and CYP3A5 are members of the cytochrome P450 mixed function oxidase system and they are involved in the metabolism of xenobiotics.The goal of this study was to determine the allelic and genotypic frequen cies of important variants in CYP3A5, CYP2C19 and VKORC1 in Bulgarian population and compare them with the frequencies in other populations. We examined 134 unrelated healthy subjects for polymorphisms in CYP3A5, CYP2C19 and VKORC1 by High Resolution Melting on Rotor Gene Q.The allelic frequencies for CYP3A5*3 and CYP2C19*2 were 88.43% and 13.81%, respectively, while VKORC1 1173C>T and VKORC1  1639G>A were found in 51.87% and 45.52% of the subjects tested, respectively.

Seventeen fast evolving Y  STRs were amplified using the multiplex AmpFlSTR Yfiler PCR Amplification Kit (Applied Biosystems) and were read on ABI 310 ge netic analyzer with GeneMapper software.We found that the Bulgarian Y chromosome gene pool is primarily contai ned within haplogroups common in Europe and surrounding areas. Fur thermore, when patrilineal relationships are visualized in a broader context by principal component analysis, Bulgarians are located among European populations. The analysis of molecular variance shows that the genetic va riation within the country is structured among Western, Central and Eastern Bulgaria, rather than among the Black Sea coast, the Danubian Plane, Thrace and the Southwest mountainous region; which indicates that the Balkan Mountains have been permeable to human movements.Y  STR variation ages and median joining networks of haplogroups E V13, J M241, R M458, R L23 and I M423 were calculated together with data from other populations. For this purpose, the analyses of STR variation within haplogroups were based on 8 STR loci, with the exception of haplogroup R M458, for which the STR profiles were further reduced to 7 loci.

The aim of this study was to estimate the possible genetic origin of  Balts performing Y chromosome haplogroup (Y  Hg) analysis of Russian in  dividuals that inhabit historical regions of Baltic tribes and to compare Y  Hg frequencies with incidence of Y  Hg in Latvian population. Material and methods. A study encompassed 192 men that represent four  Northern Western and Central Russian regions and 153 unrelated ethnic Latvians. DNA samples were hierarchically genotyped (using appropriate PCR followed by RFLP or sequencing of corresponding PCR products) by 10  Y chromosomal binary markers (M9, SRY  1532, Tat, P21, M170, P37, M253,  M172, YAP , M35) to establish their haplogroup.Results. Similar incidence of main Y  Hgâs   N1c, R1a, and I was found in ana   lysed Russian regions and Latvian population. Significant differences in Y  Hg distribution in comparison to other regions under study were observed only in Mezen (Archangelsk district, Russia). In Mezen the Slavic component re  presenting R1a haplogroup had the lowest frequency (20%) in comparison  to other Russian (~55%) and Latvian (~40%) subpopulations. On the other hand the Fino Ugric speaking population representing haplogroup N1c was the most common in Mezen (51%) in comparison to other Russian (~15%)  and Latvian (~45%) subpopulations. Conclusions: No significant differences in common Y  Hg distribution among analysed Russian and Latvian populations were found. The analysis of Y  Hg  genofund in Mezen indicates possible Fino Ugric ancestry that could be con  firmed after Y haplotype (Y  STR) analysis. P11.

Brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) is one of the most studied, which plays an important role in neuronal survival and differentiation. However, the features and underlying mechanisms of BDNF for MD is yet clear. Previous studies using different designs often reported inconsistent results for the relationship between BDNF and MD. This study aims to explore the features of BDNF for its role in MD, including aspects in molecular evolution, literature review of genetic association studies, and pathway analysis. Results of sequence alignment among different species revealed that BDNF is a highly conserved gene, having 75% identity in chor   dates with human and 85.9% 100% in vertebrates. Molecular evolutionary analysis found no signs of recent positive selection. Literature review and meta analysis exhibited inconsistent association results for rs6265 in MD, which is the most studied marker that locates in the coding region of pre cursor BDNF (pro BDNF). Mature BDNF was produced from pro BDNF and the two proteins have opposite biological functions. Studies in European seabass showed that stress changed the ratio of pro BDNF and BDNF, impli cating the necessity to study pro BDNF for MD. We identified proteins that interact with BDNF and mapped these genes to genome wide association datasets of MD. Pathway analyses identified possible biological pathways that involved with BDNF for MD. We concluded that examining the features of BDNF systematically can provide opportunities to have a better under   standing for the mechanisms underlying mood disorders.",2012

From this, we report estimates of transcript expression levels and use known annotation to infer functional differences that can be  associated with changing basic bioproduction growth conditions.

 Chromatin changes in human mesenchimal stem cells during cultivation and differentiation,P11.011,"A. V. Lavrov, Y. I. Voldgorn","Research Center of Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation","Epigenomics is one of the most exciting branches of modern cell biology. Role of chromosome territories (CT) in cell physiology in norm and disease  remains poorly understood though chromatin structure is highly important  for epigenetic regulatory mechanisms. Mesenchimal stem cell (MSC) is a useful model for studying CT role in stem cells and during differentiation.  Our aim is to study CT changes in MSC during cultivation and differentiation  in vitro.Human MSC derived from adipose tissue and bone marrow were prepared at early (before 4) and late (after 5) passages, and also after adypogenic and osteogenic differentiation. Over 2000 nuclei were analyzed using FISH with centromeric probes to chromosome 6 and 18. It was found that chro mosome 6 holds a more distant radial position than chromosome 18 with medians of 0,65 and 0,47 respectively. Homologues of both chromosomes are always placed at different radial distances keeping medium (0,48 0,67) and outer (0,71 0,87) layers for chromosome 6 and inner (0,35 0,46) and medium layers (0,48 0,67) for chromosome 18. Comparison of cells at early and late passages, adypogenic and osteogenic differentiation revealed signi ficant (p,0,0008 for chromosome 18 and p,0,03 for chromosome 6) distal displacement of both chromosomes in cells at late passages and after both differentiations also. Described particular chromatin pattern in cultivated MSCs differs from CT structure in both differentiated (i.e. lymphocytes) and embryonic stem cells. This pattern could be unique characteristics of MSC necessary for epigenetic regulation of their activity; and observed changes may reflect similar processes during differentiation and prolonged cultiva tion.",2012

The occurrence of the CNVs has  been associated with various diseases such as autism, autoimmune disor   ders, and cancer. The most commonly used molecular biology tools for discovery of CNVs are  array and next generation sequencing (NGS). These two high throughput methods can discover multiple potential CNVs, which normally need to be validated with an independent method. Once validated, the confirmed CNVs  can also be examined in a large number of samples to identify the statisti  cally significant association of the CNV and phenotype. Quantitative PCR (qPCR), with its ease of use, sensitivity, and scalability, is often the method  of choice for CNV validation and association studies. Relative quantification  principle is used to determine any possible change of gene copy numbers. Since the consistent copy number of the reference gene is essential for the  qPCR based CNV quantification, we evaluated the reliability of commonly  used single copy reference genes such as Tert.

Several computational me thods have been developed for the classification of SNPs according to their predicted effect on protein function and resulting pathogenic potential. In this study, we evaluated the performance of seven commonly used pathoge nicity prediction methods available on the Internet ( SIFT , nsSNPAnalyzer, Panther, pMut, PolyPhen, PhD SNP , and SNAP). In order to test them, nonsyn onymous SNPs in the CYP1B1 gene  which codes for the cytochrome P450 1B1 enzyme were selected. A total of 129 missense variants in CYP1B1 were identified in the literature, from which 87 could be classified as pathogenic or neutral according to criteria such as segregation with disease phenotype, and effect on function, among others. The algorithms showed significant va riation in the assignment of the variants to three categories (non neutral, neutral, no prediction), with a low 37% prediction rate for Panther. Pairwise concordance between methods in the classification of variants as pathoge nic or neutral varied between 37% and 94%. The accuracy in the prediction of the pathogenicity of the variants was higher than 68% with all methods except pMut (47%). The highest false positive and false negative rates were found for SIFT and pMut, respectively.

Their modular structure enables the design  and simple construction of TALENs that can specifically recognize virtually any DNA sequence. Upon delivery into embryonic stem cells (ESCs), TALENs  initiate a double strand break that is repaired by non homologous end  joining, introducing a large variety of mutations. Since this method lacks a selection procedure the applicability depends largely on its efficacy.Here we focused on altering the hDMD transgene, introduced into the geno  me of mouse ESCs. So far, editing by homologous recombination of hDMD  transgene has failed. Thus, we engineered a TALENs pair targeting intron 52 of the hDMD gene. The utility of the assembled TALENs pair was de   termined by measuring the variation within the targeted sequence of the hDMD transgene among TALENs transfected mouse ESCs. The 135bp locus of hDMD was PCR amplified and sequenced for 100,000 TALENs transfected  and non transfected cells using IonTorrent semiconductor sequencing. The  targeted locus was covered â¥450,000x. In TALENs transfected ESCs, the rate of editing events, mainly small deletions and insertions, was 4 fold higher (~11%) than in non transfected cells. Furthermore, we assembled a list of  the most frequently occurred structural variations and cleavage sites to faci  litate follow up functional studies.Our data endorse the use of TALENs for modifying the hDMD transgene in  ESCs.

Lipoprotein lipase gene (LPL)  is an important regulator of lipid  metabolism and transport and has been associated with obesity, T2D and dyslipidemia. The aim of this study was to determine the impact of impaired  glucose tolerance (IGT) exposure on newborn LPL gene DNA methylation  levels and lipid profile. Methods/Results: Placental tissues and blood samples were obtained  from 128 women (31 with IGT) and their offspring. Glucose tolerance was  assessed using a 75 g oral glucose tolerance test (OGTT) between weeks  24 and 28 of pregnancy. LPL DNA methylation was determined by bisulfi  te pyrosequencing. There were up to 9% (p<0.05 ) differences in LPL DNA  methylation levels between women with or without IGT . Placental LPL gene  DNA methylation levels were associated with 2h glucose post OGTT levels  (r, 0.204, p,0.022)  and first trimester maternal triglycerides concentration  (r> 0.201, p<0.05 ) and total cholesterol/HDL ratio (r, 0.207, p,0.021 ).

We applied Re  duced Representation Bisulfite Sequencing (RRBS) to generate nucleotide  resolution of DNA methylation based on high throughput sequencing (HiSeq 2X 100bp) between each pair of twins. Methylation state of 4,278,488 CpGs with at least 8X coverage was obtained for the monozygotic twins discor   dant for T21. An initial analysis of methylation percentages differences bet   ween these twins identified 1000 differentially methylated regions (DMRs) (FDR<0.001 and at least 4 fold change in methylation differences). These  DMRs were correlated with the deregulation of gene expression. The analy   ses of the control samples are ongoing. The study of methylation differences  in monozygotic twins discordant for genetic abnormalities is a promising  approach to understand the molecular mechanisms of aneuploidies.",2012

To address these needs, we have developed SureSelect Methyl Seq, which combines Agilentâs SureSelect Target Enrichment plat   form with bisulfite sequencing to detect methylation changes. Our Methyl Seq design targets human genomic CpG sites within CpG islands/shores, promoters, known differentially methylated regions (DMRs) and previously determined regulatory regions. This comprehensive design covers 84Mb making it well suited to study cancer  and tissue specific DMRs.

Maternal folate shortage during the sensitive period of neural tube develop ment contributes to the occurrence of NTD. Folate is an important B vitamin and donor of methyl groups, essential for DNA methylation, a key epigenetic mechanism to explain gene environment interactions. We hypothesize that folate related NTD are due to derangements in DNA methylation in the child of (non)imprinted genes implicated in neural tube development.Methylation levels of three imprinted genes (IGF2, H19, and KCNQ1OT1), and three non imprinted genes (MTHFR, VANGL1, and LEKR) were measu red using Sequenom MassARRAY EpiTYPER in 34 cases and 78 controls from a Texan study and in 48 cases and 62 controls from the Dutch popu lation. Linear mixed model analysis was used to calculate the association of DNA methylation levels with NTD.The Texan samples revealed no significant association of DNA methylati   on levels of any of the genes with NTD.

Two Dimensional Strandness Dependent Electrophoresis (2D SDE) is a no vel technique for nucleic acid analysis to assess quality of samples, efficiency  of molecular procedures and DNA damage. In the first dimension nucleic  acid fragments are separated based on length and strandness i.e. double stranded DNA, single stranded DNA and RNAâ¢DNA hybrids. The nucleic  acids are heat denatured before the second dimension electrophoresis and  thereafter fragments separate only based on length. After 2D separation, dif   ferent arcs can be seen representing different strandness and lengths of the nucleic acids in the original sample. We tested if 2D SDE could be used to detect DNA crosslinks. Patients with  Fanconi anemia (FA), a group of rare recessive disorders with heterogenic clinical features, are extremely susceptible to DNA crosslinking agents. Hu  man genomic DNA in solution and fibroblast cell cultures with mutations  in FANCA and FANCD1 genes were treated with the different crosslinking  agents diepoxybutane, mitomycin C and cisplatin and analysed with 2D SDE. Increased amount of DNA migrating behind normal dsDNA was observed as expected for molecules with interstrand crosslinks since they prevent full denaturation of dsDNA. Intrastrand crosslinks causing bending of nucleic acids and ssDNA migrating in front of arc dsDNA were also observed. Lesi   ons were dosage dependent and correlated with cytogenetic abnormalities.

The EUMODIC is extended to the 20 000 potential genes identified in the mouse genome and continued by the International Mouse Phenoty   ping Consortium (www.mousephenotype.org). ICS is also a partner of the  Fondation Maladies Rares. Up to now, about 80 mouse mutant lines were  phenotyped and around 80% of the analyzed lines show at least one phe notypic trait. The data are available to the scientific community (www.euro  phenome.org), as well as the mouse models through EMMA.",2012
 Integrating genomic technologies in clinical practice: A novel approach,P11.046,Y. J. Trakadis,"McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada","Medical genetics is shifting from the present âphenotype firstâ medical mo del to a âdata firstâ model which leads to multiple complexities. This abstract  discusses a âphenotype firstâ approach, Individualized Mutation weighed  Phenotype On line Search (I MPOS), which could render widespread use of Exome Sequencing (ES) and Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) in the  immediate future practical, ethical and clinically useful. In brief, patients  have their exome/genome sequenced and their encrypted data stored on a password protected platform which remains at the disposal of the indi   vidual patient. A patient presents to clinic with a specific medical concern. The physician performs a clinical evaluation and identifies some important features. After obtaining authorization, the clinician temporarily and anony   mously uploads the patientâs encrypted genomic data to a search engine (I  MPOSE) which simultaneously operates on the patientâs encrypted data and on a regularly updated database containing all well characterized genetic diagnoses. I MPOSE identifies the genetic changes present in the patientâs sequenced encrypted genome relative to the reference genome. Using pre set criteria, I MPOSE automatically assigns a weight score to each variant based on the level of certainty for its pathogenicity. The physician performs a database search using keywords related to the clinically assessed pheno type thereby providing an initial ranking of possible genetic diseases. This initial ranking is then adjusted by I MPOSE based on the weight scores au   tomaticaly assigned to the variants identified by ES/WGS. The proposed ap proach allows for a more efficient prioritization of the genes to be tested in a clinical lab and an incremental integration of genomic technologies into clinical practice.",2012

Functional interpretation of can didate genes identified by GWAS and confident assignment of the causal va riant still remains a major challenge. Expression quantitative trait (eQTL) mapping has facilitated identification of risk loci for quantitative traits and might allow prioritization of GWAS candidate genes. One major challenge of eQTL studies is the need for larger sample numbers and for replication. The aim of this study was to evaluate the robustness and reproducibility of who le blood eQTLs in humans and test their value in identification of putative functional variants involved in the etiology of complex traits. In the current study, we performed comphrehensive eQTL mapping from whole blood. The discovery sample included 322 Caucasians from a general population samp le (KORA F3). We identified 363 cis eQTLs and 14 trans eQTLs after strin gent Bonferroni correction for multiple testing. Of these, 98.6% and 75% of cis and trans eQTLs respectively could be replicated in two independent populations (KORA F4 (n , 740) and SHIP TREND (n , 653)). Furthermore, we identified evidence of regulatory variation for SNPs previously repor  ted to be associated with disease loci (n , 59) or quantitative trait loci (n , 20), indicating a possible functional mechanism for these eSNPs. Our data  demonstrate that eQTLs in whole blood are highly robust and reproducible  across studies and highlight the relevance of whole blood eQTL mapping in prioritization of GWAS candidate genes in humans.",2012

Nolte","Institute of Human Genetics, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany","Proteins of the BTB/Kelch family are known to be involved in multiple bio logical processes such as migration, cytoskeletal arrangement, regulation of  cell morphology, protein ubiquitination and gene expression. Kbtbd8 is a  new undescribed member of this family. The gene was found to be highly expressed in mouse pluripotent stem cells by analyzing their transcriptome  and was therefore suggested to be a putative pluripotency regulating gene.  Comparative analysis of the gene and protein sequences revealed a high conservation throughout evolution especially in the characteristic domains of BTB, BACK and Kelch. Starting with expression analysis on RNA level, Kbtbd8 was found to be ubi  quitously expressed in mouse and human cell lines and tissues. In mice two transcripts can be detected   one full length and a shorter one lacking a part  of exon 1   which encode for two isoforms of the protein. Next we performed  Western Blot and indeed both suggested isoforms were detectable at the predicted size. By immunocytochemistry on mouse and human cell lines we found a striking staining pattern next to the nucleus which we later identi fied as cis  Golgi apparatus by staining with GM130 antibody. Specificity of the KBTBD8 antibody was confirmed by tagging the KBTBD8 protein with an E2 tag. Detection of E2 and endogeneous KBTBD8 in transfected NIH 3T3 cells showed a perfect overlap suggesting the specificity of the antibody.In conclusion, Kbtdb8 is a new member of the BTB/Kelch superfamily that is specifically expressed in the cis Golgi apparatus in mouse and human.",2012

Although its heritabili ty estimate is high, a few associated genetic variations accounting for a small percentage of its heritability has been reported. The aim of this study was to assess whether epigenetic changes, a non traditional heritable mecha nism, may account for HDL C variability. The study was conducted in familial hypercholesterolemia (FH), a recognized human model to study CVD risk modulators.Methods/Results: A genome wide DNA methylation analysis (Infinium HumanMethylation27 BeadChip, Illumina) was performed on blood DNA samples obtained from FH men subjects with low (L HDLC; n,11) or high (H HDLC; n,11) HDL C concentrations. A total of 619 loci (Î² value bet   ween 0.10 and 0.90; p<0.05) were found differentially methylated between groups. Among these loci, 232 were hypomethylated in the L HDLC group compared to the H HDLC group, whereas 387 were hypermethylated. Accor   ding to gene ontology analyses (GeneCodis 2.0 software), hypomethylated regions revealed a pathway related to lipid metabolism (p<0.02), whereas hypermethylated regions were more likely to be associated with inflamm atory (p<0.0003) and oxidative stress pathways (p<0.003). Furthermore, the initial association with one of the top differentially methylated locus lo cated in the promoter of Troponin T type 1 gene was replicated in a cohort of 276 FH subjects using bisulfite pyrosequencing.Conclusion: These results suggest that epigenome wide changes contribute to the interindividual variations in plasma HDL C levels in FH patients. If re plicated, these findings could influence our understanding of the molecular mechanisms involved in the pathophysiological processes of CVD.",2012

 Generating complex descriptions of sequence variants using HGVS nomenclature based on sequence comparison.,P11.051,J. F. J. Laros,"LUMC, Leiden, Netherlands","Descriptions of sequence variants can be checked and corrected with the Mutalyzer sequence variation nomenclature checker to prevent mistakes and uncertainties which might contribute to undesired errors in clinical diagnosis. Construction of variant descriptions accepted by Mutalyzer re quires comparison of the reference sequence and the variant sequence and basic knowledge of the Human Genome Varia  tion Society sequence variant nomenclature recommendations. With the advert of sophisticated variant callers (e.g., Pindel) and the rise of long read sequencers (e.g., PacBio), the chance of finding a complex variant increases and so does the need to de   scribe these variants. An algorithm performing the sequence comparison would help users to describe complex variants. The algorithm closely fol lows the human approach to describe a variant. It will first find the âarea of changeâ, and then finds the largest overlap between the original area and the area in the observed sequence. This process is repeated until the smallest description is found. This algorithm ensures that the same description will be generated every time researchers observe this variant. Furthermore, no knowledge of the HGVS nomenclature is required to generate this descripti   on. This not only helps clinicians to generate the correct description, but its implementation also allows automation of the description process.

Observed binding at deep intronic sequence positions was shown to prevent inclusion of cryptic exons, of which majority is represented by ALU elements. Further, we performed more detailed study with use of re porter minigene assays, so far the most effectual choice to study regulation of alternative splicing by RNA binding proteins in vivo.

Cryptic exonization  under hnRNP C regulation was verified in control and hnRNP C knock down  conditions. Introduced mutations lead to constitutive inclusion of ALU ele ments even in the presence of hnRNP C, what confirmed that hnRNP C regu  lates exonization of ALU elements through competition with U2AF65.

We found that the ex   pression of HSPA4 is upregulated in murine hearts subjected to pressure overload and in failing human hearts. To investigate the cardiac function of HSPA4, Hspa4  knockout (KO) mice were generated and exhibited cardiac hy   pertrophy and fibrosis. Hspa4 KO hearts were characterized by a significant increase in heart weight/body weight ratio, elevated expression of hyper   trophic and fibrotic gene markers, and concentric hypertrophy with pre served contractile functions. Cardiac hypertrophy in Hspa4 KO hearts was  associated with enhanced activation of gp130 STAT3, CaMKII, and calcineu   rin NFAT signaling.

Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common hereditary cardio   vascular disease, affecting 1:500 individuals in the general population, is ty   pically characterized by genetic and allelic heterogeneity (more than 1000  mutations in 30 genes). The understanding of the genetic basis of HCM, namely the identification of new pathological biomarkers of heterogenei   ty that could contribute to genotype  phenotype correlations is of extreme importance. In this regard, the correlation between genomic and transcrip tomic profiling and their integration into the clinical data was performed for 120 Portuguese Caucasian HCM patients. DNA was extracted from periphe   ral blood samples and genotyping was performed by iPLEX Mass Array and High Resolution Melting to detect known and novel DNA variants in sarco meric/non sarcomeric genes, respectively. RNA extracted from cardiac and  skeletal biopsies from HCM patients were used for both sarcomere and non  sarcomere transcript levels and microRNAs profiling. Unsupervised machi  ne learning methods were used to distinguish differences between groups of patients, tissues and genes. 85 of the 120 genotyped patients presented genetic alterations, 14 of them are novel ones and not presented in 200 chro mossomes from healthy control individuals. All the novel mutations affected highly conserved residues. The most frequently mutated genes were MYH7 and TNNT2. Statistical analysis revealed a strong correlation between MYH7 and TNNI3 expression pattern in cardiac and skeletal muscles. Transcrip tional profile also revealed an upregulation of CSRP3 gene in cardiac tissue. microRNAs expression profile changes observed during HCM remodeling, seems very promising to identify novel pathological biomarkers.",2012

The etiology of IBD is unknown but thought to  involve environmental, immunological, microbiological and genetic factors. A contribution of epigenetic factors to IBD pathogenesis has been assumed but not been studied in detail up to now. We used using bisulfite pyrose   quencing to investigate the methylation levels at the promotor regions of nine IBD candidate genes in inflammatory and non inflammatory terminal  ileal and colonic mucosal biopsies from IBD patients as well as terminal ileal  and colonic mucosal biopsies from non IBD patients (controls). Our analysis revealed no significant methylation differences between terminal ileal bi  opsies of CD patients and controls. MUC6 and IL17REL, however, displayed  significantly increased methylation levels in inflammatory colon samples  of CD patients compared to non inflammatory patient samples and control  samples.

Fourteen families showed one ROH, 44 fa  milies showed two, three or four ROHs, and 35 families showed five or more  ROHs. We considered highly interesting candidate regions, i.e. with five or  more overlapping ROHs, and selected 31 candidate genes based on expres   sion, function, and results of association studies of neurological phenotypes. We Sanger sequenced the genes in all candidate families. Subsequently, we  identified 14 not annotated (dbSNP 132) candidate mutations and in sili   co analyzed them with help of the programs MutationTaster, PolyPhen, and  SIFT. In 4 cases, the analysis predicted a pathogenic effect of the candidate  mutations and those were examined by genotyping in a Syrian healthy con trol sample of 95 individuals. All candidate mutations were excluded becau   se of relatively high frequencies in controls. Our analysis shows an extreme  heterogeneity of ARID and suggests that massive parallel sequencing is a  better strategy to elucidate its causes.",2012

 VarioML micro framework for comprehensive variation data representation and exchange,P11.067,M. Byrne,"Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland, Helsinki, Finland","The VarioML micro framework is a set of tools and practices improving the availability, quality, and comprehensivity of human variant information. It enables researchers and clinics to share that information with ease, clari ty, and without ambiguity. Sharing of variation data is a critical need, yet attempts to meet this need have come up against difficulties at each level of design and implementation. Variant information can be arbitrarily com plex, making a single standard vocabulary elusive and re formatting diffi   cult. Complex standards have proven too time consuming for clinicians to implement.The GEN2PHEN project addressed these difficulties by developing a compre hensive data model for capturing biomedical observations, Observ OM, and building the VarioML micro framework around it. VarioML pairs a simplified open specification for describing variants, with a toolkit for adapting the specification into oneâs own research or clinical workflow. Straightforward variant data can be captured, federated, and exchanged with no overhead; more complex data can be described, without loss of compatibility. The open specification enables push button submission to gene variant databases (LSDBâs) e.g., LOVD (http://lovd.org), using the free Cafe Variome data pu blishing service (http://cafevariome.org/), while the micro framework bi directionally transforms data between semantic and web application code formats, opening up new possibilities for open source web applications buil   ding on shared data. Semantic vocabularies and translation schemas allow variant data to be part of the semantic web.

The genotoxic effects caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS) are among  the most common DNA damage causes. Oxidative stress may lead to an  increased level of unrepaired cellular DNA damages, discussed for tumor  initiation. Mismatch repair (MMR) enzymes act as proofreading complexes that maintain the genomic integrity. MMR deficient cells show an increased  mutation rate. A diet containing a high amount of antioxidants lowers the  potential harmful effects of ROS. The MutL homolog 1 (MLH1) gene belongs to the MMR complex.Objectives: The influence of an antioxidant and vitamin rich diet on the  epigenetic pattern of MLH1 was analyzed in non insulin depended diabe  tes Mellitus type 2 (NIDDM2), impaired fasting glucose (IFG) patients and a lean control (LC) group. Methods: CpG methylation of the MLH1 and MGMT promoter region was  analyzed by pyrosequencing. Gene expression of MLH1 was measured by quantitative RT RCR cDNA. DNA integrity was evaluated by COMET Assay. Results and Discussion: The region on the forward strand of the MLH1 had  higher methylation level in both intervention groups (p<0.05) after the in tervention. The expression of the MLH1 gene decreased (p<0.15) in both groups. IFG and NIDDM2 groups showed makeable differences. The COMET  Assay data suggests that the DNA stability was increased and a correlati   on between the expression of MLH1 and the DNA damage was found in the  IFG group (p<0.05). The down regulation of the MLH1 expression correla   ting with the observed increased CpG promoter methylation might reflect a lower MMR requirement by the higher DNA stability following the dietary intervention.",2012

Genetic testing for MODY has become a routine procedure allowing to set up proper treatment and discriminate from type 2 diabetes (T2D) whose symptoms are often overlapping. Common variants implicated in risk of dia betes explain only a minor proportion of the familial clustering observed in sporadic cases. We apply targeted resequencing technology to detect both known and novel mutations on a single high throughput platform. We until now resequenced 12 cases with clinical diagnosis of MODY/T2D for 46 genes involved in this disorder. All the detected variations were confirmed by di rect sequencing and potential pathogenicity was assessed by functional pre dictions and frequency in controls. We identified modest associations with common variants and a trend suggestive of an overrepresentation of rare variants in cases compared to controls for several genes, although it is plau   sible that combinations of rare and/or common variants in genes already implicated might explain the genetic basis of the disease. Between detected variants, we focus on 11, of which 2 are double heterozygous and plausibly pathogenic. In addition, our data show that, at least in the Italian population, mutations in the PDX1 are likely the second cause of MODY/T2D, and that  many patients resistant to traditional therapies are double heterozygous for some genes individually associated with diabetes/hyperglycemia.Next generation sequencing technologies are becoming the first tier for an im mediate understanding of the molecular basis of most diseases. Altogether, these efforts should allow to better understand the disease pathogenesis, find new targets for clinical therapy, and allow prediction of disease.",2012

Revertant mosaicism is a phenomenon that occurs when the replacement of a pathogenic allele by the wild type allele favors cell survival. Especially  within a tissue with high turnaround time, such as blood, this can lead to  near complete replacement of the pathogenic allele by the wild type allele. The presence of two copies of one allele can be detected by genome wide  single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) arrays. However, when stretches of  homozygosity are present in a small percentage of cells, like in the early sta ge of revertant mosaicism, these are often missed by allelic algorithms.Here we present Mosaic Homozygosity Reporter, a method that facilitates  the detection of low levels of allelic imbalance using the genotyping data  from SNP arrays. The method detects mosaic stretches of homozygosity with high sensitivity by comparing the signal distribution of heterozygous  calls between telomeric regions.

We characterized pre viously that human Neu4 sialidase has activity against sialic acid containing substrates including ganglioside GM2. Biological role of human sialidase Neu4 enzyme has been shown by the transfection of neuroglia cells from a Tay Sachs patient that Neu4 clears accumulated GM2. It has been also shown that sialidase Neu4 enzyme is responsible for degradation of gan glioside GD1a in brains of Neu4 knock out mice. To expore human sialida se Neu4 gene regulation, we aimed to determine minimal promoter region and identify several transcription factors. We used TESS (Transcription Element Seach System) tool to predict the sequence motifs. We amplified seven different DNA fragments from human Neu4 promoter region, cloned into luciferase expression vector and performed reporter assays. We used  electrophoretic mobility shift assay to demonstrate binding of transcription  factors to candidate promoter region. Human sialidase Neu4 gene has TATA less promoter but contains CCAAT elements. Luciferase reporter assay de   monstrated that 187 bp upstream of Neu4 gene is minimal promoter region which regulate transcription. Electrophoretic mobility shift assay showed that 187 bp upstream region recruits several transcription factors such as c myc. Overall, our results show some of cis  and trans  acting factors involved  in the human sialidase Neu4 gene regulation. The data we obtained might  be useful to discover small molecules which control Neu4 gene expression. Selective high expression of sialidase Neu4 gene might be controlled using  drugs or small molecules and the accumulated ganglioside GM2 in lysoso   mes of Tay Sachs patients can be reduced.",2012

Array based comparative genomic  hybridization (aCGH) is a high throughput technology for detecting copy  number variations (CNVs) in the human genome.In order to address the NMDs diagnostic problem, a custom Agilent a CGH oligonucleotide chip (SurePrint G3, 8x60k platform) was designed using the e Array application. The chip covers a selection of genes most commonly involved in NMDs: DMD  (>25,513 probes, every 90bp for exons and appro  ximately150bp for introns), LARGE Congenital muscular dystrophy type  1D (MDC1D), (5963 probes) Sarcoglycanopathies & Limb Girdle Muscular Dystrophies: SGCA (17q21.33), SGCB (4q11), SGCG(13q12), SGCD (5q33.3)  (4609 probes), POMT1/ POMT2/ POMGNT1/ FKTN/ FKRP (2681 probes),  UTRN, LMNA, EMD, TRIM32, MYL7, ACTA1  (7089 probes),  CAPN3 (1020 pro  bes), LGMD2A  and Caveolinopathies: CAV3 (141 probes).

 Accurate determination of the length of homonucleotide stretches by highly parallel sequencing,P11.083,"H. Cuppens , M. Jaspers, S. Lehnert","Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium","The number of nucleotides in long homonucleotidestretches, especially when 7 or more nucleotides long, cannot be accurately determined by high ly parallel sequencing based on pyrosequencing or Ion Semiconductor Se quencing. Most genes, however, harbor homonucleotidestretches in this size range. This pitfall prohibits implementation of these sequencing formats in routine genetic diagnostics.We present a method in which the length of a long homonucleotidestretch is reduced to a series of shorter nucleotide stretches in which each of them can be accurately determined. The combined accurate analysis of the smaller homonucleotidestretches then allows accurate determination of the length of the original longer homonucleotidestretch. The reduction in size of the homonucleotidestretch can be achieved by PCR, which we call homonu cleotide stretch reduction PCR (hnr PCR). An hnr primer is used, which is complementary against the region of the homonucleotidestretch, which ex   tends in the homonucleotidestretch but not until its end, and which contains at least one non complementary nucleotide. Since 100% complementary of a primer is not needed to allow DNA synthesis, as long as its 3â end is com plementary against its target, non complementary nucleotides can indeed be incorporated at certain positions of a primer. When a 5âadapter sequence is added to the primers used for hnr PCR, and a different 5âadapter sequence is added to the primers used for standard PCR, the combined analysis of the standard amplicon and the hnr amplicon against a given region then conclu des the actual sequence.

The free, open source, platform independent Leiden Open source  Variation Database software (LOVD, http://www.LOVD.nl) was developed  to build standardized databases for curating and sharing gene variants. To cope with the new demands posed by exome/genome studies we have de   veloped a new version of the LOVD platform. LOVD3 is compatible with the Gen2Phen data model, implemented with additional tables for phenotype, screening and transcript information. Genome wide sequence variant data can be stored in a single LOVD installation using chromosomal nucleotide  positions as reference. Web services retrieve gene and transcript informati  on on the fly. Data from exome/genome studies can be stored and displayed in several ways: variant by variant or all connected to one patient. To pro  mote early release of exome data, both phenotypes screened but unresolved  and variants not excluded from being causative can be stored (and identi fied) individually. Data can be public and non public for both with the option  to query. This leaves submitters in control of the data, ensuring that they  will be contacted to obtain essential information. Finally LOVD3 supports a new access level, âcollaboratorâ, allowing collaborating groups to share otherwise non public data. Other new features include: display of disease  specific phenotype information, storage of temporal phenotype informati  on, improved interface and speed, and queries in and across data columns. Web services will be developed to communicate between LOVD installations as well as to allow database queries.

Krawitz1","1Charite, Berlin, Germany, 2Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany, 3Berlin Brandenburg  Center for Regenerative Therapies, Berlin, Germany",Next generation sequencing (NGS) technology allows us to detect genetic variants on a genome wide scale. A deeper knowledge about the allele dis   tribution at heterozygous loci is essential for sensitive variant detection. We describe the pivotal steps of the library preparation before sequencing as a stochastic branching process and derive a mathematical framework for the expected distribution of alleles at heterozygous loci in a short read alignment. Based on technical replicates of human exomes we demonstrate that the variance of allele frequencies is higher than expected from a simple binomial distribution. As a consequence algorithms for mutation detection that apply this wrong prior distribution are less sensitive for variants that deviate strongly from the expected mean frequency. Due to the stochasticity inherent to the sample preparation we show that there is an upper bound for heterozygous variant detection even with increasing sequencing depth. Our results therefore indicate that technical replicates are an effective means in the reduction of error rates.,2012

As  reported, autosomal dominant OI is associated with the mutations in CO  L1A1  and COL1A2  genes and autosomal recessive OI is caused by mutations  in CRTAP , LEPRE1 and PPIB  genes. Methods:  In this study, exon wide mutation analyses of COL1A1, COL1A2,  CRTAP , LEPRE1 and PPIB  genes were performed by PCR and next generation  sequencing (NGS). One hundred unrelated patients and their family mem  bers diagnosed with OI clinically from Taiwan population were enrolled in  this study. Results:  46 patients had mutation in COL1A1  gene, and 25 in COL1A2  gene.  The mutation detection rate of COL1A1 and COL1A2  genes was 71%.

Recent discoveries support the hy   pothesis that TEs can directly mediate gene regulatory novelties at the net work level by contributing to transcriptional and post transcriptional mo dulation of nearby genes. For instance, TEs participate to the origin of new functional elements, as promoter sequences, transcription factors binding sites and enhancer, silencer and insulator elements. For example, binding sites of the pleiotropic master transcription factor p53 reside in LINE1, Alu and LTR repeats in the human genome. Similarly, here we describe the first case of a mobile element shaping the repertoire of the p53 target genes in zebrafish (Danio rerio). Through their embedded p53 responsive elements, the multiple copies of the non autonomous DNA transposon EnSpmN6_DR drive in several instances p53 dependent transcriptional modulation of the adjacent genes, whose human orthologs were often previously annotated as p53 targets. These transposons define a set of target genes that contribute to axonogenesis, synaptic transmission and the regulation of programmed cell death. Consistent with these biological functions, the EnSpmN6_DR co lonized loci are enriched for genes expressed in both adult and fetal brain. Our data corroborate the recent findings concerning the role of p53 in the regulation of neural stem cell development and pinpoint a remarkable ex   ample of convergent evolution: the exaptation of lineage specific transpo sons to establish networks of p53 regulated genes crucially involved in neu ronal morphogenesis in both a hominid and a teleost fish.",2012

Most variants,  however, explain only a small proportion of the estimated heritability,  suggesting that less common and rare variants might contribute to a lar ger extent to common diseases than assumed to date. Here we use next  generation sequencing to test whether such variants also contribute to the  risk for anxiety disorders by re sequencing 40 kb including all exons of the TMEM132D locus which we have previously shown to be associated with panic disorder and anxiety severity measures. Methods: DNA from 300 patients suffering from anxiety disorders, most  ly panic disorder (84.7 %), and 300 healthy controls was screened for the presence of genetic polymorphisms using the SOLiD 3+ next generation se   quencing platform (Life Technologies) in a pooled approach. Results were verified by individual re genotyping.Results: We identified a total 371 variants of which 247 had not been repor   ted before, including 15 novel non synonymous SNPs. The majority, 76 % of these variants had a minor allele frequency less than 5 %. While we did not identify additional common variants in TMEM132D associated with panic disorders, we observed an overrepresentation of rare functional variants in  healthy controls as compared to cases. Conclusions: Our data suggest that not only common but also rare variants within TMEM132D might contribute to the risk to develop anxiety disor   ders. In addition, the overrepresentation of rare functional variants in con trols supports previous results associating an increased function of this gene with anxiety measures.",2012

Addressing this obstacle is extremely important to enable the developing clinical sequencing market by improving speed of sample to sequence. Also, with the already vast number of stored FFPE samples in tissue banks and a growing impetus to study samples that may be rare or precious, a library method that can start with total, limited, and/or sheared RNA is necessary.

These processes remo ve up to 95% of the sample, the majority of which being unwanted rRNA and mtRNA. At Ambion, we have developed a library preparation method that can begin with a minimal amount of total RNA and selectively enrich for mRNA using a not so random (NSR) priming approach.

Nowadays pharmacogenetics is a very rapidly developing field of know   ledge which allows to predict therapeutical effect of different drugs and occurrence of pathologic medical reactions depending on genotype of the  patient.Every day more and more scientific articles are being published worldwide  regarding this matter. So extensive data which include information on diffe  rent genes, mutations, polymorphisms and drug to drug interactions can not be stored in oneâs mind and that is why cannot be used by the doctors without applying for special literature and databases. Our aim was to develop expert system for increasing efficacy of drug thera  py depending on genotype of the patient. As a result of the project expert system PharmakoGen was created. Expert system PharmakoGen is developed on the platform xGen IDS, suc  cessfully used for creation of diagnostic systems on hereditary neuromus cular diseases, eye illnesses, and chromosomal syndromes. Our expert system includes following elements: the module of input of pa  tient information, the knowledge base module, the module of results expla   nation, and finally the module of expert conclusion with special individual recommendations. The system can be used by doctors of various specialities and will help to  prescribe correct dosage of medicine and to prevent undesirable drug ef fects while treating patients.Our system also can be helpful in forming the list of genes and polymor   phisms which should be tested in patient before beginning of specific treat ment.Thus developed software will be interesting to the practicing doctors and will allow to optimize treatment of diseases depending on specific genetic features of the patient.",2012

To facilitate this process in a large ongoing effort to  study the whole genomes, exome and transcriptome of about 1500 Sardini   ans, we have developed âQCToolâ. The software takes as input SAM/BAM files and produces, in addition to standard statistics as base and mapping qualities, reads to reference mis  match rate, and genome coverage, also several parameters useful for wet lab  quality validation such as PCR duplicates count, nucleotide relative content, and insert size distribution statistics. It is enriched with contig/chromo  some specific breakdowns as well as per cycle quality plots. Furthermore  for exome sequencing, a simple command line option allows the parsing of targeted regions and the determination of quality statistics limited to such  regions. The package produces both PDF reports and an easily parsable file that can be integrated into LIMS systems or analysis tracking tools. For a direct use on presentations or papers, all plots are also generated in JPG format. The toolkit can be run stand alone, just supplying the input file on a single core machine, or in a multicore fashion. Around 8Gb of memory are required for the complete analysis of a human genome aligned file, but deactivating some analysis options enables execution on desktop machines using only a few kilobytes of memory.",2012

For IGF2R DMR2 we additionally screened 95 parents of patients born SGA (47 parent pairs and one single mother). We established in one child the diagno sis of Temple syndrome most likely due to an epimutation. Furthermore five patients and six individuals from the SGA parent cohort displayed IGF2R DMR2 hypermethylation. Of these in two families IGF2R DMR2 hyperme   thylation was detected in the child and one parent. Five individuals in the control cohort displayed IGF2R DMR2 hypermethylation. We conclude that imprinting disorders may still be underdiagnosed and are a relevant diffe rential diagnosis in children born SGA. Hypermethylation in IGF2R DMR2 is not enriched in our patient cohort. Lack of genotype phenotype correlation in our and previous studies leads to the assumption that IGF2R DMR2 hy   permethylation most likely represents an epigenetic polymorphism, howe ver a Mendelian inheritance cannot be excluded from our observations.",2012

SIRT6 is located in the nucleus and promotes a number of important key  functions like DNA repair, genome stabilization and telomere maintenance. In accordance with these functions, Sirt6 knock out mice show several dra  matic symptoms of premature ageing and die within four weeks. We performed microarray gene expression profiling of hepatocytes from Sirt6 deficient and wildtype mice. This analysis detected a significant upre gulation of the imprinted H19, Igf2 and Peg3 genes which was subsequently  confirmed by quantitative PCR. Bisulphite pyrosequencing of the imprin  ting control regions of these three and other imprinted genes did not reveal significant methylation differences between Sirt6 deficient and wildtype  hepatocytes. Similarly, DNA methylation analysis of these cells at subtelo  meric regions known to exhibit DNA methylation changes associated with increased telomeric recombination in DNA methyltransferase deficient  cells gave normal results. However, using quantification of global DNA me  thylation with a specific antibody in an ELISA like reaction, we observed significantly decreased levels of 5 methylcytosine in Sirt6 deficient cells. Bisulphite pyrosequencing excluded that repetitive elements as frequently  used indicators of global DNA methylation changes are affected by this de   methylation process. Our results provide further evidence that the epigenetic regulatory role of  SIRT6 is more likely associated with higher order chromatin structures and  specific histone modifications. Nevertheless, there is an obvious decline in global DNA methylation in Sirt6 deficient cells that needs to be studied in  more depth.",2012

Many of these loci harbor multiple genes and for many  of these it is difficult to link genotype to phenotype. We therefore under   took a systems biology approach to fill this gap, integrating results from  eQTL analysis, network/pathway based analyses, imputation results, and SNP function annotation. The eQTL mapping, using whole genome gene  expression data and genotyping data from 1,240 samples and replication in  an independent set of 229 blood samples, suggested significant eQTLs at 16 CeD SNPs (FDR P < 1.12*10 7 to 1.51*10 137). Pathway analyses using seed  genes identified by GWAS and eQTL analysis suggested causative genes at 55  out of 57 CeD loci.

We imputed CeD associated regions using 1000  Genome project and annotated the function of all the susceptibility variants.  SNPs with strong eQTLs lay within binding sites of either microRNAs (e.g. for IL18RAP , UBE2L3) or transcription factors (e.g. for MMEL1, CSK).

 Alternative Splicing Governs miRNA Biogenesis,P11.137,"Z. Melamed1, A. Levy1,2,3, G. Lev Maor1, G. Ast1","1Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of  Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Tel Aviv, Israel, 2Department of Molecular Genetics,  Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, 3Rosetta Genomics Ltd",", Rehovot, Israel. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are noncoding RNAs of 22 nucleotides that induce post transcriptional gene silencing through base pairing with their target mRNAs. miRNA primary transcripts contain a local hairpin structure that is cleaved by the Microprocessor complex, consisting of RNAse III Drosha and DGCR8. The processing reaction releases the hairpin shaped intermediates (pre miRNAs). The majority of mammalian miRNAs are located in introns. Splicing of the introns in which such miRNAs reside was recently suggested to derive independently from the miRNA processing. We have uncovered a novel regulatory mechanism in which splicing determines the processing of pre miRNAs. Based on a bioinformatic analysis of predicted transcription units of all miRNAs genes in 18 species, we identified a group of 52 miRNA precursors that share an intriguing genomic location   positioned on exon intron junctions, these miRNAs are exposed to a regulatory mechanism in which splicing or alternative splicing might determine their biogenesis.We experimentally demonstrated that in these cases the splicing machin ery and the Microprocessor complex compete for processing of the same region on the RNA transcript and therefore, either the spliced mRNA or the pre miRNA can be produced separately from the shared transcript. We also showed that tissue specific and embryonic specific alternative splicing negatively regulates the levels of mature miRNA produced from splice site overlapping miRNA precursor, and reciprocally, that Drosha and DGCR8 mo dulate inclusion of alternatively spliced exon that overlaps with the miRNA stem loop. Our data reveal a potential role for alternative splicing in the re gulation of miRNA biogenesis.",2012
 Pseudogenes: an unsolvable problem in Whole Exome Sequencing?,P11.138,"B. Schuster, K. Knies, D. Schindler","University of Wuerzburg, Department of Human Genetics, Wuerzburg, Germany","Over the past years Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) became an established tool for the detection of mutations underlying rare human genetic disorders. We performed WES in nine patients and in all cases the same genes consi   stently caught our attention, because they were overrepresented by hetero zygous single nucleotide variants (SNV). One of our patients carried a large number of heterozygous base substitutions in CDC27, even though one allel  of this gene was known to be partially deleted. We found three listed pseu  dogenes of CDC27 which could be responsible for wrong mutation calls by misalignment of short sequence reads. Via selective primer design we were able to specifically resequence the functional gene by Sanger technique. As  expected, all variants were identified as false positive calls due to overlap  with the pseudogenes. In consequence of this finding, we became more alert concerning alignment artifacts due to paralogous sequences in the other  projects as well. But contrary to the general expectation that these misalign  ments should be detectable because of their increased SNV counts, we also found several isolated SNVs which should have mapped to a related pseudo   gene. Analysis of the same data with different bioinformatic tools could only partially decrease the error rate. We therefore conclude that pseudogenes cause an enormous amount of false positive SNVs and require careful atten  tion because they cannot be withdrawn as easily as sequencing errors. Mu   tation validation by Sanger sequencing still seems to be indispensable and  the possibility of false negative mutation calls should be regarded as well.",2012
 Functional characterization of Williams Beuren syndrome chromosome region 22 protein,P11.139,"K. Ãunap1,2, A. Kurg1, R. Kurg2","1Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 2Institute of  Technology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia","Williams Beuren syndrome (WBS) is a multisystem disorder associated with the hemizygous deletion of 26 28 genes on chromosome 7q11.23. Typical features of WBS comprise a recognizable pattern of facial dysmorphism, su pravalvular aortic stenosis, connective tissue abnormalities, hypercalcemia and distinctive neurobehavioral phenotype. Hemizygosity of elastin gene is associated with supravalvular aortic stenosis; however it is unknown how the deletion of other genes in 7q11.23 contribute to the phenotype. Altered expression level of dosage sensitive genes within aneuploid segments is the main cause of WBS.WBSCR22 (protein expressed from Williams Beuren chromosomal region 22) is a nuclear protein which has a predicted S adenosylmethionine (SAM) binding motif and it is assumed that WBSCR22 has methyltransferase ac tivity. SAM dependent MTases represent a diverse class of enzymes which act on protein, small molecule, lipid or nucleic acid methylation and there fore mediate numerous cellular processes. The yeast homolog of WBSCR22, Bud23, sharing 47% similarity on amino acid level, is a ribosomal 18S rRNA methyltransferase required for ribosome biogenesis.In our laboratory, we investigate the cellular function of WBSCR22. In sucro se gradient ultracentrifugation WBSCR22 cosediments with free ribosome small subunit (40S). WBSCR22 knock down reduces the level of free 40S and alters 40S/60S ratio. WBSCR22 is involved in processing of 18S rRNA since WBSCR22 knock down causes the accumulation of 18S E pre rRNA in cell nucleus.

The affected males have moderate to severe intellectual disability, severe speech pro blems and aggressive behavior. Two point linkage analysis using 26 poly   morphic markers spanning the X chromosome had localized the disease gene to a large interval Xq12  Xq21.33 (flanking markers DXS983 in Xq12 and DXS6799 in Xq21.33) with a maximum lod score of 2.36.

Hence, it is important to  gain a deeper understanding of the genetic and environmental contributions  to interindividual variation in metabolite levels. As part of our ongoing con tributions to the European Network of Genomic and Genetic Epidemiology  (ENGAGE) consortium, we carried out a genome wide association (GWA)  study for serum metabolite levels in 1198 unrelated individuals who parti cipated in the Netherlands Twin Register Biobank project. From 2004 until 2008, blood samples were obtained from these individuals (67.2% male,  32.8% female; mean age 52 years [SD, 13]) after overnight fasting. Meta   bolomics analysis was performed on the serum fractions of these samples,  using the Biocrates AbsoluteIDQ p150 kit and electrospray ionization MS/ MS enabling detection of 163 metabolites belonging to five different clas  ses: acylcarnitines (N,41), amino acids (AA, N,14), glycerophospholipids (N,92), sphingolipids (N,15), and a compound measure for hexoses (N,1).  Genotyping was performed using various GWA chips. Imputation against  HapMap 2 Build 36 Release 24 resulted in data for 3.8M unfiltered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) for each participant. SNPtest v2.2.0 was used for association analysis, including age, sex and principal component scores for population stratification as covariates. Genome wide (conser   vative Bonferroni corrected p <3.1E 10) significant hits were observed  for several metabolites. The associations for 22 glycerophospholipids with SNPs in the fatty acid desaturase (FADS) gene cluster were among the most prominent. In conclusion, we found several clusters of genome wide signi ficantly associated SNPs for metabolites detected by MS in human serum. Future meta analyses will combine these data with the results of six ENGA   GE partners, to determine whether the results found in our Dutch sample are replicated in other cohorts. P12.

RHO was sequenced in families with Retinitis Pigmentosa and RPE65 in families with Leber Con   genital Amaurosis and Retinitis Pigmentosa.A great number of genetic variants in coding and non coding regions were found in this study. Most of them were known variations and include disea   se causing mutations and known polymorphic variants. Mutations in AB CA4 were found in patients with Stargardt Disease, autosomal recessive Re tinitis Pigmentosa and Cone Rod Dystrophy. Mutation c.272G>A (p.R91Q) in RPE65 was found in a patient with Retinitis Pigmentosa and in his healthy mother. This mutation has been associated with autosomal recessive Reti nitis Pigmentosa.

MDR3 protein translocates phosphatidylcoline (PC) from the inner to the  outer leaflet of the hepatocanalicular membrane; its deficiency, related to  ABCB4 mutations, favours the formation of âtoxic bileâ. A continuum of he  patobiliary diseases have been associated with ABCB4 mutations but, for most of them, the detrimental effect on the protein is speculative only. The  functional relevance of two strategic mutations within the N terminal Nu  cleotide Binding Domain was examined with stably transfected HUH28 cell lines expressing wild type and mutant MDR3 proteins by western blotting, immunocytochemistry and chromatographic quantification of lipids, coll   ected from culture medium after sodium taurocholate (NaTC) stimulation.  As suggested by our three dimensional model of MDR3 (Degiorgio D et al.,  2007), the p.Y403H mutation involves the A loop while the p.L481R muta   tion is contained into the Q loop. Our results show that both MDR3 mutant proteins were expressed in a comparable way to the MDR3 wild type prote  in: a molecular mass of 160KDa associated with a green fluorescent signal,  intenser and sharper in the plasma membranes, was constantly identified. However, compared to the stably transfected HUH28 cell line expressing wild type MDR3 protein in the presence of NaTC 3mM, the lipid dosage into  culture medium has shown (with five indipendent experiments) that i) the efflux of PC is reduced (p<0.01) from cell lines expressing p.Y403H  and p.L481R mutant proteins;ii) the efflux of cholesterol is increased (p<0.01) from cell line expressing the p.Y403H mutant protein. In conclusion, these mutations could promote in vivo formation of toxic bile  with reduced amounts of PC (p.L481R) or with reduced amounts of PC and  increased level of cholesterol (p.Y403H).",2012

We have developed a PCR+sequencing based technology that allows a speci   fic and accurate analysis of the PKD1  sequences, excluding the pseudogenes  ones.In this work we have used this methodology to obtain a genetic diagnosis in a cohort of ADPKD from different Spanish hospitals. Results do not show the presence of prevalent mutations in the Spanish population. We have iden   tified a high percentage of non previously mutations making difficult their clinical interpretation. In these cases, familial analyses have been performed and results have been supported by in silico analyses. The identification of  the disease causing mutations in several Spanish families has allowed to provide a genetic counselling and an accurate genetic diagnosis to the pati   ents and opened the possibility to offer familial testing and prenatal genetic diagnosis.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012291 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

Mutations in 15 genes have been identified in familial cases and mutations in SOD1 have been reported to account for 12 23%% of familial cases. Recently, an intronic GGGGCC hexanucleotide repeat expansion in C9ORF72 was found to be associated not only with ALS but also with frontotemporal dementia (FTD) and an overlapping phenotype combining ALS and FTD. Indeed, a re peat expansion in C9ORF72 was identified in up to 30% of familial and even 5% of sporadic ALS cases making C9ORF72 the most commonly mutated ALS gene. In most of the studies published so far, molecular testing solely relies on an indirect PCR based methodology for repeat detection without determining the exact repeat size. Therefore, little is known about the ex   act size and size range of causative C9ORF72 alleles. Here, we report on a Southern blot based analysis of the exact repeat length in a cohort of Ger   man and Swedish ALS families as well as on possible repeat expansions in seemingly healthy controls. Our study thus broadens the knowledge about the size range of normal and pathological C9ORF72 alleles, which is impor   tant e.g. for the identification of genotype phenotype correlations as well as for improved individualized risk predictions and genetic counseling.

We present a 2200 individual pedigree in 6 countries where individuals  either with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) or frontotemporal dementia  (FTD) in 1999 was found to be linked to 9p21. We now demonstrate that the  patients with ALS or FTD share a massive GGGGCC hexanucleotide expansi on in C9ORF72 as a cause of neurodegeneration. The patients have variable  degrees of expansion in leucocytes from peripheral blood. Autopsies perfor   med on 6 patients (4 ALS, 2 FTD) show very similar morphological cellular  findings but in different cell populations depending on the phenotype of the individual. Remarkably, while no mutations could be detected in the SOD1  in any of the patients, all FTD and ALS patients showed neuronal inclusions  that stained positive for highly specific antibodies for misfolded wild type SOD1. While the disease penetrance for either ALS or FTD is complete in  some parts of this huge family, in other parts it is incomplete. Whether this  is due to variable size of the hexanucleotide expansion in different cell po pulations or have other causes is being studied.",2012

This disease is a dominantly inherited condition and sequence analysis had esta blished that causative mutations involve PAX6 gene located in chromosomal  region 11p13.We have investigated the presence of PAX6 mutations in 93 cases of aniri  dia come from different Italian regions. We have used molecular techniques such as sequence analysis and MLPA for every case.Among the 93 cases, 44 are familiar (47%). The causative mutation was identified in 50 subjects (54%). In 19 cases (38%), the mutations was a deletion not identified through MLPA, in 31 remaining cases (62%) by se   quence analysis. In two cases with deletion, both PAX6  and WT1 genes are  involved. In 10 cases, the deletion regard only ELP4  gene (located about 35  Kb downstream PAX6 3â region), suggesting that the disease is caused by a  mutation that affect element controlling gene expression.Among the identified mutations by sequence analysis, 21 consist in non sense mutations, 5 in missense mutations, and 5 in site splicing mutations. Several of these mutations are novel, not present in the PAX6 mutation data   base (http://www.hgu.mrc.ac.uk/Softdata/PAX6/).These data provide important indications: i) Mutational screening of PAX6   gene must include techniques such as MLPA, which is able to identified mutations not observed by analysis sequence. ii) In a relevant fraction of patients with aniridia (about 10%), the alteration consist in a deletion of element that play a role in the transcriptional control.",2012

The  LIM homeodomain transcription factor Islet1 (Isl1) represents a prominent  marker for cardiac progenitor cells of the second heart field and has been  proposed, very similar to Shox2, to play an essential early role in the speci   fication and patterning of the SAN. Here, we compared gene expression levels in the right atria of wildtype and  Shox2  /  hearts using microarray experiments and identified Isl1 as one of  its putative target genes. The downregulation of Isl1 expression in Shox2 /   hearts was confirmed and the affected region narrowed down to the SAN by whole mount in situ hybridization. Using luciferase reporter assays and  EMSA studies, we identified two specific SHOX2 binding sites within intron 2 of the ISL1 locus. We also provide functional evidence for Isl1 as a tran  scriptional target of Shox2 by rescuing the Shox2  mediated bradycardia  phenotype with Isl1 using zebrafish as a model system.

Disease mainlyaffects the right ventricle, but left ventricle, atriums and septum might be involved. Mutations in the desmosome armadillo repeat protein plakophi   lin 2 are common in patients with ARVD. Methods: A group of 12 unrelated Russian ARVD patients were examined. Clinical and instrumental exami nation included collecting of personal and family history, physical exami nation, standard and 24 h ECG, Echo CG and cardiac MRI. Genetic analysis of the PKP2 gene was performed by direct Sanger sequencing. Results: Ge netic screening of mutations in PKP2 gene in DNA samples of 12 Russian ARVD patients was performed. Two mutations p.S140F and P .W538X were found in two unrelated families. Female patient (35 y.o.) carried heterozy   gous p.S140F variant had thinning of anterior wall infarction of the right ventricle and the presence of epicardial fat. Male patient (71 y.o.) carried heterozygous nonsense PW538X had sustained ventricular tachycardia sin ce 41 y.o., ventricular fibrillation, AVB(I) and hypertrophy and dilation of RV. ICD was implanted, patient had repeated appropriate shocks. Those two variants were previously described as disease causing mutations. Three ad ditional variants without apparent clinical significance were detected in 3 patients. Conclusion: We identified two mutations in PKP2 gene in 2 of 12 Russian unrelated ARVD patients (16%). This prevalence matches with the prevalence of ARVD9 (MIM*609040).

With the G0 micronucleus test, whereby the cells are irradiated in G0 phase of the cell cycle, 3 5X enhanced radiosensitivity is observed in typical AT patients compared to control persons. However, in this adult A T patient, we only found a 1.7X increased radiosensitivity and no enhanced radiosensiti   vity in the parents. As ATM is involved in homologous recombination and G2/M cell cycle checkpoint, we developed a novel test, evaluating the num ber of micronuclei in lymphocytes irradiated in G2 phase of the cell cycle. This test showed about 3.5X enhanced radiosensitivity for the A T patient compared to controls. For the heterozygous parents values were lower than for the proband, but significantly higher than for controls.This novel G2 micronucleus test showed the potential to distinguish bi alle   lic and mono allelic ATM mutation carriers from controls. We will evaluate if this test allows determination of radiosensitivity in carriers of germline mutations in other genes involved in G2/M checkpoint and associated with an increased risk for breast cancer (BRCA1&2, Chek2, etc.).

In the third family sharing a haplotype over  the region on 16p12 p11.2 the clinical presentation was BFIE. After sequen   cing several positional candidate genes, the PRRT2 gene was sequenced. Pa  tients in all three families were heterozygous for the c.649dupC duplication mutation, the most frequently encountered PRRT2 mutation. These data  give further support for the association of PRRT2 mutations to both epilepsy  and movement disorders of both kinesigenic and non kinesigenic type. The association of a single mutation with a variety of phenotypes highlights the contribution of modifying genetic and/or environmental factors to the cli nical presentation.",2012

Here we describe a patient with brachydactyly and a novel mutation (Q317K) in the DNA binding homeodomain of HOXD13. Anomalies of hands and feet are characterized by shortness of fingers and toes, oligodactyly, and aplasia of some terminal phalanges. Functional analysis was performed by retroviral overexpression of FLAG tagged HOXD13 wt and mutant in chicken micromass cultures, a well established model of chondrocyte differentiati   on. Targets of HOXD13 were identified by chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by next generation sequencing (ChIP seq). Bioinformatic analysis of precipitated sequences showed an altered DNA binding motif of the mu tant protein. The inferred motif of HOXD13 Q317K showed similarity to that of  PITX1. The mutant lysine at position 317 corresponds also to a conserved lysine at the analogous position of bicoid type homeodomain proteins such as PITX1. Thus we compared the binding pattern of HOXD13 wt, HOXD13Q317K,  and PITX1 using ChIP seq and found a shift of HOXD13Q317K towards a PITX1  like binding pattern. Furthermore the expression profile in HOXD13Q317K ove   rexpressing micromass cultures also shifted towards a PITX1 overexpressi   on profile. Injection of HOXD13Q317K into developing wing buds of chicken  embryos showed a PITX1 like phenotype as well. Our results demonstrate how ChIP seq can be used to characterize genome wide binding profiles of mutant transcription factors. The mutation results in a partial conversion of HOXD13 into PITX1 and thus ectopic activation of PITX1 targets.",2012

Mammalian branched chain Î± keto acid dehydrogenase complex (BCKDc)  is a mitochondrial macromolecular multienzymatic complex consisting of  three catalytic components that catalyzes the rate limiting step in the oxida  tion of branched chain Î± keto acids. BCKDc deficiency leads to the autoso   mal inborn error of metabolism  maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) . Acti  vity of the complex is regulated by a specific kinase (BCKDK) which causes  inactivation, and the protein phosphatase 2Cm (PP2Cm) which causes ac tivation. Up to now, the 150 described MSUD causing mutations have been only found on the genes encoding for the E1Î±, E1Î² and E2 catalytic subunits,  but not much is known regarding diseased states that could arise due to  errors in the enzymatic regulation of BCKDc. We present here the first two patients with a defective regulation of BCKDc. The first one corresponds to  a MSUD patient with a mild variant phenotype. The second one is a patient  with neurological abnormalities, showing a decreased amount of branched chain amino acids levels in physiological fluids. The Sanger sequencing of  BCKD related genes in both patients evidenced: a homozygous null mutati   on change c.417_418delTA (p.His139fs) in the PPM1K  gene, which encodes  for PP2Cm for the MSUD patient, and that was proved to be pathogenic by  genetic complementation in patientâs fibroblasts using the pT REX DEST30/ PPM1K wt vector, and a homozygous c.1166T>C (p.Leu389Pro) nucleotide  variation in the BCKDK  gene, undetected in 300 control alleles, for the se   cond one.

Wieacker","University Clinics Muenster, Muenster, Germany","A frequent problem in molecular genetic diagnosis is the assessment of un classified variants (UCVs). Exonic missense or silent variants and intronic variants outside the invariably exon flanking dinucleotides are ambiguous and in silico analysis has its limits in being theoretical. Expression analysis  via RNA from blood lymphocytes can help to discriminate between variants that influence correct splicing and those that don`t. A precondition for this approach is the expression of the corresponding gene in blood cells as is the case for e.g. BRCA1, BRCA2, RAD51C and NF1. Using reverse transcripti on, RT PCR and sequence analysis of the resulting product(s) we were able to show a splice effect for the BRCA1 variants p.G1366S, IVS19 12A>G, the RAD51C variant p.C135F and the NF1 variants IVS16del 6_3, IVS3+6T>G and p.L1569V.

Using the Invitrogen Flp In system we generated a stable cell line that expresses flag tagged C15orf2 upon doxycycline induction. By immu nocytochemistry in expression induced cells we found C15orf2 located at the nuclear periphery, where it co localized with NPC and nuclear lamina proteins. Extending these observations to three dimensional structured il lumination fluorescence microscopy (3D SIM), which achieves an eight fold improved volumetric resolution over conventional imaging and can resolve single NPCs, we saw that C15orf2 is located at the inner nuclear membrane where it strongly associates with the NPC. Additionally, in nuclear envelope isolation and fractionation experiments C15orf2 co purified with NPC and nuclear lamina proteins.These experiments for the first time demonstrate that C15orf2 is part of the NPC or its associated molecular networks.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012297 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

Females with severe 21 hydroxylase deficiency are exposed to excess androgens prenatal   ly and are born with ambiguous genitalia. Also most patients can not syn  thesize sufficient aldosterone to maintain sodium balance and may develop  potentially fatal âsalt wastingâ crises if not treated. Methods: Whole CYP21A2 gene were analyzed in 100 patients and 80 con trols. Distinctive primers were selected for the amplification of the functio nal gene (CYP21A2) as there is a pseudogene (CYP21A1P) with 98% homo   logy. After the isolation of DNA from peripheric blood, functional gene was amplified by PCR. Mutations were detected with direct sequencing. Results were evaluated statistically. Results: Totally 66 different mutations/polymorphisms were found in  which 20 of them cause amino acid changes and 24 of them are novel. Also 12 of them were found statistically significant in patients when compared to controls. Additionally GâA mutation at position 711 (13 %) (novel mutati   on), A/CâG mutation at position 777 (38 %) and CâG mutation at position 1709 (20 %) were only detected in the patient group and were found stati   stically significant when compared to controls. Conclusion: Prenatal diagnosis of CAH has been utilized for over 20 years  especially by screening 9 known mutations. In case of obtaining the similar  results of GâA mutation at position 711 in different populations, it may be used as a marker for prenatal diagnosis. Therefore, genital ambiguity and salt wasting can be reduced in CAH patients by using prenatal approaches.",2012
 Targeted next generation sequencing for the molecular genetic diagnostics of arrhythmogenic cardiac disorders in sudden cardiac death,P12.038,"C. Marschall , C. Heberle, I. Vogl, H.

Ion channel disorders (channelopathies) such as the long QT syndro me (LQTS), catecholaminergic polymorphic ventricular tachycardia (CPVT) and Brugada syndrome (BrS) may account for more than 30% of unclear SCD cases lacking cardiac structural abnormalities. Other frequent causes of SCD are hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) affecting 1 of 500 people and arrhythmogenic right ventricular dysplasia (ARVD). As HCM and ARVD may present with only little structural symptoms, the differential diagnosis of these arrhythmogenic disorders may be difficult.

Variable extraskel etal features include sparse hair, immunodeficiency, and predisposition to malignancy. CHH is caused by mutations in the RMRP  gene, which encodes  the RNA component of the RNase MRP complex. RNase MRP is involved in the endoribonucleolytic processing of specific RNA substrates (viperin and  cyclin B2), RNA primers for mitochondrial DNA replication, and pre 5.8S  rRNA. The RMRP  RNA also forms complexes with TERT , the telomerase pro  tein component. When reanalyzing the Rmrp expression in heterozygous Rmrp 70A>G knock  in mice, we exclusively detected the wildtype allele in all tested tissues. We  hypothesized that the instability of the mutated transcript had increased  after neo cassette removal and decided to analyse the expression of muta   ted RMRP transcripts in CHH patients. Our qPCR data show clearly reduced  RMRP  transcript levels in all patients and mild reductions in parents car  rying one mutated allele. Then we compared the transcript ratios of both alleles by sequencing. Confirming our mouse data, the mutated transcript  was nearly absent in heterozygous parents. Interestingly, we also observed shifted transcript ratios in compound heterozygous CHH patients. Our results indicate that RMRP mutations lead to reduced RMRP  transcript  levels, probably due to instability of mutated transcripts. Furthermore, the  transcript instability depends on the individual RMRP  mutation. The diffe  rent stabilities and resulting variable residual RMRP  transcript levels might  explain the diverse clinical presentation of CHH patients, as, e.g., the degree of telomerase dysfunction observed in CHH patients may be dosage depen   dent.",2012

However, very little is currently known  about the biological role of CDKL5. We here show that Cdkl5 localizes at  excitatory synapses and contributes to correct spine morphology and syn aptic activity. Since we previously found that a balanced chromosome trans  location in the Netrin G1 gene (NTNG1) also caused atypical RTT with early  onset seizures, we hypothesized that the two genes play a role in common  pathogenetic processes. Immunofluorescence and immunoprecipitation ex   periments revealed that Cdkl5 interacts with the Netrin G1 ligand NGL 1,  a postsynaptic neuronal adhesion protein. In addition, we could show that  NGL 1 is phosphorylated and that this phosphorylation is mediated by CD   KL5, in vitro. Using fibroblasts from a patient who carried a truncation of  the CDKL5 gene, we obtained further evidence that CDKL5 phosphorylates  NGL 1. Moreover, we have found that this phosphorylation is necessary for promoting a stable association between NGL 1 and PSD95, a scaffold protein  of the post synaptic density. Accordingly, phospho mutant NGL 1 lacked the  ability to induce synaptic contacts, while its phospho mimetic form bound  PSD95 more efficiently and partially rescued the CDKL5 specific spine de   fects.

Cornelia de Lange Syndrome [CdLS (MIM#122470)] is a rare multisystemic  disorder, characterized by a typical phenotype that includes distinctive facial dysmorphism, hirsutism, growth and psychomotor developmental delay, abnormalities of the upper extremities, and relatively frequent gastrointe stinal and congenital heart defects. CdLS is essentially caused by mutations in the NIPBL and SMC1A genes (~50% and 5% of cases, respectively), but  mutations have been also described in other genes (PDS5A , PDS5B , SMC3)  (http://www.lovd.nl/CDLS). This genetic heterogeneity in CdLS can howe ver be explained by a close functional relationship at the cellular level, since all these proteins are involved in chromatid cohesion.The molecular and clinical characterization of 42 Portuguese CdLS patients has been previously described (Oliveira et al ., 2010). In this work we con  ducted the molecular analysis of NIPBL gene and more recently expanded  this study to other 20 patients. Subsequently, all the molecularly unresol ved patients were screened for large deletions and duplications in NIPBL  by MLPA, and point mutations in SMC1A  by high resolution melting curve  analysis and sequencing.Preliminary results allowed us to identify 4 previously known mutations (including a case with somatic mosaicism), 3 novel mutations (c.3316C>T , c.6983C>G and c.7307C>T) and 2 large deletions in the NIPBL gene.

It shares phenotypic traits with other ciliopathies such as AlstrÃ¶m syndrome (ALMS), nephrono phthisis (NPHP) or Joubert syndromes. BBS mutations have been detected in 16 genes and no clear genotype to phenotype correlation could be ob served. This extensive genetic heterogeneity is a major problem for mole cular diagnosis and genetic counseling. While various strategies have been proposed in order to optimize mutation detection they either fail to detect mutations in a majority of patients or are time consuming and costly. We tested a targeted exon capture strategy coupled with multiplexing and high throughput sequencing on a total of 52 patients: 14 with known mutations as proof of principle, 38 with no previously detected mutations. Thirty ge nes were targeted in total, including the 16 BBS genes, the 12 known NPHP genes and the single ALMS gene. This strategy allowed the reliable detection of causative mutations (including homozygous/ heterozygous exon deleti ons) in 68% of BBS patients with no previous molecular diagnosis and in all proof of principle samples. Three probands were found to carry truncating mutations in ALMS1 confirming the phenotypic overlap between both disor   ders. The overall efficiency of detecting mutations in patients was positively correlated with their compliance to classical BBS phenotype suggesting that only a few true BBS genes remain to be identified. We will illustrate some interpretation problems one may encounter in diagnostic settings due to the multiplicity of variants detected. Targeted capture strategy appears highly efficient and cost effective for genetically heterogeneous diseases.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012299 www.eshg.orgESHG Poster",2012

We applied whole exome capture and NGS in 2 complex clinical cases, invol ving: (1) an 18yr old male patient, exhibiting multiple abnormalities of the  kidneys coupled to progressive visual impairment, and (2) a chorionic vil  lus sample following termination of pregnancy, of a male fetus with skeletal and genital anomalies. Exome enrichment was achieved using Roche Nim bleGen v2 capture, followed by NGS on an Illumina GAIIx at >50x coverage.  Sequence data was analyzed and variants were filtered, identified and evalu   ated utilizing NextGENe v2.1 sequence analysis software (SoftGenetics) and  various publicly available tools and databases. In the first case, a known or  novel pathological heterozygous mutation was identified in each of 4 diffe  rent genes (NPHP4, RPGRIP1L, CC2D2A, AVIL), consistent with a diagnosis of multi allelic cilliopathy with retinal degeneration. In the second case, a  predicted pathological hemizygous mutation c.194A>G (p.N65S) within the  NSDHL gene on Xq28 was identified, and its presence was confirmed in the carrier mother. The presence of this novel mutation in the male fetus is most likely associated with malformation syndromes caused by dysfunction in cholesterol biosynthesis, in agreement with the clinical findings.

Mutations in COL5A1  and COL5A2 , encoding type V collagen, have been re  ported, but the proportion of classic EDS that result from defects in these genes remains unresolved. We studied 126 patients with a clinically esta blished or suspected diagnosis of classic EDS. Of these, 102 patients fulfilled all major diagnostic criteria for classic EDS (Villefranche nosology) (group 1). We also included 24 patients in whom the diagnosis of classic EDS could not unequivocally be established, as they presented jointhypermobility and soft, mildly hyperextensible skin but no typical dystrophic scarring (group 2). Inclusion of this cohort allowed evaluating the most indicative clinical features for the presence of a type V collagen defect. In total, a type V col lagen defect was identified in 93/102 patients in group 1, among which 49 novel mutations. Approximately half of these defects caused COL5A1  haploinsufficiency, whereas one third were structural mutations in COL5A1   or COL5A2 . In 9/102 patients no type V collagen defect was detected. No  obvious genotype phenotype correlation was observed. In contrast, none of the patients of group 2 harboured a COL5A1 /COL5A2 mutation. Our data  show that >90% of patients fulfilling all classic EDS Villefranche criteria harbour a type V collagen defect. Biochemical and molecular analysis in the mutation negative patients from group 1 and 2 excluded the involvement of other fibrillar collagens and TNXB, which implies that type V collagen is the  major, if not the only, protein involved in classic EDS.",2012
Cockayne Syndrome testing at BGL a new service and case study,P12.050,"M. Greenslade1, L. Yarram1, P . Lunt2, A. Lehmann3, H. Fawcett3, M.

Cockayne Syndrome (CS) is a recessive multisystem disorder characterised by early onset microcephaly, mental retardation, cachectic growth failure,  photosensitivity and progressive neurological deterioration usually leading  to death in childhood or early adulthood. CS is associated with mutations in ERCC6 (OMIM:609413) and ERCC8  (OMIM:216400). 75% of CS mutations are in ERCC6 and 25% in ERCC8. The  proteins encoded by ERCC6 and ERCC8 both play important roles in tran  scription coupled nucleotide excision repair.We present an urgent prenatal case of a mother presenting at 10+ weeks,  her 17 month old son having a definite clinical diagnosis of CS but no mole  cular or cellular confirmation. Time pressures precluded obtaining a mole cular test result in European service/research laboratories, and cellular UV  sensitivity studies requiring cultured skin biopsy typically taking 6 8 weeks.  Sanger sequencing assays for ERCC6 and ERCC8 were designed and valida   ted in ten working days and the proband identified as homozygous for an  ERCC6 pathogenic variant c.3052dupA. This facilitated prenatal testing by  sequence analysis with results available in three days, confirmed by UV test  5 6 weeks later. Rapid reporting of sequencing assays recommends DNA testing as the first line approach in suspected CS cases meeting clinical criteria, complemented  by the cellular UV sensitivity studies when variants of unknown significance  (VUS) are detected. DNA testing avoids an invasive skin biopsy, and may re  duce the number of additional tests undertaken upstream e.g. microarray  CGH.An accredited diagnostic genetics service for CS is now available for the UK  and Europe, we present an audit of referrals to date.",2012

Since several sibships with CSS have been de scribed autosomal recessive inheritance was considered a likely possibility. We selected three unrelated patients with CSS and the parents of one patient for exome sequencing. Filtering using public databases rendered recessive inheritance unlikely, as there was no gene with two heterozygous or one homozygous variant in all three patients. Focusing on autosomal dominant inheritance instead, only one gene with a variant in all three patients remai ned after filtering inherited and homozygous variants. Three truncating mu tations in ARID1B were identified which were confirmed and shown to be de  novo by Sanger sequencing. Array based CNV analysis in 2000 patients with  intellectual disability revealed deletions encompassing ARID1B in three pati  ents with partially overlapping phenotypes. They share facial features, intel lectual disability and severe speech delay with the CSS patients. Interestingly, they lack the typical CSS abnormalities and CSS was considered in only one if these patients as a diagnosis. Several patients with ARID1B haploinsufficien  cy have been described in literature with a very similar phenotype and often with agenesis of the corpus callosum. Therefore we conclude that haploin sufficiency of ARID1B, which encodes a (epigenetic) modifier of chromatin  structure, emerges as an important cause of CSS and a potential common cause of intellectual disability and speech impairment. By screening additio nal groups of patients for ARID1B we have identified several new mutations.

Coffin Siris syndrome (CSS; MIM 135900) is a rare congenital anomaly syn drome characterized by growth deficiency, intellectual disability, microce   phaly, coarse facial features and hypoplastic nail of the fifth finger and/or toe. The majority of patients are sporadic, being compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance. The genetic cause has not been elucidated. To reveal the genetic basis of CSS, we performed whole exome sequencing  of five typical subjects. Based on our scheme assuming that an abnormality of a particular gene would be shared in two or more patients, 51 variants remained as candidates. All the variants were checked by Sanger sequen   cing of PCR products amplified using genomic DNA from the five patients and their parents. Nine were false positives (errors), 40 were inherited from either the father or mother, and two de novo heterozygous mutations were  found in two patients.Using this information, we carefully analyzed 23 CSS patients and found that at least 20 of them are genetically explained.

ICH is a self limiting disease which usually resolves sponta neously by 2 years of age.A single mutation in the COL1A1 gene has been reported to date in ICH pati   ents of different ethnic origins, namely the missense mutation p.Arg836Cys. The mutation was shown to lead to abnormal disulfide bonds and abnormal structures of the alpha 1 chain dimers.(1)COL1A1 gene mutations, detected throughout the gene, are responsible for further connective tissue disorders such as: osteogenesis imperfecta and Ehlers Danlos syndrome type III. Typical for these disorders is fragility of the bones and laxity of the skin/connective tissue, respectively.We report here on the molecular findings obtained for a young girl with ty   pical clinical manifestation of ICH. After having excluded the presence of the COL1A1 mutation p.Arg836Cys we sequenced all coding exons of the gene.The sequencing analysis revealed a heterozygous mutation, p.Arg918Cys, in the patient and her father, who also had typical features of the disorder.

Any phenotype  and family history compatible with autosomal recessive inheritance (and  unknown molecular defect) is candidate for participation in the study. Forty two families of different ethnic background have already been collected. From each family, blood DNA from the patient(s), all unaffected siblings, and the parents is extracted. Samples from one or more of the affected indivi duals per family are first analyzed by array CGH 400K for the detection of homozygous deletions. Then the samples of all family members are geno typed with a dense SNP array in order to identify Runs of Homozygosity (ROH), allowing the definition of chromosomal regions likely to contain the responsible genes. Finally exome sequencing is performed in one affected individual per family. Variants are called using publically available tools and filtered according to polymorphic SNVs deposited in public databases and predicted pathogenicity. We have so far analyzed twelve families using this approach. Causative variations of known disease genes have been identified in two families (VLDLR gene, causing disequilibrium syndrome and FKTN gene causing Fukuyama muscular dystrophy). In 5 additional families candi date genes have been identified.

After RNAi induced loss of PYCR1 in HeLa cells we reproduced the fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and a decreased membrane po tential.

Approximately 20 50% of dilated cardiomyopathy cases are familial with significant genetic and phenotypic heterogeneity. In a multigenerational Dutch family with autosomal domi   nant transmission, we employed whole exome sequencing in three affected family members. Using the GATK pipeline for whole exome data analysis, we identified between 1431 and1557 novel exonic/splice site variants per individual. Subsequent filtering steps, included filtering for dominant in heritance (heterozygous variants) and for coding regions, revealed a novel shared nonsense variant in the Titin gene (TTN) in all three affected pa tients. The respective substitution c.59845C>T predicts a premature stop codon (p.Arg19949X) at the protein level, leading to a truncated titin pro tein. The mutation was confirmed by Sanger sequencing and was shown to co segregate with disease in all DCM patients in this family. Our results show that mutations in the gene encoding giant muscle filament titin (TTN) can cause DCM and may account for a significant portion of the genetic etiology in familial DCM in the Dutch population.",2012

In Brazil, there are no official data regarding the prevalence and etiology of hearing impairment, but it is known that environmental factors are among the major causes. Although a simultaneous testing approach, including clini cal exams, audiological, laboratorial, imaging and genetic expands the etio logical diagnostic, overloads the healthcare system due to high costs. Thus, the goal of the present study is to evaluate the effectiveness of imaging and genetics tests and their impact on public health, aiming to increase effici   ency and reduce costs of the etiological diagnostic of hearing loss. It was conducted an analysis of 100 patients with sensorineural hearing loss. A de   tailed investigation was performed in patients, including imaging and gene tics analysis. The number of individuals with unknown cause was reduced from 72 to 42 (42% of reduction). Radiologic abnormalities were identified in 29 of the patients, while molecular alterations were found in 31 indivi duals. The etiology remained unknown in 42% of the patients, was due to environmental factors in 25%, genetics in 19% and inner ear malformations or other defects in 14% of the cases. It was concluded that both imaging and genetic analysis were important to identify the etiology of hearing loss, however, molecular tests contributed mainly for diagnosis of patients with congenital deafness, while radiologic exams had greater contribution for diagnosis of cases with progressive or abrupt hearing loss. The sequential protocol enables an optimization of the etiological diagnosis and cost re duction.",2012

Conne   xins (Cxs) are membrane spanning proteins that co assemble into intercel lular gap junction channels. Gap junction channels mediate electrical and biochemical communication between adjacent cells and play vital roles as  mediators of intercellular molecular signaling. Cx linked deafness highlights  the key role of gap junctions in the physiological processes of hearing. Co localization of Cxs with the gap junction system in the inner ear suggests a role in cochlear electrolyte homeostasis. During auditory transduction,  they are proposed to maintain membrane potentials by regulating the flow  of potassium ions between the sensory epithelia of the inner ear. Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding connexin 26 (Cx26), are a major cause of non  syndromic recessive hearing impairment in many countries and are largely  dependent on ethnic groups.

In this study, we hypothesized that PHO can also be caused by mutations in other components of prosta glandin signalling. Extracellular prostaglandins are taken up by a carrier mediated process across the plasma membrane. For many prostanoids (e. g. PGE 2) this transport is mediated by SLCO2A1, a type IV transmembrane pro  tein that belongs to the solute carrier organic anion transporter family. We performed sequencing of SLCO2A1  in seven PHO patients previously found  to be negative for mutations in HPGD and identified pathogenic mutations  in all but one individual. All patients were of normal intelligence and height and did not suffer from pulmonary disease or any other interfering disease. All of our mutations in SLCO2A1  represent truncating alleles or affect resi   dues that are indispensable for prostaglandin transporter activity. To corro borate our data, we constructed molecular models and Ramachandran plots of wild type and mutated SLCO2A1 proteins to visualize changes of protein folding and structure. We show that SLCO2A1 is a frequent cause for auto  somal recessive PHO confirming the data recently published by Zhang et al. (2012).

However, the prognostic value of these mutations and a possible correlation with the different clinical subtypes remain unclear. Therefore, the aim of this study was to search for mutations in SCN1A in patients with  Dravet and Doose syndromes, thus establishing genotype phenotype cor   relations using predictive algorithms to determine potentially deleterious  mutations. We performed SCN1A  mutation screening in 15 patients with Dravet syn  drome and 13 with Doose syndrome. Eight algorithms were used to analyze  the possible impact of the mutations in protein function. In addition, MLPA  was used to detect copy number variations within SCN1A . Twelve mutations were identified in patients with Dravet syndrome. All   missense mutations were predicted to be deleterious and are mostly loca ted in the pore region or the C terminal of the protein. Patients with Doose syndrome showed no mutations. Moreover, no copy number variants were identified. The high frequency of SCN1A  mutations found in patients with Dravet syn  drome (80%) suggests that molecular testing is particularly useful for in  dividuals with this phenotype. In contrast, SCN1A  testing does not seem to  be clinically relevant in Doose syndrome. Our strategy for predicting dele terious effect of mutations using multiple prediction algorithms provided valuable information, helping clinicians with decision making.

 Mutations in PRRT2 cause familial and sporadic cases of Benign Infantile Epilepsy,P12.079,L. M. Dibbens,"University of South Australia, School of Pharmacy and Medical Sciences, Adelaide,  Australia","Objective: Benign familial infantile epilepsy (BFIE) is an autosomal do   minant seizure disorder that occurs in infancy. Seizures begin around 6 months of age and cease by 2 years. In some cases a movement disorder, paroxysmal kinesigenic choreoathetosis (PKC), follows in childhood or adolescence: this combined disorder is known as infantile convulsions and paroxysmal choreoathetosis (ICCA) syndrome. We have recently shown that the familial disorders BFIE, PKC and ICCA are allelic, caused by mutations in PRRT2. We sought to determine if de novo PRRT2 mutations cause sporadic  benign infantile epilepsy and whether the phenotypic spectrum of PRRT2  was broader than initially recognized.Methods: 44 probands with infantile onset seizures, infantile convulsions  with mild gastroenteritis and benign neonatal seizures underwent pheno  typing and PRRT2 sequencing. The segregation of mutations identified in  probands was studied.Results: The recurrent PRRT2 mutation c.649 650insC (p.R217fsX224) was  identified in 11 probands. Nine probands had a family history consistent with BFIE or ICCA. Two probands without a family history of seizures or PKC had de novo PRRT2 mutations. Febrile seizures with or without afebrile  seizures were observed in two families with PRRT2 mutations. Conclusions: Mutations in PRRT2 are an important cause of seizures seen  in infancy. Mutations can be either familial or de novo. PRRT2 mutations are  present in >80% of BFIE and >90% ICCA families, but are not a common cause of other forms of infantile epilepsy. Seizures with fever may occur in BFIE such that it may be difficult to distinguish BFIE from febrile seizures in small families.",2012

Genomic DNA from the patients was analysed by direct sequencing of the PCDH19 gene on an ABI 3130XL Avant automated sequencer.In this study, we identified three different heterozygous novel mutations of PCDH19 gene in 26 patients with SMEI (11,5%). The c.1522_1528del/p.Ile508ProfsX59 novel mutation was identified in an isolated female patient. The second novel mutation identified is c.1649G>C/ p.Arg550Pro; the third novel mutation identified is c. 2568C>T/p.Ser856Cys.The results of this study indicate that PCDH19 mutatinon is a relatively fre quent cause of epilepsy in Southern Italy. This frequency (11,5%) is compa rable to that reported in previous studies.In conclusion molecular testing of PCDH19 should be considered in females with early onset FS and/or epilepsy with or without cognitive impairment and family history.",2012

We were able to uncover the ge netic basis of many so far unresolved cases with epilepsy. We detected mu tations in patients with both clear and unspecific epilepsy phenotypes. We revealed false negatives in conventional genetic testing methods. Many mu tations were detected in genes that only in very rare instances have been as sociated with epileptic disorders. Thus, many rare epilepsy disorders might perhaps be more common but simply underdiagnosed due to unspecific and diffuse phenotypes. Therefore, our approach may contribute in collecting information on both well known and unacquainted epilepsy disorders and in revealing their true phenotypic spectrum.",2012

The  vast majority of them are loss of function missense or nonsense mutations leading to decreased channel currents. Recently, CACNA1A exonic deletions were reported in EA2 using quantitative approaches, such as multiplex liga  tion dependent probe amplification (MLPA) and quantitative multiplex PCR  of short fluorescent fragments (QMPSF).We performed a mutational screening of the CACNA1A gene, including the  promoter and 3â UTR regions, in 49 unrelated patients diagnosed with EA2.  When point or small indel mutations were not found, we performed MLPA and QMPSF assays to screen for large duplications or deletions. Overall, a mutational screening by PCR amplification and sequencing allowed iden   tification of 9 point mutations (4 nonsense and 5 missense changes) and a 2 bp deletion (predicting a truncated protein), covering 20% of the patients.

Exome sequencing is a combination of next generation sequencing (NGS) and the enrichment of all known human protein coding exons and flanking spli ce sites. In addition to qualitative analyses, which can detect point mutations and small insertions/deletions, exome sequencing data can also be used for quantitative sequence analysis in order to detect large insertions/deletions. In this study, we have evaluated the qualitative and quantitative properties (i.e. mutation detection rate) of exome sequencing for different mutation types and genes. These genes are associated with syndromic forms of rare aortic diseases, such as Marfan syndrome (FBN1) , Loeys Dietz syndrome  (TGFBR1,  TGFBR2), and Ehlers Danlos syndrome vascular type (COL3A1),  or with non syndromic forms such as familial thoracic aortic aneurysms (ACTA2, MYH11, MYLK). For this evaluation, DNA samples with known point  mutations and small deletions/duplications detected by Sanger sequencing as well as large deletions/duplications detected by MLPA were used as tem plate in exome sequencing. In a first step, we applied Agilentâs in solution sequence capturing of all coding exons and flanking intronic sequences and performed NGS using a SOLiD4 platform.

HLH may rarely develop secondary to visceral leishmaniasis (VL). This first study demonstrates that HLH deve loped in VL may actually have genetic etiology. One year old only child of a consanguineous family had abdominal distention and high fever. Leishmania amastigots in BMA led to diagnosis of VL. Liposomal amphotericin B thera py resolved symptoms which reappeared subsequently. No amastigots but hemophagocytosis detected in second BMA. She received continuous HLH 2004 protocol therapy since remissions followed by HLH reactivations and/or five CNS relapses until she died at age four. HLA matched donor was una   vailable. Haplotype analysis of the family for Perforin, UNC13D, Syntaxin 11 and STXBP2 genes of FHL revealed homozygosity for UNC13D gene.

Parents were heterozygous for this pathologic mutation. In conclusion, HLH in this patient did not develop secondary to VL, but FHL, triggered by leishmania infection, most probably emerged at an earlier time. Clinicians must be aware that HLH developed in VL may have genetic etiolo gy and leismaniasis may mask the diagnosis of primary disease, which may eventually lead to loss of the patient due to tardiness in proper therapy and BMT .

DNA was isolated from lymphocytes. PCR and length analysis on an automa ted sequencer identified only a normal CGG repeat of 29 CGG units. Further Southern analysis revealed a mosaic pattern, that indicated presence of an FMR1 allele with a deletion next to a normal allele and alleles with a full mu tation. Sequence analysis indeed confirmed presence of a 2475 bp deletion that covered the whole CGG repeat and transcription initiation site until 45 bp proximal of the translation start codon.Similar deletions have been reported and these result in inactivation of the FMR1 gene and absence of the FMR1 protein.

Fraser syndrome is a rare disease, with autosomal recessive inheritance. It is a malformative syndrome, which most frequent signs are cryptophtalmos  and syndactyly. They are associated with other anomalies like craniofacial,  genital, urinary or lung malformations. The expression is variable. Clinical diagnosis criteria have been defined by Van Haelst in 2007. Currently, prena  tal diagnosis uses ultrasonography during the second quarter of pregnancy  and is difficult without family history orientation. Two genes, FRAS1 and FREM2, have been identified as responsible for Fraser syndrome. Only 2 dif   ferent mutations have been described in FREM2 and 23 in FRAS1. In this work, our initial goal was to identify, by PCR sequencing, causative  mutations of Fraser syndrome patients from eight families who were dia gnosed on clinical criteria. We analyzed FRAS1 in priority. We found in those patients 4 nonsense mutations, 2 intronic mutations af  fecting splicing, one 1 bp duplication and finally 4 new sequence variations (intronic and exonic) of unknown significance. We specified the value of  these 4 sequence variations using bioinformatic algorithms and functional  tests based on transfection of minigene constructs in HeLa cells. Using these tools, a missense mutation was shown to induce exon skipping.Analysis of FRAS1 gene provides the clinician a molecular confirmation of Fraser syndrome diagnosis in about 40% of cases. This further allows the possibility to offer the parents an early antenatal molecular diagnosis for a future pregnancy. We are now considering the development of the analysis of coding exons of FREM2 gene to increase the coverage rate.",2012

It is associated with a contraction of D4Z4 macro satellite repeats on chromosome 4q35. The copy number variation of the D4Z4 repeat varies between 11 100 copies in the normal population and  1 10 in FSHD patients. Chromosome 10q26 contains a highly homologous repeat array. On both chromosomes, the array can be embedded in two major haplotypes   A and  B, but only repeat contractions on the 4qA haplotype are associated with  the disease.The standard method for FSHD diagnostics is Southern blotting, but in about 20% of patients the FSHD genotype remains unclear. Therefore, GenomicVi  sion has designed a diagnostic test for FSHD based on Molecular Combing and fluorescence in situ  hybridisation. Molecular Combing is a single molecule analysis that enables direct vi  sualization of multiple whole genomes and the detection of large genome  rearrangements. Long DNA molecules are combed onto a solid surface in parallel alignment with uniform stretching allowing direct sizing of fluo  rescence signals. Probes have been developed to visualize the FSHD locus  as a three coloured bar code in order to differentiate the repeats and the four haplotypes.

Hearing impairment is the most common sensory disorder. About 1/1000 children is affected by pre lingual deafness. Several gene mutations have been associated with recessive hearing impairment. The GJB2 gene muta   tions are the most frequent cause of hereditary, prelingual, non syndromic hearing loss; they present an autosomal recessive inheritance. More than 90 GJB2 mutations affecting Cx26 expression have been reported and linked to hearing loss. Up to 85% of abnormal Cx26 expression may be attributed to the 35delG mutation. This type of mutation showed a high prevalence among Caucasian populations. Prevalence of GJB2 mutations in the Chinese population seems to be different, it appears that 35delC is the most frequent cause of recessive hearing impairment among this population; similarly, Japanese families with bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, also present the 235delC defect, which seems to be the most prevalent mutation affec ting Cx26 expression among this population. Previous investigations show ethnic association to other specific GJB2 mutations, per example R143W mutations among African populations or 167delT among Ashkenazi Jews.

In rats GPM6A has already been implicated in neurite outgrowth, neuronal differentiation and synapse for   mation. M6a has also been implicated in stress response in different animal models.We employed Drosophila melanogaster as a model organism to further elu   cidate its role in stress response, synapse formation and behavior. Using the UAS Gal4 system we analyzed the function of the Drosophila homologue m6 after tissue specific knockdown and overexpression with different m6 RNAi and m6 overexpressing lines. We found elevated expression levels of m6 in fly brains of L3 larvae and adult flies after heat shock stress treatment, which further increased with heat shock elongation. These findings indicate that m6 expression is also stress responsive in flies. Effects of different m6 levels on survival time upon starvation and oxidative stress are also being studied. Additionally we are currently investigating the role of m6 in synapse forma tion by dissecting L3 larvae to analyze various parameters of the synapses of neuromuscular junctions and a possible role in complex learning and me mory processes by performing the Courtship conditioning assay.",2012

We mapped the di  sease locus in the same chromosomal region in a large German pedigree  with X chromosomal nonsyndromic hearing impairment by using genome  wide linkage analysis. Males presented with postlingual hearing loss and onset at ages 3 7, whereas onset in female carriers was in the second to third decades.

SMPX encodes an 88 amino acid, cytoskeleton associated protein that is responsive to mechanical stress. The presence of Smpx in hair cells and  supporting cells of the murine cochlea indicates its role in the inner ear. The  nonsense mutations detected in the two families suggest a loss of function  mechanism underlying this form of hearing impairment. Results obtained after heterologous overexpression of SMPX proteins were compatible with this assumption. Because responsivity to physical force is a characteristic  feature of the protein, we propose that long term maintenance of mechani  cally stressed inner ear cells critically depends on SMPX function.",2012

Zaremba","Department of Genetics, Institute of Psychiatry and Neurology, Warsaw, Poland","BACKGROUND: Mutations in the SPAST gene are responsible for spastic  paraplegia type 4 (SPG4), the most common among heterogeneous group  termed hereditary spastic paraplegias (HSP). MATERIAL AND METHODS: A group of 160 patients clinically diagnosed as HSP (90 familial, 70 sporadic cases) were screened for mutations in the  SPAST gene. Molecular analysis was performed using multiplex ligation de  pendent probe amplification (MLPA) and direct sequencing analysis. RESULTS: Screening of 160 patients for mutations in the SPAST gene by MLPA enabled us identification of microrearrangements in 12 sub jects (7.5%). Among those 11 deletions (9 multiexonic and 2 single exon  deletion) and 1 duplication of two exons were found. Sequencing of the  SPAST gene, which contains 17 exons, performed so far for 13 exons in  104 patients, revealed 11 different mutations in 12 individuals. Frames hift mutations (c.1215_1219delTATAA, c.1246_1247insG, c.1317delT , c.1418_1431delAGTCTGCTGGAGAT , c.1435_1436delAG, c.1779_1780insA),  splice site change (c.1729 2A>G) and missense mutations (c.1079T>C,  c.1100T>C, c1378C>T , c.1849T>G) were identified. Out of 11 point mutati   ons 10 are localized in the AAA domain of spastin and one missense muta   tion in the last TAA STOP codon switched to coding for glutamic acid. Fur  thermore 5 intronic substitutions and 1 known synonymous variant in exon  6 were detected. CONCLUSIONS: So far molecular analysis in 160 patients revealed 24 cases  of SPG4 (15%). The study results confirm that the majority of point mutati   ons as well as microrearrangements in the SPAST gene are localized in the AAA domain of the spastin protein (19/24 cases).",2012

In about 35% of AD cases with pure form are detected mutations in SPG4 (spastin) gene, but can be found in sporadic cases as a result of de novo mutation.Materials and methods: We performed a genetic screening for SPG4 muta   tions by direct sequencing in a cohort of 50 AD and sporadic HSP cases from three different ethnic groups (Bulgarian, Gypsy/Roma and Turkish).Results and discussion:  In this study we identified 9 mutations in SPG4  gene, 4 novel (1 splice site mutation, 2 missence and 1 deletion) and 5 al   ready reported (3 missence, 1 nonsense and 1 deletion). In 6 cases the mu tations are found in patients with AD type of inheritance. A novel finding for Bulgarian population are mutations in four sporadic cases confirming the need for SPG4 screening of this HSP group. No mutations were found in Turkish patients.

Background: Energy metabolism has been a major focus of HD research for  many years due to several observations in both patients and models of the  disease. However, there are currently no in vivo biomarkers of brain energy metabolism in HD. Methods: We coupled noninvasive 31P NMR spectroscopy with activation of  the occipital cortex in order to measure the levels of ATP , phosphocreatine (PCr) and inorganic phosphate (Pi) before, during and after a visual stimu lus. We studied 15 HD patients at an early stage of the disease (mean motor  UHDRS, 18 Â±9) and 15 age  and sex matched controls. Results: In controls, we observed an 11% increase in Pi/PCr ratio (p,0.024) and a 13% increase in Pi/ATP ratio (p,0.016) during brain activation, re  flecting increased ATP synthesis and ADP levels. Subsequently, controls had  a return to baseline levels during recovery (p,0.012 et 0.022 respectively). In HD patients, both Pi/PCr and Pi/ATP ratios were unchanged during and  after visual stimulation, reflecting altered mitochondrial bioenergetics. In  addition, in HD patients the ratio of Pi/ATP correlated with the UHDRS score during the activation (p,0.014) and recovery periods (p,0.009), while Pi/PCr ratio correlated with the UHDRS score during recovery (p,0.016), re  flecting a correlation between brain energy metabolism and disease seve  rity in HD.Conclusions: 31Phosphorus nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy  could provide functional biomarkers of brain energy deficit to monitor the  rapeutic efficacy in Huntington disease.",2012

It is caused by mutations in the LEP gene encoding leptin and mutations in the congenital leptin receptor gene re spectively.Objective: We report 6 patients from 3 Egyptian families presenting with  severe hyperphagia and early onset obesity.Method: Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes of  all patients and their family members using a standard method. Direct se   quencing of the whole coding region of the leptin gene was carried out in the two families with undetectable serum leptin levels while sequence analysis of the LEPR gene was performed in the third family with high serum leptin levels.Results: We detect one novel missense mutation in the leptin LEP gene  (N103K) and another novel nonsense mutation in the leptin LEP gene (W121X) as well as a missense mutation in the Leptin receptor gene LEPR (P316T).Conclusion: Although genetic causes of obesity are rare autosomal recessi   ve disorders, high consanguinity rate in our society will lead to the discove ry of a high number of monogenic obesity.",2012
 Transcriptional dysregulation in Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome patients compared to age matched controls,P12.134,"R. Blatny1, Z. Zubacova1, I. Novakova2, L. Jarolimova2, V. Philimonenko2, Z.

Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare genetic condition with symptoms of premature aging manifested at a very early age. Patients born with progeria typically live to their mid teens or early twenties and the most frequent cause of death is myocardial infarction or stroke. HGPS is usually caused by dominant mutations in the lamin A (LMNA) gene. There are 22 known LMNA mutations associated with the development of HGPS that have been published in the literature to date. These mutations can be detected by the classical or next generation sequencing, high resolution melting analysis (HRMA) and denaturing high performance liquid chroma tography. At the subcellular microscopic level, the disease is manifested by morphological abnormalities in nuclear envelope structure. Within the fra mework of our ongoing effort to integrate technologies (and their results) used to gain the information about genomic mutations (classical or next gen  sequencing, scanning or unlabelled probe HRMA), gene expression (qPCR,  microarray analysis, next gen sequencing) and its regulation (ChIP chip, ChIP qPCR, ChIP seq) in HGPS patients which could be further used to im  prove diagnosis, prognosis, treatment and the overall quality of life of the  HGPS patients we conducted a pilot experiment on gene expression in fibro blast cell lines from four HGPS patients and four age matched controls. Our reliminary data on this small group of target and control samples showed  that the most affected biological processes are transcription, signal trans  duction, development and signal transduction.

Common variants in KCNQ1 , KCNE1, and NOSA1P   genes have been recently implicated in modifying the risk of life threatening  arrhythmias in LQTS. In our highly consanguineous population, we conduc  ted genome wide SNP analysis in 15 families with LQTS to identify regions  of homozygosity (ROH) that harbor loci known to be associated with either  LQTS or risk of sudden cardiac death. In two families with previously known homozygous KCNQ1 (LQT1) mutations, ROH encompassing AKAP9  (LQT11)  and SNTA1 (LQT12) that were detected. In a third family, a ROH that harbors  ADRB2 gene, known to be associated with SCD without LQTS, was identified.

Mutations in the gene NFIX were recently discovered as the cause of MSS (Malan et al. AJHG 2010). In six patients exhibiting the typical phenotype, we identified four novel NFIX frameshift and splice site mutations by direct sequencing, while two indivi duals turned out normal. For further evaluation, we set up an MLPA based screening for exon deletions or duplications. Both patients were found to carry a heterozygous deletion of exons 6 and 7 of the NFIX gene. The same deletion was found in three additional cases of a cohort of 15 MSS patients, of which 9 were previously found to have NFIX point mutations. Breakpoint sequencing revealed the deletion to be mediated by a recombination event between ALU Y repeats located in introns 5 and 7. Further studies on the mRNA level indicated that the transcript lacking exons 6 and 7 escapes nonsense mediated mRNA decay, thus suggesting that the deletion leads to the expression of a mutant protein rather than haploinsufficiency of NFIX. We conclude that the recurrent NFIX deletion is specific for MSS, because it mimics the effects of other MSS associated mutations that are thought to generate mutant proteins able to exert a dominant negative effect over the wild type allele. Intronic ALU repeats create predetermined breaking points facilitating de novo occurrence of this deletion, a mechanism that accounts  for about one quarter of MSS cases in our joint cohort.",2012

The wide group of nonsyndromic hearing loss disorders (NSHL) is one of the most common sensory impairment in humans. Approximately 50% of all cases are caused by genetic factors. Among all types of monogenic, Men delian traits, autosomal recessive form stands for nearly 80% of all NSHL  cases. The group of hearing disorders is characterized by tremendously high  locus and allele heterogeneity with over hundred genes associated to the se disorders. Most frequently analyzed genes in NSHL patients worldwide are GJB2, GJB6, MYO7A, MYO15A, SLC26A4, and TMPRSS3 . In respect to the  patientâs population origin, mutations in otherwise scarce genes may occur in higher frequencies in some specific populations. Demographic history and population structure of Roma in Europe resulted in occurrence of such  population specific mutations which are otherwise very rare or unseen in  autochthonous populations in Europe. Studying a large Hungarian family of Roma origin with multiple NSHL patients we identified a founder mutation,  IVS4+2T>C of the MARVELD2  gene, previously identified in Pakistani pati   ents.

Mutations often affect a cysteine residue and result in endoplasmatic reticulum retention and subsequent reduced urinary excretion. However the precise pathopyhsiology of tubulointerstitial damage is ill understood.Next to UMOD, mutations in HNF1beta can result in a similar clinical pre sentation.Recently, dominant Renin mutations were shown to result in a UAKD pheno type. Initially recessive mutations in Renin were identified as one cause of renal tubular dysgenesis.Here we report the results of a stepwise mutational analysis in 71 families compatible with a diagnosis of UAKD.UMOD mutations were identified in 25, while HNF1beta mutations could be identified in 7 families.

MCPH1 encodes a multifunctional protein that was reported to be involved in brain development, DNA damage response and regulation of chromosome condensation.In previous work of our group, Gavvovidis et al. found that MCPH1 encodes two major transcripts, full length MCPH1 (MCPH1 FL) and another tran script lacking the six 3â exons (MCPH1Î9 14). In addition, a splice variant lacking exon 8 (MCPH1Î8) was detected.

Furthermore, experiments using knockdown of MCPH1 by RNAi or MCPH1 deficient MEFs had previously shown severe effects on the cellular response  to DNA damage after irradiation. Here we compared the effect of patient  derived MCPH1 mutations on G2/M checkpoint control. We determined the mitotic index by phospho histone H3 flow cytometry after irradiation of cells with 1 Gy. There was no difference in terms of G2/M checkpoint control  compared to normal control cells. However, delayed checkpoint release was  observed in all of the analyzed MCPH1 deficient cell lines, featuring the way in which DNA damage response to IR is defective.",2012

Thus, any future therapies  directed at increasing the levels of MeCP2 in the patient must be considered  carefully to avoid further neurological impairments. To estimate gene dose effects and predict the level at which potential non tolerable side effects  might occur, mouse models with mild overexpression are instrumental. We  generated Mecp2_WT_EGFP transgenic mouse, in which the total amount  of MeCP2 (endogenous plus transgenic) is mildly overexpressed (~1.5X). When Mecp2_WT_EGFP mice were crossed with Mecp2 knockout (KO) mice, our preliminary analysis suggest that major phenotypes of the KO mice were  rescued, however further investigation will be necessary to exclude any late  stage symptoms. To characterize Mecp2_WT_EGFP mouse model, we perfor   med an extensive test battery which, apart from increased aggressiveness  and seizure propensity, revealed essentially unaltered behavior. Evaluation of neuronal parameters both ex vivo and in vivo revealed no major abnor  malities. Also, expression analysis of differentially regulated Mecp2 target  genes, such as Bdnf, Ddc, Gdf11, Gpr26, Lrp1b, Pygm and Robo1 by quanti   tative RT PCR analysis in Mecp2_WT_EGFP mice revealed only minor altera  tion in the expression of Mecp2 target genes.

Mutations in two genes, MLC1(22q13.33; 75% of patients) or HEPACAM (11q24; 5 10%  of patients) are associated with the disease.We describe an adult MLC patient with moderate clinical symptoms.

The role of this mutation on splicing was confirmed using a mini gene assay, and an antisense morpholinated oligonucleotide (AMO) targeted to the aberrant splice site partially abrogated the mutation in vitro. The mutation c.895 226T>G has a leaky effect on splicing leaving part of the full length transcript and may explain the milder phenotype in our patient.

All these factors contributed to significantly prolonged testing time per pa  tient. In many cases, the testing was stopped prematurely due to high cost/long duration.Therefore, we have implemented a high throughput sequencing platform (GS Junior, Roche), which has enabled us to switch from consecutive to par allel testing strategy. Our muscular dystrophy panel currently contains 14 genes (DMD, MYOT , LMNA, CAV3, CAPN3, DYSF, SGCG, SGCA, SGCB, SGCD, FKRP , POMT1, ANO5, POMT2) and further genes will be added as necessary. We aim to decrease the testing time and cost, increase the mutation detec tion rate and avoid muscle biopsy where possible.",2012
 Molecular genetic diagnostics of myotonia congenita and structural analysis of mutations in the CLCN1 gene,P12.152,"L. FajkusovÃ¡1, D. PÃ¡clovÃ¡2, J. SedlÃ¡ÄkovÃ¡2, J. Marek1","1Central European Institute of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic, 2Centre of Molecular  Biology and Gene Therapy, University Hospital Brno, Brno, Czech Republic","Non dystrophic myotonias are skeletal muscle disorders associated with mutations in the CLCN1 and SCN4A  genes. Mutations of CLCN1 result in auto  somal dominant (Thomsen) and/or autosomal recessive (Becker) myotonia congenita (MC). Mutations in SCN4A  are typically inherited as an autosomal  dominant trait. The ClC1 protein is a homodimer with a separate ion pore within each subunit. The varied inheritance pattern of myotonias appears to result from differential effects of a mutation on the channel dimer. Mu   tations causing recessive myotonia most likely affect properties of mutant monomer leaving the wild type monomer unaffected in the heterodimer. On the other hand, mutations causing dominant myotonia affect properties of both subunits in the wild type/mutant heterodimer. Our study addresses two points: 1) molecular genetic diagnostics of MC by tandem analysis of the CLCN 1 and SCN4A  genes, and 2) homology modelling of the dimeric ClC1  channel. In the first part, mutations associated with the disease were identi fied in 57 probands   39 carried mutations in CLCN1 and 18 in SCN4A . In the  second part, we performed homology modelling of the dimeric ClC1 channel on the basis of known crystallographic structures. From this model, we pre dicted aminoacids (AA) forming the dimer interface and AA forming the Cl    ion pathway. Further, we performed search for mutations of AA forming the dimer interface or/and the Cl   ion pathway in our model which have been  found in patients with MC to assess the correlation between the localisation of a mutation and the type of MC.",2012

In this report, we describe two Pakistani families with an autoso   mal recessive inherited nail dysplasia. Thickening and hyperpigmentation  of all finger and toe nails were present at birth, and the nails subsequent  ly became claw like around puberty. By genomewide linkage analysis, we mapped this genodermatosis to chromosome 8q22.3, and identified a ho  mozygous nonsense mutation c.1750G>T (p.E584X) in the frizzled 6 (FZD6)  gene in all affecteds. Expression analyses in nail sections from healthy indi   viduals revealed strong expression of FZD6 in the ventral nail matrix and a less pronounced expression of FZD6 in the nail bed. FZD6 belongs to a  family of proteins that serve as receptors in Wnt signaling pathways, and has  been shown to act as a negative regulator of the canonical Wnt/Î² catenin si gnaling cascade and a positive regulator of the non canonical Wnt or planar  cell polarity (PCP) pathway. The present results therefore suggest that FZD6  plays a pivotal role in the growth and guidance of the nail plate in humans by acting as a molecular switch between different Wnt pathways. Previous  studies have identified mutations in the RSPO4 and LMX1B components of  the Wnt pathway in patients with the hypoplastic nail disorders anonychia and nail patella syndrome, respectively. Only recently, FZD6 mutations were identified in isolated nail dysplasia. The present results emphasize the im  portant role of the Wnt pathways in nail development and increase under   standing of Wnt mediated developmental events in general.",2012

The purpose of this study was to describe the clinicopathologic findings and unravel the underlying genetic cause. Known nephrotic syndrome genes were screened and 250K SNP array analysis was performed. No novel vari ants were identified in the known nephrotic syndrome genes. A homozygous region of 20 Mb was identified in the patientâs DNA. Sequencing of the stron gest candidate gene revealed a novel homozygous missense variant that was inherited from the heterozygous unaffected parents and not found in 384 control chromosomes. Striking similarities were seen between the gene knockout mouse and the patientâs phenotype. Further in vitro characteriza   tion studies demonstrated the effect of the variant on the protein function. Here, we report a novel human gene variant, causing congenital interstitial lung fibrosis and nephrotic syndrome for the first time. The variant leads to an amino acid substitution in a gene essential for basement membrane de   velopment, in a domain interacting with extracellular matrix components. This is the first clinical phenotype associated with a mutation in this gene in humans.

About 10% of children with idiopathic Nephrotic syndrome (NS) are stero id resistant (SRNS), and develop end stage renal disease. In the last couple of years, mutations in a number of genes highly expressed in podocytes have been identified causing SRNS.The focus of this study was to establish a NGS approach for developing a fast and extensive method leading to increased genetic diagnostics of SRNS patients. As positive control 31 patients were analyzed, who had already been sequenced using the Sanger sequencing method following the muta   tional algorithm. These patients were examined in all thitherto known SRNS relevant genes (ACTN4, CD2AP , COQ6 , INF2, LAMB2 , NPHS1 , NPHS2 , PLCE1, TRPC6, WT1) using the Roche 454 technology. In 18/31 patients mutations  were known, 13 patients did not show mutations in the already examined genes (Sanger detection rate 58%).In 16/18 genetically diagnosed patients mutations were confirmed using NGS. Two mutations localized within homopolymer regions had not been  identified. In 4/13 (31%) without mutations so far, mutations in one of the  following genes have been identified: CD2AP (1 patient), INF2 (1 patient),  and NPHS1 (2 patients). These genes were not sequenced using Sanger  sequencing because they were excluded by the mutation algorithm. Alto gether, in 20/31 patients causative mutations have been identified (NGS detection rate 65%). NGS in the diagnostics of NS seems to be a good option for a rapid and reliab   le genetic analysis. However, mutations within homopolymer regions can be  missed by the Roche 454 technology. These regions should still be analyzed by Sanger sequencing.",2012

In 40 NS patients (35 sporadic, 5 familial) with histological findings of DMS or FSGS, 27/31 exons of PLCE1 were analysed by direct sequencing.  Pathological mutations in the NPHS1, NPHS2  and WT1 genes had been pre  viously excluded in all patients. Sequencing analysis revealed PLCE1 mu  tations in 4/35 patients.

Additionally, 1 case was found homozygous for a novel mutation, p.A945P . The patient (male) presented at 3months with DMD, initiating dialysis at 9months. In silico analysis (SIFT , Polyphen, Pmut and MutationTaster) were  applied to evaluate causality of the p.A945P mutation. Pmut and SIFT found the nucleotide change âpossibly damagingâ, while Polyphen and MutationTa ster indicated p.A945P to be benign. Resequencing analysis in members of the patientsâ family (over 3 generations, all unaffected with NS) found only heterozygotes for p.A945P (according to expected phase).

Mutations in the VANGL1 gene, which is homologous to VANGL2, were described to be associated with NTDs in 1 2% of cases. To examine the contribution of VANGL2 sequence variants to human NTDs, we studied lymphocyte DNA from peripheral blood of 164 patients with clinically relevant NTDs for VANGL2 gene mutations using PCR sequencing.We identified no mutations, but 14 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the VANGL2 gene. Of these, seven were silent SNPs within the coding DNA (exons 3, 4, 6 and 7) and seven were intronic SNPs. Nine SNPs were already reported by the 1000 Genomes Project with similar frequencies, and five SNPs were novel and appeared with low frequencies. In silico testing of the five novels SNPs predicted no deleterious effects (no alteration of splice sites), but further studies remain to be done before final conclusions can be drawn.

The overall morphology of the humerus from Nf1Prx1 mice appeared severely disordered. Especially at the muscle to bone inserti   on sites we observed large amounts of fibrocartilaginous tissue. Within the diaphysis we detected large non mineralized regions of bone tissue that are www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012321 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters associated with blood vessels. Thus, the macroporosity was 5 fold increased  in Nf1Prx1 mice as compared to controls. Microporosity, which is mainly  determined by the size of osteocyte lacunae, was increased. While Nf1Prx1  cortical bone contained a normal number of osteocyte lacunae, the average lacuna volume was increased, yielding higher relative osteocyte volume per  bone volume (3.4 % in the mutants vs. 2.0 % in controls). The osteocyte phe  notype is likely cell autonomous as increased osteocyte lacuna volume was also detected in the Nf1Col1 mice. Similarly, a quantitative volumetric ana   lysis of cortical bone samples from NF1 patients demonstrated increased  osteocyte lacuna size. These findings suggest that neurofibromin is required  for normal osteocyte function, and facilitates bone homeostasis.

As a  consequence, the identification of the genes responsible for these pheno  types remained limited. Using high resolution microarrays, we identified intragenic copy number variations in the CG 1 domain of the Calmodulin  binding Transcription Activator 1 (CAMTA1) gene, segregating with au   tosomal dominant ID with NPCA in two unrelated families, and a de novo  deletion located in the same domain in a child presenting with NPCA. In the ID patients, the deletion led to a frameshift, producing a truncated protein,  while this was not the case for the patient with isolated childhood ataxia.  Brain MRI of the patients revealed a pattern of progressive atrophy of cere bellum medium lobes and superior vermis, parietal lobes and hippocampi.  Although DNA sequencing of the CG 1 domain in 197 patients with sporadic  or familial non syndromic intellectual deficiency, extended to full DNA se   quencing in 50 patients with ID and 47 additional patients with childhood  ataxia, identified no pathogenic mutation, there is considerable evidence  that CAMTA1 rearrangements are being disease causing. Indeed, CAMTA1 is a brain specific calcium responsive transcription factor expressed in the brain and cerebellum during development and later implicated in memory processes; intragenic rearrangements are concentrated in a highly conser   ved functional domain with transcription regulation ability and nuclear traf ficking functions; CAMTA1 transcriptional studies have shown upregulation of genes already implicated in intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorder. Altogether, we show that CAMTA1 loss of function is responsible for NPCA with or without ID.",2012

One in every 1,000 neonates is born with profound congenital deafness. About 70% of hereditary sensoryneural hearing loss (SNHL) is non syndromic (DFN) and at least 80% of these cases have autosomal reces   sive (DFNB) inheritance. To date, genetic studies have shown that mutations in more than 90 loci and 40 genes are associated with DFNB. Mutations in OTOF  gene are cause of neurosensory non syndromic recessive deafness,  DFNB9. OTOF  gene contains 48 exons which encode a transmembrane pro  tein, otoferlin. Several mutations in this gene have been found in Lebanese, Pakistani, Turkish, Colombian and Spanish families.Recently, we observed an Iranian family with autosomal recessive non syn dromic hearing loss(ARNSHL),which showed linkage to OTOF  gene. Muta   tion detection of this gene revealed a missense mutation. So we decided to screen our population for this gene.One hundred and forty four ARNSHL families with two or more affected in dividuals originated from different ethnic groups of Iran were selected for this study. All the families were subjected to homozygosity mapping using flanking STR markers of OTOF  gene. After screening all the families, one fa  mily showed linkageto this gene. Further analysis using direct sequencing of this gene revealed a splice site mutation (IVS28+2 T>C). So, in comparison with other countries such as our neighboring country, Pakistan, OTOF  muta   tions are very rare in Iran.",2012

Genomic cap  ture and NGS on a HiSeq 2000 sequencer (Illumina) of the proband lead to the identification of a novel missense mutation within PRPS1 . Mutations in  this gene, which codes for the phosphoribosylpyrophosphate synthetase 1 (PRS I) enzyme, were previously demonstrated to cause X linked syndro mic conditions associated with hearing impairment (e.g. Arts syndrome and Charcot Marie Tooth disease 5), and, most recently, NSHL in 4 families  (DFNX1 locus). The identified mutation segregates with prelingual, bilateral,  profound NSHL in the probandâs family. A subsequent screening of the entire  PRPS1 gene by Sanger sequencing in 13 additional unrelated probands from  NSHL families showing a likely X linked inheritance pattern led to the dis   covery of a second missense mutation segregating with pre lingual hearing impairment. The two novel variants were absent in a cohort of 126 Italian  audiologically tested, normal hearing controls. Both amino acid substituti   ons are predicted to cause a destabilization of the enzyme structure. The  impact of both PRPS1  mutations on the function of PRS I is currently under  analysis by measuring the enzyme activity in the patientsâ emolysates com  pared to controls. In conclusion, we provide evidence of the usefulness of  whole exome NGS for the genetic diagnosis of NSHL and we highlight the recurrence of PRPS1  mutations, suggesting that it may represent a major  locus  for X linked NSHL to be prioritised in genetic screenings.",2012

NS is known to be a disorder with variable phenotypic expressi   on including symptoms like short stature, dysmorphic features, congenital  heart defects and many other. Noonan syndrome is caused by a germline mutation in one of the genes that encode proteins involved in RAS/MAPK signaling pathway. In NS patients, heterozygous mutations have been identified in PTPN11, SOS1, RAF1, BRAF,  KRAS, NRAS, SHOC2, MEK1 and CBL genes . Three hundred eleven individuals (237 patients with clinical suspicion of NS and 74 relatives) were referred to our laboratory for molecular exami  nation. The PTPN11, SOS1  and RAF1 genes were examined in 237, 70 and 28  patients, respectively. The analysis of coding sequence was performed using  direct sequencing method. The known NS causing missense mutations were found in 89 (37.5%) cases:  67 had mutation in PTPN11 , 10 in SOS1  and 12 in RAF1 . All the identified  mutations, according to the literature, were gain of function type. Although most of the probands with NS have a de novo mutation, we have identified  17 (50%) familial cases (14   PTPN11 , 2   SOS1 , 1 RAF1 ). The low frequency  of identified mutations among patients included in the study might suggest that more stringent criteria should be used for patientsâ qualification for molecular testing.Supported from NCN research project no.

Cerebral autosomal dominant arteriopathy with subcortical infarcts and leukoencephalopathy (CADASIL) is characterized by early onset stroke and vascular dementia. It is caused by stereotyped missense mutations in NOTCH3, which invariably lead to an uneven number of cysteines in one of the 34 EGFL domains that constitute the NOTCH3 ectodomain. In addition to missense mutations, a few small pathogenic NOTCH3 deletions and in  sertions have been described. All changed the number, or the spacing, of cysteine residues. A frame shift mutation leading to a stop was reported as pathogenic, but molecular and clinical testing was incomplete.We describe three patients with large NOTCH3 alterations, of which the pa  thogenicity was initially unclear. We combined extensive laboratory analysis (MLPA, DNA and RNA analysis, Western Blotting) with thorough clinical eva luation. The first patient has a deletion of exon 3 16, leading to a premature stop, the second patient has an exon 3 stop mutation. Clinically, they did not have a CADASIL phenotype. Molecularly, the mutations are predicted to result in small NOTCH3 fragments that lack transmembrane and intracel lular domains and are highly unlikely to be expressed at the cell surface. The pathogenicity of the mutation in the third patient, a splice site mutation causing exon 7 skipping, remains uncertain but does not give classical CA   DASILWe conclude that i) clinical and molecular investigation by an experienced  team is indispensable for the correct interpretation of atypical NOTCH3 mu  tations ii) NOTCH3 stop mutations do not cause CADASIL, arguing against  the theory that hypomorphic NOTCH3 alleles also cause CADASIL.",2012

" Cornelia de Lange Syndrome diagnostics in times of NGS P . StÃ¶be, T . Schopen, H. Gabriel, M. Gencik, A. Gencik; diagenos, OsnabrÃ¼ck, Germany. Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CDLS) is a rare autosomal dominant disease with an incidence of 1 in 10.000 to 60.000 newborns. It leads to severe de velopmental anomalies. This disorder is characterized by skeletal, craniofa cial deformities, gastrointestinal and cardiac malformations. The physical as well as intellectual development of a child is affected. Clinical diagnosis is based on the phenotype.This disorder is mainly caused by mutations in the Cohesin complex genes NIPBL, SMC1A, and SMC3. Mutations in the NIBL gene are responsible for about 50% of the cases. The two latter genes cause a slightly milder form of CDLS. In addition, patients with mutations in the UBE2A gene show a CDLS like phenotype. So far, molecular validation of CDLS has been done by San ger sequencing or MLPA with focus on NIPBL gene analysis. All coding exons and their corresponding splice sites were analyzed.Recently, the high throughput pyrosequencing technique using the Roche 454J platform was implemented in our laboratory and an open and flexibly upgradeable diagnostic panel for CDLS including the genes NIPBL, SMC1A, SMC3 and UBE2A was established.Here, we report on our analyses of CDLS patients applying NGS technology into routine diagnostics and compare its performance with standard mu tation detection. The preliminary data show that our diagnostic panel is a real alternative to classical sequencing in respect to sensitivity, TAT and cost. In addition, our approach is optimal for molecular analysis of genetically heterogeneous diseases with distinct clinical manifestation and caused by mutations in a limited number of genes.

Oculocutaneous albinism (OCA) is classified into several types based on  clinical and molecular categories. The prevalence of all forms of albinism  varies considerably worldwide and has been estimated at approximately  1/17,000.Patients and Methods: After informed consent was obtained, blood samp les were collected from patients with clinical signs of OCA. We screened 13  families (7/13 Spanish, 1/13 Rusian and the 2/13 Africans) for sequence va  riations in the coding region of the TYR gene avoiding the TYRL pseudogene  and the 6, 7 and 13 exons of the OCA2 gene. Also MLPAp325 was performed  in order to detect deletions or duplicacions in the TYR and OCA2 genes. Results: At least one single mutation in either or both TYR and OCA2 genes  has been identified in 12 out of 13 families. Most of the identified mutations  were detected in a heterozygous pattern, but with the exception of the mu  tation p.Pro81Leu and the 2,7kb including exon 7.Discussion: The entire coding regions of 4 genes associated with non syn dromic OCA have been analysed in many cases, however one single mutation have been identified in many of the cases analysed what suggests that other genes yet unidentified probably exist. Epistasic phenomenon also has been described in mice assays. The new technologies such as Next Generation Se quencing would provide us new insights in this disease.",2012

Despite the previous studies indicating the vast majority (70%) of COL1A1/CO L1A2 mutations causing OI being glycine substitutions to amino acid with a bulky side chain, we detected no missense ones. Interestingly, all detected mutations were unique for each family except for the frameshift mutation c.579delT (p.Gly194ValfsX71) observed in two unrelated families.

OTOF  gene mutations were identified causative for an isolated autosomal  recessive form of congenital auditory neuropathy, DFNB9. Since 1998, mole cular investigation identified absence of hotspot mutations, numerous poly   morphisms and variants of unknown significance. The first 10 local patients were reported at ESHG 2011 meeting. Additional patients were studied.Material and methods: Patients were enrolled if they fulfill criteria for AN.  Molecular investigation relied on complete ORF sequencing (NM_194248.2, long isoform, 1997aa). Our molecular lab is the only one in Belgium to se   quence complete ORF of OTOF  gene. Substitutions were noted as âunclas  sified variantsâ when absent from Ensembl and Uniprot databases or from available publications. Family members were investigated when available.Results: Among 32 patients referred for AN, 24 had isolated NA among  whom 15 were congenital (prelingual).1/15 was identified with 1 homo  zygous mutation (c.3269C>A); 2/15 carried one mutation and a variant,  probably pathogenic 1 (c.[2401G>T;2402A>T];[2464C>T] and c.[2401G>T ;2402A>T;c.4936C>T];[3608A>G]). These last two propositus originated from unrelated pedigrees from Congo and Burundi. 1 patient was carrier of  2 undetermined variants (c.[2123G>A];[206+9G>A]); 1 patient of 2 variants (c.[3751T>C(;)5063C>T]) and 6 patients had one variant only. Conclusion: The present screening confirms substitutions considered as pa  thogenic reported once 1 and present in different genetic background popu  lation. Identified compound heterozygous (one mutation and one variant,  this last reported so far as âprobably pathogenicâ) may account for a less  severe phenotype.

Mutation of the lysosomal protease Cathepsin C (CTSC) gene is the genetic cause of PLS. The CTSC Gene was analyzed in three Iranian families with affected PLS showing premature tooth loss and palm plantar hyperkeratosis. Direct automated se   quencing of genomic DNA was performed following amplification of exonic regions and associated splice intron site junctions of the CTSC gene. Mu   tation screening and sequence analysis of the CTSC gene revealed a novel mutation (P . 35delL) in exon 1 of one patient, and two previously reported mutations in other probands. The known mutations were a missense muta   tion in exon 4 which converts Arginine to Proline (CGTâ CCT , CM993131, codon 210) and a nonsense mutation in exon 6 that causes a stop codon (CGAâTGA, CM993134, codon 272) in the other two patients. RFLP for 100 normal alleles confirmed the new mutation. Protein modeling of the dedu   ced novel mutation was performed by online server Swiss Prot automated modeling and analyzed by special bioinformatic softwares including ZMM, ICM browser and SPDB viewer to better understand the structural defects. The structural defect caused by the mutation P . 35delL admits the polarity nature of the molecule. As this mutation occurred in the conserved domain of the CTSC, the structural analysis might reveal inconsistency of the special binding sites in the CTSC molecule which could be very important in the functionality of the protein.",2012
 The guanine nucleotide exchange factor kalirin 7 is a novel synphilin 1 interacting protein and modifies synphilin 1 aggregate transport and formation,P12.187,"Y. Tsai, O. Riess, H. Nguyen, A. S. Soehn","Department of Medical Genetics, University of Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Germany","Synphilin 1 has been identified as an interaction partner of alpha synuclein, a key protein in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD). To further ex   plore novel binding partners of synphilin 1, a yeast two hybrid screening was performed and kalirin 7 was identified as a novel interactor. Kalirin 7 is a brain specific guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) enriched in the postsynaptic density (PSD) of excitatory synapses. It contains a SEC14 do   main, a spectrin like domain, a RhoGEF domain and a Pleckstrin homolo gy domain (PH) which control multiple functions of the protein. Kalirin 7 activates Rac1 and regulates dendritic spine morphogenesis, plasticity and development. An interaction of kalirin 7 with huntingtin associated prote in 1 (HAP1), nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), and disrupted in schizophrenia 1 (DISC1) further links the protein to Huntington disease (HD), Alzheimer disease (AD), and schizophrenia.In order to evaluate the functional relevance of this newly discovered inter   action, we first focused on the ability of synphilin 1 to promote inclusion formation, as this feature provides a functional overlap of kalirin 7 and syn philin 1.

Gene identification studies can be instrumental in the elucidation of disease  mechanisms underlying neurodegenerative brain diseases such as Parkin  son disease (PD) and eventually support the development of earlier and  more accurate diagnostic tools as well as formulation of preventive or cu ring therapies. We therefore performed whole genome sequencing in a Flanders Belgian  PD patient with an onset age of 24 years and both unaffected parents. Suc cessive filtering of the identified variations was based on sequence quality, genomic location and frequency in both the â1000 genomes projectâ and an  extended collection of Flanders Belgian individuals. Finally, variations were  selected based on segregation in line with one of the four possible inheri   tance patterns. Focusing on high confidence coding and splice site variati  ons we identified 115 de novo, 40 homozygous recessive, 55 heterozygous  compound recessive and 11 X linked variations. Genetic validation in an extended cohort of geographically matched control individuals (N,1000),  to exclude polymorphisms, resulted in 16 variations in 10 genes with a high  potential to be linked to PD in this Flanders Belgian nuclear family. We are currently estimating the contribution of these variations to PD pathogenesis in our cohort of Flanders Belgian PD patients (N,600) using various geno  typing platforms. Further we plan to sequence the selected candidate genes  using a custom MASTR NGS assay to identify other mutations in these genes to further support a role in PD pathogenesis. Eventually, functional charac terization of the probable pathogenic variant(s) will be performed to gain insights into the mutation mechanism and disease processes.",2012

X linked female limited epilepsy is characterized by seizure onset in infancy or early childhood and cognitive impairment. The spectrum of phenotypes has been extended to include female patients with early infantile epileptic encephalopathy, type 9 (EIEE9). Heterozygous PCDH19 mutations were identified in EIEE9 patients. Interestingly, only heterozygous females are affected, while hemizygous males are devoid of seizures or cognitive im pairment, although mosaic males can also be affected. This inheritance sup posed cellular interference as possible pathogenic mechanism.We report on two Bulgarian patients with typical clinical manifestation of EI EE9. Two novel mutations were detected in the PCDH19 gene: c.2705dupA;  p(Asp902Lysfs*6) and c.1091delC; p.Pro364Argfs*4 (both in heterozy   gous state). Surprisingly, the mother of the first patient was heterozygous  asymptomatic carrier of c.2705dupA. She has never suffered epileptic seizu   res and intellectual impairment. The second mutation c.1091delC was de  novo. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case of a female heterozygous for a mutation in the PCDH19 gene who did not manifest any clinical fea  tures. Usually, the PCDH19 mutations arise de novo, are inherited by the  unaffected carrier fathers or by affected mothers. The possibility for total   ly skewed X inactivation is very unlikely as it has never been detected in  PCDH19 mutation positive patients. Thus, one could speculate that, due to  the complex interaction with other genetic, epigenetic factors, some PCDH19 mutation carriers could even fully âescapeâ any disease manifestation, and this could be the case in our patientâs mother.

Here, we aimed  to map the disease gene in a large, four generation consanguineous fami  ly with PCG, originating from Jordan. Mutations in known PCG genes were  excluded. Identity by descent (IBD) mapping was performed in six affected  members using genome wide SNP genotyping with 250K arrays. The com  mon IBD regions did not overlap with any known PCG loci.

Using prioritization tools, BEST2 was selected  as the best candidate gene. Indeed, Best2 is expressed in non pigmented epithelial cells of ciliary body, which is responsible for formation of aqueous humour. Also, Best2 /  mice have significantly lower IOP than wild type lit   termates. Sanger sequencing of BEST2 in affected individuals revealed no  mutations however.

Autosomal recessively inherited Perrault syndrome (MIM233400) is a cli  nically and genetically heterogeneous disorder. It is typically characterized  bilateral hearing loss, ovarian dysgenesis in female patients, and can be as  sociated with neurological manifestations such as mental retardation and cerebellar ataxia. A proposed clinical classification suggests type I does not  show neurological symptoms while type II patients do show variable affec  tion of the nervous system. Recently, mutations in HSD17B4 and in HARS2 genes were described in some, but not all, patients with Perrault syndro me.

Hearing impairment was not observed. Her karyotype  was normal (46,XX). We excluded homozygosity of regions of described ge  nes for Perrault syndrome by marker analysis. Subsequently, we performed whole exome sequencing. Our strategy for the identification of the causative gene is based on an initial determination of homozygous stretches using all identified variants followed by a prioritization of likely damaging variants within these homozygous stretches.

All of them had moderate to severe psychomotor retardati on, the male patient never experienced walking and was non educable The older female affected was able to walk at the age of 6 year, and the younger female was able to walk with support and had a mild intellectual impair ment. Interestingly, the female patients had no menstrual cycle. The hormo   nal and abdominopelvic sonar investigations revealed a premature ovarian failure in the affected females. Our proband was a six years old male patient from far relative parents with a normal cognitive function He had hypoto nia, mild intesion tremors and ataxic gait although his MRI scans showed severe cerebellar atrophy. Strabismus was note in the second year of life and corrected by surgical intervention. The sequence analysis of the PMM2 gene revealed a compound heterozygous mutation in Exon 5 and in exon 8 in the proband and a homozygous mutation in Exon 8 in the other affected family members. This consanguine family demonstrated a phenotype and genotype variability of the PMM2 gene.",2012

Cultured fibroblasts from patients have structural abnormalities of the cilia and show down regulation of BMP4 , WNT5A and  WNT2B , key regulators of planar cell polarity, expressed at the cortical hem,  the cortex organizing center giving birth to Cajal Retzius (CR) neurons. In deed, in mouse embryos Rotatin expression co localizes with CR neurons. Knockdown experiments in human fibroblasts and neural stem cells confirm a role for Rotatin in cilia structure and function.

With a frequency of up to 1 in  10,000 PCD is a rather common ârare diseaseâ. To date, 12 genes causing  approximately 40% of all cases have been identified, two encoding proteins  (KTU, LRRC50) involved in cytosolic axonemal dynein co assembly. Using homozygosity mapping and subsequent Sanger sequencing we have identi fied mutations in a new gene, C19ORF51 in PCD patients with absent dyn  ein arms. We find that the Chlamydomonas ortholog of C19ORF51, PF22, is  involved in the cytoplasmic assembly of the outer dynein arms preceeding their import into the axoneme. In PF22 mutants, axonemal dynein heavy chain stability as well as co assembly of heavy with intermediate chains is significantly disturbed and PF22 appears to act downstream of KTU and LRRC50 in the dynein preassembly pathway. In zebrafish, PF22 knockdown results in a typical ciliopathy phenotype (axis curvature, pronephric cysts, hydrocephalus and situs inversus) due to loss of the axonemal dynein arms resulting in cilia dysmotility. We therefore propose a conserved multi step pathway for formation of assembly competent dynein complexes, and that PF22 (renamed DNAAF3, âdynein axonemal assembly factor 3â) mutations causes PCD with situs inversus due deficient cytoplasmic dynein assembly resulting in absent dynein arms.",2012

The main clinical feature shared by this group of disorders is  progressive neurodegeneration accom  panied by myoclonias and epilepsy. As a part of a larger research project  on the genetics of inherited neurological disorders in Oman, this study was carried out to investigate genetic abnormalities in two Omani families with PME. The study comprised of two families with total of five affected indivi duals initially diagnosed with PME . Age of onset ranged from 7 17 years. Symptoms included progressively increasing myoclonic jerks with action and stimulus sensitive myoclonus, generalized tonic clonic seizures, and ataxia . Some patients suffered also from memory and mental impairment  and visual deterioration. Genome wide homozygosity mapping was perfor   med using Illumina 33K SNP arrays.

A rare Mendelian form of hypertension is Pseudohypoaldosteronism type  II (PHAII), also known as Gordon hyperkalemia hypertension syndrome  (OMIM 145260). Mutations in WNK1  and WNK4 , and two recently identified  genes (KLHL3 and CUL3) have been reported as causes of monogenic hy   pertension. In a Turkish family (parents and 5 children) one daughter was suspected of PHAII. This daughter has been diagnosed at age 24 years with  severe hypertension (200/130 mm Hg), hyperkalemia (6.5 mmol/l; normal range 3.5 5.1), and normal renal function. All other family members are healthy. We hypothesized that a de novo mutation in the daughter is the most likely  cause of her disease. Sanger sequencing of WNK1  and WNK4  and SNP array  analysis (OmniExpress, Illumina) did not reveal any mutation or large chro mosomal abnormality. Full exome sequencing (Nimblegen SeqCapEZV2, Il   lumina HiSeq2000) of all seven family members identified 34,733 unique  variants in our patient. Filtering against dbSNP , 1000Genome project, vari  ants found in unaffected family members, and selecting loss or gain of func  tion mutations resulted in 481 possible disease causing variants. By compa ring the recent mutations reported by Boyden et al (Nature, Febr 2012), we found an identical de novo mutation in CUL3, a splice acceptor site mutation  in intron 8 resulting in the skipping of exon 9. This results in an in frame 57 amino acid deletion abrogating the function of CUL3.This de novo splice acceptor site mutation found in a second patient with  PHAII confirmed CUL3 as a cause of PHAII in line with Boyden et al.",2012

De Paepe1","1Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, Ghent, Belgium, 2Dpt","of Cell and  Molecular Biology, John A. Burns School of Medecine, University of Hawaii, Honolulu, HI, United States. Aim. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is characterized by oculocutaneous and cardiovascular manifestations, due to mineralization and fragmentation of elastic fibers. The pathophysiology of ectopic calcification is unclear and hypotheses include oxidative stress and an unidentified serum factor. PXE patients also have diminished vitamin K (VK) serum concentrations, leading to inefficient activation of the VK dependent mineralization inhibitor matrix gla protein (MGP). MGP acts as inhibitor of the pro calcifying Bone Morpho   genetic Protein 2 (BMP2). One of several BMP2 associated pathways is the âBMP2 Smad RUNX2â pathway, where RUNX2 acts as transcriptional regu lator of proteins involved in mineralization, osteogenesis and apoptosis. We studied the role of this signaling pathway in PXE. Methods & Results. Immunohistochemistry for BMP2, Smad 1 4 5 8 and RUNX2 in whiskers of Abcc6 knock out mice and human PXE dermis sho   wed positive labeling, co localizing with mineralization compared to con trols, which was confirmed via qPCR on human PXE fibroblasts. TUNEL as says revealed significant increase in apoptosis in PXE fibroblasts. Caspase 3 stains demonstrated co localization of apoptosis with mineralization foci in all tissues. Comparable qPCR results and apoptosis rates were obtained on PXE serum inoculated control fibroblasts. Discussion & Conclusion. Our results indicate the involvement of the pro  osteogenic BMP2 Smad RUNX2 pathway in PXE. RUNX2 upregulation can explain the expression profile of proteins previously implicated in PXE, lea   ding to ectopic mineralization or neovascularisation. By also demonstrating an effect of oxidative stress and PXE serum, three principal pathophysiolo gical observations in PXE can be merged in this pathway, which may provide therapeutic options through small molecule inhibitors of BMP receptors.",2012

Patients generally present deficits in the areas of learning, speaking, sensorial perception, mood management, move ments, breathing, heart function, severe scoliosis, and even on the chewing, swallowing and digesting areas. These symptoms arise in 6 to 18 months  old girls, after an apparently normal development, when the deficit of the  psychomotor abilities becomes more evident. Laboratorial diagnosis can be done by screening for mutations along the coding region of the MECP2 gene  and its adjacencies.

Excluding one case due to insufficient DNA, data on 17 breakpoints within CREBBP could be precisely compared using MLPA, microarray analysis (Affymetrix 6.0), and qPCR. Comparison of MLPA and microarray data yielded consistent results for 9 breakpoints, differences of only 1 exon for five further cases, and for 2 and more exons in 3 cases with qPCR in most cases confirming the MLPA data. Taken together, genome wi de microarray analysis may at least in some cases give less precise data than other methods like MLPA or qPCR and may, in particular, overlook small de   letions. The combination of the three techniques may improve the diagnosis and avoid later alternative and expensive diagnostics and/or management strategies.",2012
 Twelve new mutations in the EP300 gene in patients with Rubinstein Taybi syndrome.,P12.214,"M. J. van Belzen, C. A. C. van der Lans, D. J. M. Peters","Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","Rubinstein Taybi syndrome (RSTS) is a rare disorder affecting approxi mately 1/100,000 newborns. The syndrome is characterized by mental and growth retardation and a particular dysmorphology mainly concerning the face, hands and feet. The most frequent cause of RSTS are mutations in the CREBBP gene, which are found in 30 50% of patients. Furthermore, micro deletions involving the CREBBP gene have been found in ~10% of patients. Mutations in EP300 have been published, but seem to be rare with a fre quency of 1 3%.In a cohort of 119 patients suspected of having RSTS, in 12 patients (6%) a pathogenic mutation in the EP300 gene was found. Eleven EP300 mutations were small sequence variants: three frameshift mutations, five nonsense mutations, one splice site mutation, one insertion/deletion mutation and one (de novo) missense mutation in the functional HAT domain. In addition, a deletion of exons 24 to 29 was detected. About one third of patients in this cohort (32%) could be explained by a mutation in the CREBBP gene, so in the majority of patients no mutation could be identified. In conclusion, these results show that mutations in the EP300 gene are a rare cause of Rubinstein Taybi syndrome, but perhaps not as rare as previously thought.

SCA 36 was recently shown to be caused by a GGCCTG repeat expansion in intron 1 of NOP56 in Japanese families. NOP56 encodes a component of  the ribonucleoprotein complex and plays a role in transcription and spli  cing processes. We found the same mutation in ten families, including two very large kindreds from the coastal region in Northwestern Spain (Costa  da Morte, Galicia). The screening of the NOP56 expansion, carried out with  Southern Blot analysis and repeat primed PCR, revealed expanded alleles ranging from 650 2500 repeats, within a unique haplotype. The most recent common founder chromosome was dated over 600 years ago. We have stu  died 66 mutation carriers and observed both further expansions and con  tractions of the repeat upon transmission. The main clinical characteristics of the disease are a late onset cerebellar syndrome with upper and lower motor neuron signs, oculomotor abnormalities and sensorineural hearing  loss. SCA36 represents the most frequent SCA type so far in our region, with  epidemiological implication for South American countries, the main destiny of traditional Galician emigration, where thus additional SCA36 cases might  be identified. Together with the recent description of the intronic C9ORF72  hexanucleotide expansion in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, our findings  further highlight the increasing recognition of a major role of abnormal RNA  processing in neurodegeneration.Acknowledgements: Xunta de Galicia ConsellerÃ­a de Sanidade (PGIDT05SAN26PR), ConsellerÃ­a de EconomÃ­a e In  dustria (10PXIB9101280PR) and ConsellerÃ­a de InnovaciÃ³n (Lucas Labrada  contract to MG M).

Molecular karyotyping is commonly used to identify disease causing de novo copy number variants in patients with developmental delay and multiple congenital anomalies. In such a patient with multiple congenital anomalies  we now observed an 150 kb deletion on chromosome 7q21.11 affecting the  first exon of the axon guidance molecule gene SEMA3A. This deletion was  inherited from the healthy father, but considering the function of SEMA3A and phenotypic similarity to the knock out mice, we assumed a recessive  defect. Sequencing of the SEMA3A gene in the patient revealed the de novo  in frame mutation p.Phe316_Lys317delinsThrSerSerAsnGlu. Cloning of the mutated allele in combination with two informative SNPs confirmed com pound heterozygosity in the patient. While the altered protein structure  was predicted to be benign, aberrant splicing resulting in a premature stop  codon was proven by RT PCR to occur in about half of the transcripts from this allele. Expression profiling in human fetal and adult cDNA panels, con  firmed a high expression of SEMA3A in all brain regions as well as in adult  and fetal heart and fetal skeletal muscle. We therefore report the first bona fide human mutations in the SEMA3A gene delineating a novel autosomal  recessive disorder characterized by postnatal short stature with relative  macrocephaly, camptodactyly, septal heart defect and several minor anoma lies. Normal intellectual development in the patient was surprising but may be explained by the remaining 20% of SEMA3A expression level demonstra  ted by quantitative RT PCR.",2012

We recently identified nonsense and splice site mu tations in NEK1  as the underlying cause of short rib polydactyly syndrome  type Majewski (SRPS II) (Thiel et al. 2011). According to their phenotype the short rib polydactyly syndromes (SRPS) are classified into four distinct types: Saldino Noonan (I), Majewski (II), Verma Naumhoff (III) and Beemer (IV) and include the phenotypically related asphyxiating thoracic dystrophy (ATD) and Ellis van Crefeld syndromes (EVC). Here, mutations in EVC1/2,  IFT80, and DYNC2H1 have been observed. Absence of full length NEK1 leads to a severely reduction of primary cilia length and a significant decrease of ciliated fibroblasts. The primary cilium acts as a chemosensor for important developmental pathways like hedge  www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012333 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters hog, wnt and the platelet derived growth factor (PDGF) pathways.

PTPN11  encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain containing protein tyrosine phos   phatase that positively modulates RAS function. Here, we characterized functionally all possible amino acid substitutions arising from single base changes affecting codons 62 and 63 to explore the molecular mechanisms lying behind the largely invariant occurrence of the Tyr62Asp and Tyr63Cys substitutions recurring in NS. We provide structural and biochemical data indicating that the autoinhibitory interaction between the N SH2 and PTP domains is perturbed in both mutants as a result of an extensive structural rearrangement of the N SH2 domain. Most mutations affecting Tyr 63 exerted  an unpredicted disrupting effect on the structure of the N SH2 phospho   peptide binding cleft mediating SHP2âs interaction with signaling partners. Among all the amino acid changes affecting that codon, the disease causing mutation was the only substitution that perturbed the stability of SHP2âs inactive conformation without severely impairing proper N SH2âs phospho   peptide binding. On the other hand, the disruptive effect of the Tyr62Asp change on the autoinhibited conformation of the protein was balanced, in part, by less efficient binding properties of the mutant.

SLOS is caused by mutations in the Î7sterol reductase gene (DHCR7; E.C. 1.3.1.21) which disrupt cholesterol biosynthesis. Pheno   typic variability of the disease is already known to be associated with ma ternal ApoE genotype. Recently a second modifier of this monogenic disease  has been demonstrated which is ABCA1. The existing LOVD based mutation databases includes the DHCR7  genotype for each phenotypical described  patient. It includes the so called severity score, DHCR7  haplotypes, geogra  phic origin, and cholesterol data if present.Findings on modifier Regarding ApoE there are the known allelic variants  ApoE2, E3, E4 determined in the mothers who play a role in phenotypic va riability and cholesterol concentrations of the patient. Regarding ABCA1 it is the maternal genotype of the SNP p.Arg1587Lys that is associated with severity of the disease and in an already unknown manner with the viability of SLOS foetus.Implication for mutation databases The aim of patient based mutation  database is to interpret molecular findings concerning the accurate dia gnosis, getting information about prognosis and possible useful therapies. Hence the existing database is complemented now by additional data about maternal ApoE genotype.

The epidemiological features and the relative  frequency of such disorders are quite unknown yet. We prospectively stu  died 262 suspected ARCA patients from Brazil between 2005 and 2011. All  patients were evaluated in the neurogenetics clinics with a standard evalua   tion, neuroimaging studies (CT scan, brain MRI with spectroscopy), ophtal   mological and auditory evaluations, neurophysiological studies (EEG, ERG,  and EMG/NCV), hormone and biochemical tests, muscle biopsy with respi   ratory chain mitochondrial analysis, screening for inborn errors of meta  bolism (enzyme studies, peroxisomal and sterol panels, cholestanol dosage, organic acids, aminoacids chromatography), molecular studies for the FRDA expansion , mitochondrial point mutations and SCAs 1, 2,3, 6,7,10,12,17    when indicated, nerve/skin biopsy for EM studies and karyotype were also  performed. A conclusive diagnosis was established for 196 patients. The  most frequent causes seen in our cohort were Friedreich ataxia, leukodys trophies, Joubert syndrome, ataxia with oculomotor apraxia types I and II, mitochondrial disorders and neurolipidoses. ARCAs are rare disorders with  a wide differential diagnosis. Recognition of the most frequent genetic cau  ses of ARCA can lead to a sequential evaluation capable of establishing a  definitive diagnosis in the majority of patients; new techniques as SNP ar rays and exome sequencing can be extreme useful in identification of new ARCAs, although they were not available for our study.",2012

Mutations in the first nucleotide of exons af  fect splicing when found in AG dependent 3â splice sites typically possessing weak and/or short polypyrimidine tracts while exons with AG independent splice sites are resistant to this type of mutations. Recent study showed that  mutations in the +1 G impaired splicing in exons with preceeding polypyri   midine stretches (PPS) from 4 nt do 10 nt long whereas those with PPS from  9 to 16 nt long were normally spliced. We identfied three changes of first nucleotides of exons in our patients with  btk mutations. Two of them were point mutations of +1 G located in 3â splice site with borderline PPS length (8 nt), though just one of them affected the  process of splicing. The third mutation was a deletion of four nucleotides  in a splice site with 10 nt long PPS (but the affected exon started with A nucleotide). This mutation did not influence splicing of the gene. We sought  to examine how the most commonly used in silico splicing prediction tools  would cope with the effect of these mutations on splicing.

Weber2","1* Authors contributed equally / Institute of Human Genetics, Regensburg, Germany,  2Institute of Human Genetics, Regensburg, Germany","Stargardt disease (STGD), a frequent maculopathy with juvenile onset, is caused by mutations in ABCA4, CNGB3, and ELOVL4. To date, more than 550 distinct ABCA4 mutations have been reported to cause disease. Neverthe   less, the genetic heterogeneity of STGD and the complexity of the ABCA4 gene, which has 50 coding exons, often hinder routine application in genetic testing. We therefore developed an Affymetrix based resequencing array that allows analysis of STGD related genes in a cost  and time saving pro cedure.A challenging task is the interpretation of sequence data and the identifica   tion of disease relevant variants. Consequently, we have generated an au   tomated variant interpretation pipeline which is linked to ongoing interna tional DNA variant project efforts such as the 1,000 Genomes Project or the NHLBI Exome Sequencing Project which currently has data from 3,510 indi   viduals of European descent. In addition, the pipeline automatically queries in silico prediction tools such as MutationTaster and PolyPhen 2. Neutral and intronic sequence changes not affecting the canonical splice acceptor or splice donor sites are analyzed with the Alamut decision support software.So far, we have included a total of 158 STGD patients in our analysis. This identified 1,027 distinct variants, of which 20% (n,199) were defined as pathogenic or likely pathogenic and 91 as variants of uncertain significance (UVs). From the 120 unique possibly pathogenic variants, 35 (29%) are no vel. These data provide an excellent starting point for functional assessment of the defined variants.

The STK11 gene mutations cause the occurrence of the Peutz Jeghers syn  drome. These mutations are heterogeneous, but a significant proportion of  them are large rearrangements. The occurrence of large mutations may be  associated with the presence of interspersed repeats or microhomologies. In the STK11 gene, only one type of interspersed repeats is observed  Alu  elements. Alu sequences represent 19% of the entire gene sequence. Among  large mutations of STK11 gene the deletion of exons 2 and 3 has been de   scribed four times so far in different European populations. In two cases the deleted sequence was described in detail and in another two, deletions  were identified only on the basis of the MLPA results. The deletion of exons  2 nad 3 was also observed by us in one of the cases of Polish families. The deleted sequence endpoints are localized in Alu elements. We can assume  that Alu elements localized in regions including nucleotides c.280+5594 and  c.464+384 are responsible for causing one of the most common recurrent mutation of STK11 gene in Peutz Jeghers patients.",2012

Thus the exon 2 skipping in TNFR1 d2 may be controlled via transcriptional regulation in a cell specific manner. Moreover, by in vitro studies, we showed that one particular mu tation, identified among TRAPS patients involves a translation defect of TNFR1 d2 suggesting that its altered function may account for some of the  inflammatory processes occurring in TRAPS. We suggested that the transcript ratio, depending on the TNFRSF1A  alleles,  may partly account for the inter individual variations observed in patients  with a TRAPS phenotype and possibly in patients suffering from other in  flammatory conditions and that, this new protein could have a role on the physiopathology of TRAPS.",2012

Lester","Regional Molecular Genetics Laboratory, Oxford, United Kingdom","Treacher Collins syndrome (TCS) is a disorder of craniofacial development characterised by a combination of bilateral downward slanting palpebral  fissures, coloboma of the lower eyelid, micrognathia, malformation of the  external ear and bilateral conductive hearing loss.TCS type 1 is caused by dominant loss of function mutations in the TCOF1  gene. The Oxford Molecular Genetics Laboratory, UK, has provided a mole cular diagnostic service for this gene since 2005. To date 119 referrals with a good clinical diagnosis of TCS have been analysed and pathogenic variants have been detected in approximately 70% of patients (of which around 4%  were large deletions)  [1]. In approximately 30% of referrals, no pathogenic  variant was detected.Mutations in the POLR1D  and POLR1C , components of RNA polymerases I  and III, have recently been reported in individuals with TCS  [2]. Sequencing  analysis of these genes was undertaken in a cohort of 26 patients strongly  suspected of having TCS, in whom a pathogenic TCOF1 variant was not de   tected. Probable pathogenic variants in the POLR1D  gene were detected in 6  out of the 26 patients (23%) tested to date. The mutation spectrum includes  novel frameshift, missense and nonsense variants, all predicted to result in loss of protein function. No pathogenic variants were detected in the POL   R1C gene.Data from our cohort suggests that approximately 7% of individuals with a strong clinical diagnosis of TCS may have a pathogenic mutation in the POLR1D  gene.

FXS is caused by a (CGG)n expansion of over 200 repeats, in the 5âUTR  of the FMR1  gene, which as a result is methylated and gene silenced. Based  on (CGG)n length, four classes of alleles can be distinguished: normal (5 44),  intermediate (45 54), premutated (55 200) and fully mutated (>200; FM) alleles. Both FMR1 related primary ovarian insufficiency (FXPOI) and fragile  X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) have been described in pre  mutation carriers. To gain insights into instability  of FMR1 (CGG) n and asso   ciated phenotypes, we assessed repeat length in 541 individuals from 128  Portuguese FXS families. We found 5.3% of intermediate, 29.9% of premuta   ted and 26.6% of FM alleles. For a total of 115 transmissions of the maternal  premutation, 26 (23%) with alleles ranging 60 98, the average expansion  was 17 repeat units, whereas 89 (77%) with alleles 66 199, expanded to FM.  In 44 transmissions of maternal FM, the offspring inherited the FM. For 10  paternal transmissions of premutations, ranging 56 120, all the daughters  inherited a premutation, with an average expansion of 7 repeat units. We identified one male with FXTAS and two females with FXPOI among seven investigated premutation carriers; the remaining premutation individuals were not yet examined. In conclusion, in Portuguese FXS families, allele in stability upon transmission is in agreement with previous reports, where the risk of premutation to FM expansion is linked to the premutation size of the transmitting mother.",2012

Tuberous sclerosis complex (TSC) is a rare genetic disorder, that belongs to neurocutaneous syndromes where both the skin and central nervous sy   stem are involved. It is characterized by an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance and a variable penetrance. The symptoms of tuberous sclerosis vary from person to person and may include seizures, developmental delay, skin abnormalities, lung and kidney disease.TSC is caused by a mutations in the genes TSC1 or TSC2, which encode the  protein hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumor growth suppressors, agents that regulate cell proliferation and differentia tion.Molecular analysis can detect mutations in about 85% of cases and is com plicated by the size of both genes, absence of mutations hotspots and a high rate of de novo mutation s. Untill now DGGE mutations scanning, direct se   quence analysis in combination with deletions/duplications analysis of in TSC1 or TSC2 was performed in patients with suspected TSC.In respect to the progress of new molecular genetic technologies we have adapted next generation sequencing (NGS, Roche GSJ) into routine testing of TSC patients. All relevant areas of genes TSC1 and TSC2 were amplified  by gene specific primers with universal tail and marked by MID adaptors (Multiplex Identifier Adaptors), to differentiate between patients. We used  Geneious software with ADINIS MultipluginG to handle NGS data. Here we report on our experience of routine diagnostics for TSC profiting from the power of NGS.",2012

USH3 is rare  and variable; it may resemble USH1 or USH2, and vestibular dysfunction  may occur. Clarin 1 (CLRN1) is the only known USH3 gene (locus: USH3A ).  We have previously identified a consanguineous Lebanese family with an USH3 phenotype. Microarray SNP analysis identified three homozygosity  by descent regions: 1q43 q44 (8.54 Mb), 20p13 p12.2 (10.48 Mb), and  20p11.23 q12 (19.35 Mb). We excluded mutations in ninein like protein (NINL) on chromosome 20p11.21, an interactor of the USH protein com  plex.

ABHD12 hydroly   zes 2 arachidonoyl glycerol, an endocannabinoid lipid transmitter that acts on cannabinoid receptors CB1 and CB2. This pathway is probably unrelated to the USH interactome.

Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive disorder with congenital  sensorineural hearing impairment (HI) and retinitis pigmentosa (RP). USH1 presents with severe to profound HI, facultative vestibular impairment and early RP , USH2 with moderate to severe HI and RP in adolescence. USH3 is rare and variable. Because of the mostly large size of the 10 USH genes, genetic confirmation of the diagnosis is the exception. We have applied a no vel and efficient diagnostic strategy to 32 patients. For USH2, we sequenced USH2A , followed by USH2A  MLPA and next generation sequencing (NGS)  of all USH genes. For USH1 or atypical USH samples, we sequenced MYO7A  (USH1B) before NGS was available to us; now, they directly undergo NGS. We found USH2A  mutations in 18 out of 19 USH2 patients, including large intra  genic deletions and duplications. NGS revealed GPR98  (USH2C) mutations  in one USH2 patient, but no USH gene mutations in the only patient with a monoallelic USH2A  mutation. All three atypical USH patients and 4 of the 10  USH1 cases carried MYO7A mutations.

In tragenic mutations as well as deletions of the coding region or the upstream region of POU3F4 have been reported. Most affected males show a profound sensorineural hearing loss with or without a conductive component (which can be masked by the sensorineural loss). Common features are stapedial fixa tion and temporal bone anomalies (including dilation of the internal auditory canal, visible in computed tomography (CT)) leading to a perilymphatic gusher following stapedectomy or during cochlear implantation.We extracted DNA from blood samples of five patients with a characteristic temporal bone CT and sequenced the coding region of the POU3F4 gene and its flanking sequences. For the detection of larger deletions or duplications MLPA analysis was applied. In three patients we found intragenic mutations which have not been described so far: one missense mutation (c.844C>T , p.Arg282Trp), classified as probably pathogenic by biometric analysis, and two frame shift mutations (c.226delC, p.Leu76Trpfs*6; c.346dupG, p.Ala116Glyfs*77) leading to a truncated protein lacking both DNA binding domains.

The molecular mechanisms leading to excessi   ve keratinocyte proliferation, the hallmark of both diseases, remain elusive.  ZNF750  mutations were previously reported to be associated with psoriasi   form SD and with familial psoriasis. ZNF750  encodes a putative transcripti  on factor that is highlyexpressed in keratinocytes and represents a psoriasis  candidate gene. To understand ZNF750 function, we initially determined the sub cellular  localization of ZNF750 and assessed the effect of ZNF750  silencing on cell  proliferation and apoptosis in the human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT . Im  munofluorescence and subcellular fractionation followed by western blot  analysis showed nuclear localization of ZNF750. In addition, using EGFP  tagged constructs, we identified which of the two ZNF750 nuclear locali   zation signals is functional. As excessive proliferation of keratinocytes is a hallmark of both psoriasis and SD, we examined the effects of ZNF750  silen  cing in HaCaT keratinocytes on cell proliferation (Ki67 assay) and apoptosis  (annexin V assay). In comparison to controls, HaCaT cells in which ZNF750   expression was down regulated exhibited a 10 fold increase in cell prolife  ration and a 3 fold decrease in apoptosis.

Phenotype in all clinical forms of the disease: calssic salt wasting (SW) and simple virilizing (SV) and nonclassic late onset form (LO) corresponds to the genetic lesion in the CYP21A2 gene. The Q318X nonsense and R356W missense mutations at exon 8 that totally ablate 21 hydroxylase activity are most often associated with salt wasting disease.Method: Using the PCR/ACRS method, we have performed direct molecular  detection of the Q318X and R356W mutations in 35 Macedonian patients with classic clinical form of CAH (23 had SW and 12 had SV form), diagnosed according to standard clinical criteria at the Department of Endocrinology and Genetics, University Childrenâs Clinic, Skopje, Republic of Macedonia.Results: Mutations were detected in 20% (7/35) of all patients, Q318X in 5  (14.3%) and R356W in 2 (5.7%). In 17.4% (4/23) of the SW patients Q318X mutation was detected (three homozygotes and one heterozygote), and only one was heterozygote for R356W (4.3%). Among SV patients mutations Q318X and R356W were detected in one heterozygote (8.3%) each.Conclusion: The R356W distribution in the Macedonian patients with clas  sic CAH is comparable whereas the Q318X  frequency was higher than re  ported in the most European populations. However, these findings further  support a role of the severe mutations Q318X and R356W in the salt wasting  form of the 21 hydroxylase deficiency.",2012

Carrier frequency is around 1/50. Detection of car riers of SMN1 deletions is crucial to define couples at risk for SMA offspring.  One of the pitfalls in quantitative SMA carrier diagnosis is the presence of two SMN1 genes in cis (2/0 carriers). We analysed 2827 individuals (810 parents and 2017 other relatives) for SMA carrier diagnosis. In the group of parents, 786 (97%) showed one SMN1 copy. The remaining 24 showed two copies and based on the inheritance of the at risk alleles and quantitative analyses of their parents or siblings, 18 individuals were considered 2/0 carriers (2.25%) and 6 âde novoâ cases (0.75%). In the group of relatives we detected 600 carriers with one copy, 1362 two copies, 50 three copies and 5 four copies.

A key regulator of phosphate homeostasis is the fibro blast growth factor 23 (FGF23). It is mainly secreted from osteocytes, cir   culates in the blood, and binds to receptor heterodimers composed of FGF receptor 1 (FGFR1) and KLOTHO in the kidney. FGF23 activates KLOTHO/FGFR1 to inhibit renal phosphate reabsorption and to suppress 1,25 dihy   droxyvitamin D3 synthesis. As a key signalling pathway mitogen activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathway is employed. To analyse regulatory inter   actions between FGF23/KLOTHO/FGFR1, small inhibitory compounds and further downstream targets, we have developed FGF23 inducible HEK293  cells that stably express KLOTHO (HEK293 KL). Stable cell clones were  picked, expanded, and expression of KLOTHO was confirmed by Western blot analysis. By investigating the activation of MAPK pathway we could  show that HEK293 KL cells are FGF23 inducible. Moreover, we could inhi  bit the induction with FGF23 by the use of two small inhibitory molecules: (1) SU5402, an inhibitor of FGFR1 and (2) U0126, an inhibitor of MAPK  pathway. Taken together, we have established a potent cell based reporter  assay, which can now be used to investigate FGF23/KLOTHO/FGFR1 recep tor signalling and receptor complex inhibition in more detail. We will try to  identify novel downstream targets which may be candidates for regulatory  compounds involved in phosphate homeostasis.",2012
 A novel splice mutation and a novel exon deletion in the AGL gene in a patient with Forbes Cori disease (GSD III),P13.13,"M. Kuhn1, C. Distler1, F. Wegner2, D.

Glycogen storage disease type III (GSD III) is an autosomal recessive disor   der characterized by excessive accumulation of glycogen in the liver and in skeletal / cardiac muscles. The typical symptoms are hepatomegaly, hypo  glycaemia and muscles weakness, also shown in our 4 years old male pati   ent. GSD III is caused by a deficiency of the glycogen debranching enzyme  (AGL). We performed screening for mutations in the AGL gene by sequen   cing all exons including flanking intronic sequences. The analysis revealed  a heterozygous mutation at the donor splice site of exon 10. Considering the autosomal recessive inheritance pattern of GSD III, this mutation can not solely be responsible for the present phenotype in the patient. So it was appropriated to search for possible deletions in the AGL gene. A gross de   letion was excluded by Array CGH. As there is no commercial MLPA kit for AGL available, we designed our own MLPA probes. Having established the assay we analyzed DNA from the patient. We found a heterozygous novel single exon deletion in the AGL gene. This result was confirmed by junction fragment analysis using flanking primers. Sequence analysis of the junction fragment revealed a 2.3 kb deletion and the intronic break points. The de   letion could also be detected in paternal DNA and the splice mutation in maternal DNA. This demonstrates the compound heterozygosity of the two detected genetic alterations. Our results show that home made MLPA tests are an appropriate method to detect causative exon deletions in genes since there is no commercial MLPA kit available.",2012

 The genetic origin of glutaric aciduria type I in Belarus,P13.15,"A. Zinovik, S. Miasnikov, N.

From 1975 more than 500 patients were diagnosed worldwide. More than 200 disease cau   sing mutations of GCDH gene (19p13.2) are known thus far, most mutations are unique to individual families. In some countries GA I is included in the panel of diseases identified by expanded newborn screening.In Belarus the possibility to diagnose GA I appeared after the beginning of acylcarnitine analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS). From 2007 4120 patients passed selective screening by MS/MS, and four unrelated pa tients, aged 7 months   2 years, were diagnosed as having GA I. The analysis of GCDH gene revealed one common mutation, p.R402W, covering 75% (6 from 8) of all mutant alleles. High prevalence of p.R402W also among Rus sian GA I patients indicates possible Slavic origin of this mutant allele and suggests that screening for this mutation may be appropriate for the confir   mation of biochemical and clinical diagnostic, identification of carrier status and prenatal diagnosis of GA I in this region.",2012
 Association of HFE gene mutations with HLA A and B alleles in patients with idiopathic hepathobiliar disorders,P13.16,"O. Bilevych, D. Zastavna, H. Makukh, O.

This is the most common inherited liver di sease. HH gene (HFE) is located within the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I region on chromosome 6. It is suggested linkage disequilibrium bet   ween these genomic regions which results in certain clinical features of HH.The aim of the study was to establish the distribution of HLA A and  B alleles in patients with idiopathic hepathobiliar disorders (IHD) in association with C282Y and H63D mutations in HFE gene. The presence of HFE mutations was established in 70 patients with IHD  (chronic idiopathic hepatitis, liver cirrhosis, hepatomegaly) and in 60 healthy controls. HLA typing was performed in 25 HFE mutation carriers  and 20 non carriers. HFE mutations were screened for by RFLP performed  on PCR products. HLA alleles were detected using allele specific PCR.Heterozygous C282Y mutation found in 14.3% of patients with IHD was si gnificantly higher than in control group (Ï 2,4.625, P<0.05). The differences  in H63D mutation frequencies were not reliable. An expected significant association between HFE mutations and HLA A3 allele was established  (Ï 2,3.902, P<0.05). 4 out of 5 patients with chronic idiopathic hepatitis were HLA A3/B7, HLA A3/B62 and HLA A3/B14 genotype carriers in association  with both C282Y and H63D mutation. We suggest that heterozygous status for C282Y mutation may be a risk fac tor for IHD. HLA A3 allele and HLA A3 containing genotypes in combinati   on with HFE mutations may play important role in susceptibility to chronic  idiopathic hepatitis.",2012

The known causes  are: defects in the SLC22A12 gene, encoding the human urate transporter 1 (hURAT1), and also impairment of voltage urate transporter (URATv1),  encoded by SLC2A9 (GLUT9) gene. Diagnosis is based on hypouricemia (<  119 Î¼mol/l) and increased fractional excretion of UA (> 10%). To date more than one hundred Japanese patients with mutations in hURAT1 gene have been described. Hypouricemia is sometimes overlooked, therefore we have  set up the flowchart for this disorder. Methods : The patients were selected for molecular analysis from 640 Czech  hypouricemic patients. These cases were found in 3 700 blood and urine samples. Serum and urinary UA and creatinine were determined. The se   quence analysis of SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 genes were performed.Results: Other secondary causes of hyperuricosuric hypouricemia were ex   cluded. The estimations of : 1) serum UA, 2) excretion fraction of UA, 3) and analysis of hURAT1 and URATv1 genes follow. We have found 3 transition, 4 deletions in SLC22A12 gene and one nucleotide insertion in SLC2A9 gene in overall 7 Czech patients. Three patients had acute renal failure and urate nephrolithiasis.Conclusions:  Our finding of the defects in URATv1 gene gives further evi  dence that SLC2A9 is a causative gene of primary renal hypouricemia. He   reditary renal hypouricemia is still unrecognized disorder and probably not wide spread in East Asia only. (Supported by project PRVOUK, MOLMED of Charles University).",2012

Hospital Universitario de Salamanca, Salamanca, Spain. BackgroundHNF1A is a transcription factor that plays a central role in the regulation of pancreatic beta cells. It controls the transcription of key genes such as insulin and GLUT2. Their mutations cause deregulation of certain processes leading to the onset of MODY3 diabetes. So far it has been described three HNF1A isoforms. We have identified two new isoforms in liver cells.MethodsHNF1A cDNA was synthesized in HepG2, Capan 1, Hek and MCF7 cells (ne gative control). The reaction products were cloned to analyse the isoforms activity by luciferase assay in COS1 and HepG2 cells. We carried out a pre dictive analysis of the structures of two new isoforms and their location was determined by immunofluorescence in both cell types.ResultsWe found two unreported transcripts: HNF1AÎ2, which lost exon 2 and the reading frame, and HNF1AinsIVS8, who never missed the reading frame and inserts 31 amino acids in the protein. Luciferase analysis show a 77% reduc tion in expression levels of isoform HNF1AÎ2 and a twofold increase in the activity of the isoform HNF1AinsIVS8 with respect to the Wt. The structure prediction shows a significant change in the case of isoform HNF1AinsIVS8. Immunofluorescence analysis shows that this isoform maintain the nuclear localization. This isoform is expressed in Hepg2 cell line but not in Capan1, HEK293T , JURKAT or MCF7. Analysis of HNF1AÎ2 isoform is underway.ConclusionWe report two novel isoforms cloned by HNF1A gene that are expressed in HepG2 cell line and could help to better understand HNF1A activity.

Congenital hyperinsulinism (CHI) causes persistent hypoglycemia due to uncontrolled insulin secretion in newborns and infants. Since patients are  at increased risk of neurological sequelae, a rapid diagnosis and disease ma  nagement is mandatory. CHI is a heterogenous condition at the clinical and genetic level. Mutations in several genes including ABCC8, KCNJ11, GLUD1 ,  GCK , HADH , SLC14A1 , HNF4A and UCP2 have been identified in approximate  ly half of the patients in several patient cohorts. The most severe forms of CHI are caused by loss of function of the ABCC8 and KCNJ11 genes encoding  subunits of the ATP sensitive K(+) channel. They are usually associated with  unresponsiveness of pancreatic Ã cells to medical treatment. Recently, it has  been suggested to implement rapid genetic analysis of ABCC8 and KCNJ11  in newborns with diazoxide unresponsive CHI to improve patient manage   ment. We report sequence analysis in 37 CHI patients referred to us within one year. Mutations in ABCC8 and KCNJ11 were observed in 7/17 patients  aged less than one year and in 5/20 patients at age of more than one year.  Seven patients harbored homozygous or compound heterozygous mutati   ons that cause diffuse form of CHI and five patients had paternally trans  mitted single heterozygous mutations predicted to cause focal form of CHI.  Together, 14 different mutations were identified and 12 were novel with one recurrent mutation in two consanguineous families of Turkish descent. In conclusion, genetic analysis of ABCC8 and KCNJ11 in CHI newborns and in  fants revealed mutations in about one third of the patients and contributed to further patient management.",2012

It is caused by impaired activity of the tissue nonspecific isoenzyme of al   kaline phosphatase. Five clinical forms are distinguished depending on the patientâs age when clinical symptoms occur. Early onset of the disease normally accompanies a severe clinical course, in this case HPP is normally transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait. HPP due to a single mutation in the ALPL gene and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait can cause milder forms without clearly defined symptoms so far.Results: Here we present clinical data of 9 families and 22 individuals with one mutation in the ALPL gene. Stress fracture and impaired healing of fractures are leading symptoms of dominant HPP . The majority of mutation carriers show signs of odontohypophosphatasia like premature tooth loss, tooth decay and caries. One third of the patients complained about joint pain, followed by pain of the muscles. Approximately a quarter of patients reported impaired physical fitness. Only few patients suffered from osteal   gia.The majority of patients showed decreased activity of the alkaline phospha tase. Eight missense mutations in the ALPL gene and no nonsense mutation were found.Conclusion: The clinical signs of dominant HPP are not well known and de   spite of decreased activity of the alkaline phosphatase diagnosis of domi   nant HPP is rarely made.

In itial studies in the 1970s suggested that it might be associated to intellectual deficiency, epilepsy, autism or ataxia. Later assessment of cases identified through neonatal screening, who did not suffer from developmental delay or ID, led to consider histidinemia as a non disease. A recent study has sug gested however that it may be a risk factor for autism (Miyachi et al. 2009). Because of this lack of established clinical impact, interest in this trait has subsided and a single mutation study in the HAL gene revealed only 4 diffe rent missense mutations in a minority of tested cases ascertained through neonatal screening. Following the identification of histidinemia in a girl with developmental delay and ataxia, we initiated a mutation study. Prelimina ry results on 3 patients with ID revealed 5 different missense mutations, and one splice site mutation. In another case with no reported neurological phenotype, another homozygous missense variant was found, not predicted pathogenic by SIFT or Polyphen2. Up to now, truncating mutations appear underrepresented (one detected compared to 10 different missenses). The spontaneous histidinemic mouse mutant (with no obvious neurologic phe notype) is also due to a missense mutation. One may wonder whether phe notype in histidinemia depends on the level of residual activity, and whether total loss of function may be lethal or very severe.

 GI microbiota and epigenetic markers in metabolic syndrome and caloric restriction,P13.26,"A. G. Haslberger , M. Remely, E. Aumueller, Y. Cen, B. Hippe",Univ,"of Vienna, Vienna, Austria. Microbial diversity, abundance and metabolic activities contribute to a high ly individual GI tract microbiota. The metabolic syndrome is one condition,  where host genetic factors, microbiota composition and microbiota direc  ted regulation of gene expressions combined contribute to pathogenesis. Intestinal symbiosis is maintained via the signaling activities of short chain  fatty acids (SCFAs), bacterial LPS mediated immune reactions, but also via  epigenetic mechanisms, e.g. causing a hyporesponsiveness of toll like re ceptors (TLRs) towards the symbiotic and commensal constituents of the microbiota. We analyzed changes in microbiota and epigenetic regulation of inflamm  atory mediators in type 2 diabetic (n , 25) volunteers under caloric restric   tion in comparison to lean (n , 18) and obese (n , 8) healthy controls. The  abundance of bacteria and bacterial subgroups we measured in fecal samp  les with quantitative PCR (qPCR) of 16S rRNA coding regions.Lactobacilli and Clostridium cluster XIVa differed significantly in type 2 dia  betics compared to lean controls before intervention and after weight loss.  Obese individuals had a higher Firmicutse to Bacteroidetes ratio than lean controls. In type 2 diabetics with weight loss the ratio of Firmicutes to Bac   teroidetes increased throughout the study period. In addition to changes in the microbiota composition, we also report that  epigenetic mechanisms regulate gene promoters with relevance to inflam  mation, antioxidation and DNA repair in type 2 diabetes and that diet and caloric restriction have epigenetic regulatory effects.",2012

EC circulating levels were significantly higher in overweight and obese (BMI>25,0) compared to normal weight subjects (AEA, PEA, OEA p,0,00001; 2AG p,0,008). FAAH 385A allele carriers showed significantly increased EC levels, particularly OEA (p,8x10  11) and PEA (p,5x10 7), but they showed no  significant association to obesity indexes. Coexistence of FAAH predisposing genotype and increased EC levels also did not correlate with obesity. None of CNR1 SNPs showed association with obesity indexes, nor with EC increased levels. In conclusion, our data show that the FAAH 385A allele has a direct effect on EC elevated plasma levels, and that the detected hyperactivation of ECS may be a novel biomarker of obesity.",2012

Genome Wide Human SNP 6.0 array (Affyme   trix) was used for genotyping of DNA isolated from leucocytes of patients. In 20% of patients, large deletions as a cause of MD were found. In 2 of them, 175 kb, 87 kb resp. heterozygous deletions on 22q13.33 affecting SCO2 and  TYMP genes were detected. Missense point mutations in TYMP, SCO2 genes  resp. were identified on the other allele. Patient 1 with MNGIE phenotype inherited c.261G>T in TYMP from father and 175 kb deletion from mother.  A novel SCO2 mutation c.667G>A was found on maternal allele of patient  2 in combination with 87 kb deletion inherited from father.

Objectives: Mitochondrial DNA mutations at m.8993T>G of the mtDNA AT   Pase 6 gene typically cause the Maternal Inherited Leigh Syndrome (MILS)  and neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia, retinitis pigmentosa (NARP). To  elucidate the molecular clinical correlations in MILS NARP syndrome, the phenotype, biochemical parameters, mtDNA mutant loads, and bioener   gentics were investigated in three generations of a pedigree harboring m.T8993G mutation.Methods: Detailed neurological and ophthalmological phenotypes, bioche   mical and metabolic status, mutant load, cellular bioenergentic and mole  cular modification were investigated in members of three generations of  pedigree with MILS NARP syndrome.Results: The ATP6 mutation was ubiquitously distributed in various tissues of the affected individuals. A remarkable high mutation load was demon   strated in individuals with MILS and Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), respectively.  While a mutant load ranging from 5% to 97% was noted in those individuals  with mild or absent clinical symptoms. Interestingly, the individual affected with MILS showed remarkable elevation in the levels of lactate, pyruvate, and alanine, and deficiency of carnitine, impaired cellular bioenergetics, and molecular compensation with glycolysis. While the fibroblasts from RP sho   wed molecular modification through the nuclear respiratory chain complex pathway.Conclusion: The correlation between the mutant load in tissues and the severity of phenotype in MILS NARP is very complex, and the genetic back   ground may play an important role in modulating the bioenergetics, bioche   mical defects and clinical outcome. Our results emphasizes the complexity of mechanism contributing in the phenotypic expression of the m.8993T>G mutation and the need for caution in predictive counseling in such patients.",2012

Each mucopolysaccharidosis subtype is caused by a defi   ciency in the activity of a single specific lysosomal enzyme which required for glycosaminoglycan degradation. The deficiency of these enzyme results in the storage of the glycosaminoglycans in several tissues.The clinical presentation and the natural course of the patients with MPS may be different among subtypes which are influenced by the presence of the genetic background including functional polymorphisms and environ mental problems. The general features are course facies, corneal clouding, developmental delay, mental retardation, skeletal and joint abnormalities, and cardiac abnormalities.We report frequency of the clinical symptoms of the MPS patients of our pe diatric genetic clinic. Between January 1995 and December 2011, aged 2 18 years, seventeen children (11 boys, 6 girls) were examined. The MPS III, MPS IV, and MPS I were the most frequent subtypes amongst the MPS patients, respectively. The patients were most frequently representing coarse facies, skeletal abnormalities, mental retardation and hepatomegaly.Although MPS is a rare disorder, it is important to consider the MPS in the differential diagnosis of patients presenting coarse facies, skeletal abnor malities, neurodevelopmental disabilities and hepatomegaly.

Niemann Pick type C disease (NPC, OMIM #257220, #607625) is a severe autosomal recessive neuro visceral disorder characterized by progressive  neurological deterioration and hepatosplenomegaly. The most prominent  biochemical feature is complex lipid storage of free cholesterol and glycoli  pids. Molecular defects in two late endosomal/lysosomal proteins (NPC1 or  NPC2) cause symptoms of NPC.Fifty four Czech and Slovak NPC patiens were diagnosed by histochemical  and biochemical methods. Prevalence based on these data is 1:109,000,  significantly higher than the reported pan ethnic prevalence of 1:150,000. Probands from 37 families were available for molecular genetic analysis. Mutations in NPC2 gene were proved only in one family. Thirty nine pati   ents from 36 families belonging to NPC1 complementation group had highly variable clinical manifestations   from infantile neurological form to adult solely visceral form. By Sanger sequencing we have identified 32 different mutations on 69 NPC1 alleles, 14 of them being novel. MLPA method did not reveal any deletion in NPC1 gene of three patients, in which only one mutation was identified by sequencing. The most common mutations were p.R1186H, p.S954L and p.P1007A (16, 10 and 7 alleles, respectively).In one family an unrelated partner of a carrier was tested during the pre conception genetic counselling for mutations in four exons (18, 19, 20, 23) which encompassed 60% of all identified mutations. Unexpectedly, recur rent mutation p. P1007A (exon 20) was identified.

Mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS) are a group of inherited metabolic disorders characterized by the deficient activity of catabolic enzymes in the lysosomes  and its consequent abnormal accumulation of deposits of glycosaminogly   cans (GAGs). The lysosomal dysfuction caused by this irregular storage is  responsible for the clinical manifestations seen in MPS. Once the lysosome is also important for normal functioning of the immune  system, playing a key role in the expression of cellular membrane receptors, the presentation of antigens, the secretion of cytokines and phagocytosis, we presume that these processes may be impaired in patients with MPS. The presence of recurrent respiratory infections in these individuals may be a clinical clue of the immune dysregulation in MPS.We studied the leukocyte oxidative burst activity and chemotactic function of neutrophilic granulocytes and phagocytic activity and expression of miel operoxidase in phagocytes by flow cytometric immunoassay of 15 patients with MPS types I, II, IV and VI.All patients demonstrated normal phagocytic activity and normal chemot actic function of neutrophilic granulocytes.

All alleles, except for a nonsense mutation, show some residual activity (as shown both by growth and CoQ6 content analysis); analysis of the CoQ/DemetoxyCoQ ratio in the mutants did not detect an altered ratio (as in the case of COQ2 mutations) suggesting that the mutations affect only COQ6 ca talytic activity but not the structure of the entire CoQ biosynthetic complex.Together these data show that all patients thus far identified still retain some residual endogenous CoQ biosynthesis, supporting the notion that complete lack of CoQ biosynthesis is embryonically lethal.",2012
MECP2 related disorders and molecular investigation: Iranian aspect,P13.46,"J. Dadgar1, A. Arastehkani1, S. Dadgar1, O. Aryani1, M.

MECP2 related disorders include classic Rett syndrome, variant or atypical Rett syndrome, and mild learning disabilities in females and neonatal ence  phalopathy and mental retardation syndromes in males. Classic Rett syn  drome is a progressive neurologic disorder in girls characterized by normal birth and apparently normal psychomotor development during the first six  to 18 months of life. The girls then enter a short period of developmental  stagnation followed by rapid regression in language and motor skills. Fema les with classic Rett syndrome typically survive into adulthood, but the inci dence of sudden, unexplained death is significantly higher than in controls  of similar age. Atypical Rett syndrome is increasingly observed as MECP2  mutations have been identified in individuals previously diagnosed with au   tism, mild learning disability, clinically suspected but molecularly unconfir   med Angelman syndrome, or mental retardation with spasticity or tremor.In this study PCR and whole MECP2 gene sequencing was performed in 57 cases clinically suspected to RETT syndrom. The result showed five repor   ted mutations in 7 patients. Two of them had C>T (Arg 168 Term), the other two patients showed C>T (Gln 406 Term) and each of these alterations C>T (Arg 106 Trp), C>T (Arg 270 Term), G>A (Val 288 Met) were found in 1 pati   ents, respectively.

Currently,  more than 370 mutations are known in the disease related ATP7B gene  (OMIM#606882). However, standard investigations to diagnose WD occa  sionally fail, e.g. disease causing ATP7B mutations sometimes remain unde  tected by direct sequencing.We therefore aimed to evaluate quantification of ATP7B mRNA as a new tool  to improve WD diagnostics.Methods: Total RNA was extracted from snap frozen and from FFPE liver  tissue. After cDNA synthesis, real time PCR was performed using HybPro bes and TATA Box binding protein (TBP) as reference gene. Expression de   termination was done by calibrator normalized relative quantification with efficiency correction. ATP7B expression of 12 snap frozen liver specimens  from WD patients was compared to that of 22 patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), 9 patients with biliary atresia, 8 clinically healthy donors and 12 patients with other liver diseases. Furthermore, ATP7B expression  in FFPE liver tissue from 8 WD patients was compared to that of 4 hepatitis B and 5 biliary atresia patients.Results: ATP7B mRNA expression in snap frozen liver tissue from WD  patients was significantly lower (median 1.7) than in the control groups (median: HCC 5.3; biliary atresia 4.9; healthy 7.4; other 6.5). Comparable results were found in FFPE tissue (median: WD 1.08; hepatitis B 3.50; bili   ary atresia 2.65).Conclusion: Our findings suggest that quantification of ATP7B mRNA provi  de a novel tool for the diagnosis of WD in patients where no ATP7B mutation  is found.

Ast","Department of Human Molecular Genetics and Biochemistry, Sackler Faculty of Medicine, Tel Aviv University, Ramat Aviv, Israel","Familial Dysautonomia (FD) is an autosomal recessive congenital neuropa thy that occurs almost exclusively in the Ashkenazi Jewish population. The major mutation leading to FD is a T to C mutation at position 6 of intron 20 of the IKBKAP  gene; this mutation causes aberrant splicing of the IKB  KAP  gene product in a tissue specific manner and reduces production of the  IKAP protein in the nervous system. The aim of this study was to establish a humanized IKBKAP  knock in mouse model that exhibits some of the charac  teristics of the human FD disease such as alternative splicing of exon 20 of IKBKAP gene. We established two homozygous humanized mice strains car  rying human exon20 and its two flanking introns: one possesses the FD mu tation and the other one lacks it. The IKBKAP FDloxP/FDloxP mouse demonstrates  a unique tissue specific alternative splicing pattern of the IKBKAP  gene. We also generated two other humanized knock in mice strains similar to the strain described above except that they contain a Neomycin cassette in  intron 20.

This absence causes loss of repression of metabotropic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR5) mediated pathways resulting in the behavioral and cognitive im pairments associated with FXS. In a randomized, double blind trial it was recently demonstrated a beneficial effect of AFQ056, a selective inhibitor of metabotrobic glutamate receptor type 5 (mGluR5), on fully methylated FXS patients respect to partially methylated FXS ones. To determine whether AFQ056 may have secondary effects on the methylation and transcription of FMR1, here we treated three FXS lymphoblastoid cell lines and one normal control male line. A quantitative RT PCR was performed to assess transcrip tional reactivation of the FMR1 gene. To assess the methylation status of the FMR1 gene promoter it was carried out a bisulphite sequencing analy   sis.

Introduction and Objectives:Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) is a neurodevelopmental disorder affecting intel  ligence and behaviour.The treatments available today are unable to norma  lize these symptoms. We demonstrated that an excess of oxidative stress is present in FXS mouse brain and a treatment with antioxidants could reverse  hallmarks of the FXS mouse phenotype. We propose a combination of ascor   bic acid and alpha tocopherol to improve learning abilities in young male  patients.Material and Methods: Phase II randomized placebo controlled double blind pilot clinical trial to  treat 30 selected FX male patients(15 treated patients and 15 in placebo) in two groups: A:6 to 12 and B:13 to 18 year olds. Mean age (SD) 11.67 (4.20)  [treated subgroup: 12.13 (3.44); placebo subgroup: 11.71 (4.86)]. A questionnaire to evaluate clinical data and neuropsychological tests was performed at the beginning of the trial (T0) and at 12 weeks of placebo ver   sus treatment (T1). The principal variable: the Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children (WISC R) tested by simple linear regression (p<0.05). Results: Significant improvements in direct scores in total manipulative and total verbal subscales were observed in young patients compared to the placebo group only when they were not taking psychoactive medication.Conclusions:Clinical trials for Fragile X Syndrome are necessary due to the absence of effective therapies and the side effects of available psychopharmacological treatments.

FRDA is typically diagnosed by identifying GAA repeat expansi ons, or mutations, in FXN that cause reduced frataxin expression. We de   scribe a Luminex immunoassay to measure frataxin in whole blood (WB) and dried blood spots (DBS) for population screening and therapeutic moni toring of FRDA. In addition we adapted this assay to a MesoScale Discovery platform and completed an initial screen of a Library of Pharmogologically Active Compounds (LOPAC 1280) in FRDA patient cells. Results: Recovery for frataxin is 99% from WB and DBS. Intra assay imprecision is 4.9 13% CV and inter assay imprecision is 9.8 15.8% CV. The LOD is 0.07 ng/mL and reportable range is 2 200 ng/mL. The reference range for adult and pedia tric normals is 15 82 ng/mL (median: 33) for DBS and WB. FRDA carriers (n,30) have frataxin levels of 12 30 ng/mL (median: 18) and FRDA patients (n,82) of <26 mg/mL (median: 6). Frataxin was stable for over 6 months at 22Â°C, 4Â°C and  70Â°C. An initial screen of LOPAC 1280 has yet to uncover a positive hit but it also has not provided evidence that EPO, pentamidine, or bisbenzimide enhance frataxin expression as observed by others in dif   ferent experimental settings. Conclusions: We validated a high throughput assay for frataxin that is applicable to diagnosis and population screening and modified the method for FRDA drug discovery.

Since mitochondrial dysfunction also plays a prominent role in Huntington disease (HD), we evaluated its effects on the behavioral and neu ropathological phenotype of the BACHD rat, a full length mutant huntingtin (mhtt) model of HD. Behavioral observations were carried out during a 12 months study period and neuropathology was investigated subsequently. BACHD rats displayed clasping behavior and had severe problems to run on a rotating rod already at 6 weeks of age, indicating early onset motor dys function. A simple swimming test carried out at 8 months of age revealed a deficit in reversal learning. Furthermore, BACHD rats showed metabolic ab   normalities, deteriorating with disease progression. However, no difference was found between rats treated with olesoxime and untreated rats. NMRI revealed a specific reduction in cerebral and not cerebellar volume in the BACHD rats. Immunostaining of brain slices further showed cytoplasmic ag gregation and intranuclear accumulation of mhtt in most cerebral brain re gions as well as a decreased width of axonal bundles within the corpus stria tum. Treatment with olesoxime increased overall brain volume in BACHD but also in wild type rats, and by trend reduced nuclear mhtt accumulations within the prelimbic cortex. It remains unclear, how olesoxime exerts these effects and whether there is an interaction between olesoxime and mhtt.

Identification of genetic factors is essential in op  timizing the individual treatment in IBD patients. In the metabolism of thio  purines besides well established thiopurine methyltransferase, also other enzymes as inosine triphosphate pyrophosphohydrolase (ITPase) and xan thine oxidase (XO) are involved, which are encoded by ITPA and XDH genes.  Two sequence variations in the ITPA gene have been described as associated  with ITPase deficiency (P32T , IVS2+21A>C).

We established pyrosequencing method. We tested 91 of Polish IBD patients treated with thiopurine drugs, where 11 did not have any therapeutic effect of thiopurine treatment and where adverse drug  reactions existed. Allele frequencies estimated in our study for ITPA gene  were lower to the determined in other Caucasian populations. Allele P32T was identified with frequency of 4.95%. The frequency of IVS2+21A>C al   lele was 8.24%. Investigated alleles in the XDH gene were not observed in  this study group of Polish IBD patients and in 200 healthy Polish individuals  additionally, what suggested probably no role of this alleles on thiopurine metabolism in the Polish population.",2012
 The effect of losartan on the TGF beta pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells of patients with bicuspid and thoracic aortic aneurysms,P14.13,"G. Belge1, A. Radtke2, R. Nimzyk1, M. Kirkgoez2, J.

Mohamed2","1Center for Humangenetics, Bremen, Germany, 2Department of Cardiac Surgery,  University of Schleswig Holstein Campus Luebeck, Luebeck, Germany, Luebeck, Germany","Introduction  The renin angiotensin system is believed to participate in  the development of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAA) by targeting the TGF  beta pathway. Blockade of the renin angiotensin system by the angiotensin II Type 1 receptor (AT 1) antagonist, losartan, has been shown to prevent  aneurysm growth in Marfan syndrome. We therefore aimed to investigate the effect of losartan on the TGF beta pathway in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSCM).Methods and Results Aortic cells were cultivated and characterized as VSCM. The cells were grown to 80 percent confluency and incubated in serum free media for 24 h. Next, 1 ÂµM losartan was added to the media fol lowed by incubation for 24 h. The cellular RNA was extracted, reverse tran scribed into cDNA, and the expression of 84 genes related to the TGF beta pathway quantified using the RT 2 Profiler PCR Array from Qiagen. Several  genes related to the TGF beta pathway demonstrated significant changes in expression after losartan treatment, although none of these changes were above two fold. Among these were Edoglin ( 1.14, p , 0.005), SOX4 ( 1.25, p  , 0.006), and CDC25A  ( 1.24, p , 0.0008).   Discussion Our study revealed the complex relationship between the renin  angiotensin system and the TGF beta pathway in aortic smooth muscle cells. The relatively mild changes in gene expression may indicate that the losar tan dosage used is not sufficient to fully antagonize the AT 1 receptor in VSMC  obtained from bicuspid aneurysmal tissue.",2012

Marfan patients require specialized interdis   ciplinary care for optimal out come and life quality. We study the efficacy  and tolerability of angiotensin II receptor blockade Losartan to prevent pro gressive dilation of aortic root and dissection in other parts of the aorta in patients with Marfan syndrome operated on aneurysms of ascending aorta.Methods. We examined 41 patients with Marfan syndrome after aortic valve www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012355 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters replacing root operations. All patients are meeting strict diagnostic criteria  for Marfan syndrome based on the original Ghent nosology and underwent  aortic valve replacing root operations. We collected clinical data, biological  samples (DNA/blood samples, aorta/valve tissues), and echocardiographic. We make two groups: one treated and one non treated with losartan. Results. In the 20 patients who received losartan experienced better control  of blood pressure during the day, previously normalized clinical parameters,  quality of life, none of the patients did not require repeat surgery. The chan ges in aortic distensibility and cross sectional compliance were similar bet   ween the two groups. Mean aortic diameter increased 0.5 mm/year, while in patients who have not received losartan 1.6 mm/year. Left ventricular function was better in patients treated with losartan. Conclusions. The results of this clinical study could lead to profound modi   fication of the management of aortic risk and complications in patients with  Marfan syndrome. The uniqueness in our study is related to the fact that the  additive effect of losartan evaluated in patients with Marfan syndrome who  have already undergone surgery.",2012

In the last few decades, transplantation of  neural like cells derived from stem cells has been carried out as a potenti  al treatment for neurodegenerative diseases. The potential success of the transplantation process, however, depends on the functional activity of the  grafted cells in their new environment. Bone marrow stromal cells (BMSCs)  which are capable of differentiating into neural cells, has been employed for cell and gene therapy of neurodegenerative diseases. Neurotrophin 3 (NT 3) is a member of the neurotrophin family of growth factors, best cha  racterized by its survival  and differentiation inducing effects on developing  neurons.Our previous studies revealed that BMSCs do not express NT 3 and its receptor, TrkC, either before or after differentiation into neural like cells.  Since during the development of the brain, NT 3 expresses earlier than other  NTs, we used electroporation technique to introduce NT 3 and TrkC genes into the BMSCs by pDsRed N1 and pCMV vector, respectively. PDsRed N1 is  a mammalian expression vector that encodes a variant of red fluorescent  protein. Vectors transformed into E coli DH5Î±. Expression of NT 3 and TrkC  confirmed using fluorescence microscopy and RT PCR method. Our results  showed that BMSCs have the potential for being genetically manipulated and electroporation can serve as a fast, easy, and efficient method for it.

We hypothesized that due to their multipotency human mesenchymal stroma cells (hMSC) could be more easily reprogrammed than other somatic cells. Therefore, we investigated whether cultivation of MSCs under hypoxic culture conditions, known to support pluripotency in embryonic stem (ES) cells, would suffice to induce pluripotency in MSCs. In particular we analysed the expression of pluripo tency associated genes and the microRNAs (miRs) 302, specific for pluri potent embryonic stem cells, as parameter for reprogramming. Therefore primary human MSCs obtained from bone marrow aspirates and the MSC cell line L87 were cultured under hypoxic (5%O 2) and normoxic (20%O2)  culture conditions with and without FGF2 supplementation. We found that under hypoxic culture condition in the presence of FGF2, MSCs showed hig her proliferative capacities and decreased senescence. FGF2 induced OCT4  and NANOG analyzed by real time RT PCR. In combination with hypoxia this  effect was potentiated. If not already present, KLF4 and c MYC  were likewi  se induced. Most importantly, in contrast to many retroviral methods, the combination of hypoxia and FGF2 led to an induction of the miR302 cluster similar to that found in ES cells leading to the repression of their predicted targets at day 14. In summary, we showed that hypoxia is a safe, easily appli   cable and sufficient tool to induce pluripotency associated genes and miRs in multipotent MSCs. This may serve as a first step to generate clinical grade iPS cells.

Mitochondriopathies are inherited metabolic disorders with a severe clini  cal phenotype affecting different organ systems. A majority of them affect  the respiratory chain and the cellular ATP production but even these clinical  manifestations are highly variable, extending from early childhood encepha lopathies to adult onset myopathies. In spite of rapid progress identifying  the molecular cause, curative therapeutic options are barely available. Ba   stin et al. (2008) and Wenz at al. (2008) provided evidence from in vitro stu  dies and mouse models that activation of the PPAR/PGC 1 alpha pathway with bezafibrate could be a new therapeutic approach. In order to verify  this effect, we collected 28 fibroblast cell lines from patients with isolated  complex I deficiency and a defined molecular diagnosis. The complex I ac tivity in patient fibroblasts ranged from 10% to 80% compared to controls. Bezafibrate treatment led to significant improvement of complex I activity in more than 50% of the cell lines. In a subgroup of 13 cell lines, the treatment effect was additionally analyzed on genome wide expression levels, reve aling increased expression of genes involved in lipid and fatty acid metabo   lism and transport. In 5 cell lines which responded to bezafibrate treatment with significant increase of complex I activity, we found increased amounts of complex I assembled in supercomplexes by two dimensional blue native SDS PAGE experiments. These results support bezafibrate as a promising treatment option in a well defined subgroup of patients. They have to be verified in other mitochondrial disorders like COX deficiency.",2012

Zabel1, C. Niemeyer1, J. RÃ¶ssler1","1University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany, 2Olgahospital, Stuttgart, Germany","Vascular malformations are common among patients with segmental over   growth disorders. Very recently, a recurrent activating AKT1 mutation was identified in Proteus syndrome lesions and loss of function mutations of PTEN are known to cause SOLAMEN syndrome. Genetically, both aberra tions are predicted to increase downstream phosphoinositide 3 kinase (PI3K) signalling pathway activity. A significant number of patients, howe ver, do not show mutations in either PTEN, or AKT1, and the pathogenesis of hamartomatous tumours and associated vascular malformations remains unresolved. Over the past years, we provided clinical care and molecular diagnosis for patients affected by vascular and hamartomatous tumours. No constitutive PTEN mutation was detected in a cohort of eleven children with segmental overgrowth disorders, mainly classifiable as Proteus, or Proteus like syndrome. Molecular analyses of tumour tissues failed to demonstrate somatic activation of AKT1. Mosaic mutations were neither found in dermal fibroblasts derived from affected regions, nor in vascular malformations, nor in soft tissue tumours. Nevertheless, experimental therapy with mTOR inhibitors was able to induce rapid remission in three of three treated pati   ents, proving efficacy against diverse lesions, including intestinal haeman gioma, intra thoracal lipomatosis, and retro orbital lymphangioma. In view of the poor outcome and high complication rate of surgical approaches, mTOR inhibition therefore holds the promise of a well tolerated first line medical alternative for this group of disorders, regardless of mutational sta tus of proven disease genes. Our results provide clear evidence for genetic heterogeneity in segmental overgrowth disorders, especially in Proteus, and Proteus like syndrome. Preliminary molecular data suggest a common pa thogenic mechanism involving the PI3K/PTEN/AKT/mTOR pathway.",2012

Some mutations allow a significant level of normal splicing (e.g. IVSI 6), leading to thalassaemia intermedia, while others reduce normal splicing to low (e.g. IVSI 110) or very low levels (e.g. IVSI 5 and IVS2 654) and lead to blood transfusion dependency in the homozygote forms.

High resolution melting analysis with snapback primers can be used to genotype all com mon mutations and scan for rare mutations more rapidly and economically. There are 23 common mutations listed by the American College of Medical Genetics and 7 common SNPs in the CFTR gene. Twenty seven CFTR gene exons were amplified in 39 exon/intron fragments due to length conside   rations for some of the exons. High resolution melting was performed on all 39 fragments on the LightScannerÂ® to scan the intramolecular amplicon melting curves for common and rare mutations or SNPs. The twenty exon/intron fragments that may contain common mutations or SNPs were am plified using snapback primers. After scanning, these amplicons were then diluted in H2O to favor intermolecular hybridization, denatured by heating, cooled, then melted again on the LightScannerÂ®. The resulting snapback probe melting peaks detect intra molecular hybridization and identify the genotype at the loci all of common mutations or SNPs. Twenty six CFTR mu tation cell lines from Coriell, 25 pretested CF patient and 80 none patient samples were used for blinded testing. All of the loci of common mutations and SNPs were genotyped correctly by high resolution melting with snap back primers. The method genotyped all but 0.3% samples require sequen   cing.

Background: Molecular diagnostics are increasingly used to guide diagnosis  and therapy of human diseases. The detection of key polymorphic variants/mutations in human genes provides valuable information about diagnosis,  risks or therapeutic regimens.Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive disease which  affects Armenian, Arab, Jewish, Greek, Turkish and Italian populations. Beta  thalassemia (BTAL) is a blood disorder that reduces the production of he moglobin. BTAL is common in Mediterranean countries such as Greece, Italy, Spain, Cyprus, but occurs as well in North Africa, the Middle East, India, and  Eastern Europe. Thrombosis is a blood clot inside a blood vessel, obstruc  ting or stopping the flow of blood through the circulatory system. Thrombo tic diseases are one of the main causes of mortality worldwide. Methods: Pyrosequencing assays were developed targeting key mutations/ polymorphisms in genes associated with thrombosis (Factor II, Factor V,  MTHFR, PAI 1 ), FMF (MEFV) and BTAL (HBB). The important disease related  deletions, insertions, point mutations and polymorphisms in these genes were determined by pyrosequencing. Plasmids coding for FMF, BTAL and thrombosis variants were used to study assay precision.Results: All assays allow flexible, fast and reliable genotyping of the mutati   ons in DNA isolated from whole blood with excellent concordance to Sanger  sequencing. Conclusions: Pyrosequencing was shown to be highly suitable to detect,  identify and quantify important polymorphisms/mutations in human di sease associated genes. The newly developed assays have a significant lo wer turn around time and are easier to interpret raw data compared to the current gold standard Sanger sequencing and maintain the flexibility of a sequencing based method.",2012

The discovery of the molecular defects responsible for these diseases has initiated genetic diagnostics in many countries around the world including the Middle East, Europe, USA, Japan and Australia. However, diverse testing methods and reporting practices are employed, and there is a clear need for consensus guidelines for the HRF genetic testing. Draft guidelines were prepared based on current practice deduced from  previous HRF External Quality Assurance (EQA) schemes and data from the literature. The draft document was disseminated through the EMQN (Eu ropean Molecular genetics Quality Network) for broader consultation and amendment. A workshop was held in Bruges (Belgium) on September 18 and 19, 2011 to ratify the draft into a final consensus document. An agreed set of best practice guidelines was proposed for genetic diagno  stic testing of HRFs, for reporting the genetic results, and for defining their clinical significance.Supported by EU projects EuroGentest (FP6 512148), Eurotraps (FP7 2008 200923), la RÃ©gion Languedoc Roussillon, Eurofever (EAHC, Project 2007332).Associated authors:B Bennetts, F Austrup, I Ceccherini, JM Costa, A De Leener,M Gattorno, U Kania, I Kone Paut, S Lezer, A Livneh, I Moix, R Nishikomo ri, S Ozen, L Phylactou, L Risom, D Rowczenio, T Sarkisian, ME van Gijn, M Witsch Baumgartner, H El Shanti, M Jakobsen, K Konstantopoulos, D Mar torana, MG Pomponi, A Bybee, C Rydlewski, M Morris, HM Hoffm",2012

The aim of this study was  to automate the methods of genetic analysis of mutations: Factor V Leiden,  and F12C46T and rs7025486 of DAB2IP  gene. Methods: DNA extraction  was performed by MagnaPure Compact (Roche). We designed an assay of  TaqMan allelic discrimination by real time PCR 7500 (Applied Biosystem).  Were selected DNA samples from patients (n,50) from whom the mutations were previously genotyped by other assays. Factor V Leiden and F12C46T  mutations were performed by real time PCR with allele specific probes with  the Light Cylcer 2.0 analyzer (Roche). The rs7025486 mutation of DAB2IP   gene (c.18554G>A) was performed by direct sequencing with Analyzer Ge  netic 3500 (Applied Biosystems). Results: We designed assays using real  time PCR 7500 with allele specific Taqman probes in 96 well plate format  samples. In all samples we obtained the same genotype for each mutation  with both methods (sensitivity and specificity of 100 %). However, the automated process by real time PCR ge  notyping plate allows us to analyze a large number of samples in each run (n , 92) including matched controls (n , 4). If this protocol were employed using automated DNA extraction, the full process would last 2 hours until  the report of the results.

To contribute to and update the limited literature available related to this topic, we surveyed 910 human mole cular genetic testing laboratories, of which 291 (32%) from 29 European countries responded. The majority of laboratories were in the public sector (81%), affiliated with a university hospital (60%). Only a minority of labo   ratories were accredited (23%), and 26% were certified. 22% of laborato ries did not participate in external quality assessment and 28% did not use reference materials. The main motivations given for accreditation were to improve laboratory profile (85%) and national recognition (84%). Nearly all respondents (95%) would prefer working in an accredited laboratory. In accredited laboratories, participation in external quality assessment (p<0.0001), use of reference materials (p,0.0014) and availability of con tinuous education on medical/scientific subjects (p,0.023), specific tasks (p,0.0018), and quality assurance (p<0.0001) were significantly higher than in non accredited laboratories. Restriction of the development of new techniques (p,0.023) and the improvement of work satisfaction (p,0.0002) were significantly overestimated by non accredited laboratories. By using a quality implementation score, we showed that accredited laboratories (ave rage score 92) comply better than certified laboratories (average score 69, p<0.001), and certified laboratories better than other laboratories (average score 44, p<0.001), with regard to the implementation of quality indicators. We conclude that quality practices vary widely in European genetic testing laboratories. This leads to a potentially dangerous situation in which the quality of genetic testing is not consistently assured.",2012

Hendrikx1","1CYCLERtest BV, Landgraaf, Netherlands, 2GENOtronics BV, Landgraaf, Netherlands","Validation and verification of PCR methods and procedures before their use in clinical molecular genetic testing is essential for producing correct and clinically relevant results.Over the past decades many validation studies and external quality assess   ments have addressed the difficulties of producing and reproducing PCR, qPCR and HRM molecular diagnostic results. Non consistent PCR results are often attributed to different purities of template DNA and reagents used, but seldomly to variations in thermocycler performance as thermocyclers are perceived as a constant rather than a variable.In this study the thermal performance of over 10.000 thermocyclers has been evaluated. The temperature calibration data show a large spread, both www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012359 www.eshg.orgESHG Posters between and within thermocyclers. This variability is expressed in inconsi   stent, false negative, lower positive or incorrect PCR results. Typically, thermocyclers can not be adjusted and therefore solutions must  be sought to deal with this variability in the design and validation of PCR assays. Currently, accredited laboratories consider PCR assays as sufficiently  validated when an empirical validation study on a limited number of ther   mocyclers has produced comparable results. However, the large variability  as measured during this study reveals the severely underestimated risk of using limited numbers of thermocyclers for empirical validation studies.  Through this detailed study we have generated guidelines for easy, straight  forward, analytical validation of PCR based molecular genetic tests.

Research Group, Istanbul, Turkey. Spinal muscular atrophy is a hereditary motor neuron disease characterized  by proximal muscle weakness due to degeneration of the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord. Approximately 94% of patients with SMA reveal homo   zygous absence of the SMN1 gene. However, small intragenic mutations are  not detected by SMN1 gene dosage analysis and the presence of two normal  SMN1  copies on one chromosome 5 can mask a deletion of SMN1  on the  other chromosome 5 (carrier). Subsequently, de novo mutation rate is re  latively high. Accurate risk assessment and clinical genetic counseling are particularly important due to the genetic complexity and high SMA carrier frequency. This external quality assessment scheme was designed to assess laboratoriesâ abilities to correctly genotype cases suspected of having SMA and to identify carriers of SMA. Each year three DNA samples (accompanied by mock clinical information) were distributed to approximately 70 labora tories from more than 30 countries after validation of the SMN1 and SMN2   gene copy numbers. Each laboratory sent in their written reports, usually accompanied by raw lab data. Each of the written reports is marked for ge notyping and subsequent interpretation according to predetermined eva luation criteria. Most laboratories used MLPA to quantify SMN1  gene copy  number for diagnostic and carrier analysis. The genotyping error rate has in creased concomitant to a decreased number of labs with full interpretation score. A full report of the results of the SMA schemes and recommendations for best practice guidelines for molecular analysis of SMA are presented.

Were analyzed data regarding  ultrasound examination, nuchal translucency, outflow tracts, biochemical  screening, double test, fetal karyotype in the second trimester of pregnan  cy.Results: Prenatal diagnosis identified severe fetal pathologies to pregnant women. Chromosomal abnormalities spontaneously occur, regardless of  degree of genetic risk, as an outcome of ,,de novoâ mutations. Diagnosis of  chromosomal abnormalities to fetuses by cytogenetic methods (amniocen tesis) contributed to the detection of deviations in fetal karyotype before  their birth.

Applying this technology to a population would produce the same benefits, in addition to saving already scarce health resources. The objective of this study is to review what has been researched and published in the fields of pharmaco genomics and public health, regarding how the two sciences can construc tively intersect. Literature addressing pharmacogenomics in terms of glo bal burden infectious diseases, public health initiatives, and public policy were researched in the PubMed database. Six major themes were identified and further discussed: interactions between public health and pharmaco genomics, pharmacogenomics and drugs, pharmacogenomics and diseases, benefits of including pharmacogenomics in public health policy, keys for implementing pharmacogenomics into public health policy, and points for consideration. Pharmacogenomics can prove to be a beneficial addition to a public health policy by maximizing therapeutic benefits, decreasing adverse drug reactions, and allowing for a better allocation of resources. Indirect health benefits can also be realized through economic advantages and in ternational collaboration. The pharmacogenomics research surrounding major infectious diseases (malaria, tuberculosis, and HIV/AIDS) is limited, although important discoveries have been made. The implementation of this information and its implications are far reaching, and deserve extensive consideration.

This study has evaluated the effect  of gene and gene mutations in the mu opioid receptor (MOR). One of the most important genes involved in addiction is the mu opioid receptor (MOR)  gene located on the human chromosome number 6. This gene has multip   le exons including exon number 3. Various mutations have been detected  in this exon which are involved in the effects of MOR gene. This study has investigated the presence of single nucleotide polymorphisms in the exon  3 of MOR gene in Iranian people. 213 male and female individuals divided  into two groups of addicted and non addicted subjects participated in the study. After preparing blood samples from subjects, DNA was extracted with  G DEX kit. MOR gene exon 3 was amplified with thermocycler equipment.  PCR products were sequenced. And analysis by DNA MAN software, a 877 G>A mutation and 759 C>T mutation was detected. Both of these samples  were belonged to non addicted male subjects. Furthermore, in addicted, a  1043 G>C mutation was found. After analysis by x2 analysis. no significant  relationship between addiction and genotype and significant relationship  between addiction and sex was obtained(P<0.05). This is the time which 1043 G>C mutation has been reported in Iran.",2012

Comprised oxidative phosphorylation leads to progressive hepatoencephalopathy manifesting in severe, often intractable seizures, myocloni and stroke like episodes, psy   chomotor regression and variable hepatic dysfunction. Symptoms usually appear following normal early development, initial symptoms are often infection induced. The phenotypic spectrum associated with POLG1 muta   tions is very heterogeneous, even intrafamilial phenotypic variablity is ob served.We present a case of a 19 months old boy in whom myocloni, lethargy and elevated liver enzymes following a viral infection and a positive family hi story raised the possibility of Alpers syndrome. His sister died at 18 months after an adenoviral infection provoked fulminant hepatoencephalopathy, however, no diagnosis was achived at that time. POLG1 mutation analyis  in our patient revealed compound heterozygosity for the common c.1399 G>A (p.Ala467Thr) mutation and a novel, so far unpublished missense mu tation, c.3589 T>C (p.Cys1127Arg) in the polymerase domain. During the 11 months of follow up no progression or neurologic deterioration and no hepatopathy has been observed in our patient, despite abnormal EEG fin dings. The fulminant course in his sister might have been precipitated by several environmental factors, including valproate therapy and adenovirus infection.Our case points to the difficulty of phenotype genotype correlation in POLG1  mutation associated disorders. We recommend investigation of mtDNA de   pletion and multiple deletions from muscle tissue and analysis of the POLG1  gene in all children with progressive neurodegeneration accompanied by episodic, therapy resistent epilepsy and hepatic involvement.",2012

Lacassie,"Department of Pediatrics, Louisiana State University Health Sciences Center and Childrenâs Hospital, New Orleans, LA, United States","The major goal of clinical evaluation in genetics is to establish the etiological diagnosis, the cornerstone for providing genetic counseling. Historically, the percentage of diagnoses established by geneticists has been low compared to other medical specialties in which a phenotypic diagnosis may be enough. With the recent advent of microarray based comparative genomic hybridi   zation (aCGH) which allows the rapid detection of submicroscopic genomic deletions and duplications, the number of etiological diagnoses established has progressively increased. However, there are many old and new diagno stic problems, frequently neglected, that contribute to make it difficult to establish the diagnosis.At the Latin American Association of Genetics (ALAG)âs meeting in Mexico in 1994, we first presented a classification delineating four groups of pro blems. For teaching and educational purposes, we recognized problems due to the patient, the disease, the observer, and the environment. This systematic review and illustration of different diagnostic problems creates awareness and improves the effectiveness of medical practice. With the new technologies, big advances have been made but also new problems have been recognized. In 2008 this classification was expanded to include a fifth group: problems of informatic due to the interpretation of microarray (aCGH) results mainly secondary to the incomplete knowledge about CNV and phenotype genotype correlation. The application of aCGH to diagnosis is evolving and requires intense communication among clinical geneticists and the laboratory specialists about their specific clinical queries or trou blesome cases.

The prevalence is estimated at 1:50,000 and seems to be higher in males (male/female ratio 1.5:1).We present a clinical study of 9 cases of HME (6 male and 3 female) dia gnosed in our Medical Genetics Center, to discuss suggestive features, par ticularities, long term follow up, management and genetic counseling. This exploratory descriptive aims also to study the impact on daily living activi ties and quality of life.According to literature, most commonly involved bones are the femur(30%), radius/ulna(26%), tibia(20%) and fibula (13%). Hand deformity, resulting from shortened metacarpals, is common. Axial sites, such as the pelvis, sca pula, ribs and spine are more commonly the location of degeneration of osteochondromas to chondrosarcoma.In our study exostoses are present in all patients. The most frequently invol ved bones were tibia and fibula   6 cases (66.7%), ribs and scapula 4 cases (44.4%), humerus, radius/ulna and fist 3 cases (33.3%), the femur and knee are affected in 2 cases (22.2%), the spine and elbow in 1 case (11.1%). 3 cases were familial. No tumoral degeneration was identified.Other associated anomalies are: scoliosis, lower back pain, moderate pec tus excavatum, tumefaction of the elbow joint, brachydactyly, clinodactyly of fifth finger, long fourth finger, genu valgum.In conclusion, we present the clinical study of 9 illustrative HME cases, discussing particularities and consequences on daily living and quality of life, as well as management and genetic counseling issues.

Introduction: The absence or the incomplete cleavage of prosencephalon into diencepha   lon and telencephalon in the 4 8 th weeks of fetal life, leads to holoprosen   cephaly. This is often associated with severe facial anomalies, microcephaly, hipertelorism and labio palatine clefting. There are multiple and various genetic implications (chromosomal deleti  ons 2p21; 7q36; trisomy 13) which are associated with multiple environ mental factors.In this paper the authors aim to process the clinical and imagistic data resul  ted from the study of 4 clinical cases. Material and method:The study lot consisted of 4 newborn: 3 on term newborn with GA (gestatio  nal age), 39 40 weeks and BW (birth weight), 3500 4000 g and 1 new born  with IUGR (intrauterine growth restriction).On term newborn presented labio palatine clefting; two of them presented  cardiac malformations (Atrial septal defect and Ventricular septal defect);  they were classified as having Semilobar Holoprosencephaly.Newborn diagnosed with Semilobar Holoprosencephaly had altered pheno type: hipertelorism (2 clinical cases); labio palatine clefting (3 clinical ca  ses); micrognathia; flattened nose and upper implanted ear. Cranial ultrasound and MRI showed anomalies of the interhemisferic split, agenesis of the posterior region of corpus callosum, various degrees of fusi   on of the lateral ventricles, the absence of cavum septum pellucida.Conclusions:Semilobar Holoprosencephaly is a severe form of illness due to the brain malformation which determines growth anomalies and severe neurological retardation.",2012

The etiology is heterogeneous and complex, as this developmental disorder can be due to environmental factors, chromosomal aberrations, or genetic anomalies. SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF genes are the four major genes implicated in the susceptibility to HPE, but have only been found to explain 25% of the ge netic cases, including mutations and microdeletion. We analyzed a cohort 26 individuals within the holoprosencephaly spectrum thought Multiplex Ligation Dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique using P187 Ho   loprosencephaly Kit (MRHC HollandÂ®). All individuals have been previous   ly analyzed for mutation in SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF genes. We found one case with deletion in SHH gene. Numerous isolated HPE case reported have shown that most of the chromosomes have been implicated, emphasizing the genetic heterogeneity of HPE. Considering this multigenic aspect of the disease, investigation of HPE loci and identification of new HPE genes must be continued. Mutations and deletions in HPE genes do not always lead to physical signs of HPE, however this information may be helpful for genetic counseling purposes.Grants: Fapesp nÂ° 2010/18740 2",2012

Hundred of mutations in a vast number of disease genes could be identified. However, most data were established using well defined study populations. In contrast, only few data are available about routine patients without study based preselection bias.Materials and methods: We studied n,104 consecutive patients with HCM and n,22 cases with DCM. In HCM a panel of the most frequent disease genes MYH7, MYBPC3, TNNT2, and TNNI3 encoding for Ã myosin heavy chain, myosin binding protein C, cardiac troponin T and cardiac troponin I respectively, were analyzed using direct terminatorsequencing technology (ABI BigDye Terminatorv1; 3130 XL). In DCM a panel of the most frequent  disease genes LMNA (encoding for Lamin A/C), MYBPC3, MYH7 and TNNT2 respectively, underwent analyses.Results: In HCM of 104 pts in n,54 pts (52%) using the HCM diagnostic pa nel a mutation in one of the disease genes could be found, whereas in DCM of  22 pts in n,3 pts (14%) using the DCM diagnostic panel could be det ected. Conclusions: In molecular diagnostics of serial HCM and DCM patients  using specific panels of the most frequent disease genes in HCM more than  a half of all patients and in DCM more than 10% of all cases could be geno  typed positively. This is comparable to study based data.

IntroductionNeurofibromatosis type I is typically an autosomal dominant inherited dis   order with complete penetrance and variable expressivity, generated by the neurofibromin mutation, a tumor suppressor gene located on chromosome 17q11.2.50% of the cases are mutations de novo, with no other affected family mem bers. Somatic mosaicism accounts for many sporadic cases.The classic NF1 is characterized by multiple neuro fibromatous tumors, in cluding the plexiform neurofibroma, cafe au lait spots, freckling of the groin or the axilla, Lisch nodules in the eye and skeletal abnormalities.The patients have increased susceptibility to develop other benign or mali   gnant tumors, so they need regular follow up to detect malignant degenera tion, an early recurrence or appearance of other manifestations.A particular aspect is described in some patients, presenting only one clini cal criterion of diagnostic, possibly generated by a mosaic form and having, in this situation, serious implications for the patientâs evolution and its fa mily.Case presentationA 29 years old male was hospitalized for a large tumor located on the right hemi tongue. There were no other clinical findings in physical examination. The pathological personal antecedents and the family history were negati ve.Histological examination demonstrated the presence of a lingual plexiform neurofibroma.ConclusionDespite their occurrence in the head and neck region, neural sheath tumors are rare in the oral cavity; oral manifestations are reported much often in patients affected by neurofibromatosis.Because of this, we think our patient may present a form of mosaicism and needs genetic testing for NF1 mutations, considering the possible implica   tions.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012367 www.eshg.orgESHG Published Abstract",2012

Mucopolysaccharidosis II, Hunter syndrome (MPS II, OMIM 309900, Xq28,  IDS, OMIM 300823), is a rare disorder caused by deficiency of the lysosomal enzyme iduronate sulfatase ((EC 3.1.6.13), leading to progressive accumu   lation of glycosaminoglucans in nearly all cell types, tissues, and organs. We reported on this case of HS in EJHG, v.11, Suppl 1, P . 166, 2003. Now proband is 18 yr aged. His intelligence is normal and the youth is the tenth grader of  a comprehensive school. Proband has progressive coarsening of facial fea  tures, short stature (124cm) and underweight (32kg), skeletal deformities  of thorax and feet, protuberant abdomen, hypermetropic astigmatism (S,D), chronic purulent ethmoiditis, cerebral ventricular dilation, cardiac valvular disease (myxomatosis of mitral valve and mitral regurgitation, cardiomyo  pathy), hepatosplenomegaly. Joint mobility is decreased, and the fingers  have clawlike deformities. Laboratory findings and imaging studies were  found to show moderate abnormalities. Unilateral auditory prosthetics was made. Care for our patient with HS involves a multidisciplinary approach and includes pediatrician, neurologist, orthopedist, otolaryngologist, oph  thalmologist, geneticist etc. To our regret ERT was not available.",2012
 Novel mutations detected in the NF1 gene,J02.29,"F. Joncourt, S. Gallati","Division of Human Genetics, University Hospital, Bern, Switzerland","Mutations in the NF1 gene are the cause of Neurofibromatosis type1, the most common tumor predisposing disorder in humans. As the mutation rate in the NF1 gene is among the highest known, analysis of the NF1 gene conti nues to reveal novel mutations in many patients. Because of the large size of the gene, the lack of a mutation hot spot and the diversity of pathogenic mu tations found NF1 analyses have long been laborious and sometimes yielded unsatisfactory results. Newer techniques are more efficient and allow detec tion of a causative mutation in the great majority of NF1 patients. We report on 7 novel NF1 mutations not yet described in the HGMD mutation database (version 9.12.2011). Among them a spectrum of different mutation types was found: 3 splice site mutations, caused by a small deletion (c.654+2delT), a duplication (c.2325+1dupG) and a base change (c.7126+1G>A) respective ly, all concerning splice site consensus sequence positions. Furthermore we detected 2 missense mutations (c.3503G>A, c.6718C>T), 1 nonsense muta   tion (c.4720C>T) and 1 duplication leading to a frameshift (c.6676dupA). Two of the patients were adults, for whom genetic analysis served the con firmation of the clinical diagnosis. The patients who benefit most from the ameliorated mutation detection, however, are young patients with only little clinical manifestations and hence uncertain diagnosis. This was the case for five of the patients, who at the time of diagnosis were 11 years old (1 pati   ent) or younger than two years (4 patients).",2012

We describe the phenotypic and genetic variations in 39 Greek NF1 pati   ents and point out the significance of early genetic testing, aged 7 months to  34 years (21 males/18 females).13 patients underwent molecular analysis  of the NF1 by cDNA sequencing of all exons and were found positive, 6 of  them were younger than four years. If no mutation was detected the pre  sence/absence of deletions was verified by MLPA. Our patients presented the following NF1 clinical features: cafÃ© au lait spots in 34/39, two or more  neurofibromas in 15/39, axillary or inguinal freckling in 9/39, optic glioma  in 2/39, two or more Lisch nodules in 5/39, bony lesions in 13/39 and a first degree relative affected with NF1 in 15/39. 5/39 patients had tumors  (except neurofibromas) and mental retardation presented in 7/39 individu  als older than 3 years. 15/39 patients had abnormalities in the brain MRI. 4/13 patients analyzed, carried novel mutations, 4/13 had missense, 2/13  frameshift, 6/13 nonsense and 1/13 a large deletion.

Methods: Nine girls diagnosed with TS that received  treatment with GH for at least 2 years. We evaluated differences in height standard deviation score (HSDS), at baseline, at one and two years from ba   seline; and pubertal stage development in patients with or without estrogen therapy. Results: Median age was 12.1+/ 3.7 years. Chromosomal analysis  revealed six girls (66%) with pure 45X monosomy, while 3 (33%) had mo saic form. The patients had a baseline mean HSDS, 3.29Â±0.65. After 2 years of GH treatment only one patient achieved HSDS> 2 value for normal girls. Mean difference in HSDS after 1 year was 0.27+/ 0.31; after 2 years it was  0.17+/ 0.22 (p,0.047). Regarding estrogen replacement therapy: two pa tients from study did not reach puberty onset age; four of them had spon taneous puberty without treatment; two girls responded well to estrogen therapy, while one did not. We found weak correlations between pure mo nosomy and the necessity for estrogen therapy (r,0.5;p,0.17) and between pure monosomy and mean HSDS difference after 2 years with GH (r, 0.35; p,0.34).  Conclusions: Results showed great variability in treatment re  sponse in girls with TS, in both GH and estrogen treatment, which could not be strongly correlated with karyotype. Larger studies are needed to assess these important correlations that could guide therapy for these patients in the future.",2012

INTRODUCTION Some mutations in the desmoplakin gene generate an autosomal dominant  inheritance pattern related to the involvement of the left ventricle (LV) in  ARVC.METHODS It has made the study of 28 patients (14 women and 14 males), belonging to  3 families affected by ARVC. This cohort was obtained from a screening of 64 ARVC patients. The analysis of the 28 individuals was performed by sequen   cing of exons and flanking intronic regions for the DSP gene. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS We found a gene variant (Q447X) that is a heterozygous nonsense type not previously described. Is a C to T transition that generates a stop codon re  sulting in a peptide 85% smaller than the wild type and an autosomal do   minant inheritance pattern with high penetrance (91%). In most cases, stop  codon mutations are disease cause. Eleven of the 28 studied patients were mutation carriers and ten of them  were affected by ARVC. The rest were healthy patients. The eleven carrier patients consisted of eight women and three men.The amino acid 447 is located in one of the globular head domains of des   moplakin to participate in the binding of this protein with plakoglobin and plakophilin. It is noteworthy that several mutations in this gene have been associated with the development of arrhythmogenic left ventricular domi   nance and even isolated involvement of the ventricle and simulating idiopa thic dilated cardiomyopathy. We conclude this gene variant Q447X could be possibly the cause of ARVC with predominant LV.",2012

INTRODUCTIONThrough genetic screening of dilated cardiomyopathy patients, we identi fied a previously described deletion of arginine 14 (PLN R14Del).METHODSNine individuals were evaluated using dHPLC and bidirectional sequencing of the exon and intron regions flanking the PLN gene.RESUL TSSeven of the nine patients studied were mutation carriers although only two of them met diagnostic criteria of dilated cardiomyopathy: the proband and her asymptomatic maternal grandmother. Five carriersÂ´s ECG showed strikingly low voltage QRS complex, despite no echocardiographic abnor malities in 3 (mother and 2 maternal aunts). Apart from proband all carri   ers were asymptomatic with no history of arrhythmia evidenced. ProbandÂ´s father belongs to another family affected by Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, although the father himself only express mild left ventricular hypertrophy with normal ECG.R14Del mutation was described in 40 families to date. There is information available from 68 carriers. This mutation was identified as a mutation with founder effect in up to 14% of cases in a cohort of Dutch patients with dila ted and arrhythmogenic cardiomyopathy. Carriers from this cohort charac terized by low voltage QRS and negative T waves in lateral leads similar to that evidenced in carriers of some desmosomal mutations.CONCLUSIONLow voltage ECG has a high sensitivity to identify PLN mutation carriers. Echocardiographic phenotype can be mild or normal in most carriers of R14Del mutation who can remain asymptomatic throughout life. Severe phenotype can be consequence of double mutations. Interpretation of ge notype phenotype correlations should be done in the context of large family trees and complete cardiac evaluation.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012371 www.eshg.orgESHG Published Abstract",2012

Methods:  We included 195 HCM causal mutation carriers (55% males, age  40Â±16 years); 64.8% had clinical manifestations of the disease. All patients were diagnosed in inheritance cardiomyopathy consultation, in a reference hospital. 146 patients were carriers of at least one mutation in MYBPC3 (IVS23+1G>A (72), Arg891fs (37), A107fsX116 (26), A216T (11), V896M (4) ), 21 were carriers of a mutation in MYH7 (T1377M (21), D928N (4), E1348Q (8), E1356Q (4), R1382Q (4)) and 8 patients were carriers of R278C in TNNT2. IVS23+1G>A, the most prevalent mutation, was present in 18 un related families. We performed time to diagnosis analysis according to the affected gene and the most prevalent mutations.Results: No differences in time to diagnosis were detected between the most prevalent mutations. Median age at diagnosis was 46Â±2 years old for IVS23+1G>A, 44Â±3 years old (Arg891fs), 43Â±2 years old (A107fsX116), 44Â±7 years old (T1377M) and 51Â±9 years old (A216T); log rank p,0.963. Similarly, there were no differences according to the 3 analyzed genes (log rank p,0.935). Median age at diagnosis for the whole was 47Â±2 yrs. Conclu sions:  Mutations in MYBPC3 encoding myosin binding protein C could be  considered more benign form of HCM than initially was considered. Now, genetic diagnosis reveals that HCM phenotype can appear later in life, rea ching near full penetrance in the elderly.",2012

The methylation for the three diffe rentially methylated GNAS regions was quantified via Sequenom EpiTYPER. Patients showed significant hypermethylation of the XL amplicon compared to controls (36Â±3 vs. 29Â±3%; p<0.001); a pattern that is reversed to XL hy   pomethylation found in PHPIb. Methylation for NESP and ExonA/B was si gnificantly different for some but not all patients, though most patients have site specific CpG methylation abnormalities in these amplicons. Since some AHO features are present in other imprinting disorders, the methylation of IGF2, H19, SNURF and GRB10 was quantified.

The deletion was familial in one and simplex in seven individuals.  The phenotype was remarkably similar and consisted of a round face with full cheeks, high forehead, ptosis, cornea opacities, underdevelo  ped alae, short philtrum, cupidâs bow of the upper lip, down turned  corners of the mouth, micrognathia, low set and prominent ears, and mild finger and toe anomalies (camptodactyly; syndactyly; broadening of first rays). Intellectual disability, hypotonia, decreased balance, sen   sorineural hearing loss, and unusual behavior were frequently obser   ved. High resolution oligonucleotide array showed different proximal and distal breakpoints in all of them. Sequencing studies in three of  the individuals revealed that proximal and distal breakpoints were lo  cated in unique sequences with no apparent homology. The smallest region of overlap was a 539.7 kb interval encompassing three genes: a  Zinc Finger Homeobox 4 ( ZFHX4), one micro RNA of unknown function  and one non functional pseudogen. ZFHX4 encodes a transcription fac  tor expressed in adult human brain, skeletal muscle and liver. It has  been suggested to be a candidate gene for congenital bilateral isolated ptosis.

Scorpion venom has historical ly been one of the richest sources of polypeptide toxins with unusually high degrees of specific actions on and interactions with the ion channel mem brane proteins of both excitable and non excitable cells. In this study, we report the characterization and isolation of a beta neurotoxin  Bt, from the venom glands of scorpion Androctonus crasicauda venom Kuzestan (Iran). Scorpions were collected from the Khuzestan province and transported to the reference laboratory of the Razi Institute . cDNA was synthesized with extracted total RNA as template and modified oligo(dT) as primer. Using RT PCR techniques, a 281 bp cDNA fragment encoding a beta neurotoxin active on mammals or on insects have been isolated from the telsons of scorpion Androctonus australis. All cDNA sequences displayed one major open rea ding frame of about 310 nucleotides. The deduced precursor open reading frame is composed of 59 amino acid residues that consist of a signal peptide of approximately 22 amino acid residues. This polypeptide has a molecular mass of 9324.86 kDa with an Isoelecric point of 4.96 which is closely packed by three disulfide bridges. Amino acid alignment and secondary structure prediction revealed that the peptide deduced from cloned cDNA is a functio nal homolog of potassium channel blocking neurotoxins from the venoms of other scorpions.Keywords: Adnroctonus crasicauda, beta toxin, scorpio",2012

The clinic features are overlapped with myotonic distrophy. Standard cytogenetic analysis showed a de novo translocation, 46,XY,t(1;12)(p22;p12 13) karyotype. Three hypotheses have been postulated to explain such phenotype abnormalities, including a break in a gene, a positional effect and a cryptic deletion or duplication. According to the literatÃ¼re, coexistence of t(1;12)(p22;p12 13) karyotype with myoto nic distrophy features has not been reported. This is the first case presenting both features and karyotype. As for myotonic distrophy, there are two types in adult onset. This identity may not be associated with the present karyo type. Therefore, it will be clarified of these two findings. This case places further emphasis on the importance of cytogenetics analysis in the study of de novo translocations with this abnormal phenotype. In conclusion, fine mapping and cloning of cytogenetically translocation chromosome break   points in patients with multiple malformations are a promising strategy for the isolation of new genes that may be related with myotonic distrophy.

Once she was cured, she decided to have a baby although the chromosome findings in the lab where frightened scared, showing multiples and different chromosome aberrations in 20% of cells. The karyotype was repeated and the same findings were observed. The question is: Could it be any relation between the lymphoma treatment which happened 8 years ago and the multiple chromosome alterations? If so, is there any risk for a preg nancy in our patient? Should she avoid her ovocites and consider a donor? Is there any other patient describe with a similar karyotype? Shall we check her hematology looking for another lymphoma?",2012

The frequency estimated to be 1 to 3% in the general population.  Despite being categorised as a minor chromosomal rearrangement which does not correlate with abnormal phenotypes, there have been many con troversial reports indicating that it may lead to abnormal clinical conditions such as subfertility, recurrent abortions, leukemia, dysmorphic features and psychosis.Materials and Methods: We studied retrospectively the incidence and cli  nical significance of pericentric inv(9) from the collected peripheral blood karyotypes of 1,800 cases being referred to our department with suspected genetic diseases over a 3 year period.Results: Pericentric inv(9) was detected in 21 cases (1% ).

Deletion of CHRNA7  gene in this  region is causative for the majority of neurodevelopmental phenotypes in  the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome. Subsets of persons with the deleti  on have no obvious clinical findings. During 2009 2011 the chromosomal  microarray analysis (CMA) was performed in 596 individuals due to their clinical indications. In four individuals 15q13.3 microdeletion was found. In one patient 15q13.2 q13.3 microdeletion was diagnosed previously during  research study of the children with ID. Here we present the clinical features  of five patients with 15q13.2 q13.3 microdeletion.All our patients (aged 6 17 years, among them two sibs) had normal grow   th parameters, except one boy with larger deletion 15q13.2 q13.3 who had short stature and microcephaly. Mild or unspecified ID, speech delay and mild facial dysmorphism was noticed in all patients. Abnormal EEG was  found in three of them (60%) and one boy has severe treatment resistant  generalized epilepsy (20%). Positive family history for epilepsy was docu mented in two families. Therefore, it is highly possible that their epilepsy may be also caused by 15q13.3 microdeletion (not investigated yet) as in 1 2% of individuals with generalized epilepsy 15q13.3 microdeletion is found. Cardiac anomaly was occurred in three children (60%).Microdeletion 15q13.3 is one of the most common microdeletions found by CMA in individuals with ID. In our cohorts of patients it was detected in 0.7% of investigated individuals.",2012

Methylparathion is a largely used pesticide. To exert its biological effect it must be biotransformed into methylparaoxon. Previous work in our labo   ratory, using the chromosome aberrations assay in human lymphocytes in vitro has shown that while methylparathion had no clatogenic or aneugenic effect on chromosomes, methylparaoxon was responsible for the alterations  in structure observed. The objective of the present work was to study the  effect of methylparathion on chromosomes of mice bone marrow in vivo, using the micronucleus assay. Animals were separated into four groups. In the first group, 6 animals received methylparathion intraperitoneally during  five consecutive days in a concentration equivalent to 25% of the LD 50. In the  6th day, animals were sacrificed, their femurs removed, the bone marrows  collected and smears were made for slides preparation. After 24h cells were stained with Giemsa Gurr (2%) and analyzed under optical microscope. As  positive control, 6 animals received cyclophosphamide (50mg/mL) once.  Six animals were injected intraperitoneally with the solvent (corn oil) and 6  animals not exposed to any drug served as negative control for the experi ment. In the test group, 12000 cells were observed and 199 showed micro  nuclei. In the group exposed to the solvent, 12000 cells were analyzed and  none had micronucleus. In the positive control group, 12000 cells were ob  served and 102 had micronuclei and in the negative control group, of 12000  cells observed, none had micronucleus. The chi square test for indepen   dence showed that our results were extremely significant (P<0.0001). They  suggest that methylparathion is responsible for the micronuclei observed. J04.

The number of women with 4 and more childbirths remained unchanged (4%).Within the last 11 years Kaluga region birth rate increased by 30%, this fact being accompanied by the increase of childbearing womenâs average age from 25,05 to 26,85 years.In the group of 957 families with reproductive losses the average age of wo men ranges from 26,92 to 28,5 years, which is distinctly higher than general population rate. The expected Down syndrome frequency among the fami lies with reproductive losses amounts to 14,46 per 10000 neonates, general population rate being 11,51. This fact may initiate age related fetal patho logy and cause present and future reproductive losses. The average age of the men from the families with reproductive losses amounts to 29,46, which turns out to be lower than general population rate (30 years). Based on this, the fact described above should not influence the frequency of age related fetal pathology in the families with reproductive losses.Thus, we obtained certain evidences of possible influence of the age of wo men from the group with reproductive losses on the increase of age related neonates pathology frequency and possible increase of repeated reproduc tive losses among them due to fetus trisomies.",2012

Because of its cytoskeletal association and sequence homology to myelin P2 (FABP8), it has been suggested that FABP9 tethers sperm membranes to the underlying cytoskeleton. Furthermore, its upregu lation in apoptotic testicular germ cells and its increased phosphorylation status during capacitation suggested multiple important functions for FA   BP9. Also recently it is shown that it can affect sperm morphology in mice . According to these data , we designed a study to evaluate if mutations of this gene can affect sperm morphology in human.Material and methods : The DNA was extracted from peripheral blood from the infertile males that their sperm count was normal but the number of morphologically abnormal sperms on their semen was above normal. Then the exon sequences of the FABP9 gene was amplified by PCR. These exons were sequenced and then analyzed for detection of potentially mutations.Results : We couldnât detect any mutation in the four exons, intron 3 and splice sites of the FABP9 gene in our 100 samples which we studied.Conclusion : As there was no mutation in the exons of this gene in our samp les, we can conclude that the mutations of this gene may have a neglectable effects on sperm morphological defects and the infertility caused by that.

In Non Obstructive Azoospermic (NOA) men, evaluation of spermatogenesis  is performed with histopathological techniques as a gold standard. Patholo gical assessment of testes could be imprecise due to randomized biopsy and presence of focal spermatogenesis. NOA men showed a variety of defects in spermatogenesis stages, therefore molecular analysis of the stage specific of gene expression in the testis could be confirmatory of histopathological techniques in evaluation of spermatogenesis in NOA men.In this study, spermatogenesis status evaluated through expression of germ cell specific genes (DAZ, TSPY1, SPTRX3 and SPTRX1) in testicular tissue of azoospermic men. Histophatological evaluation was performed using H&E routine method. Semi nested RT PCR was performed on synthesized cDNA. The molecular results prepared from gene expression were compared with the histopathological findings using Kappa test.RT PCR results showed a significance difference (Kappa coefficient,0.009, P value , 0.894) with the histopathological results. TSPY1, DAZ, SPTRX3 and SPTRX1 were expressed in 94%, 94%, 17.6% and 52.9% respectively in azoospermic men diagnosed as Germ cell aplasia. Detection of DAZ, TSPY1 and SPTRX1 transcripts in testicular tissue can be used to predict the pres   ence of mature spermatid / sperm in the testis especially in men diagnosed as spermatogenesis arrest using histopathological technique and may provi de the better chance of finding the mature sperm to use through ART .",2012

The lipid metabolism genes play essential role in mouse spermatogenesis, but their role in human infertility has not been fully established. Products of  CREM gene are essential for the initiation of spermatid maturation and de   velopment. Mice lacking CREM gene exhibit specific arrest of round sperma  tid development, fenotype similar to some human infertility conditions. Few  studies have shown that CREM deficiency is associated with spermatogenic  disorders in man. ATP binding cassette transporter 1 (ABCA1) mediates li pid efflux from Serotoli cells and influences male fertility. Apolipoprotein E receptor 2 (LRP8) and acid sphingomyelinase (SMPD1) play important role in sperm development, maturation and function in mice. This case control study investigated associations between polymorphisms in the CREM, LRP8, ABCA1 and SMPD1 genes of lipid metabolism and male infertility.Screening of eight polymorphisms (CREM: rs1531550,rs17499247, LRP8: rs17108177,rs3737983, ABCA1: rs2230806,rs2066714, SMPD1: rs1542705,rs1050239) was performed in 522 Slovenian and Serbian men with azoospermia and/or oligoasthenospermia and in 445 Slovenian and Serbian controls.Distribution of genotypes and alleles of investigated polymorphisms were in accordance with Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in different groups or with the total population. We have found significant differences in genotype frequencies of ABCA1 gene rs2066714 polymorphism (p<0,002) between group of patients with azoospermia and control group. However, no signi ficant differences in genotype frequencies of other tested polymorphisms (CREM,LRP8,SMPD1) and male infertility were observed (azoospermia and/or oligoasthenospermia).The ABCA1 gene rs2066714 polymorphism might represent a possible risk factor for infertility susceptibility in Slovenian and Serbian men.

Our hospital performed the first amniocen tesis in 1976. Since then, we have done more than 2000 cases over 30 years. When we started amniocentesis, we examined amnio fluid and fetus by fee ling with the hands because ultrasonography had not developed enough. In addition, obstetrician had to cultivate cells because there was no processing section. Ultrasonography has become a common tool and it makes us to perform amniocentesis easier. We could perform amniocentesis with more information such as placentation, fetus and leiomyoma. We also could order chromosome analysis to a commercial company.Amniocentesis is getting easier and more people would like having it, so we have to consider more carefully about the ethical and social aspects of the prenatal diagnostic examinations. Before performing prenatal diagnostic test, we have to give some information such as the maternal and fetal risk and complications and also have to discuss together what the clients would like to do after knowing the results.In this report, we show patientâs motives, age, gestational weeks and chro mosome results of amniocentesis in our hospital and discuss about the ideal way of amniocentesis.",2012

Fragile X syndrome is caused by a large expansion of CGG repeat (full mutation) which silences the FMR1 gene and stops the protein (FMRP) production. An important feature of the syndrome is mental impairment which may in clude mental retardation, autism, etc. It is therefore important to exclude FXS whenever patients are in diagnostic procedure for developmental delay affecting mental capabilities.For the detection of the FXS patients, a PCR based technique, designed as an exclusion test, was used. This technique is useful for the detection of normal variants of the CGG repeat number in males and heterozygous females.

Despite ultrasound (US) techniques improvement and specialistsâ awareness of the possible  fetal phenotype suggestive for this deletion, 22q11DS prenatal diagnosis  remains complicated because of atypical phenotype that may present and difficulties of the syndromeâs earliest detection. We evaluated two groups of pregnant women referred to invasive procedures in 1st (22 cases) and  2nd (27 cases) trimesters due to US findings. Two fetuses were found to  carry 22q11 deletion. Indications of the 1st trimester were increased nuchal translucency (NT)  19 (none detected) and lymphatic formations in the neck area   3 (1 detected). In the 2nd trimester one of 20 fetuses with CHD had 22q11 deletion and none of 7 with intrauterine growth retardation and/or palatal malformations was found to carry 22q11 deletion. 22q11DS prena tal diagnostics in 2nd trimester could be proposed when US reveals CHD, e.g. conotruncal, while in 1st trimester the main US findings are increased NT , lymphatic malformations (edemas, cysts), which may later transform to CHD.

 Unbalanced translocation with two partial monosomies in fetus with 45 chromosomes,J05.11,"S. Mandal1, B. B. Ganguly1, N. N. Kadam1, N. M. Oza2","1MGM Centre for Genetic Research & Diagnosis, Navi Mumbai, India, 2Ozaâs Maternity  Hospital, Navi Mumbai, India","Constitutive unbalanced translocations are generally inherited from one parent carrying balanced translocation, and described as derivative or re combinant chromosome carrying partial monosomy of one and partial tri somy of the other chromosome. However, transmission of partial monoso   my of both chromosomes of a parental balanced translocation is a very rare phenomenon. In the present case, increased fronto nasal angle detected through routine ultrasound imaging as a measure of antenatal screening was the only deformity to consider fetal karyotyping. FISH test was also perfor   med for quick testing of the numerical status of chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X and Y, which appeared normal. However, conventional G banding karyotype appeared with 45 chromosomes and monosomy 21. Since interphase FISH presented two normal signals of 21, a critical analysis following high reso   lution banding was performed and could trace the second 21 rearranged on 9p. Therefore, the fetus was carrying 45,XX,der(9)t(9;21)(p22;q11.2) ka ryotype with a constitutive abnormality. Subsequently parental karyotyping confirmed mother being the carrier of t(9;21)(p22;q11.2) transmitted the unbalanced translocation. The present fetus had 45 chromosomes without the other derivative chromosome resulting in partial monosomy of both chromosomes. Therefore, it is apparent that meiotic nondisjuction, most li kely maternal, resulted in aneuploid condition. Had the child inherited the normal 21 from the mother, the child would have had partial trisomy 21q which might have produced clinical expressions of Down syndrome. This is the first case to describe two partial monosomies in an aneuploid fetus with 45,XX,der9t(9p22;21q11.2).

Subsequently, top DEG were validated using RT PCR quantitation on independent sample of 16 cases with DS and 32 controls. The classification was performed using support vector machine classification kernel and evaluated using leave one out cross validation ap www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012383 www.eshg.orgESHG Published Abstracts proach.

The isolated and who  le amplified DNA and cDNA (RNA) were used for analysis of SNPs with the Cancer SNP Panel (Illumina) and assessment of expression of MDR genes:  ABCB1, ABCC1, ABCC2, ABCC5, GSTP1, and MVP . Results: SNP array emerged as an effective tool to detect somatic alterations. Despite of low microarray call rate, probably caused by degradation of DNA  during formalin fixation, the Cancer SNP Panel demonstrated significant  differences in genotypes both among the different types of morphological structures and their local microenvironment. In particular, the genotype  variations affected rs6179 (GHR gene), rs3740616 (LMO2), rs717620  (ABCC2), rs4623993 (k Ras), rs1050008 (MX1), rs569421 (GATA3), and rs529359 (PGR). MDR genes expression acts as indispensable hallmark of cancer. Similar to the SNP results, their expression was significantly differed  between both the studied types of morphological structures and their mi  croenvironment. The differences were displayed in both number (type) of expressing genes and level of expression.

According the monoclonal theory, coexisting primary tumors ari se from a single malignant transformed cell, which proliferates and spreads throughout the urothelium or might be spread during the intravesical ma nipulations. Another theory explains multifocality as subsequent events se   condary to a field cancerization effect, so tumors are expected to be geneti cally non identical. The question weather coexisting tumors arise from the same tumor clone or develop independently has a great clinical relevance to surgery and treatment approaches. Molecular analysis of alterations pat   terns in each of coexisting tumors may give us an answer.We examined tumor samples from 22 patients with primary multiple SBC (PMSBC) (2 5 tumors/patient). Genomic DNA samples were prepared from formalin fixed, paraffin embedded sections. Our panel included LOH analy   sis at 9p21 and 17p13  (microsatellite assay). Three out of 22 (13.6%) patients had non informative state of microsatellite markers. In nine out of 22 patients (40.9%) was shown concordant pattern of LOH in at least one of loci.

To date the methylation status of many oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes has  been investigated. However the genome wide analysis of methylation status  of many genes is necessary for identification of pathogenetic pathways of cancer development. This study was aimed to identify the functional groups  of genes abnormally methylated in BC. We analyzed 16 samples with BC and  6 control histologically normal epithelium samples from women with BC  using Illumina GoldenGate Cancer Panel I (Illumina, USA). Differential me thylation was observed at 318 CpG sites. Among them 252 (79.2%) were hy   permethylated and 66 (20.8%) were hypomethylated. The identified diffe  rentially methylated genes were analyzed using Gene Ontology Enrichment  Analysis. Hypermethylated genes belong to two functional groups: positive  regulation of cell differentiation (n,8) and regulation of cell proliferation (n,12). Hypomethylated genes belong to two groups as well: cell migration (n,2) and the protein amino acid phosphorylation (n,3). Hypermethylati   on of genes involved in positive regulation of cell differentiation and proli  feration may indicate the important role of their epigenetic inactivation in  BC development. Hypomethylation of genes involved in cell migration and phosphorylation of proteins may promote invasiveness, metastasis of can cer cells, and inhibition of tumor suppressor proteins by phosphorylation.  Thus, the abnormal methylation status of these functional groups of genes  may play a significant role in breast cancer development.",2012

A complex network of transcripti on factors and signaling molecules are required to continuance of this trait. SALL4 is zinc finger transcriptional activator crucial for maintenance of self renewal in stem cells which its expression rate is not yet elucidates in colorectal tumor cells. To clarify this rate and probable clinicopathological consequences, an expressional analysis was performed. Freshly tumoral and distant tumor free tissues of thirty eight colorectal samples were enrolled to comparatively examine the expression level of SALL4 by real time PCR. Compare to normal tissues, greater than two fold expression of SALL4 was interestingly detected in 89.5% of related tumors. SALL4 expression was si gnificantly correlated with the number of involved lymph nodes especially in moderately differentiated tumor samples (P<0.05). Furthermore, higher levels of SALL4 mRNA expression was significantly associated with older age of patients whom their tumor cells were being in the lower stages (I/II) (P<0.05). These results elucidate the direct impact of SALL4 overexpression on the process of tumor cell metastasis to lymph node and consequently development of tumors into advanced stages (III/IV).

 Examination of UVR Induced DNA damage and repair and its association with apoptosis in human keratinocytes and fibroblasts,J06.21,"M. Karbaschi1, M. D. Evans1, S. Macip2, M. S. Cooke1","1Department of Cancer Studies and Molecular Medicine, University of Leicester,  Leicester, United Kingdom, 2Department of Biochemistry, University of Leicester,  Leicester, United Kingdom","Skin cancer has an increasing incidence in countries with large populations of white skinned individuals. UVR, by initiating the DNA damage, can lead to mutagenesis and is regarded as the prime cause of most skin cancers. As a result, UVR protection is of primary importance to prevent UVR induced skin cancers. Cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPD) are an important form of DNA damage induced by both UVA and UVB and removed by nucleotide excision repair. The persistence of CPDs, compared to other forms of DNA da mage, is understood to be a major contributory factor to their mutagenicity. Using the T4endonuclease V modified comet assay on human keratinocytes and fibroblasts, we noted that there was rapid initial repair of CPDs over the first 6h post irradiation, following either UVA or UVB treatments, but whilst this slowed significantly in the UVB irradiated cells, it continued to be rapid in the UVA treated cells with levels approaching baseline within 36h. This confirmed the widely accepted slow repair of UVB induced cyclobutane thy   mine dimers, but we uniquely noted far more rapid repair of UVA induced cyclobutane thymine dimers. There were no significant differences in cell viability between the two treatments over the first 6h post irradiation, but at 24h post irradiation viability had decreased significantly only in the UVB irradiated cells. These data suggest that for at least the first six hours follo wing UVB irradiation, the majority of cells were viable and capable of repair, after that time increasing numbers of cells enter apoptosis, and therefore fail to repair the damage.

Bilateral symmetry of these nuclei along with  their association to the cytoskeletal fibres contribute to their efficiency in lo comotion by alignment of the axis of nuclear symmetry to the axis of cellular polarity, which orients towards the direction of locomotion in response to  cytokines and other stimuli.

STR markers located next to or within HLA DRB1  including M2_3_22, M2_2_36, D6S2878, D6S2805, D6S2879 and D6S2880  were selected from Major Histocompatibility Complex database (dbMHC). In silico analysis revealed that among all investigated markers, only M2_3_22 was specific for HLA DRB1. M2_3_22 existed as single copy in all MHC haplo  type sequences and located next to the HLA DRB1. The presented primers  for this STR marker at dbMHC and uniSTS were not compatible with some of the last published MHC haplotype sequences. Therefore, a new set of pri  mer pair was designed and used to amplify this marker in 164 DNA samples  obtained from Iranian unrelated individuals. M2_3_22 was successfully am plified in all DNA samples, and three different alleles were identified. The  marker was found in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (P>0.05) in the studied  population. Together, the findings suggested that M2_3_22 could be introdu ced as a specific locus among all the markers present in the HLA DRB1 gene region for linkage analysis and disease association investigations.",2012

Lamnissou1","1Dept of Genetics & Biotechnology, Faculty of Biology, University of Athens, Athens,  Greece, 2âGenesis Athens Clinicâ, Center for Human Reproduction, Athens, Greece","Background. The CYP19 gene encodes aromatase, a key cytochrome P450 enzyme that converts androgens to estrogens in the ovarian tissues of pre menopausal women. Polymorphic variations in the CYP19 gene result in modified estrogen levels through augment aromatase activity. In the present study, we investigated the association between the C/T single nucleotide po lymorphism (SNP) of the CYP19 gene and the risk of recurrent spontaneous  abortions (RSA).Methods: In this prospective case control study 120 RSA patients and 100 healthy controls were studied. All cohors were Greeks. The PCR RFLP me thod was used in order to genotype the subjects.Results: The frequencies of CC, CT , TT genotypes were 0.275, 0.500, 0.225, respectively, in the patient group and 0.262, 0.532, 0.206, respectively, in the control group. The allele frequencies were 0.525 and 0.475 for C and T , in the patient group and 0.528 and 0.472 for C and T , respectively, in the con trol group. The data between the two groups were analyzed by chi square test. The results showed that there are no significant differences in genotype or in allele frequencies between the patient and the control group.Conclusion: The CYP19 C/T polymorphism cannot be used as genetic mar ker for RSA risk assessment in our Caucasian population.",2012

OBJECTIVE: To investigate the association of vitamin D receptor (VDR) gene  BsmI (rs1544410) polymorphisms with bone mineral density (BMD) in a  population of Iranian women. METHODS: Blood samples were obtained  from 146 pre  and/or postmenopausal Iranian women, aged 35 80 years, stratified for BMD into normal and osteoporotic groups. Anthropometric  parameters including age, body height and weight were all recorded. BMD  of the lumbar spine (L1 4) and femoral neck were measured using dual en ergy x ray absorptiometry. Polymerase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism (PCR RFLP) technique was used to detect and analyze  VDR gene BsmI polymorphisms distributions of our study groups. RESULTS:  The frequency of AA and GG genotypes were significantly different in normal and osteoporotic groups (P < 0.05), frequency of AA was higher in patients  and GG was higher in normal group. Also the GG genotype was significantly  associated with increased BMD in the lumbar spine (P < 0.05). This associa   tion was not significant in femoral neck (P > 0.05). CONCLUSION: VDR gene  polymorphisms have an association with the BMD in lumbar spine and may  have a less effect on proximal femur BMD in women. J09. Complex traits and polygenic disorder",2012

The presence of G allele was observed in 88 patients (78.6%) compared to the 63 (70%) individuals from control group. The OR for subjects carrying genotypes GG and GA was 1.5417 (95%CI 0.830 2.974). The preliminary sequencing data of 37 preeclamptic and 45 control samples confirmed the HRMA results for rs1800682. Additionally, two preeclamptic patients with rs1800682 AA al   leles were heterozygous for rs34995925 and none in the control group. The relative gene expression in placental samples showed none association with the genotypes. We have detected rare alleles in preeclamptic women close to the STAT1 binding site with possible additional effect on predisposition to pree  clampsia.

The distribution of ACE DD, ID, and II genotypes in FM patients were 40; 41.3 and 18.7%, respectively; the corresponding numbers for the control group were 29.1; 52.8 and 18.1%, respectively. The distribu tion of the ACE gene genotypes frequencies werenât statistically significant between patient and controls groups (x2,5.33, p,0.07). But the percentage of DD genotype is relatively higher in patient group than control group.Many studies showed that the ID and DD polymorphism is strongly asso   ciated with the increased plasma or serum ACE levels. Thus the ID and DD polymorphism favors high ACE expression and activity, hence may predis   pose individuals to FM and its complications. In this study we have demon   strated that genotype and allele frequencies of ACE gene I/D polymorphism were not statistically association with FM.

It is a multifactorial disease, which affects between 3% and 10% of all pregnant women (data from different surveys). GDM is associated with adverse health outcomes for both mother and baby   newborns larger than normal for their gestational age, pre eclampsia, higher risk of developing diabetes following the pregnancy, etc.There is accumulating evidence that adiponectin plays a role in the patho physiology of diabetes. In patients with type 2 and gestational diabetes lo wer levels of the protein have been observed. Several common single nu cleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the adiponectin gene (ADIPOQ) have been associated with predisposition to type 2 diabetes. One of those, rs266729 in the promoter of ADIPOQ, has been proposed to affect its transcription. The aim of the present study was to check if this variant was associated with GDM in Bulgarian population.The study involved 260 pregnant women, 130 with GDM and 130 controls, recruited from local antenatal clinics in Sofia, Bulgaria.

Osteoarthritis (OA) is a degenerative disease of the joints characterized by degradation of the hyaline articular cartilage and remodeling of the sub chondral bone with sclerosis. Asporin (ASPN) gene encodes a cartilage ex   tracellular protein that is member of the small leucine rich proteoglycan fa mily. Polymorphisms in the aspartic acid repeat region in the second exon of this gene, that is consist of GAT repeats, are associated with a susceptibility to osteoarthritis. The D14 allele (an allele containing 14 D repeats) is asso   ciated with increased OA susceptibility in Japanese and Han Chinese, but is not an important factor in OA etiology among Caucasians, although the D15 allele is considered a risk allele for Greek population. To apprise the possible association, that seems controversially, we explored the ASPN effect in Ira nian patients with knee OA. The D repeat polymorphism was genotyped in 100 knee OA patients and 100 control subjects, and the allelic association of the D repeat was examined. Our data suggest that the D15 allele could  be considered a risk allele significant only for females (p,0.045) of Iranian  population.

With the exception of the rare monogenic forms of mi  graine, current technology has not proved efficient in revealing the under   lying genetics of migraine. Recent genome wide association studies (GWAS)  have identified four single nucleotide polymorphisms significantly related  to migraine. However, these polymorphisms explain only a small part of the heritability. The missing heritability might be hidden in rare variants, calling for a more detailed sequencing to be applied and developed. Sequencing the  entire genome by exome sequencing and whole genome sequencing (WGS)  are techniques undergoing an enormous development and might help to re veal the genetic mystery of migraine. We aim to explore future possibilities for migraine genetics given by the new developing technologies. Methods  Since the technology evolves much faster than the literature, the study is  predominantly based on interviews with genetics experts. Also, we evalu   ated studies regarding migraine genetic and next generation sequencing, which were identified using PubMed search. Conclusion The future research in migraine genetics will be dominated by the next ge  neration sequencing. However, at the present time, prices and analyzing tools limit its use, and in cases with sporadic migraine, GWAS appear to be the best choice. Conversely, in cases with familial migraine, exome or whole  genome sequencing will be the preeminent choice. In order to gain insight in  the heritability of migraine, studies in the upcoming years will require large  sample sizes and cooperation between migraine genetic consortia.",2012

A genetic predisposition in SLE disease is well documented. Material and method: We present a 12 years old girl referred to our hospital for SLE as presumptive diagnosis. Results: The patientâs family history is highly signi ficant for SLE: a maternal aunt died at age 26, due to SLE complications. Her daughter (patientâs cousin) was also diagnosed with SLE. Her evolution was unfavorable, despite extra renal epuration. She presented important cardiovascular comorbidities, but the cause of death was renal failure, at 16 years. In these circumstances, the onset of malar rash and photosensitivity demands further evaluation of other markers of SLE, in our case. Complete investigation ruled out the following diagnostic criteria: discoid rash, serosi   tis, oral ulcers, arthritis, hematological disorders, renal involvement, antinu   clear antibodies, immunologic phenomena and neurological pathology. Two out of the eleven diagnostic criteria were serially present during follow up. Discussion: The presence of HLA A1, B8, DR, the null complement alleles and congenital deficiencies of complement (especially C4, C2, and other ear ly components) increase the risk of SLE in this case. If a mother has SLE, her daughterâs risk of developing the disease is estimated at 1:40.

The association of  2578C/A,  1154G/A, and  634G/C SNPs  with ALS was found in some European populations (Lambrechts et al.,  2003). However, there was no such association in different other popula   tions (Brockington et al., 2005; Del Bo et al., 2006; Van Vught et al., 2005;  Zhang et al., 2006). We suppose the important role of VEGF in ALS pathoge nesis. The aim of this study was to investigate the association between VEGF  2578C/A polymorphism and ALS in Russian population.Methods. The peripheral blood was extracted from 197 patients with ALS and 156 controls. The ALS group included 54% (107/197) males and 46% (90/197) females aged from 20 to 83 years (51,2 Â±13,4) and was compa rable with controls. All of persons were the Slavs. TaqMan PCR was used for detection of  2578C/A SNP .Results. The significant difference of the distribution of  2578A allele in ALS cases and controls was observed (p,0,014). The VEGF  2578A/A genotype increased ALS risk to an adjusted odd of 1,58 (95% CI, 0,04 0,95). There was no increased risk for males (OR,1,84, 95% CI,  0,06 1,27).

The absence ( 9), rather than  the presence (+9), of a 9 bp repeat sequence in exon 1 has previously been shown to be associated with increased gene transcription, higher BDKRB2  mRNA expression and higher efficiency of muscular contraction (Williams  et al. 2004). Studies suggest that insertion deletion (I/D) polymorphism in BDKRB2 gene is associated with aerobic capacity and elite endurance ath lete status. The aim of our study was to investigate the association between  the BDKRB2  9/+9 polymorphism and athlete status in Russians. MethodsOne thousand three hundred and seventy nine athletes from different spor   ting disciplines and 507 controls were involved in the study.

Ahmetov","Kazan State Medical University, Kazan, Russian Federation","Peroxisome proliferator activator receptor gamma (PPARG) gene regula   tes the expression of genes involved in lipid and carbohydrate metabolism, differentiation of adipocytes and myoblasts, insulin sensitivity and glucose homeostasis. The 12Ala variant of the PPARG gene Pro12Ala polymorphism is associated with decreased receptor activity [Deeb et al., 1998], leading to insulin hypersensitivity and enhanced glucose utilization [Ek et al., 2001]. As a consequence, the carriers of the 12Ala allele show better glycaemic re sponse to exercise training [Adamo et al., 2005], higher rates of skeletal mu scle glucose uptake [Vanttinen et al., 2005] and greater cross sectional area of muscle fibers [Ahmetov et al., 2008]. In a study of Russian power oriented athletes a higher frequency (23.8 vs. 15.1%, P < 0.0001) of the PPARG 12Ala allele compared with controls has been reported [Ahmetov et al., 2008]. The aim of the present study was to investigate the association of the PPARG Pro/Ala polymorphism and athlete status in an independent cohort of Rus sian athletes.

Background: Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic inflammatory demyelina ting disorder in the central nervous system. Evidences linking Apolipoprote in E (APOE) to myelin repair, neuronal plasticity, and cerebral inflammatory processes suggest that it may be relevant in MS. The main goal of this study  was to determine whether the APOE genotypes and alleles are associated  with MS patients.Materials&Methods: Totally,147 MS cases and 168 control subjects from  Iranian population were genotyped for APOE gene using PCR RFLP method.

The aim of this study was to determine whether a functional single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), an A>G base transition at position 896 from the transcriptional start site of TLR4 (refer   red to as Asp299Gly), contributes to TLE. We also investigated whether this variant may influence the TLE phenotype. We used a case control approach comparing the frequencies of Asp299Gly polymorphism between unrelated TLE patients and matched controls.

CDK5 and its activator p35, encoded by CDK5R1 gene, are highly expressed  in CNS where they have a fundamental role in neuronal migration and diffe  rentiation during CNS development. Their fundamental role in CNS develop  ment and function, and their involvement in the pathogenesis of neurode   generative disorders makes CDK5 and CDK5R1 strong candidate genes for  the onset of mental retardation. We carried out the mutation screening of  CDK5 and CDK5R1 coding regions, as well as of CDK5R1 3â UTR, on a cohort of 344 patients with non syndromic mental retardation (NS MR). In fact, we recently demonstrated that 3â UTR has a key role in the post transcriptional  regulation of CDK5R1 expression, through the binding of protein factors and  microRNAs belonging to miR 15/107 family, and this evidence prompted us to include this region in the mutational analysis. We found one silent muta   tion in CDK5, and three silent and two missense conservative mutations in CDK5R1 coding region. Four novel variations in intronic regions of CDK5 were also found but never predicted to cause splicing defects. Interestingly,  we found nine heterozygous variations in CDK5R1 3â UTR: among these, six  were single base substitutions and three were small deletions. None of these variations was present in 450 healthy controls. Of particular interest is the deletion of one predicted miR 15/107 family binding site, found in one pa  tient.

Introduction: The main factor for atherosclerosis development is high LDL  cholesterol (LDLc) levels. Majority of hypercholesterolemia cases are due to complex interactions gene environment being the most common cause the polygenic hypercholesterolemia (PH).Aim: Our objective was to identify candidate gene variants as contributors  to de genetic cause of PH.Methodology: 378 unrelated subjects, without mutations in LDLR  and  APOB genes, were selected according to the following criteria: LDLc â¥ 90 th  percentile and Tryglyceride levels â¤ 200 mg/dl. Moreover, a control group with 525 normolipemic subjects from the Aragon Working Health Study  (AWHS) was analysed. All subjects were genotyped using Solexa (Illumina Â®)  technology for 18 SNPs located in 5âUTR region of the APOE, APOB, PCSK9,  NR5A2 , SREBF1  and LDLR  genes. Results: We have observed different allelic distribution between the PH po  pulation and the normolipemic subjects within 5 genetic variants. Our re sults have shown a higher frequency of the minor allele in PH versus control population of the APOB SNPs: rs51235 (0.497 vs 0.444, p<0.0250), rs617314  (0.333 vs 0.272, p<0.0055) and rs58429712 (0.092 vs 0.027, p<0.0001); while a lower frequency was observed in the PH group for the NR5A2 po lymorphism rs9427440 (0.260 vs 0.387, p<0.0001) and the LDLR  variant  rs17248720 (0.087 vs 0.164, p<0.0001), are inversely related to PH.Conclusion: We have identified 5 SNPs associated with the phenotypic ex   pression of PH disease. The 3 APOB SNPs are directly related to PH pheno  type while the LDLR  and NR5A2  polymorphisms seem to be protective to the  hypercholesterolemia development.

Despite the important geo  graphic location of historical Armenia in terms of ancient migrations and  spread of Indo European languages and agriculture, the genetic profile of the Armenian population is not well studied yet. In this work, we aimed to  answer the following questions: i) is the Armenian population geographical   ly stratified based on HLA markers despite their ethnic unity, and ii) what  is the place of the Armenians on the genetic landscape of the Middle East? To answers these questions we analyzed the genetic structure of three lar  ge Armenian territorial groups, Karabakh, historical Western Armenia, and  Iran, as well as ethnically different populations from Middle East, Europe, Africa and Far East. Initial information on HLA typings were taken from pu  blished papers and analyzed relying on low resolution genotyping results of  HLA A, HLA B and HLA DRB1 loci. All the three Armenian territorial groups were assessed for haplotype frequencies estimated by the EM (Expectation Maximization) algorithm using Arlequin software package. It was shown  that the three Armenian subpopulations despite their ethnic homogeneity  are geographically stratified which is in compliance with the results based on the Y  chromosomal markers. The pattern of genetic relatedness between  the three Armenian groups and the comparative data sets revealed that the  Armenians along with Mediterranean ethnic groups form a distinct cluster  on a Principal Coordinate plot and Neighbor Joining tree based on standard genetic distances, which is supporting the Mediterranean origin of Arme   nians.",2012

 Uninterrupted CCTG tracts in the myotonic dystrophy type 2 associated locus are they really rare?,J10.06,"J. Radvansky1, L. Kadasi1,2",1Inst,"of Molecular Physiology and Genetics, SAS, Bratislava, Slovakia, 2Faculty of Natural  Sciences, Comenius University, Bratislava, Slovakia. Myotonic dystrophy represents the most common form of adult muscular dystrophies. The first genetic form of the disease, myotonic dystrophy type  1 (DM1), is caused by expansion of the (CTG)n repeat tract in the DMPK  gene. The second genetic form, myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2), is caused by expansion of the (CCTG)n repeat tract in the ZNF9 gene. The CCTG tract is  generally interrupted in healthy range alleles and is uninterrupted in patho  logically expanded alleles. Our study reports the variability of the healthy range DM2 alleles found during a population study in Slovakia. In compari son with previous studies, we identified wider range and higher frequency  of healthy range alleles containing uninterrupted CCTG tracts. As uninter   rupted alleles were so far reported mainly on larger alleles, they were con  sidered as possible DM2 premutations. Our findings, however, suggest that  uninterrupted CCTG parts are not restricted to large alleles and can be found  continuously throughout the whole range of healthy range alleles, from the smallest up to the largest ones. This emphasizes the need for further studies  aimed partially to the better characterisation of boundaries between meio   tically and mitotically stable alleles and those which can be considered as  unstable DM2 premutation alleles.",2012

Therefore, knowing the distribution of genetic varia bility among and within this population is essential for the establishment of appropriate use, as well as better enforcement. Thus, this study aims to evaluate, from the DNA, the genetic structure of natural populations found in the western Brazilian Amazon, with a view to advancing knowledge and manipulation of species, favoring the development of conservation strate gies and stimulating the application of a breeding program to actively par ticipate. Preliminary data from our lab established the best methodology to be applied in this analysis. The results show that the method described by Doyle & Doyle (1990) and modified by Faleiro et al. (2003) was the most ef ficient in obtaining DNA of better quality and in sufficient concentrations to be used in studies of genetic diversity in plants. To molecular analysis in this population, in a comparison with different techniques, RFLP , RAPD, AFLP and SSR, the results indicates that RAPD (random amplified polymorphic DNA) can be successfully used (Powell, 1996). This reinforces the use of this technique in studies of genetic variability.

Despite intensive  research little is known about the origin of aneuploidy and its risk factors.  Here we analyze mitochondrial DNA of aneuploid fetuses and patients to reveal whether certain features of mtDNA of primary oocytes make them  more prone to non disjunction. Methods: Hypervariable segment 1 of mtDNA was sequenced in 48 patients with Downâs syndrome, 22 aborted fetuses with DS and 2 aborted fetuses with Edwardâs syndrome   altogether 72 samples. Previously published  HVS 1 sequences of 267 Byelorussians were used as controls. Results: Attention was focused on frequencies of 16189C and its combi nation with 16183C as these substitutions create a polyC stretch which in  terferes with the replication of mitochondrial DNA and is reported to be a  risk factor for metabolic syndrome and cancer. 16189C is 1.6 times more frequent in the group of aneuploids compared to the control one (p,0.07),  whereas 16183C+16189C haplotype is 3.7 times overrepresented among  aneuploids (p,0.005).

PCR was opti mised so that it worked over a wide range of template amounts (0.03 ng to 75.83 ng). Multiplex (4 plex) PCR assay was validated following the guideli nes of Scientific Working Group on DNA analysis Methods (SWGDAM). The multiplex PCR was tested for its specificity, reproducibility, sensitivity and stability using ABI 310 and 3500 genetic analysers (Applied Biosystems). Samples treated with various environmental regimes and DNeasy1 were also included in this study. The multiplex (4 plex) PCR was found to work efficiently in triplicate samples of all three species until 0.3 ng of DNA tem plate, although, partial profile is also obtained with 0.03 ng DNA template.The result of this validation study promises that this multiplex can be used in forensic analysis to assess DNA persistence in human decomposing bo dies following mass disasters and in experimental animals (rabbit and pig) and therefore is recommended for forensic purposes.",2012

 Role of the genes encoding NMDA receptors in the development of neurologic pathologies during influenza infection,J11.06,"M. A. Plotnikova, S. A. Klotchenko, V. V. Egorov, A. V. Vasin","Research Institute of Influenza, St","Petersburg, Russian Federation. Influenza is one of the most widespread respiratory viral diseases, infecting humans. Influenza virus may cause various neurologic complications which can lead to chronic diseases characterized by different cognitive dysfunc tions. However, until recently very little was known about the molecular bio logical mechanisms of activity disbalance of the central nervous system in case of influenza disease. One of the dominant roles in this process probably belongs to the ionotropic glutamate receptors selectively binding N methyl D aspartate (NMDAR). The main aim of this study was to analyze the expres   sion level of the genes encoding NMDAR during influenza infection. Native NMDARs are thought to function only as heteromeric assemblies containing both NR1 and NR2 subunits. The NR1 family is encoded by a single gene. The NR2 family of subunits consists of four members arising from separa te genes (GRIN2A, GRIN2B, GRIN2C, GRIN2D). The novel mRNA which can be encoded by GRIN2B gene was found. We used postmortal human lung tissues from patients who died because of complications against pandemic influenza virus disease. PCR analysis of IL 10 mRNA expression shown that the nonspecific products were irrefutable obtained. Sequence of this ampli   con aligns with the intron 2 of GRIN2B. Gene specific primers for detecting expression level of human and mouse NMDAR were designed using Primer BLAST program. To test these primers we used total RNA isolated from mice tissues section. We are now planning to investigate the expression of NMDAR genes in cell cultures infected by pandemic and seasonal influenza virus H1N1. The work is supported by RF Presidentâs Grant.",2012

Among these ge  nes, mutations in ATP13A2 are the least common. Mutations in PARK9 have  been reported to cause autosomal recessive early onset Parkinsonâs disea   se (PD). ATP13A2  is located on chromosome 1p36, contains 29 exons, and  codes a transmembrane protein of 1180 amino acids which belongs to the Group 5 P type ATPase superfamily. The function and substrate specificity of the coded protein remains unknown. Here we present results of mutation screening in 14 Iranian EOPD patients in whom mutations in LRRK2 , PRKN,  DJ1, and PINK1 were previously ruled out. The average age at onset of the  Iranian patients was 20 years, and the range was 11 31 years.

Background & Objective: The connexins are a family of at least 20 homolo gous proteins in humans that form aqueous channels connecting the interi   ors of coupled cells and mediating electrical and chemical communication. Mutations in GJB3, the gene encoding the gap junction protein Connexin 31 (CX31), have been pathogenically linked to erythrokeratodermia and non  syndromic autosomal dominant (DFNA2) or recessive hereditary hearing  impairment (HHI).In the present study, we aimed to characterize the genome variation of GJB3 in Iranian patients with hearing impairment. Methods: Twenty five non syndromic autosomal recessive hearing loss pa  tients who were normal for two major responsible genes of non syndromic hearing loss (GJB2 and GJB6) were tested with direct sequencing of entire  coding region of the GJB3 gene. Results: Single nucleotide sequence alteration was present in 15 out of 25 patients (60%) and 40 % of patients were normal. Five different variations  that were detected are: G866A (34%), G798T (20%), C856A (6%), C357T  (2%) and C93T (2%).Conclusions: 60 percent of patients showed single polymorphism in coding and non coding part of GJB3. All patients were normal for sequencing of two  well known genes for non syndromic hearing loss (connexin 26 and conne  xin 30). Therefore this high percentage of genetic variation in GJB3 may have pathogenic effects on Iranian population, but this needs more investigation  on normal subject",2012

Also we have investigated two sisters with type I of RCM and found in two sisters only one mutation p.Val253Met in exon 9 in heterozygosis state, which was previously described. Analysis of haplotypes for 4 markers, which flank gene CYB5R3, detected one general haplotype in patient with type II in homozygous state and in two sisters with type I in heterozygosis state. Then we developed system, which permitted us to detect exact borders of the deletion in introns 1 and 7. The size of deletion formed 12 kb and the name of deletion was c.22 1320_633+1224del. In next step we developed system, which permitted us to detect deletion c.22 1320_633+1224del in homo  and heterozygosis state, and we revealed this dele tion in two sisters. Our patients with type I and II of RCM are not relations but they live in Volga region in Russia.",2012

In general SCA 1 7 are the  most frequent forms and account for 50 80 % of ADCA in most studies. The mutation associated with these loci is abnormal expansion of CAG repeat.  The frequency of SCA subtypes varies in different ethnic groups. We here investigated a large Iranian pedigree with clinical presentation of ADCA consisting of 13 affected members in three generation.Genomic DNA was extracted from blood of patients with cerebellar ataxias  and unaffected individuals. To amplify a fragment of SCA6/CACNA gene con  taining the CAG repeat, the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was perfor   med. PCR products were run on 3% agarose gel, wild type and expanded  alleles were extracted from the gel and were sequenced with both forward  and reverse primers. Analysis of the sequence data determined the number of repeats for the normal and expanded allele as 11 and 24 repeats respec   tively. The results were confirmed by capillary electrophoresis using fluo rescent primer labeled with 6 FAM. The size of the normal and expanded alleles were determined as 128 bp and 169 bp respectively with capillary electrophoresis. Investigating patients in different generation showed a stable number of  repeats, with no sign of increase in the number of repeats. This finding was consistent with the clinical findings in patients because no sign of anticipa   tion, such as earlier age of onset and more severe clinical presentation was seen.",2012

Bondarenko, A. Chukhrova, A. Loginova, A. V. Polyakov;   Research Center for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation. Stargardt disease is the most common hereditary early onset macular dege   neration. It characterized by slowly progressive loss of central vision. Autosomal recessive Stargardt desease type 1 (STGD1) is caused by muta   tions in the ATP binding cassette transporter gene (ABCA4). ABCA4 gene  includes 50 exons, encodes 2273 amino acid and mapped to 1p22. There are  about 500 mutations in the ABCA4 gene have been reported. 882 unrelated control individuals and 100 unrelated STGD1 patients from Russia were screened for the prevalent European ABCA4 gene mutations: Gly863Ala, Ala1038Val and Gly1961Gln by multiplex ligation dependent  probe amplification (MLPA) and subsequent gel electrophoresis. In the con  trol group the allele frequency of Gly863Ala, Ala1038Val and Gly1961Gln were 0.17%, 0.51% and 0.62%, respectively. In STGD1 patients the allele  frequency for mutations Gly863Ala, Ala1038Val and Gly1961Gln were 1.0%,  17% and 6.0%, respectively. Heterozygous carrier frequency of mutation Gly863Ala is high in different countries of Europe (up to 1 out of 18 in Nort   hern Europe), but it is significantly lower in Russia (1 out of 294 by our data).Mutation Ala1038Val is the most frequent in Russian STGD1 patients, but prevailing mutation in control group is Gly1961Gln. The possible explana   tion is the heterozygous state of Gly1961Gln mutation provokes an age re  lated macular degeneration (AMD) and reduces this mutations` frequency  in the group of STGD1 patient. This reseach is the first attempt to define the heterozygous carrier frequency of ABCA4 gene mutations in Russian population.",2012

Several classifications of dystonia are based on topographic distribution, age at onset, cause, or genetics. According to the etiologic classification this syndrome includes primary dystonia, secondary dystonia, dystonia plus syndromes, and paroxysmal dystonia. Presently, eleven genes and seven additional loci have been reported to be associated with monogenic primary dystonias. We report the mapping of a family from Iran with an autosomal recessive form of dystonia plus syndrome with se   vere hearing impairment linked to the chromosome 13.Materials & methods: Whole genome homozygosity mapping was perfor   med in a consanguineous Iranian family with two dystonia affected children and five unaffected family members using high density single nucleotide po lymorphism chips . Patients had childhood onset form of dystonia, muscle  atrophy, and severe hearing impairment.Results : We observed a large homozygosity region of 15 Mega bases on  chromosome 13 in all affected individuals of this family but no among the non affected individuals. Nearly 200 annotated genes exist within the linked region.Conclusions : These findings indicate that the causative gene exists on chro  mosome 13.

The function of Î±1(I) Pro986  3 hydroxylation is unknown, but roles in fibril alignment and matrix cross linking are speculated. PPIB, a prolyl cis trans isomerase also known as cy   clophilin B, is thought to catalyze the rate limiting step in collagen helix for   mation. To further characterize the role of PPIB in collagen folding, Ppib null mice were generated from a gene trap ES cell clone with half normal PPIB   expression. Homozygous Ppib  /  mice were verified by real time RT PCR  to completely lack  transcripts in skin, fibroblasts, osteoblasts and femora.  Ppib /  mice weigh one third less than WT and Het littermates. Ppib protein  was absent and P3h1 reduced 50% in Ppib /  cultured fibroblasts and osteo  blasts. As expected, Î±1(I) P986 3 hydroxylation was reduced to 5 11% of WT . In agreement with previously described patients with decreased P986 3 hydroxylation, collagen from Ppib  /  cells had delayed electrophoretic mo  bility on SDS Urea PAGE. However, thermal stability, 5 lysyl and 4 prolyl hydroxylation of fibroblast collagen were normal. Inhibiting hydroxylation of collagen with Î±,Î±â dipyridyl resulted in Ppib  /  collagen alpha chains with  faster elecrophoretic migration than WT chains, suggesting altered confor   mation due to loss of peptidyl prolyl isomerization. In Ppib /  fibroblast cul   tures, collagen deposition was decreased by 70% vs WT cultures, despite only moderate delay of secretion. These data suggest unique roles for Ppib in collagen post translational processing and extracellular matrix incorpo   ration, in addition to its chaperone function for folding.",2012

Null mutations in FKBP10  (Chromosome 17q21.2) have been shown  to cause recessive osteogenesis imperfecta (OI), with (Bruck Syndrome 1) or without congenital contractures. Linkage mapping of Kuskokwim Di   sease to chromosome 17q12 q21, together with contractures as a variable feature of FKBP10  mutations, led us to sequence this gene. We identified  a homozygous 3 nt deletion in FKBP10  exon 5 (c.875_877delACT), which  causes deletion of p.Tyr293, in probands from three Kuskokwim pedigrees. This mutation occurs in the 3rd PPIase domain of FKBP65 and is highly con served among species. FKBP10  expression by real time PCR ranged from  0.75 1.67 of control in five probands, suggesting that the transcripts are not degraded. FKBP65 protein was present in proband fibroblasts at 2.5 7.5% of control levels, demonstrating destabilization of the protein. Steady state type I collagen biochemistry has near normal migration. Additionally, colla   gen cross linking is decreased in probands, with 0 25% hydroxylation of the telopeptide lysine involved in cross linking and an 80% reduction in mature cross linked collagen deposited in culture, despite normal collagen secre tion. Collagen in extracellular matrix appears more diffuse, perhaps from thinner fibrils, with a normal to decreased collagen:organics ratio shown  by Raman micro spectroscopy. In conclusion, this is the third phenotype  caused by mutations in FKBP10 , adding contractures with osteopenia to the  previously described severe OI with and without contractures; the Kuskok   wim mutation specifically affects collagen cross linking.",2012

PURPOSE. We describe 3 novel MYH7 mutations (b myosin heavy chain) associated with Dilated Cardiomyopathy (DCM) and Left Ventricular Non Compaction (LVNC), localized within the region of actomyosin interface.METHODS. Clinical assessment of 3 children with MYH7 mutations (E525K, M528I, F540L) was performed in dedicated clinics. Genetic study included sequencing of MYH7,MYBPC3,TNNT2,TNNI3,TPM1,ACTC1,LDB3,LMNA and TAZ. Mutations occurred once in >500 samples and were predicted as pathogenic by in silico analysis. RESULTS. E525K was found in a newborn with DCM/LVNC without familial history of cardiac disease. She underwent a heart transplant (HTx) at 5 months. The M528I variant was detected in a girl with LVNC and mitral regurgitation. The mutation was inherited by the fatherâs family. F540L was identified in a 16 year old boy with DCM/LVNC. His mother and 2 siblings were affected. The mutations lie within the 50k lower sub domain of the globular myosin head, in a region with surface hydrophobic helical peptides that are part of the binding site actomyosin. Other mutations in the same subunit have been described (G529D, M531R, S532P , M539L, A543T , D545N and A550V): the most prevalent phenotype was DCM/LVNC or DCM. High penetrance and early onset of disease were common (52% of affected were <21 years). The evolution was severe: 3  deaths from heart failure, 4 HTxs, 1 myectomy. CONCLUSIONS. We identi  fied 3 novel mutations in MYH7 related to early onset DCM and LVNC. This phenotype is shared by other mutations affecting the same sub domain of MYH7. Such a site specific approach could help interpreting the pathogenic  role of previously undetected mutations.",2012

The C104R mutation abolishes ligand binding and, consequent ly TACI signalling which plays a fundamental role in immunoglobulin class switching, production and in B cell homeostasis regulation. We analyzed by direct sequencing all five coding exons of TNFRSF13B  in 9 pediatric patients  (5 sporadic patients and 4 siblings belonging to two families) presenting with hypogammaglobulinemia, cerebellar hypoplasia, psychomotor delay and mild to bordeline intellectual disability. We identified the recurrent C104R mutation in heterozygous state, in two affected males in one family and in one sporadic patient. In all patients with TNFRSF13B  mutations, we  also analyzed by RT PCR, TACI expression on peripheral lymphocytes, which was not impaired. Recent evidence suggests that tumor necrosis factor re ceptor superfamily members (TNFRSF) are expressed in an overlapping re gulated pattern during neuronal development, participating in the regulati   on of neuronal expansion, differentiation and development. The association between TACI mutations and cerebellar hypoplasia has not been described before and could provide interesting clues for investigating the non immu nological role of TNFRSF13B in brain and cerebellar development.www.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012411 www.eshg.orgESHG Published Abstract",2012

Sequencing of the coding region of X chromosome has revealed four muta   tions (T92fs*45, N59_K60>K*, D277fs*59 and G217R) in the synaptophysin  gene (SYP) at Xp11.23 p11.22 encoding an integral membrane protein of  small synaptic vesicles (Tarpey et al. 2009) in families with ID.Subjects and MethodsExome sequencing using AgilentSureSelectHumanX chromosome kit and  single read76nt NGS on the Illumina GAII sequencer was applied to find the  causative gene in the index patient belonging to a large Finnish family with a total of nine male patients with ID in three generations. DNA of six patients  and their mothers were available for the study. ResultsA novel missense mutation c.879G>A (p.Gly293Ser) in exon 6 of SYP was  identified  that perfectly co segregates with the disease in the family. The  mutations were not found in 440 Finnish anonymous blood donors respec   tively. In detailed clinical investigation of the three affected patients (III/5, IV/1 and IV/2) similar dysmorphic features were identified including hy   perplastic supra orbital ridges, straight eyebrows, deep set eyes, and short philtrum. The carrier mothers were normal.ConclusionsWe anticipate that mutations in the SYP gene cause a previously undescri   bed syndrome of with X linked intellectual disability.Grants: The Sigrid JusÃ©lius Foundation, Helsinki, Finland",2012

Mutations in the GJB2 gene, encoding the gap junction protein connexin 26  (Cx26), are the most common cause of non syndromic deafness. To investi gate the molecular basis of non syndromic deafness in the Tuva Republic (Southern Siberia, Russia), we analysed nucleotide sequences of the GJB2  gene entire coding region in 90 deaf patients of Tuvinian ethnicity. The Tuvi nians are the indigenous population of the Tuva Republic located northwest of Mongolia and directly east of the Altai Republic. Most of the Tuvinians are descended from ancient Turkic speaking Central Asian tribes and Mongoli   an speaking groups assimilated by them. Mutations p.W172C (c.516G>C), p.L79fs (c.235delC), p.V37I (c.109G>A), p.H100fs (c.299_300delAT) in homozygous or compound heterozygous state or as a single allele were found in 24 out of 90 patients (26.7%). Besides, 18.9% of studied Tuvini an chromosomes were carrying polymorphisms p.V27I (c.79G>A), p.E114G (c.341A>G), and p.F192L (c.571T>C). Interestingly, we observed high pre valence of the p.W172C mutation (79.4% out of all mutant chromosomes): 7 patients were homozygous and 13 patients  heterozygous for p.W172C.  The p.W172C was first reported in the Altaians (the Altai Republic) (Posukh et al., 2005) and then in one Mongolian deaf patient (Tekin et al., 2010). The p.W172C change is located in the second extracellular domain of Cx26 pro tein. Based on evolutionarily conservation of c.516G in the GJB2  sequence  in many species and the PolyPhen analysis, p.W172C (c.516G>C) was con sidered to be probably pathogenic.

SACS is the only gene known to be associated with the ARSACS phenotype. The gene was initially reported to be encoded by a single gigantic exon. Recently eight additional exons were identified upstream of the giant exon. The SACS protein product, sacsin, is believed to integrate the ubiquitin proteasome system and Hsp70 chape rone machimery. Recent studies indicates a role for sacsin in regulation of mitochondrial dynamics. To date, more than 70 different mutations, predo   minantly located in the giant exon, have been identified worldwide; of these only seven, exclusively located in the giant exon, were identified in Italian patients. The authors identified a novel homozygous variation c.815G>A, which results in the missense mutation p.Arg272His (R272H) in a patient from Southern Italy. This mutation was present in heterozygosis in both unaffected parents as in one unaffected sibling and in several unaffected relatives. The phenotype of our patient closely resembled the classic pheno type. R272H missense mutation falls in the seventh coding exon of the SACS gene, hence not in the carboxyterminal giant coding exon which contains most reported sacsin mutations. R272H represents the first described Ita   lian mutation located upstream of the giant exon of the SACS gene. The re sidue is completely conserved in evolution. The missense mutation R272H was not detected among 200 control chromosomes. Although it is also in a well conserved region of the protein, no functional domain is defined for this region.",2012

MÄ±hcÄ±","Akdeniz University School of Medicine, Department of Pediatric Genetics, Antalya,  Turkey","Alpha mannosidosis is a rare autosomal recessive lysosomal storage disea   se of glycoprotein catabolism caused by a deficiency of lysosomal alpha  mannosidase activity. The incidence is approximately 1 of 500,000 live  births. Characteristic clinical features include mental retardation, coarse facial features, ataxia, hearing loss, dysostosis multiplex, and immunodefi   ciency. Three clinical subtypes include a mild form recognized after age ten years with absence of skeletal abnormalities, myopathy, and slow progressi   on (type 1); a moderate form recognized before age ten years with presence of skeletal abnormalities, myopathy, and slow progression (type 2); and a severe form manifested as prenatal loss or early death from progressive cen tral nervous system involvement (type 3). Assay of acid alpha mannosidase enzyme activity in leukocytes or other nucleated cells is the confirmatory diagnostic test. We presented a 8 year old girl with psychomotor develop ment delay. She was an adapted child. She attended a special education. On her physical examination was consisted with alpha mannosidosis. The uri  ne tests for mucopolysaccharides showed small amount of dermatan sul fate. The alpha mannosidase enzyme activity was 1.6 umol/g/h (normal range: 100 800 umol/g/h), 3.2 umol/l/h (normal range: 20 100 umol/g/h) in white cells and plasma, respectively. Although alpha mannosidosis is a rare disorder, it is important to consider the alpha mannosidosis in the dif   ferential diagnosis of young patients with neurodevelopmental disabilities. We could not forget the importance of the screening for oligosaccharides in children with neurodevelopmental delay with mild phenotypic signs and symptoms.

Both adaptive and innate immune systems are involved in coro  nary artery disease (CAD). The aim of this study was to evaluate cytokine ex   pression profiles in un stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBMCs) of patients with coronary artery disease.Methods.

IL 4, and IL 10 gene expression were decreased in un stimulated PBMCs of patients with CAD, while IFN Î³ gene expression as a prototype of Th1 immune response and IL 6, were increased in patients with CAD compared to individuals without CAD. However, the differences were not significant. Nevertheless, a significant decrease in IL 23 gene expression in un stimulated PBMCs of patients with CAD compared to those without CAD was found (p<0.001, 95% CI: 0.29 0.80).Conclusion. Our data reinforce the potential role of the IL 23 IL 17 axis as a critical regulatory system that bridges the innate and adaptive arms of the immune system in the complex mechanisms associated with the deve lopment of atherosclerosis.

Hyperinsulinemic infants are usually ma  crosomic, reflecting the anabolic effects of insulin during pregnancy; also, in  most cases there is no history of maternal diabetes. Common symptoms of hypoglycaemia are non specific and include increasing demands for feeding,  hypotonia, irritability, jitteriness, and frank seizures. Case report:  Two days old female newborn from a mother with no history  of diabetes was admitted to our clinic presenting with macrosomia and se   vere hypoglycaemia for further management. Glucose level upon arrival was  extremely low, 0.72 mg/dL (0.04 mmoL/L) and despite vigorous therapy  the severe hypoglycaemia persisted throughout the first two months of life. Further investigations revealed inappropriately elevated insulin levels at  the time of documented hypoglycaemia, as well as lack of acidosis or keton  uria. The presence of organomegaly, structural abnormality, and tumours was assessed by abdominal echography and CT scan Conclusions: Blood glucose levels should be closely monitored in infants  with hyperinsulinism even if the baby does not present with jitteriness,  frank seizures or other signs of hypoglycaemia. An increase in glucose level of at least 40 mg/dL proves that glucose mobilization has been inhibited by insulin and that the mechanisms of glycogenolysis are intact.",2012

Detoxification of VPA and its major metabolites is known to be carried out by cytochrome P450 enzyme system with special emphasis on CYP2C9 and CYP2C19 as well as on ATP binding cassette (ABC) transporter, P glycoprotein MDR 1. Analysis of VPA treatment efficiency respective of polymorphisms in SNPs in CYP2C9  (430C>T and 1075A>C) , CYP2C19 (681G>A) and MDR1  (3435C>T) was a  main goal of the present study. PCR RFLP analysis was carried out in 76 epi lepsy patients and in 210 individuals of the control group. The genotype and allele frequencies of the relevant genes were different in the patient compa red to the control groups (P>0.05, Ï2<5.99). Chronic adverse complications were associated with CYP2C9 allele (*2 and/or *3), which correlates with  reduced activity of this enzyme (P,0,048 F,0,049). The multivariate logistic regression analysis also supported that carriers of particular SNPs alleles have higher risk of chronic adverse events. Analysis of SNPs polymorphism in cytochrome P450 genes allows more precise control of the necessary dosage of VPA medication, thus making epilepsy treatment more efficient, personalized and less toxic.",2012

WD patients mostly  present hepatic and/or neurological manifestations, however, severity and age of onset are variable. We explored whether Cu resistance of tissue cul   ture cell lines that express specific mutations of ATP7B can predict severity  and course of disease. Chinese Hamster Ovary cells that lack intrinsic ATP7B  expression were used for stable expression of ATP7B mutants by retroviral  vectors. 12 mutations were chosen for analysis from reports of homozygo tic patients. To determine Cu resistance MTT assay was established. ATP7B  protein expression was determined by Western blot analysis. Cu resistance of the cell lines appeared to be highly specific and could be classified into three groups. The first group showed high copper resistance similar to that  of wild type ATP7B. The second group showed low copper resistance similar  to native CHO cells, the third group displayed intermediate resistance. Ma   gnitude of ATP7B protein expression correlated with level of Cu resistance in  most but not all cases. ATP7B mutants found in patients having a mild clini  cal presentations were highly resistant to Cu. In contrast, an early onset and  severe disease was found in the group of mutants that showed low Cu resi   stance. The third group with intermediate Cu resistance was heterogenous  with respect to clinical manifestation of disease. Our observations indicate  that functional characterization of  ATP7B mutants can give further insights  into the understanding of individual mutations and for prediction of WD.",2012
 The mutational spectrum of Phenylketonuria in Egypt : A unique pattern of mutations including four common mutations and five novel mutant PAH alleles.,J13.15,L. K. Effat,"Division of Human Genetics and Genome Research, giza, Egypt","Phenylketonuria (PKU) is one of the most common inborn errors caused by deficiency of the hepatic phenylalanine hydroxylase gene (PAH). Exten sive studies identifying mutational spectrum of PKU have been published during the last two decades. The frequencies of the different mutations vary in different locations of the world. On the basis of phenotype/genotype cor   relations, determination of phenylketonuric genotype is crucial for better classification of the clinical phenotype and treatment, including tetrahydro biopterin therapy. We report here on the mutational spectrum of PAH gene  in 150 Egyptian families using the following systems: (1) PCR RFLP analysis for common Mediterranean mutations; (2) single stranded conformational polymorphism; (3) direct sequencing; and, (4) Long range PCR for detection of large deletions. Of the 300 mutant alleles, 288 (96%) were genotyped and a total of 25 distinct mutations were identified including 5 novel muta   tions. R176X, R243X, Y198fs and IVS10 11G>A were prevalent mutations in our population. The mutational data obtained reflects a unique pattern of mutations in Egyptian patients with PKU which will permit precise carrier detection, prenatal diagnosis and genetic counseling for these families.

Introduction. Osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic disease of bone formation, with autosomal recessive trait, is characterized by bone fragility and redu  ced bone mass due to mutations in genes coding for type I collagen. Different  severity of clinical signs is due to imperfect genotype phenotype correlati   on. Because the treatment with bisphosphonates (antiresorptive agents that  inhibit osteoclast function and stimulates osteoblastic bone formation) was  recently introduced, the authors have proposed to evaluate the effects of pamidronate in patients with osteogenesis imperfecta.Patients and method. The study group consisted of 11 patients (3 girls and  8 boys), aged between 4 ys 1 mo   18 ys 3 mo, who were registered in the  Centre of Genetic Disease of the First Pediatric Clinic Cluj with osteogenesis imperfecta. The method consisted in: clinical and bio humoral assessment  regarding the parameters of bone mineralization, radiological examinations,  osteodensitometry; assessing occupational score.Results. Treatment with bisphosphonates (commercial preparations Are  dia) was administered in 2   14 cycles, at a dose of 0.5   1 mg/kg/day IV in  fusion, 3 consecutive days at 4 months interval. The drug was well tolerated, the only side effect being fever recorded in the first cycle of treatment in 4 patients. Bio humoral parameters of phospho calcic metabolism remained  within normal limits, except for reduced alkaline phosphatase values in a  girl who associated hipophosphatasia tarda. Bone pain has resolved, frac tures have not occurred (except in one patient), occupational score and Z  score were improved. Conclusions. Under bisphosphonates treatment the clinical symptoms, oc cupational score and Z score were improved.",2012
 A cell model system to monitor the translocation of Ataxin 3 in SCA3,J14.08,"Z. Wang, T . Schmidt","Human Genetics Institute, Tuebingen, Germany","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 (SCA3), also known as Machado Joseph disea   se (MJD), is an autosomal dominantly inherited neurodegenerative disorder caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat in the MJD1 gene encoding a ex   panded polyglutamine repeat in the Ataxin 3 protein. Ataxin 3, the affected protein in SCA3, is mostly a cytoplasmatic protein, however, it distributes to different subcellular regions i.e the cytoplasma and the nucleus in diffe rent cell types. The characteristic hallmark of this disease is the formation of Neuronal intranuclear inclusions (NII) including expanded and misfol ded causative protein. Whether NII are toxic or protective, their presence indicated that expanded ataxin 3 plays a role in the nucleus. In addition, transcriptional regulation of ataxin 3 occurs in the nucleus and nuclear lo calization of ataxin 3 indeed aggravate the symptoms in SCA3 animal mo del. Therefore, if ataxin 3 localizes in the nucleus, this is a negative event. Prevention of ataxin 3 nuclear translocation maybe ameliorate this disease progression. To gain insight into how to inhibit the translocation of Ataxin 3, we will undertake a small molecular library screen to explore which small molecules influence the location of this protein in a SCA3 cell model, analy   ze the mechanisms regulating Ataxin 3 transport and attempt to develop a therapeutic strategy for this disease.

This paper ex   plores the feasibility of discrete choice experiments to identify and weight  various criteria in a form that allows prioritisation through a rank ordering  of different testing options. Therefore a pilot discrete choice experiment was carried out, using face to face interviews, among 22 genetic profes   sionals. Respondents chose between two generic scenarios (dual choice  options) that described testing options, represented by medical and non  medical attributes. Choice data was used to rank order a set of seven testing options on the basis these attributes and their relative weights. A series of  follow up questions were asked to learn about participantsâ understanding  of the choice format and potential improvements in the discrete choice in strument.

Carrier screening for fragile X syndrome (FXS), the leading cause of inherited intellectual disability, provides indivi duals with information about their health and risk of having children with FXS. It is important individuals participating understand the personal and familial implications of such screening. This study aimed to explore percep tions and decision making styles of non pregnant women from the general population offered FXS carrier screening in Australia.Methods: Purposive sampling was used to select equal proportions of par ticipants who declined and accepted screening. 37 qualitative, semi struc   tured telephone interviews were conducted after women accepted or decli ned screening, but prior to receiving test results (if tested). Interviews were transcribed with data coded into themes.Results: A range of decision making styles emerged from the data, including: relying on initial gut reaction, being influenced by previous experiences and in depth deliberation.

Todd2","1Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 2University of Manchester, Manchester,  United Kingdom, 3St Maryâs Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom","An enduring challenge in evaluating interventions in clinical genetics and  genetic counselling is how best to measure patient benefit. Patient Repor   ted Outcome Measures (PROMs) offer a possible solution. PROMs are self completion questionnaires used in research to evaluate patient benefits from new interventions e.g. in randomised controlled trials, and for service  evaluation in routine clinical practice. PROMs differ from satisfaction que  stionnaires because they measure change over time in outcomes valued by  patients, rather than simply reporting satisfaction with service received.  Current UK health policy encourages use of PROMs data. But in clinical genetics, there is no consensus about the best PROMs to use. A research  programme involving ~450 patients and 130 clinicians tackled the issue  of PROMs use in clinical genetics (Manchester 2003 2011). Mixed methods were used to identify patient benefits: (a) a systematic review of validated outcome measures used (b) a Delphi survey to identify consensus amongst clinicians and patients about appropriate outcome domains and (c) quali   tative interviews and focus groups. The next stage involved validating the Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale (GCOS 24), a new PROM developed from the qualitative data, and the existing Perceived Personal Control (PPC) scale. Both PROMs were proven to (i) have high internal consistency (PPC: Cron bachs Î±,0.83, GCOS 24: Î±,0.87) (ii) have concurrent validity with health locus of control, satisfaction with life, depression, and authenticity and (iii) capture statistically significant patient benefit following clinic attendance (PPC: Cohens d,0.4, GCOS 24: d,0.7). These properties suggest that both GCOS 24 and PPC are appropriate validated PROMs to evaluate clinical ge netics services.",2012

Introduction Prophylactic mastectomy (PM) has proven to be the most effective method to reduce the risk of breast cancer in high risk women. The present study  aimed to present and compare the attitudes towards PM among physicians  in France, Germany, the Netherlands and the UK.Methods An international sample of 1196 general practitioners (GP) and 927 breast  surgeons (BS) were surveyed using a mailed questionnaire. ResultsBoth GPâs as well as BSâs opinions towards PM significantly differed from one country to another. Only 30% of the French and 27% of the German  GPs were of opinion that PM should be an option for an unaffected fema  le BRCA1/2 mutation carrier, as compared to 85% and 92% of the GPs in  the Netherlands and UK, respectively. Similarly, 78% of the French and 66% of the German BS reported a positive attitude towards PM, as compared to 100% and 97% of the BS in the Netherlands and UK, respectively. In the whole sample of GPs, a positive attitude towards PM was associated  with country of residence, being female, and having more knowledge of bre  ast/ovarian cancer genetics, while among BS there was a positive associati on with country of residence and having more knowledge of breast/ovarian cancer genetics as well, and, in addition, with a higher number of newly dia  gnosed breast cancer patients last year. Conclusion These results demonstrated the international variations in the attitude to wards PM among physicians. This might reflect that different policies are adopted to prevent breast cancer in women at risk.",2012

Cancer survivorship often involves identity reconstruction and integrati on of the experience into oneâs self concept, and may even lead to radical transformations in oneâs identity. The increasing availability of genetic te sting enables other family members who have not yet developed cancer to determine if they have inherited the risk; those with a mutation are known as previvors. Once a previvor is identified, they are faced with complicated and often difficult decisions and this new situation may have important psy   chological and social impacts. To date, little is known about the formation of previvor identities and the extent to which genetic diagnosis is central to oneâs identity. The main objective of this study was to conduct a qualitative investigation based on a phenomenological framework in order to under   stand the lived experience of cancer previvors and to examine the centrality of the genetic diagnosis and the associated life changes. Eighteen previvors were studied using a qualitative semi structured interview. All interviews were subjected to interpretative phenomenological analysis.

The psychological evaluation of familial OCS (PsyFOCS) was conducted to examine the psychological impact of taking part in OCS on women who are  at increased genetic risk. The aims of the qualitative component of PsyFOCS  were to understand 1) womenâs experiences of OCS and 2) the catalysts for surgery to remove the ovaries and reactions to subsequent withdra wal from OCS. Semi structured interviews were conducted with 48 women  who were or had been taking part in OCS. Women were chosen on a num  ber of demographic and clinical criteria to endeavour to capture a range of  OCS experiences. Interview topics included: family history, cancer risk, the screening experience, risk management decisions and information provisi   on. Results suggested that OCS provides reassurance for women and they feel privileged to take part in OCS. A number of catalysts, including OCS test results, and secondary considerations were found to prompt surgery. The emotional impact of discontinuing OCS following surgery varied between relief, acceptance and loss. In conclusion, OCS appears to be an acceptable risk management strategy for women at increased risk of ovarian cancer. However, OCS results may prompt women to reconsider their risk manage   ment options. These findings highlight the benefit women feel they receive from OCS as well as the importance of the timing of decision making about risk management options.",2012

Method 36/61 individuals who had a predictive test for HBOC, HD or FCM, age 15  25, in our Centre, at least 3 months previously, agreed to participate. Tele phone interviews with the 36 participants (10 HD, 16 HBOC and 10 FCM)  were audiotaped, transcribed and analysed using Interpretative Phenome   nological Analysis. Results None of the participants expressed regret at having the test at a young age.  Participants saw the value of pre test counselling not in facilitating a deci   sion, but rather as a source of information and support. Several reflected  it had been difficult to emotionally rehearse the potential outcomes prior  to testing and thought this was related to their youth. Differences emerged amongst the three groups in parent/family involvement in the decision to be tested. Parents in HBOC and FCM families were a strong influence in favour  of testing, whereas in HD the decision was more autonomous and someti   mes went against the opinions of parents/grandparents.

One such development is non invasive prenatal diagnoses (NIPD) which has the capacity to transform prenatal diagnosis. To understand how health professionals in the UK see NIPD impacting on clinical care, inter   views and focus groups with professionals from fetal medicine (n,7), clini cal genetics (n,12) and midwifery (n,46) were conducted, audio taped and transcribed. Thematic analysis was employed to elicit common views regar ding the integration of NIPD into clinical practice and the education needs of the workforce who will deliver this service. All three groups recognised that NIPD will impact on the service they provide, however they believed this new technology should be viewed as supplementing current roles as opposed to changing practice. As such, the identified educational needs fo cused primarily on the procedural issues associated with NIPD, such as the laboratory process and appreciating the implications of test results. Partici pants stated that any educational package developed needed to reflect the service model for delivering NIPD to ensure education was relevant to the health professionalâs role.

Practical advantages of NIPD included avoiding miscarriage, and there were a number of psychological  advantages associated with timing such as perceived control, early re enga  gement with pregnancy, normalisation and peace of mind. NIPD facilitated a stepwise approach to decision making whereby women divided time into manageable âchunksâ and focused on the immediate future. This is likely to  have been a coping mechanism. A number of disadvantages were discussed  including concerns about social sexing and increased bonding at a time in pregnancy when miscarriage risk is high.

There  are, however, many challenges ahead for successful implementation and it is  critical that stakeholder preferences and opinions are considered. Discrete  choice experiments (DCE) have been widely utilised in healthcare research  to examine stakeholder preferences. Participants choose between a series of healthcare options and in doing so reveal their preferences and trade  offs in a way that reflects the complex nature of real life decisions. Here  we describe the use of DCEâs to compare patient and health professional  preferences for key attributes of NIPD relative to invasive testing for Down  syndrome and for single gene disorders such as sickle cell anaemia and beta thalassemia. Participants include; 1. pregnant women and partners at   tending maternity services for routine procedures; 2. members of relevant patient support groups; and 3. health professionals involved in prenatal  care. Women (n,335) and health professionalâs (n,181) were found to have  differing preferences when considering diagnostic tests for Down syndro me. The key attribute for womenâs decisions regarding testing was no risk of  miscarriage, while for health professionalâs accuracy and timing were most  important. Studies exploring preferences for diagnostic tests for single gene  disorders are ongoing. Our results are important for the implementation of  NIPD. In particular, womenâs strong preference for tests with no risk of mis carriage indicates that test safety has the potential to outweigh other factors  in decision making and highlights the need for effective pre test counselling  and informed consent processes.",2012

Interviews were digitally recorded, transcribed and thematic analysis performed, with independent coding by at least 2 researchers.Almost all participants supported screening for such conditions provided it is voluntary. However, parents of healthy children generally thought that newborn screening should be offered, perceiving this as a convenient time, while parents of children with DMD or SMA2/3 were overall much more supportive of screening at a later stage (~1 year old), as they valued having a period of ânormalityâ. They perceived that receiving a diagnosis from ne wborn screening would have impacted negatively on the relationship with their child. Those favouring infant screening suggested it could be targeted to children whose parents are concerned about their childâs development, while parents of healthy children often worried that targeted screening might reduce equity of access.

Background: Increasingly, women newly diagnosed with breast cancer with a relevant cancer family history or other high risk features are being offered  genetic testing to guide their treatment (Treatment Focused Genetic Testing  âTFGTâ). In this randomised controlled trial, we evaluate two ways of offe ring information about genetic testing to young women at diagnosis. Methods: Women (<50 years) at diagnosis before definitive breast cancer  surgery, with either suggestive cancer family history or other high risk features, are invited to participate by their surgeon. After completion of a baseline questionnaire, participants are randomised to receive information  about TFGT either: a) in educational materials (Intervention) or, b) at a ge  netics service (Control). Free rapid genetic testing is offered; results are dis   closed at a genetics service. Self report questionnaires assess demographic  information, decisional uncertainty about TFGT , surgical and psychosocial  outcomes.

Of these, 141 (86%) completed a further questionnaire one week after being returned to routine 4 monthly screening (primary end point). A total 912 (78%) women completed nine month follow up questionnaires. Measures included cancer distress, general anxiety/depression, reassurance, and rate of withdrawal from screening. Results: Compared to women with normal results,  women with abnormal results reported moderate cancer distress (F,27.47, pâ¤.001,Î· 2,0.02) and were significantly more likely to withdraw from scree  ning for surgery (Ï2 (1),18.92, p<.001) after their abnormal result.

Discussion: Understanding cognitive representations of being at risk may  have some use in explaining psychological responses to cancer genetic risk  assessment. Specifically, these findings suggest that those receiving a high risk result have a greater understanding of its implications: this may reflect differences in the mechanisms by which individuals at different levels of risk are informed.",2012
 The underestimated impact of prophylactic mastectomy,EPL4.4,"J. P . Gopie1, R. Timman2, M. T . Hilhorst2, M. A. M. Mureau2, A.

The impact on cancer distress, general mental and physical health, and satisfaction with body image, sexuality and the partner relationship was investigated.Methods Fifty women opting for BPM completed psychological question  naires at baseline, 6 and 21 months after surgery. With repeated measures ANOVA the quality of life in time was explored with a prospective design.Results  Cancer distress significantly decreased after BPM. Physical health  and satisfaction with body image diminished shortly after BPM, but in creased on the long term. General mental health improved on the short term, but decreased thereafter. Satisfaction with sexuality tended to decrea se up to 21 months. In the end, 30% was not satisfied with the aesthetic result of their breasts and 30% indicated they had less frequent sex with their partner than they used too.Conclusion Although cancer distress significantly declined, the psychoso   cial impact of BPM including immediate breast reconstruction should not be underestimated. Particularly, the intimate relationship can be adversely affected. Adaption to the new body image and the impact on femininity and identity may take a long time. Psychological consults should be provided preoperatively as well as postoperatively to catch the patients and partners in need of psychological counseling.",2012

We sent validated questionnaires to and conducted  semi structured interviews with 15 of the 24 women invited to take part (response rate 62.5%). The results suggest that risk reducing surgery does  not lead to significant psychological distress. Women tend not to think or  worry much about developing cancer. Women tend to be distressed about the physical and somatic symptoms associated with menopause; their social well being is somewhat affected, but sexual difficulties are minimal. The 5  major themes identified from the interviews were: motivating factors; ta   king control; benefits of surgery; physical and emotional costs of surgery;  and, experiences of HRT and the menopause.

Background: Pedigrees are key tools in cancer genetic counseling where  accurate and comprehensive information is needed for risk assessment. Counselees often have imcomplete information. We have adopted the use of an electronic population based genealogy database to generate a full 3 generation pedigrees.Materials and methods: From January 2007 to January 2012, over 600 coun selees have been seen in the cancer genetic counseling clinic, for 3 or 4 visits each. During the intake the counselee signs a consent for tracing her family through the database of the Genetical Committee of the University of Iceland (GCU) and the Icelandic Cancer Registry. The GCU holds accurate informati on on at least all Icelanders born after 1840. As cancer diagnosis recording is mandatory, the Cancer Registry provides very accurate information.Families with pedigrees in the clinic are 265. Pedigrees made during intake, include10 25 individuals and the electronic pedigrees 40   2000 individu als, most commonly 3 500. Families with the BRCA2 founder mutation are 42 and BRCA1 families 5. Tested individuals are 541 resulting in over 107 BRCA2 and 14 BRCA1 carriers.Conclusion: In our experience this method adds considerable information. No disapprovement on the behalf of the families have been noticed. This is especially inportant in the light of the policy of many cancer registries to only release individual information based on informed consent. We argue, in part based on our experience, that persumed consent should suffice. Such policy would be consistent with other sharing of individualÂ´s genetic pedi   grees, between health care facilities.",2012
 Self and Other Oriented Reassurance in Telegenetic Counselling,EPL5.1,"S. Sarangi1, O. Zayts2","1Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 2The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong,  China","This paper focuses on telephone mediated genetic counselling in Hong Kong where nurses contact mothers whose newborns have been diagnosed with a mild hereditary disorder (G6PD deficiency, commonly known as favism). Since this condition is preventable through avoidance of certain food and medication, it becomes imperative that when mothers are given the âaffec tedâ status of their child, reassurance of the manageability of the condition ensues.Our data is drawn from 50 transcripts of audio recorded telephone counsel ling encounters as part of a funded study. We use thematic discourse ana   lysis (Roberts and Sarangi, 2005) to demonstrate that the âaffectedâ status of the child is always delivered first, which is immediately and briefly miti gated before explanations about causes and consequences of the condition are offered. The delivery of âgood newsâ in the form of reassurance follows a particular structural pattern: typically advice is offered about life style practices that the mothers must adhere to as a way of avoiding the inherent risks associated with the condition. We argue that this âpositiveâ framing of advice allows nurses not only to reassure mothers that they are able to ma nage their childâs condition, but also to become self reassured that there is manifest uptake of the advice by the mothers (e.g. via confirmation check  questions; recycling of information). We examine how the nurses orient  themselves to the mothersâ existing knowledge of the condition vis Ã  vis identifiable reassurance trajectories. In conclusion, we discuss the ways in  which the reassurance trajectories are a specific feature of the telephone  mode of counselling.",2012

To inform  the design of a European Master level curriculum and registration process,  we undertook an online survey of 216 practitioners working in 19 European countries to ascertain current areas of practice, legal regulation, collaborati ve working and clinical responsibilities. Of the respondents, 82.7% were ge  netic counsellors and 9.9% were genetic nurses.

Furthermore, there is a disparity between the way genetic ophthalmology services are delivered in the UK. This research used thematic qualitative analysis to identify and describe the needs and outcomes desired by a set of UK patients and their families (n,20). Extensive prior qualitative research has identified five outcome domains in clinical genetics: Behaviou ral Control, Cognitive Control, Decisional Control, Emotional Regulation and Hope, referred to as Empowerment. Yet, the relevance of these five domains to inherited eye disease is unknown. The data were analysed through the Empowerment theoretical framework to determine what attributes, if any, differentiate retinal dystrophy patients from other clinical genetics patients. The research found that patientsâ desired outcomes relate to medical, psy   chosocial and practical categories of need, most of which line up closely to the Empowerment domains. However, three themes discovered in the data do not have a corresponding Empowerment outcome measure: Informati on about benefits, Adaptations and Mobility. Thus, a new outcome domain, Independence, defined as âThe ability to participate fully in social, family, economic, educational and/or public lifeâ, is proposed to reflect the desired practical outcomes. Independence is a logical outcome for coping with a po tentially disabling condition. It may not apply to genetic conditions that are non disabling, which could account for its absence in previous studies.

Introduction Approximately 20% of individuals undergoing oncogenetic counseling  with/without DNA testing experience clinically relevant levels of distress.  Within the counseling session, information provided is mostly biomedical and provider driven. The use of a checklist, completed by counselees prior  to the counseling session, might facilitate discussion of psychosocial issues.  The aim of this trial is to evaluate the use of a checklist as an aid in 1) facilita   ting communication, 2) increasing counselorsâ awareness, and 3) improving the management of psychosocial problems. Methods In total, 260 individuals undergoing oncogenetic counseling at the family cancer clinics of the NKI AVL (Amsterdam) or the UMCU (Utrecht) will be  randomised to either a group whereby the results of the checklist, comple  ted prior to the counselling session, are shared with the genetic counselor (intervention), or a group where the results of the checklist are not used  within the counseling (control). The counseling sessions are audiotaped for  purposes of content analysis.ResultsPreliminary data on the first  98 participants indicate that counselees expe  rience problems in the following psychosocial domains: living with cancer (95% of the counselees), genetics (67%), children (51%), family and social issues (30%), emotions (24%), and practical problems (14%). Whether the se issues are more frequently addressed in the intervention group as com pared to the control group will be evaluated when the study matures.DiscussionIf proven effective, the use of a oncogenetics specific psychosocial problem checklist can be recommended as an aid in facilitating communication, in creasing counselorsâ awareness, and improving the management of psycho   social problems within cancer genetics.",2012

Rapid genetic testing is now available for newly diagnosed breast cancer before having surgical treatment. To guarantee autonomous and informed decision we elaborated a new model of oncogenetic counseling focused mostly on psychological aspects and surgical counseling. Since 2008, at the Modena Centre for Hereditary Breast and Ovarian Cancer (Italy) has been performed a rapid genetic testing for women with hereditary profile at the time of bre ast cancer diagnosis. The entire oncogenetic counselling path is completed within three weeks. So BRCA1/2 carriers have the opportunity to choose for RRBM. About 71 mutational analyses were performed and 25 (35%) patients were mutated. Among the 25 patients with a positive result, 13 (52%) had a RRBM at the surgery time for the breast cancer. A psychological follow up was performed in all patients undergone RRBM. After 12 months from the intervention, patients showed an overall good emotional adjustment and satisfaction with their decision whereas only in a minor case sexual and psy   chological problems arose. Our study shows that a rapid genetic testing in patients with a hereditary profile significantly improved the choice of RRBM and that is it fundamental to guarantee both multidisciplinary counseling and psychological follow up to these women.",2012

Tibben","Erasmus Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands","The introduction of new techniques for screening of genetic anomalies such as whole genome microarray analysis (WGA) into the clinic of prenatal dia  gnosis ensues a number of psychological challenges for pregnant couples.  WGA generates more information about the current and future health of the unborn child than conventional karyotyping (CK), the gold standard for  genetic chromosome analysis in prenatal diagnosis. One the one hand coup  les need to determine the extent of information they wish to receive about the (future) health of their unborn child. On the other, professionals may withhold or disclose information in the interest of the (health/future auto  nomy of the) unborn child. Our experience thus far is that WGA generates  more probabilistic results (e.g. increased risk of learning disabilities) than CK. Probabilistic information is more difficult to grasp than information  about actual presence of an anomaly. Moreover, probabilities represent an  uncertainty that impedes decision making. A best possible decision about the course of a desired pregnancy needs to reflect consistency with personal  values and considerations in order to be processed adequately emotionally. Thus, the broadening of knowledge about the current and future health of the unborn child implies that pregnant couples will have to anticipate a va riety of outcomes, determine the extent of information they wish to receive,  interpret the meaning of probabilistic results and assimilate the results with  personal values and considerations into their decision about the course of  their desired pregnancy.

The integration of this information into the health care setting has proved  to be much more problematic than for monogenic disorders. Furthermore, with the 1000$ genome just around the corner, there is a strong push for  the uptake of additional genomic testing. Although laudable, these advances  also bring with them a slew of ethical and social issues that challenge the normative frameworks used in clinical genetics until now. With this in mind and considering a previous report from the Dutch Health Council, we out  line herein five principles that should be considered in order to introduce  genome based technologies and information (GBTI) into public health.1) Their introduction should be based on a solid scientific foundation. 2) GBTI introduced into the health care system and financed by public funds  should be focused on significant health problems.3) The advantages of introducing and offering GBTI should outweigh the  disadvantages. 4) The autonomy of patients, and individuals in general, must be respected.5) The offer of GBTI funded from public sources should be justified in the context of the overall healthcare budget.EMPAG Workshops EW1 Parents & Children in Families with Huntingtonâs Disease L. B. Van der Meer1, A. Blom2;   1Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands, 2Academic Medical Center,  Amsterdam, Netherlands. In families with Huntingtonâs Disease (HD), family dynamics are often un favorable for the healthy psychological development of children. In a recent  study, we found that persons who grew up with a parent with HD had been  exposed to more adverse experiences in childhood than the general popu lation. This may have life long negative consequences; we found that adults  with a parent with HD have poorer mental health and more fear of intimacy  and abandonment than the general population.Recently, in the Netherlands, a meeting with professionals (psychologists, social workers) was held, to explore the nature and extent of problems that  professionals encounter in their work with HD families. It was agreed that  HD families present with specific difficulties concerning parents and child ren. Adequate support can not always be given, because couples may not  be open for support with child rearing, and because existing support is not  tailored to the needs of HD families.Professionals working in Clinical Genetics, where persons apply for predicti   ve testing and receive counseling on reproductive options, may have an op  portunity to address parenting issues in an early stage, before neurological  diagnosis of HD and before problems with parent child interactions occur.In this workshop, we will exchange experiences with parent child issues in HD families, and with existing forms of support. Hopefully, we can coopera te in a search for more adequate, specialized programs for prevention and intervention, so that children who are growing up in HD families now and in the future have optimal chances of becoming stable adults. EW2 Methodological guidelines for empirical validation of genetic counselling interventions J. C. Rocha ;   UnIPSa, ISCS N, Gandra, Portugal. Actual constraints and better awareness of critical factors underlying psy   chosocial based interventions had increased needs, and doubts, about ge netic counselling efficacy and effectiveness. Further from the ethical foun dations of genetic counseling importance and simple experience based evi dences, there is still a huge gap on empirical validation of genetic counseling interventions and still low number on meta analytical results are conclusi ve. We had advocated on several contexts the need for substantial evidences about efficacy and efficiency of genetic counseling interventions and about better understanding of interview skills and programs structure specific im pacts. Based on this point of view, it is proposed a model for future research on genetic counseling clinical research based on known guidelines adapted to this context.Aspects related to frequent difficulties on randomized controlled trials as: 1. Manualization of interventions respecting broad literature reviews and clinical opinions; 2. Sampling aspects envisaging minimum bias; 3. Aspects concerned with proper control groups; 4. Sophistication of methodological design; 5. Problems with outcome measures; 6. Statistical aspects to quan tify counselling effects; 7. Concerns will long term effects, acceptability and robustness of interventions, are addressed on this workshop and specific research contingencies are reflected.Guidelines are operationalized and explained on two levels of discussion: past relevant research examples and based on ongoing or future participantâs projects.

 The challenge of diagnosis and counseling for intermediate alleles in Huntingtonâs disease: a clinical example,EP01.01,"A. Van Tongerloo1, P . Santens2, K. Claes1, A. De Paepe1",1Dept,"of Medical Genetics, University Hospital Gent, 9000 Gent, Belgium, 2Dept.of  Neurology, University Hospital Gent, 9000 Gent, Belgium. In presymptomatic testing for Huntingtonâs disease (HD), counselees expect  to receive a clear cut result about their carrier status. However, we are in  creasingly confronted with counseling dilemmas related to the presence of  intermediate (IA) or reduced penetrance (RP)alleles, of which the individual clinical outcome is more difficult to predict than for full penetrance alleles.  Moreover, these alleles can expand into full penetrance alleles upon trans  mission , which has specific disease risk implications for the offspring.We present a family in which the index patient, a 45 year old man, was clini cally diagnosed with HD and shown to carry a HD allele with 43 CAG repeats.  Remarkably, he was the youngest in a sibship of nine, with no other affected  individuals in the family. His father, who died at age 78, reportedly showed  aggressive behavior throughout his life but the diagnosis of HD had never been suspected in him. His mother died at age 77 without signs of HD.Subsequently, six siblings requested presymptomatic testing: three showed  a normal molecular test result, although, in two of them, the pre test neuro  logic evaluation was inconclusive regarding the possibility of early signs of HD; three other sibs had an IA of 34 CAG. The clinical history of the father suggested that, most likely, he also a carried the 34 CAG allele and that ex   pansion occurred in the index patient. This case illustrates the unusual segregation and counseling issues that may  arise in families segregating an intermediate HD allele.",2012

Aim: The aim of the present study is to investigate the psychological well  being of presymptomatic Huntingtonâs disease (HD) gene carriers and non carriers 6 12 months after the genetic testing.Methods: From May 2009 to October 2011 we evaluated 18 presymthoma tic subjects resulted carriers of HD gene and 18 noncarriers. The instrument used is the Psychological General Well being Index (PWBGI).Results: Both the 18 subjects resulted carriers (N:18, M:5, F:13; mean age: 47,35, range age: 26 75) and the 18 subjects noncarriers (N:18, M:7, F:11; mean age: 45,93, range age: 26 69) donât show any significant difference from normative data, but the carriers mean scores are lower than the nor   mative scores; moreover the Global Index Score indicate a moderate level of distress (71,37). The Student T test comparison between carriers and non carriers shows statistically significant differences in Vitality scale (11,78 versus 14,56; p<.01) and in the Global Index Score (71,37 versus 82,33; p<.05).Conclusions: The results of the present study indicate that the presympto matic HD gene carriers in comparison with noncarriers 6 12 months after genetic testing present a significant lower vitality and a significant worse le vel of the global index of well being. The research, despite the limited samp le, highlights a psychological critical situation in presymptomatic HD gene carriers and suggests the importance of specific psychosocial interventions.

As Klass  (1988) pointed out, this experience can have an effect of estrangement bet   ween the couple.We know by experience that women often complain about  their partners who seem to have no grief feelings. Peppers and Knaps (1980) called out our attention to the tremendous differences between women and  men mourning processes and named it Incongruent Grief.  If we take this  knowledge to our practice we will be able to help the couple to recognize  these differences in a good instead of a scary way. What about the cons of a diagnosis/predictive testing kept in secret? We  will discuss a case of a woman who decided not to confess her diagnosis of Familial Amyloidotic Polyneuropathy to her husband, and how that decision  put the couple bonds at risk. We will compare this case with another woman  who asked for family support the diagnosis of CADASIL. Accepting that the secret was a bigger risk, than the disclosure, for her familyâ bonds, she deci   ded to share the diagnosis with her partner and son.

The role of the patient expected by the counselor may therefore be less evident to the patient. This observation was then communicated to the counselor along with suggestions of how to deal with such negotiations.Discussion: This analysis illustrates, that CA might be a useful tool to analyze the interaction in genetic counseling, because of the data driven approach.

Overwhelmingly research has demonstrated that dialogue is domi   nated by the clinician, with content being mostly educational or scientific in rather than psychosocial.This presentation will illustrate how an interactional sociolinguistic frame work, in particular, one making use of Mishlerâs âvoicesâ in medical consulta   tions, can enable researchers and clinicians to gain a greater understanding of the apparent medical dominance illustrated in these studies (Mishler, 1984).Mishler describes two different âvoicesâ present during medical interactions. Talk relating to the knowledge and experience of the client is described as the âvoice of the lifeworldâ. The âvoice of medicineâ refers to the technical, scientific talk of the medical world. Mishler argues that the typical or âunre markable interviewâ is dominated by the voice of medicine, while the voice of the lifeworld remains mostly suppressed. Barry et al. support Mishlerâs theory that allowing more space for the lifeworld can result in more efficient medical consultations (Barry et al. 2001).In analysing two contrasting paediatric clinical genetic consultations we track the voice of medicine and the voice of the lifeworld through the lens of interactional sociolinguistics. It will be demonstrated how clinicians can effectively engage with the voice of the lifeworld, while preserving other es  sential elements of the consultation.We believe that this framework could be useful for both researchers and clinicians to enhance a client centred model of care.",2012

Nevertheless, only a small proportion of families are referred to a cli nical genetics service for proper genetic counseling. In Portugal, there are no published studies about the prior beliefs of parents about the causes of hereditary hearing loss of their children and their genetic knowledge after the genetic counseling offered by professionals with specific training. The aim of this study was to assess beliefs about possible causes of non syndro mic neurossensorial prelingual deafness in order to improve the quality of communication.Methods: Forty four parents (24 mothers, 20 fathers) of twenty four child  ren with the diagnosis of non syndromic neurossensorial prelingual deaf   ness due to mutations in the connexin 26 gene (GJB2 ) answered a question  naire about genetic knowledge before and after the genetic counseling.Results: Before counseling 15.9% of the parents knew the cause of deaf   ness, while at a post counseling setting this percentage was significantly higher. No differences were found between the answers of mothers and fa thers before and after genetic counseling. Parentsâ level of education was a significant factor in pre test knowledge. After genetic counseling 95.5% of the parents stated that the clinical genetics consultation had met their expectations; 70.5% remembered the inherited pattern, 93.2% recalled the recurrence risk of deafness.Conclusion: It is important genetic counselors to take into account parentsâ beliefs and assess their genetic knowledge, in order to increase the know   ledge and demystifying parentsâ beliefs.

Ulph;   University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom. Research examining parentsâ experiences of receiving carrier result in  formation from newborn screening suggests that anxiety and distress are  caused by unpreparedness for results and how these results are communi  cated, rather than the results per se. Questions have been raised about how feasible it is to convey newborn screening information adequately during  pregnancy, a time when parents often experience information overload. To  understand how these newborn screening processes can be improved for future generations and to investigate the feasibility of providing newborn screening prior to pregnancy, young adultsâ understanding of and attitudes  towards newborn screening were investigated. Thirty four young adults,  with no experience of screening, took part in one of seven focus groups. The   matic analysis suggested that respondents recognised the benefits of carrier  knowledge on altering future reproductive decisions, and despite concern  regarding the stigmatisation of carriers, typically expressed a desire to have access to personal carrier status. After viewing key information from Cystic  Fibrosis and Sickle Cell Disease websites, adults became preoccupied by the  personal threat of being a Cystic Fibrosis carrier, yet did not acknowledge the risk of being a Sickle Cell Disease carrier, despite re evaluating its per ceived severity. Some adults were unable to accurately interpret inheritance  diagrams. Young adults were not interested in receiving screening informa  tion prior to pregnancy; rationales varied from worry associated with scree  ning information (avoidance) to the inability to conceptualise its relevance (denial). Incremental impartation of information aimed at increasing adultâs interest in screening to enable them to appreciate the personal relevance is suggested. EP3 Reproductive Decision making",2012

Myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1) is a neuromuscular, multisystem, progres   sive disease, with autosomal dominant inheritance. Genetic counselling is a delicate process in this disease, as reproductive decisions are difficult due to the variable clinic presentation and the phenomenon of anticipation of age at onset. We planned (1) to assess the impact of genetic counselling in fami lies with DM1, their reproductive choices and the factors that influenced it, (2) to consider the results of prenatal diagnosis, and (3) to assess the influ ence of psychosocial elements in their reproductive planning. A retrospec   tive study of 10 years used a questionnaire aimed at couples with a family history of DM1, followed by genetic counselling for reproductive planning. The main reproductive choice was not to have children (55.6%), followed by pregnancy and prenatal diagnosis (33.3%). In 60% of those couples who had prenatal diagnosis, the foetus was a carrier and the option was for ter   mination of pregnancy. The main factors that have influenced reproductive decisions were (1) the risk of having an affected child, and (2) the existence of other children prior to genetic counselling; (3) the psychosocial impact of the disease also contributed to the reproductive choices. Genetic counselling has a strong impact on reproductive choices in families with DM1. A multi   disciplinary team should always be involved in the counselling process, to meet the expectations and the needs of counselees and their families, and to provide the support they need at all stages of their decision making process about reproductive options.",2012

Reasons for not informing relatives may be categorized as a lack of: 1) knowledge, 2) motivation and/or 3) self perceived competence. The aim of this cross sectional study was to develop and assess the psychometric properties of an instrument that measures counseleesâ knowledge, motivation and self perceived compe tence.Methods Consecutive counselees who visited the department of Genetics with que stions regarding the possibility of hereditary breast and/or ovarian cancer or colon cancer (including Lynch and FAP/MAP) were asked to complete a home sent questionnaire after receiving a summary letter from the de   partment of Genetics. This letter included information from the last coun selling session. Knowledge, motivation and self perceived competence were assessed with a study specific questionnaire. Analyses will address the ac ceptability of the instrument, its dimensionality (i.e. whether knowledge, motivation and self perceived competence items constitute separate scales), the reliability of separate scales and the instruments validity.ResultsOverall, 214 of 343 questionnaires were included in the analyses (response rate 62%); 108 breast and/ovarian cancer and 106 colon cancer. We will report on the instrumentsâ acceptability and its properties to reliably and validly assess counselee characteristics that might hamper sharing genetic information with relatives.

To date, 58 women who underwent genetic  counselling for BC between 2003 and 2011 have been interviewed, and the data of 42 were available for a preliminary analysis. Age ranged from 24 71  years. The majority of women considered the information received during  counselling as clear (quite clear: 31.0%; very clear: 33.3%; extremely clear: 21.4%) and helpful (quite helpful: 33.3%; very helpful: 33.3%; extremely helpful: 7.1%). Twenty five (59.5%) stated that their perceived risk of BC  had changed after the counselling: for 20 (80%) it had decreased, for 3  (12%) increased, while 2 did not specify. Twelve (28.6%) declared to have made useful decision for their health after the counselling: most appropri   ate breast surveillance (75.0%, n,9), healthier lifestyle (8.3%, n,1) or in tensification of surveillance for fear (8.3%, n,1). Nevertheless 27 women (64.3%) stated they had not followed the surveillance recommended by the counsellor.

 Counselling and clinical implications of an unclassified variant in MLH1 in a family with a history suggestive of Lynch Syndrome.,EP05.03,"W. H. Beckett , D. G. R. Evans","Genetic Medicine, St Maryâs Hospital and Manchester Academic Health Sciences Centre, Manchester, United Kingdom","Unclassified variants (UVs or variants of unknown significance) are now a relatively frequent occurrence in genetic tests. Differentiating between a benign polymorphism and a pathogenic mutation can be technically diffi   cult, particularly for missense changes and intronic variants. A number of strategies exist to help this process, but it is not always possible to confirm/exclude pathogenicity because of insufficient data, lack of resources and/or samples from other affected and unaffected individuals within the family. In this case a clinical diagnosis may be tentative and/or predictive testing is unavailable. Genetic professionals face challenges when communicating this information to patients and families. The lack of certainty can cause confu sion and/or frustration. We present a case study that highlights some of the counselling implications. A 45 year old woman was referred because of a family history of colon, endometrial and pancreatic cancer. This was sugge stive of Lynch syndrome, and the patient was considered to be at 50% risk. She was keen to pursue predictive genetic test to clarify the risk for her and her children. Immunohistochemistry in her cousinâs bowel cancer and her motherâs endometrial cancer showed loss of MLH1 protein, and molecular testing in the cousin identified a UV in the MLH1 gene. In silico analysis sug  gested the variant was pathogenic, but no confirmatory tests (e.g. functional studies) were available. Therefore, predictive genetic testing to refine the patientâs risk was not possible. She found this frustrating, particularly given the invasive nature of bowel and endometrial screening.",2012

G. Vreeswijk, C. J. van Asperen","Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","Background: In nearly 15% of BRCA1/2 tests an unclassified variant (UV) is  identified. In the Netherlands the four group classification system of Bell is in use. In the current practice, class III UVs are communicated with the coun selees and class II are not. Aim was to investigate whether UVs in classes II and III showed significant differences in their in silico characteristics and  would this classification justify differences in counseling protocols regar ding communication.Methods: 88 missense UVs in BRCA1/2 were analyzed. In silico analysis of  UVs was performed using SIFT analysis, Grantham score and AGVGD for the predicted severity of amino acid substitutions.Results: 60% (n,53) of the UVs were predicted to be tolerated by SIFT ana   lysis and scored as neutral (C0) by AGVGD. Of the remaining 35 UVs, sixteen were scored as C0, eight were scored C15 C25 (intermediate) and eleven were scored C35 C65 (likely to be deleterious). Class III UVs more frequent ly show in silico parameter outcomes suspicious for a deleterious effect. The  observed differences, however, are not absolute. Four UVs classified in class II had similar in silico profiles to five UVs in class III.Conclusion: This study showed that in general in silico analysis is consistent  ly applied and is able to discriminate between different classes of UVs. Ad ditional analyses will be required to classify UVs with more certainty. To re duce psychological distress in UV families we propose that communication of an UV should not primarily depend on its class, but on the possibility to perform additional research in the family.",2012

We are  evaluating a different format for such an intake: telephone, written and di gital information sent to BC patientsâ homes, and face to face contact follo wing BRCA testing (DNA direct). Patients/Methods: From August 1st 2011 to February 1st 2012, 160 BC patients referred for BRCA testing could choose between DNA intake and  DNA direct. Participants received questionnaires on psychological distress and satisfaction, just after inclusion and following face to face BRCA result  disclosure.

Teachable moments have been used in preventive care to promote changes in life styles (i.e. smoking cessation) and to improve cancer screening adherence. In cancer genetic counseling, teachable moments could be a form of opportunistic counseling that could take advantages of health concerns and events in patientsâ lives to increase willingness and commitment to change behavior and to improve adherence to cancer screening and prophylactic measures.

This integrative, multitheoretical, dual model, combing individual and team based supervision provided by consultative supervisors, contri buted to local awards for excellence in patient care, team working and part nerships. The project was undertaken as a collaborative endeavour between the team and the team supervisor, the Head of Psychosocial Services at Alder Hey Childrenâs NHS Foundation Trust, Liverpool. Normative, formative and summative evaluation was designed in at the start of the programme by the supervisor. The Lead and Deputy Lead Genetic Counsellors, in their capacity as supervisees and senior practitioners with leadership and management responsibilities for the team, contributed principles from real world, action research and summative evaluation. Whilst this is specific to a particular team of UK NHS professionals, as a flexible and pragmatic model of reflective practice designed to support and develop healthcare professionals, the prin ciples, framework and structural components which informed the model, and the data it has produced, are likely to be of wider interest in the genetic counselling community and beyond. There is particular significance for the wellbeing and continuing professional development of staff and the enhan cement of the of quality patient care.",2012

In  2011 the survey was extended to a larger population of Italian nurses by  using a questionnaire uploaded to the Survey MonkeyTM website. Specialist  genetic nurses currently work in many countries; however there are very few genetic nurses in Italy and the knowledge of Italian nurses to provide  care for people with or at risk for genetic conditions in unclear. Out of 102 (85%) nurses and midwives responding to first study, 61% belie  ved genetic counselling was only an informative and advisory process, while  53.9% did not specify; 62% (n,63) did not identify nursesâ role in genetic healthcare, but 28% (n,26) believed nurses could provide information and  support. The second study was completed by 385 nurses, the majority (40.4%,  n,131) correctly answered four of five questions on knowledge of genetics.  Knowledge scores did not change by age, but was positively correlated with academic qualification. Only a minority (26.8%, n,103) of respondents be  lieved genetics was very relevant to the nursing role. The findings of these studies indicate that although nurses have the basic  knowledge of genetics, they need more education not only on genetics to  pics, but also on the transferability of those into nursing care.",2012

E learning in Genetics Multimedia Educational Training Program,EP06.08,C. Gug,"University of Medicine and Pharmacy âVictor Babesâ, Timisoara, Romania","Telemedicine is born with the Internet.Tele education is one of its applicati   on. An on line learning infrastructure is considered essential for the delivery  of educational programs in medical genetics.The use of a performing anima   tion system allows the geneticists to explain the essence of the fundamental  genetic phenomena. The flash technology was used to access animation on  the Internet, as it already represents a standard in creating animation that  has Internet impact. The navigation system of the FLASH animation allows each scene to be accessed separately using representative images of a scene as buttons. Respecting the scientific truth by taking into account the limits  imposed by the technical possibilities may represent a true challenge for the  people involved. For didactic purposes, the phenomena (mitosis, chromoso   me and chromatin structure, DNA replication and DNA repair) were divided  into several stages. The number of the scenes is directly proportional with  the complexity of the phenomenon. As learning in the traditional manner involves transmitting the information under the form of a text simultaneous  with the scrolling image, a short explanation of the scene is inserted. The  text is available in English and Romanian. The use of the multimedia (gra phics and 3D animation) programes enhances teaching process of any fun damental genetic phenomenon and contributes to the computer supported  training in the field of medical genetics.

Future service development must be informed by the perspectives of patients to ensure that services are accessible and meet their needs.METHOD: Semi structured telephone interviews were undertaken with pa tients referred to the Genetic Eye Clinic in Manchester, UK. Participants were interviewed before their first appointment. The interview transcripts were analysed using Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA).RESULTS: Forty six people were invited to participate and 9 agreed to be EMPAG Posterswww.eshg.org Abstracts   European Human Genetics Conference 2012435 www.eshg.orginterviewed (response rate 20%): 5 participants were patients with a visual  impairment; 4 were the parent/carer of a child patient. The major themes  identified were: lack of preparation and restricted expectations due to un  familiarity with the service; psychological adjustment to the diagnosis of an eye condition impacting on needs and expectations; concern about the futu   re; hope for future treatments; and, positive attitudes towards genetics.CONCLUSIONS: The participants had consistently positive attitudes towards genetic eye services, genetic testing and genetic research. However lack of preparation and knowledge of available services, particularly genetic coun  selling, meant families may not get the most out of their appointment. A  leaflet, available in a range of formats, has been devised to improve patient experience.

A single case study  approach was taken to evaluate the initiative, collecting data from multip   le sources. Themed semi structured interviews were held with all CGNs,  Cardiology and Genetics Clinical Leads from each of the nine sites, Genetic  Counsellors and a patient representative, at key points during the project.  A patient focus group was also held. Detailed thematic analysis of the quali   tative data was conducted using NVivo 8.0. Three broad categories emerge from the data pertaining to the quality of patient/family experience:1. âContinuityâ relates to the CGN role in providing support and continuity  along the patient journey. Time, Giving clarity, and Managing anxiety and  uncertainty, are important sub themes. 2. âCoordinating care for the patient and familyâ highlights the CGN role in  providing patient and family centred care, with sub themes of Preparing; Having the bigger picture; and Knowing the patient and family. 3. âCoordinating care across the pathwayâ concerns the CGN role in coordina  ting the multidisciplinary team across the two specialties and linking with  primary and secondary care and others. The CGNs enhance the quality of the patient/family experience through an holistic approach to care, offering clarity and continuity along a potentially  complex pathway, often at a time when patients and families will be feeling  particularly vulnerable.

Clinical guidelines for health practitioners suggest that adolescents should be seen on their own for part of the clinic consultation. However, little is known of parental attitudes on this issue. We explored the views of parents of adolescents in our Metabolic Clinic, in which this is standard practice.Of 40 eligible parents, 33 completed a questionnaire handed to them in clinic, seeking parental understanding of confidentiality, their views about when information should be shared with them and their perception of bene fits/concerns of consulting with young people alone.The main advantages parents identified in adolescents seeing clinicians alone were: practicing talking to the doctor alone; taking responsibility for their own health; helping them become more mature.Concerns identified included the possibility of not being informed about important issues (including eating disorders, cigarette smoking, alcohol and illicit drug use, pregnancy, and problems with parents); not being in  formed of the treatment plan, and concerns about their child possibly not  understanding the issues or not remembering the treatment plan. Parental understanding of a confidential consultation with young people alone was remarkably similar to that in a general adolescent clinic (N,86), but they  were more likely to see the advantages of confidential discussions in pro  moting self management skills. However, they seemed more protective of their children, as evidenced by their expectation that medical consultations  where their children are seen alone, should begin at a later age.",2012

Such technology is frequently used in research to understand the genomic basis of disease and will very soon be used within clinical health services.It has been considered good practice for many years to conduct genomic research anonymously and not share any individual results with research participants. However, there is mounting pressure to change this approach and begin to share individual results with research participants. There is, however, no clear guidance or evidence to suggest what sort of data research participants want   should it only relate to clinically actionable conditions or would participants be interested in receiving results with broader implicati   ons or even their raw sequence data? There is an urgent need for large scale empirical research to gather evidence on what is reasonable, responsible and indeed ethical to share.As a contribution to this process we have designed a mixed methods study and have launched an innovative questionnaire (see www.genomethics.org) that uses film to explore the ethical implications of whole genome research. The questionnaire is accessed online. We are inviting genetic counsellors, genomic researchers, health professionals and lay members of the public worldwide to complete the questionnaire and are aiming for 20,000+ re sponses.

Although innovative, and hold large financial interest, the ethical issues in volved in this process should be discussed. A key role has to be devoted for assessing quality of laboratories and delivering information regarding such tests. Many other aspects have been discussed in the preparatory debates to the revision, such as consent issues or biobanks and are absent from the proposal. However these issues are among the most problematic in research and practice. Thus these work alerts discuss the consequences of this lack of regulation.

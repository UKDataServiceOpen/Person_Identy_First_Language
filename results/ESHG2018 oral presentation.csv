Lappalainen1,2","1New York Genome Center, New York, NY, United States,","2Columbia University, New York, NY, United States Detailed characterization of cellular effects of genetic var  iants is essential for understanding biological processes thatunderlie genetic associations to disease, to improve the interpretation of the personal genome, and to characterize the genetic architecture of molecular variation. This hasinspired large consortium projects to create and integrate population scale genome data with transcriptome data –as well as other molecular phenotype data –in human popu  lations. The catalogs of genetic effects on the transcriptome across multiple human tissues and conditions now allows downstream discovery in diverse questions in genetics,including joint effects of regulatory and coding variants underlying modi ﬁed penetrance of disease causing variants, and novel methods to understand variation in gene dosagein human populations and patients.T.

 Recent advances in mutational signatures of human cells,PL1.2,S. Nik Zainal,"Department of Medical Genetics, Cambridge, United Kingdom","A cancer genome contains the historic mutagenic activity that has occurred throughout the development of atumour. While driver mutations were the main focus of cancer research for a long time, passenger mutational signatures   the imprints of DNA damage and DNA repairprocesses that have been operative during tumorigenesis   are also biologicall y informative. In this lecture, I provide a synopsis of this concept, describe the insights that wehave gained through combinations of computational analysis and experiments i n cell based systems, and showcase how we have developed the concept intoapplications that we hope to translate into clinical utility in the near future.

Ascertainment bias towards affected individuals and their families has in part shaped our understanding of genepenetrance. Here we report, for the ﬁrst time, rates of pathogenic variation in hereditary cancer genes across thousands of healthy elderly individuals, ascertained with out reference to clinical phenotype or family history, enrolled in an aspirin primary prevention trial. Materials and Methods : Individuals enrolled in the ASPirin in Reducing Events in the Elderly (ASPREE) Healthy Ageing Biobank were screened using a 760 gene ‘super panel ’including pan cancer gene coverage. The average age was 75 years (min 65 years, max. 98 years), and all participants were con ﬁrmed to be free of life  threatening cancer diagnoses, cardiovascular disease orcognitive decline at time of enrolment. Medical records, family history and clinical data were mined for evidence of cancer phenotypes in mutation carriers. Results : We detected hundreds of pathogenic and high  conﬁdence predicted deleterious mutations in hereditary cancer genes in elderly individuals (>10,000 samplessequenced Feb 2018). Mutations were often detected in the absence of any reported disease phenotype or family history. Overall, pathogenic variants were found at acomparable rate to population based cohorts, suggesting over representation of non penetrant individuals in this study. Conclusions : Pathogenic germline mutations in cancer predisposition genes may exist more commonly in the population than expected, raising questions about clinicalactionability, risk and penetrance.P.

 CRISPR QTL mapping as a genome wide association framework for cellular genetic screens of the noncodinggenome,PL2.2,"M. Gasperini1, A. Hill1, J. L. McFaline Figueroa1, B. Martin1,","C. Trapnell1, N. Ahituv2, J.

Although most are thought to disrupt gene function by disrupting regulatory elements such as enhancers, it is stilllargely unknown which noncoding regions constitute true enhancers, nor which genes each enhancer in ﬂuences. To empirically address this, we have developed CRISPR QTLmapping, a framework in which large numbers of noncod  ing perturbations are introduced to each cell on an isogenic background, followed by single cell RNA sequencing(scRNA seq). This framework is borrowed from conven  tional human expression quantitative loci (eQTL) studies, but with individual humans replaced by individual cells;variants replaced by 'unlinked' combinations of guide RNA  programmed perturbations per cell; and tissue level RNA  seq of many individuals replaced by scRNA seq of manycells. We applied CRISPR QTL mapping to evaluate 1,119 candidate enhancers with no strong a priori hypothesis as to their target gene(s). Perturbations were made by a nuclease dead Cas9 tethered to KRAB, and introduced at a mean ‘allele frequency ’of 1.1% into a population of 47,650 proﬁled human K562 cells (median of 15 gRNAs identi ﬁed per cell). We tested for differential expression of all genes within 1 megabase of each candidate enhancer, evaluating 17,584 potential enhancer target gene relationships in oneexperiment. We identify 128 cisCRISPR QTLs whose targeting resulted in downregulation of 105 nearby genes (of which 49 genes are thought to underlie disease). Weanticipate that the power of CRISPR QTL mapping will facilitate the comprehensive characterization of enhancer  gene relationships, thus advancing interpretation of non coding variants discovered through WGS.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 749M.

 Elimination of aneuploid cells in the early mammalianembryo,PL2.3,"S. Singla, M. Zernicka Goetz","University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Whole chromosomal aneuploidies   loss and/or gain of chromosomes from a euploid complement   are responsible for the low fecundity in humans. Here we use mouseembryo as a model system to understand how mosaic aneuploidy affects embryonic development. To experimentally induce chromosome missegregation in thecleavage stage embryos, we inhibit the master spindle assembly checkpoint kinase Mps1, which results in a high percentage of aneuploid cells in the embryos. We introducemosaicism in the system by making chimeras using euploid and aneuploid cells. Detailed analysis of such chimeras revealed that during blastocyst maturation abnormal cellscontributing to the inner cell mass undergo preferential elimination up to 40%. Using an in vitro culture system capable of recapitulating in vivo mosaic embryos duringperi implantation development and time lapse imaging, we have found aneuploid cells are further preferentially elimi  nated from the epiblast via apoptosis. Moreover, wedemonstrate that autophagy genes are signi ﬁcantly upre  gulated in aneuploid cells. Using pharmacological treat  ments to knockdown genes involved in autophagyapoptosis, we have found the onset of autophagy mediated apoptosis during embryogenesis. Overall, our ﬁndings suggest that p53 mediated autophagy promotes apoptosis ofaneuploid cells in mouse preimplantation embryos. This work gives an insight into the mechanisms behind sub  fertility, developmental defects, and miscarriages duringpregnancy.

Withthe help of massively parallel sequencing technologies, the majority of these rare disorders have been linked to patho  genic variants in genes encoding glycosyltransferases ( “lin  keropathies ”), sulfotransferases, epimerases or transporters, required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG) biosynthesis. These ﬁndings support the existence of a new group of inborn errors of development de ﬁned by impaired GAG biosynthesis. However, several ﬁndings suggest that GAG synthesis is more complex than previously described and that there are anumber of partners of unknown function still to be identi ﬁed. Using exome sequencing, we identi ﬁed homozygous mutations in SLC10A7 inﬁve individuals with a skeletal dysplasia with dislocations and amelogenesis imperfecta. Common features were severe growth retardation<  3SD, cleft palate, yellow/brown teeth, knee dislocations, spineanomalies and advanced carpal ossi ﬁcation. SLC10A7 encodes a 10 transmembrane domain transporter located at the plasma membrane, with a yet unidenti ﬁed substrate. Functional studies in vitro demonstrated that SLC10A7 mutations were loss of functions mutations reducing SLC10A7 protein expression. We generated a Slc10a7  /  mouse model which displayed short long bones, growth plate disorganization and tooth enamel anomalies, recapi  tulating the human phenotype. Furthermore, we identi ﬁed decreased heparan sulfate levels in Slc10a7 / mouse cartilage and patient ﬁbroblasts. Finally, we found an abnormal N glycoprotein electrophoretic pro ﬁle in patient blood samples. Together, our ﬁndings support the involve  ment of SLC10A7 in glycosaminoglycan synthesis and speciﬁcally in skeletal and tooth development. J. Dubail: None. C. Huber: None. S. Chantepie: None. S.

 Local and global chromatin interactions are altered bylarge genomic deletions associated with human brain development,PL2.5,"X. Zhang1, Y. Zhang2, X. Zhou1, C. Purmann1, M. S. Haney1,","T. R. Ward1, J. Yao3, S. M. Weissman3, A. E. Urban1","1Stanford University, Palo Alto, CA, United States,2Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States,3Yale University, New Haven, CT, United States Large copy number variants (CNVs) in the human genome are strongly associated with common neurodevelopmental,neuropsychiatric disorders such as schizophrenia and aut  ism. Using Hi C analysis of long range chromosome interactions, including a novel approach for haplotype speciﬁc Hi C analysis, and ChIP Seq analysis of regulatory histone marks, we studied the epigenomic effects of the prominent heterozygous large deletion CNV on chromo some 22q11.2, with replication analyses for the CNV on 1q21.1 [BioRxiv 182451]. There are local and global gene expression changes as well as pronounced and multilayered effects on chromatin states, chromosome folding and topological domains of the chromatin, that emanate from the large CNV locus.Regulatory histone marks are altered in the deletion ﬂanking regions, in opposing directions for activating and repressing marks. Histone marks are changed along chromosome 22qand genome wide. Chromosome interaction patterns are weakened within the deletion boundaries and strengthened between the deletion ﬂanking regions. The long range folding contacts between the telomeric end of chromosome 22q and the distal deletion  ﬂanking region are increased. Using haplotype speci ﬁc Hi C analysis we determined that on the chromosome 22q with deletion the topological domain spanning the CNV boundaries is deleted in its entirety while neighboring domains interact more intenselywith each other. Finally, there is a widespread and complex effect on chromosome interactions genome wide, i.e. involving all other autosomes, with some of this effect tiedto the deletion region on 22q11.2. These ﬁndings suggest novel principles of how such large genomic deletions can alter nuclear organization and affectgenomic molecular activity. NIH grants X. Zhang: None. Y. Zhang: None. X.

 miR 204 overexpression exerts a protective role in inherited retinal diseases,PL2.6,"M. Karali1,2, E. Marrocco1, M. Pizzo1, I. Guadagnino1,","A. Carissimo1, I. Conte1, E. M. Surace1,3, S.

Their high genetic heterogeneity hinders the devel  opment of effective gene based therapies. We have recentlydemonstrated that the microRNA miR 204 is essential for retinal function and plays a pathogenic role in IRD in humans. Therefore, we investigated the potential ther apeutic action of this microRNA in IRDs. Materials and Methods: We delivered by subretinal injection an adeno associated viral vector carrying the miR 204 precursor to the Aipl1 knockout and the P347S  RHO transgenic mouse lines, models of autosomal recessive and dominant forms of IRDs, respectively. The impact on retinalfunction and degeneration was assessed by electroretino  graphic and immunohistological analyses. Results: We detected a notable improvement of the ERG response in the miR 204 injected eyes of P347S  RHO mice. This effect persisted for two months post injection and was prevalent under photopic conditions that re ﬂect cone activity. We also observed a preservation of cone photo  receptors and a signi ﬁcant decrease in apoptotic photo  receptor cells. Photoreceptors were better preserved also inthe miR204 injected eyes of Aipl1 knockout mice. Tran  scriptome analysis suggested that dampening of microglia activation represents one of the main mechanisms under lying the neuroprotective effect of miR 204. Conclusions: Ourﬁndings indicate that the subretinal delivery of miR 204 attenuates retinal degeneration in IRDmouse models and preserves retinal function, supporting the gene independent therapeutic potential of this microRNA.

Hydration of their reduced forms (either spontaneously if the temperature is elevated or following speciﬁc enzymatic processes) leads to the accumulation of NADHX and NADPHX, which are toxic and can inhibit a number of dehydrogenases. Highly conserved dehydrataseNAD(P)HX Dehydratase (NAXD) is one of the key intra  cellular NADHX/NADPHX repair enzymes. Materials and Methods: We describe 6 unrelated children with generally fever induced recurrent episodic neurological impairment and/or cardiac failure with early demise, and its genetic basis. Results: Genomic sequencing revealed biallelic NAXD variants in all cases, and in silico analyses predicting potential pathogenicity for each of them. Pathogenicity wasfunctionally validated using patient ﬁbroblasts through a combination of transcript analysis (splicing abnormality in one case), demonstration of markedly elevated S NADHX,R NADHX and cyclic NADHX, impaired mitochondrial function, and reduced viability in culture media containing galactose and azide but not glucose. Transduction withwildtype NAXD restored damaged metabolite levels back to normal. Finally, in vitro studies revealed that the two missense variants [(p.(Gly63Ser) and p.(Arg608Cys)] werethermolabile, and speci ﬁc ATP dependent NADHX dehy  dratase activity showed abnormal enzyme kinetics. Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst report of a human disorder caused by NAXD de ﬁciency, showing remarkable clinical overlap with the other known defect of the NADH/NADPH repair pathway, NAXE de ﬁciency.

Deletion cause Williams Beuren syn  drome (WBS) characterized by hypersociability, anxiety and intellectual disability, while duplication give rise to 7qduplication syndrome (7DupASD) with severe impairments in language, anxiety and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Despite the well established genetic underpinnings of thesedisorders effective treatments are unavailable. Converging evidence points to GTF2I as a major player mediating the cognitive behavioral phenotype associated with WBS and7DupASD. We showed previously in patient derived iPSC and neural progenitors that GTF2I associates with LSD1 to suppress expression of genes involved in neuronal function,whereas inhibition of LSD1 restored gene expression balance. Here we used mouse models together with patient derived 3D cortical organoids and single cell transcriptomics to dissectthe molecular foundations of WBS and 7DupASD. Mice with duplication of GTF2I faithfully recapitulated the ASD like phenotype in the three chambered sociability apparatus.Remarkably, inhibition of LSD1 with an irreversible inhibitor, rescued the ASD like phenotype. Bulk and single cell RNAseq from cortical organoids revealed divergent dynam ics of neuronal maturation with accelerated maturation in 7DupASD and decelerated in WBS organoids resulting in a divergent neural fate, which was con ﬁrmed by relative abundance of basal progenitor populations. Strikingly, knockdown of GTF2I in 7DupASD organoids rescued neu  ronal maturation rate to control levels. These ﬁndings suggest that GTF2I LSD1 axis plays a critical role in social behavior and cognition by controlling the timing of cortical maturation. A. Lopez Tobon: None. R. Shyti: None. E.

Here we have used whole exome sequencing to uncover the endo plasmic reticulum lipid desaturase DEGS1 as the cau  sative gene of a novel leukodystrophy. This enzyme catalizes the ﬁn a ls t e pi nt h e de novo biosynthesis of ceramides controlling the conv ersion of dihydroceramide (DhCer) to ceramide (Cer), and may play intriguing roles in antiapoptotic, and anabolic and insulin signalling.Through international collaborative networks, we have identi ﬁed eighteen patients from twelve unrelated families carrying biallelic de leterious variants in the DEGS1 gene. Common features among the cases include severe hypomyelination, cerebellar atrophy, and thinning of the corpus callosum on MRI, accompanied by speechabnormalities, developmental delay and intellectual dis  ability, suggesting a critical role of DEGS1 and ceramide metabolism in myelin development and maintenance.Patients ’ﬁbroblasts exhibited accumulation of DhCer, which increased ROS production. Knockdown of the DEGS1 ortholog in Danio rerio recapitulated the bio  chemical imbalance of ceram ides, showed diminished numbers of mature oligodendrocytes and impaired locomotor abilities. The enzymatic inhibition of cer amide synthase, one step prior to DEGS1 in the pathway, by the multiple sclerosis treatment Fingolimod (FTY720), restored the critic al DhCer/Cer balance, and ameliorated the cellular and locomotor phenotypes in the zebra ﬁsh model. These results pave the way to clinical translation, illustrating the tr ansformative, timely impact of clinical genomics in patient care.

 CRISPR Cas9: How bacteria revolutionize genome engineering,PL3.1,"E. Charpentier1,2","1Max Planck Institute for Infection Biology, Berlin, Germany,","2Humboldt University, Berlin, Germany The CRISPR Cas9 system has recently emerged as a transformative technology in biological sciences, allowing rapid and ef ﬁcient targeted genome editing, chromosomal marking and gene regulation in a large variety of cells andorganisms. The system consists of Cas9, an enzyme that can be programmed with RNA guides to target site speci ﬁcally any DNA sequence of interest. The system is ef ﬁcient, versatile and easily programmable. CRISPR Cas9 research has developed into one of the most dynamic and fastest  moving ﬁelds in life sciences and holds great promise for future biotechnical and biomedical applications. The CRISPR Cas9 system is remarkably simple in its design, close to a plug and play method, which can therefore beeasily leveraged for a large variety of gene targeting. Application of the system has been extraordinarily broad, including among many others the generation of transgenicanimals, genetic modi ﬁcation of various eukaryotic cell types, and genetic modi ﬁcation of plants and crops. Tool and kit service companies offer CRISPR Cas9 related pro ducts and at least three biotechnology companies have been founded during the past years to develop the technology for the treatment of serious human genetic disorders, withprobably many more to come. Already, the CRISPR Cas9 system is an integral and critical part of the toolbox for any researcher who intends to modify genetic information bymeans of targeted introduction or correction of mutations, replacement of genes, modi ﬁcation of DNA or modulation of transcription in any cell or organism   and the applica tions of this breakthrough technology are continuing to increase at a rapid pace.

 The utility of sizing up cell free fetal DNA,S01.1,"R. ChiuHong Kong, Hong Kong",Cell free DNA molecules circulate in human plasma in the,"form of short fragments. Cell free fetal DNA demonstrate an even shorter size pro ﬁle than the circulating maternal DNA in maternal plasma. This observation could beexploited as a means to differentiate the fetal DNA popu  lation from the maternal DNA in maternal circulation. For example, aneuploidies of fetal origin may result in aberrantgenomic representation among the shorter DNA molecules in the maternal plasma sample. While noninvasive prenatal testing by maternal plasma DNA sequencing generallyprovides high sensitivities and speci ﬁcities for the detection of common fetal chromosomal aneuploidies, false positive results may occur. We reasoned that the combined used ofcell free DNA counting and size measurements may allow one to identify the false positive cases. We applied the combined protocol to test for fetal chromosomal aneu ploidies among 20,000 cases seeking NIPT screening. The approach was able to identify sex chromosome aneuploidies of maternal origin, copy number variations of maternalorigin, artefacts caused by sequencing biases or conditions that perturbed the maternal plasma DNA pro ﬁle, such as systemic lupus erythematosus. The adoption of theapproach led to a substantial reduction in the number of reports that would otherwise become a false positive result with respect to the fetal chromosome pro ﬁle. Next, we reasoned that if cell free fetal DNA molecules were shorter than the cell free maternal DNA molecules, the fragmen  tation sites of the two different population of DNA mole cules might be different. Interestingly, we demonstrated that the ending sites between the cell free fetal and maternal DNA molecules indeed showed consistent differences.Some of the ending sites were reproducibly detectable from maternal plasma collected from different pregnancies and served as a means to assess the fetal DNA fraction in thesample.

 Mommy and me sequencing: incidental detection ofmaternal abnormalities via non invasive prenatal testing,S01.2,D. W. Bianchi,"National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,Bethesda, MD, United States","Noninvasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using circulating cell  free (cf) DNA in the plasma is currently the most matureexample of implementation of genomics into clinical med  icine. Since 2011, the testing has been widely incorporated754 J. del Picchiainto prenatal care, resulting in a signi ﬁcant reduction in the number of invasive diagnostic procedures and cytogenetic analyses performed globally. Most women who undergo prenatal cf DNA screening do not realize that the testing analyzes placental as well as maternal DNA, and further  more, that maternal DNA abnormalities are sometimes theunderlying biological explanation for false positive results.

 Supporting informed choice for non invasive prenatal testing in clinical practice: How well are we doing?,S01.3,C. Lewis,"North East Thames Regional Genetics Service, Great Ormond","Street Hospital for Children NHS Foundation Trust, London, United Kingdom Non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) using cell free DNA in maternal blood is an advanced screening test which has been shown to be highly accurate for Down syndrome aswell as trisomies 13 and 18. The clinical advantages of NIPT are that the test is safe, easy to conduct and can be administered within the ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. Nevertheless, there are concerns that NIPT may compro  mise informed decision making as the risk free nature of the test may lead parents to agree to testing without ade quate consideration of the potential outcomes including a positive NIPT result (thus requiring consideration about invasive testing) or an inconclusive result. Moreover,because NIPT is a blood test, consent procedures may potentially become less rigorous than those used for inva  sive testing and the ease with which the test can be con ducted may promote routinisation of testing. A number of studies have been conducted in recent years to establish whether NIPT is undermining informed decision making. Inthis talk I will present key ﬁndings from this body of lit  erature as well as presenting the ﬁndings from my own research from the RAPID study where we adapted theMultidimensional Measure of Informed Choice (MMIC) developed by Marteau et al. (2001) for NIPT. The adaptedmeasure was used in both a research and a routine clinical setting and rates of informed choice were measured and compared. Recommendations for practice relating to how best to facilitate informed decision making in the prenatal clinic will also be discussed. C. Lewis: None. S02 DNA damage and repair in cancer",2018

 Differential DNA repair across human chromosomes shapes somatic mutation landscapes,S02.2,"F. Supek1, B.

We identify variable DNA mismatch repair (MMR) as the basis of this domain scale variation. While regionalmutation rates are broadly stable between tumors, there are systematic differences that accurately re ﬂect the cancer cell  of origin, related to changes in replication timing and geneexpression. However, mutations arising after the inactiva  tion of MMR are no longer enriched in late replicating heterochromatin relative to early replicating euchromatin.This implicates differential DNA repair as the primary causeAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 755of the large scale regional mutation rate variation across the human genome (Supek and Lehner, 2015 Nature). At the smaller, sub megabase scale, we ﬁnd that differential MMR also shapes gradients in mutation rates across gene bodies. In particular, we examined clustered mutation patterns across >1,000 tumor genomes andidenti ﬁed a novel and prevalent mutational signature matching the error prone DNA polymerase eta (POLH). Such clustered mutations occur in tumors associated withcarcinogen exposure and they target H3K36me3 marked chromatin, commonly found at 3 ’ends of transcribed genes. In the absence of carcinogens however, the H3K36me3regions have a considerably lower mutation rate. This is because the canonical, error free MMR is normally targeted towards the H3K36me3 histone mark, protecting activegenes from alterations. Carcinogens therefore not only increase mutation burden, but can also redistribute muta  tions to the more important regions of the genome byactivating error prone DNA repair. We predict this can contribute a substantial mutation load in many tumors such as melanoma, gastrointestinal tract and lung cancers, withhigh potential to yield driver mutations (Supek and Lehner, 2017 Cell).

 The Dynamics of 3D Chromatin Structures In ﬂuence Transcription and Morphogenesis,S03.2,G. Andrey,"Max Planck Institut for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany","The complex gene expression of developmental genes often relies on the communication between promoters and long  range regulatory elements called enhancers. Enhancers andpromoters can interact in the nuclear space in a tissue  speciﬁc or tissue unspeci ﬁc manner. Yet little is known about the functional role of these different modes of inter actions. Here we present two in depth functional studies illustrating how these modes of interaction contribute to achieve speci ﬁc expression patterns and transcriptional robustness in vivo. In the ﬁrst case, the disruption of a pre  established, tissue unspeci ﬁc interaction between the Shh promoter and its limb enhancer strongly reduces Shhtran  scription. In the second case, a tissue speci ﬁc enhancer  promoter interaction modulates the fore  and hindlimb activity of an enhancer to drive Pitx1 transcription in hin  dlimb only. The disturbance of this particular communica  tion in human patients and in mice with structural variationsleads to gene endo activation and a partial arm to leg transformation. In conclusion, our data not only suggest an interplay between enhancer speci ﬁcity, transcriptional robustness and 3D chromatin dynamics but also provide a framework to understand the pathomechanism of many non coding mutations.

 Transgenerational inheritance: The role of CTCF and 3D genome organization,S03.3,V. Corces,"Emory University, Atlanta, GA, United States","Mechanisms by which epiphenotypes are transmitted between generations through the paternal germline remainpoorly understood. The nuclei of mammalian sperm are thought to be highly condensed and the DNA mostly cov  ered by protamines with only a few retained nucleosomes.Epigenetic information stored in the form of DNA methy  lation is erased from paternal chromosomes after fertiliza  tion. Results from our lab suggest a more complex picture ofthe mouse sperm epigenome, indicating the presence of multiple histone modi ﬁcations at retained nucleosomes. Most promoters in mouse sperm contain the elongating formof RNA polymerase II, and are ﬂanked by several positioned nucleosomes marked by a variety of active histone mod  iﬁcations. The sperm genome is bound by several tran  scription factors, including Mediator, the pioneer factor FoxA1, and estrogen receptor alpha. These proteins are found at promoters, enhancers, and super enhancers, manyof which are active in mESCs or adult tissues. CTCF and cohesin are also present in sperm DNA, where they organize the sperm genome into domains that overlap extensivelywith those found in mESCs. This information suggests that mammalian sperm contain a rich and complex palette of epigenetic information that could be altered by environ mental factors to paint novel phenotypic outcomes in the next generation. This is supported by experiments in which pregnant females exposed to endocrine disruptor chemicalsgive rise to progeny showing a variety of phenotypes, including obesity. The obese phenotype is transmitted between generations in the absence of further exposure.Experiments indicate that approximately 110 new protein binding sites are present in the sperm and fat tissue of obese mice from the F1 through the F4 generations. These newbinding sites correspond to CTCF and ERalpha, suggesting that effects of these proteins on 3D chromatin organization and transcription of speci ﬁc genes are responsible for the establishment and transmission of epiphenotypes.

Although themajority of cases are considered sporadic, familial aggre  gation has been recognized in European and Korean populations, but the ﬁnding of familial MD genes has been elusive until the last few years. Detailed phenotyping and hierarchical cluster analyses have found several clinical predictors for different subgroups of patients, which mayindicate different mechanisms of disease, including genetic and immune factors. The familial cluster include all cases with unilateral or bilateral MD, and most familiesshow an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with incomplete penetrance and variable expressivity in Eur  opean population. Whole exome sequencing have foundrare and novel variants in 6 ge nes associated with familial MD including COCH, FAM136A, DTNA, PRKCB, SEMA3D andDPT genes; however, no consistent gene has been described in multiple unr elated families. Although the signi ﬁcance of these variants remain to be established in animal models, the candidate genes are involved in verydifferent functions such as protein phosphorylation, axonal guiding signalling or structural proteins in the cytoskele  ton or extracellular matrix. So, familial MD shows geneticheterogeneity as it has been also demonstrated for syn  dromic and non syndromic sensorineural hearing loss. To investigate the immunogenetic contribution in MD, wehave also conducted a genome association study using a high density genotyping array containing covering loci associated with autoimmunity (Immunochip). Our grouphave identi ﬁed a locus in the classical class I subregion of the MHC ~9 kb at 6p21.33 (31,081,878 31,090,401), being the leading signal rs4947296 (metanalysis,OR , 2.089 (1.661 2.627); p,1.39x 10 −09). The variant is associated with bilateral MD in the Spanish populationand it is enriched in patients with a comorbid autoimmune disorder. Moreover, rs4947296 is a trans expression quantitatve trait locus (eQTL) which regulates gene expression of multiple genes in the tumor necrosis factor  like weak induced of apoptosis (TWEAK)/Fn14 pathway in peripheral mononuclear cells (PBMCs). By usinggenotype conditioned PBMCs, we found an increase of NF κB mediated in ﬂammatory response in the carriers of the risk genotype. Meniere disease shows clinical andgenetic heterogeneity and common and rare variants may contribute to shape the phenotype in a given patient. Ongoing projects include exome sequencing in >100familial MD patients or early onset sporadic cases and the analysis of two custom sequencing panels designed by our group using data mining, phenotyping information andgene expression pro ﬁles in cochlear and vestibular supporting cells.

 An approach to restoring vestibular function?,S04.3,"A. Forge1, R. R. Taylor2","1London, United Kingdom,2UCL Ear Institute, London,","United Kingdom The sensory epithelia of the cochlea and vestibular system are composed of sensory “hair ”cells and non sensory supporting cells. Supporting cells surround each hair celland separated it from its neighbours. Hair cells derive their name from the organised bundle of projections from their apical surface. During development expression of the tran scription factor Atonal Homologue 1(Atoh1) in precursor cells directs differentiation towards a hair cell fate. The ﬁrst cells to do so activate Notch Delta signalling in theirimmediate neighbours to inhibit Atoh1 expression. The laterally inhibited cells differentiate as supporting cells. Death of hair cells is a major cause of hearing loss andvestibular dysfunction, which manifests as dizziness, ver  tigo and imbalance. Ageing and certain drugs with ototoxic side effects, most notably aminoglycoside antibiotics, areamongst the primary causes of hair cell death. When a hair cell dies the surrounding supporting cells close the lesions. In non mammalian vertebrates, new hair cells are generatedfrom the supporting cells, some following supporting cell division, others by direct conversion of supporting cells.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 757There is no hair cell regeneration in the mammalian cochlea. However, there is a limited capacity to regenerate hair cells in the mammalian vestibular system through direct phenotypic conversion of supporting cells. We have some evidence that spontaneous regeneration of hair cells may occur throughout life in the human vestibular system. Usinghuman vestibular sensory epithelia in explant culture, hair cells were ablated by incubation in an aminoglycoside (gentamicin). Subsequent transduction of supporting cellswith ATOH1 using an Ad 2 viral vector resulted in gen  eration of highly signi ﬁcant numbers of cells expressing the hair cell maker protein myosin VIIa. Cells expressingmyosin VIIa were also generated after blocking the Notch signalling pathway with TAPI 1 but much less ef ﬁciently. Transcriptomic analysis following ATOH1 transduction conﬁrmed up regulation of 335 putative hair cell marker genes, including several postulated downstream targets of ATOH1 , as well as downregulation of 5 chromatin modi  ﬁers. Morphological analysis revealed numerous cells bearing dense clusters of microvilli at the apical surfaces. However, no cells bore organised hair bundles and severalexpected hair cell markers genes were not expressed. The results show a potential to induce conversion of supporting cells in the vestibular sensory tissues of humans, but thatdifferentiation of fully functional hair cells is incomplete under the conditions used. This suggests the likely necessity of additional factors to achieve this goal. R.R. Taylor: None. S05 Large scale genetic studies in complex disease",2018

Thus, the prediction of silent atherosclerotic alterationsin coronary arteries is a highly relevant medical need. Recent genomic research identi ﬁed numerous genetic var  iants that associate with a higher prevalence of coronarydisease. At present, association with coronary artery disease has been demonstrated at more than 160 chromosomal locations with risk alleles increasing relative risk by 5 25%per allele. Moreover, genetic variants primarily affecting cardiovascular risk factors such as hypertension or LDL cholesterol were shown to affect the risk of coronary diseaseas well.This enormous progress has been facilitated by genome  wide association studies. By nature, these studies focus on frequent alleles. Thus, the alleles that have been identi ﬁed to increase the risk of coronary disease are also relatively frequent in our population. As a consequence, virtually all individuals of our population carry a variable degree ofgenetic predisposition for coronary artery disease. More recently, the focus turned to rare variants with more profound effects.

 Harnessing large scale genetics and genomics to derive biological insights in type 2 diabetes,S05.3,M. McCarthy,"Oxford, United Kingdom","Individual risk of common complex diseases such as dia  betes (and the complications thereof) is in ﬂuenced by var  iation at many hundreds (even thousands) of genetic risk loci, together with a range of exposures experienced overthe life course. A deeper understanding of these factors, and the mechanisms through which they in ﬂuence disease risk and development, is a prerequisite if we are to develop moreeffective strategies for prevention and treatment. Over the past decade there has been substantial progress towards these goals. The most recent genome wide association study(involving nearly a million subjects) has extended the number of independent genetic signals for type 2 diabetes beyond 400. For a growing number of these loci, we nowknow which speci ﬁc genetic variant is responsible, which regulatory element active in which tissue is disturbed, which downstream effector gene mediates the causal effect,and which pathophysiological process is consequently perturbed. By combining genome wide association and sequence data, we have a clear description of the geneticarchitecture of this disease.

 Liquid Biopsies for Monitoring Temporal Genomic Heterogeneity,S06.3,G. Siravegna,"Torino, Italy","Liquid biopsy  tumor genotyping using circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood  has been recently applied to molecularly pro ﬁle cancer patients, monitoring tumor burden during therapy and uncovering novelmechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. We used metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) as a model system to assess whether liquid biopsies could in principle uncovermolecular mechanisms responsible for the emergence of resistance to targeted therapies, in particular to the mono  clonal antibodies (moAbs) cetuximab and panitumumab.Emerging evidence indicates that escape from EGFR tar  geted therapy might be molecularly heterogeneous and involve several genes. We exploited plasma ctDNA analysisby Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) and Digital PCR (ddPCR) in mCRC patients to de ﬁne gene alterations responsible for primary or acquired resistance to anti EGFRtherapies. While most mCRC patients who receive anti EGFR antibodies develop KRAS mutations during the course oftherapy we found that additional mutations affecting key nodes of the EGFR signaling pathway can also confer resistance. An interesting mCRC case harbored a novelMAP2K1 mutation (p.K57T) in tissue and liquid biopsies post EGFR blockade. To validate the biological and molecular relevance of this mutation in resistance to anti EGFR therapy, we used a CRC cell line which harbored a MAP2K1 mutation when made resistant to CMAB. Biochemical analysis showed that MAP2K1 variantsaffecting position p.K57 drive constitutive activation of MEK and ERK and conferred resistance to CMAB and PMAB. However, the combination of the MEK inhibitortrametinib with either CMAB or PMAB restored sensitivity, suggesting a potential therapeutic strategy to overcome resistance to EGFR blockade caused by this mutation.Accordingly, the patient was treated with the combination of PMAB and trametinib. After 3 months, imagingdemonstrated a reduction in size of the biopsied liver metastasis harboring the MAP2K1 mutation, but revealed that some other lesions had progressed. Pre treatment plasma ctDNA was analyzed using NGS, con ﬁrming the presence of MAP2K1 variant, but unveiling an additional KRAS mutation. Longitudinal analysis of plasma samplesunveiled that MAP2K1 mutant levels declined, while KRAS mutant increased markedly during therapy, indicat  ing outgrowth of a resistant KRAS mutant clone. Biopsy ofa different liver metastasis ’segment that progressed despite PMAB and trametinib revealed the same KRAS mutation identi ﬁed in ctDNA. In a separate study, we focused on Her2 ampli ﬁed CRC. Targeting HER2 is effective in 30% of ERBB2  ampli ﬁed metastatic colorectal cancer, and most sensitive caseseventually relapse. We studied the molecular evolution of individual metastases during treatment to discover spa  tially resolved determinants of resistance. ctDNA analysis identi ﬁed alterations associated with lack of response in the majority of refractory patients. CtDNA pro ﬁles and lesion speci ﬁc radiographic reports revealed organ  and metastasis private evoluti onary patterns in patients who had initially responded. Whe n radiologic assessments documented progressive disease in target lesions,response to HER2 blockade was often retained in other metastases. Genomic and functional analyses on samples and cell models from eight metastases of a patient co recruited to a post mortem study unveiled lesion speci ﬁc evolutionary trees and pharmacologic vulnerabilities. A correlation between lesions ’size and contribution of distinct metastases to plasma ctDNA was observed. These data highlight the signi ﬁcance of coupling radiologic analysis, liquid biopsies and avatar models in precision oncology. S07 Drug repurposing for treating genetic disorder",2018

 Drug repurposing for breast cancer prevention in BRCA1 mutation carriers,S07.2,"E. Nolan1, J. E. Visvader2, G. J. Lindeman2,3","1The Francis Crick Institute, London, United Kingdom,2The","Walter and Eliza Hall Institute of Medical Research, Melbourne, Australia,3The Royal Melbourne Hospital, Melbourne, Australia Women who carry a germline mutation in BRCA1 are at heightened risk of developing breast (and ovarian) cancer.Tumors often arise at an early age, with the peak relative risk occurring before 40 years of age. Although breast MRI has substantially improved screening for mutation carriers, this isnot preventive and its impact on mortality is uncertain. Interval cancers (arising between screening) are not uncom  mon and screen detected tumors can be relatively advanced.Furthermore, tumors are usually triple negative with a basal  like phenotype, necessitating chemotherapy even if identi ﬁed early. Asymptomatic BRCA1 mutation carriers have few effective breast cancer prevention options beyond bilateral prophylactic mastectomy (BPM). Although BPM reduces the risk of breast cancer by up to 90%, only a subset of mutationcarriers pursue this option. An effective prevention therapy therefore remains an important area of need. RANKL is an important paracrine mediator of progester  one signaling in breast tissue. Activation of the RANKL/ RANK signaling has been shown to accelerate tumor formation and to be associated with aggressive tumorbehavior in vivo. Conversely, ablation of RANK signaling in mammary epithelium delays the onset of medroxypro  gesterone/DMBA driven mammary tumors. Accumulatingevidence points to a role for progesterone/RANKL/RANK  mediated signaling in breast tumorigenesis in BRCA1 mutation carriers. BRCA1 mutation carriers may have elevated levels of serum progesterone during the luteal phase compared to non carriers and possibly augmentedRANKL activity due to reduced levels of the endogenous soluble decoy receptor osteoprotegerin (OPG). Our recent ﬁndings suggest that the RANK and down  stream NF  κB pathways are aberrantly activated in luminal progenitor cells in preneoplastic (ostensibly normal) BRCA1 mut/+breast tissue. The augmented proliferation of these cells and their predilection for DNA damage suggest that they are prime cellular targets for basal like breast cancers arising in BRCA1  mutation carriers. Targeting of RANK+progenitors using a RANKL inhibitor in pre  clinical models has revealed a promising new prevention strategy for these high risk women. These ﬁndings have raised the possibility that the RANKL inhibitor denosumab (currently only approved for the treatment of osteoporosis and bone metastases) could be ‘repurposed ’as a breast cancer prevention drug. Plans are underway to formally test this hypothesis in an international, randomized, double  blind, placebo controlled multi center phase 3 preventionstudy, ‘BRCA P ’, led by the Austrian Breast & Colorectal Study Group.

 Epigenetic mechanisms regulating energy balance,S11.1,R. Waterland,"Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States","Environmental in ﬂuences during critical periods of prenatal and early postnatal development can cause persistent alterations in regulation of energy balance. Although a potentially important factor in the worldwide obesity epi demic, the fundamental mechanisms underlying such ‘developmental programming ’of energy balance are poorly understood, limiting our ability to intervene. Most studies ofdevelopmental programming of energy balance have focused on persistent alterations in food intake; energy expenditure has been relatively underemphasized. In parti cular, very few studies have evaluated developmental pro  gramming of physical activity. In the past several years we have studied three different mouse models of developmentalprogramming of energy balance. In all three, we observed alterations in body weight regulation that persisted to adulthood, but no group differences in food intake. Rather,programming of energy balance appeared to be due to persistent alterations in energy expenditure and spontaneous physical activity. We are now taking a transgenic approachto assess the role of hypothalamic epigenetics in energy balance.

 Epigenetics of major psychiatric disease: the circadian perspective,S11.3,A. Petronis,"Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, ON, Canada","Putative epigenetic misregulation of genes sheds a new light on numerous epidemiological, clinical, and molecular complexities of psychiatric and other complex diseases. Epigenetic modi ﬁcations of DNA can explain a series of non Mendelian disease features such as discordance of identical twins, relatively late age of onset, ﬂuctuating course and sometimes partial or even full recovery. Prin ciples for experimental epigenomic studies in disease are still being developed. We recently discovered that DNA modiﬁcations in somatic differentiated cells of humans and mice exhibit circadian oscillations. Such oscillating cyto  sines (osc modCs) were linked to the circadian tran  scriptome and explained a fraction of epigenetic variation,which has traditionally been treated as stochastic. We also found that osc modCs were associated with the aging epi  genome, where the osc modCs preceded age dependentDNA modi ﬁcation changes, and osc modC amplitude strongly correlated with the magnitude of the aging effect. These ﬁndings indicate that epigenetic aging outcomes, to some extent, can be predicted from the circadian epige  nomic parameters at a younger age. Finally, we performed a re analysis of ﬁve epigenome wide association studies, including schizophrenia and obesity. We detected that dif  ferentially modi ﬁed cytosines in disease were signi ﬁcantly associated with human neutrophil osc modCs (odds ratioranged from 1.2 to 8.1). In summary, circadian DNA modiﬁcations provide a new perspective on several funda  mental questions in biomedical research. In the broad sense,circadian rhythmicity, one of key adaptations of life on Earth, seems to also be mediating an organism ’s demise. A. Petronis: None. S12 Retinal disease",2018
" The non coding morbid genome in inherited retinaldiseasesE. De Baere Ghent University and Ghent University Hospital, Ghent,Belgium The integration of genome and transcriptome sequencing reveals an increasing number of non coding mutations in Mendelian disease such as inherited retinal disease (IRD). IRD represents a major cause of early onset blindness,having an overall prevalence of ~1/3,000. Whole exome (WES) and genome sequencing (WGS) revealed the underlying genetic cause in over 260 disease genes(RetNet) in ~60% of cases, with few novel disease genes identi ﬁed in the remaining cases. The largest part of missing heritability of IRD is assumed to reside in non coding regions, harboring cell speci ﬁc functional ele ments. The likelihood of ﬁnding non coding variants increases in IRD subtypes with recognizable phenotypesand without or in case of autosomal recessive disease monoallelic coding variants in a known disease gene. Of the non coding pathogenic variants, the majority are deep intronic splicing variants, often leading to pseudo exon inclusion and amenable to antisense oligonucleotide mediated rescue, as demonstrated for CEP290 ,USH2A and more recently for ABCA4 . Thus far, non coding mutations in cis regulatory elements (CREs) are more scarce, with only a few examples in choroideremia(CHM ), Leber congenital amaurosis ( LCA5 ,NMNAT1 ), North Carolina Macular Dystrophy ( PRDM13 ,IRX1 )a n d Stargardt disease ( ABCA4 ).

Some of these individuals will experience spontaneous improvement of all or part of their visual function, but the majority of them is affected with aphotoreceptor neuron degenerative diseases of dramatically poor prognosis known as Leber congenital amaurosis (LCA). The initial presentation of LCA is invariable and thedisease has long been regarded as homogenous. But, there exist a variability of the retinal outcome ranging from a stationary disease with dramatically poor visual perfor mances to a progressive, yet very severe disease with low but measurable visual acuity in the ﬁrst two decades of life. Occasionally, the same or similar retinal ﬁndings can be seen as the initial symptom in a range of systemic diseases involving in particular, the bone, kidney, liver, ear, cere  bellum and/or the central nervous system. Some associa tions of symptoms are not uncommon and describe well deﬁned syndromes but some others are exceptional, ques  tioning their classi ﬁcation as syndromes. The characteriza  tion of the molecular bases of monosymptomatic and systemic diseases sharing severe visual de ﬁciency at, or near birth has identi ﬁed large numbers of genes and func  tions along with some strong genotype phenotype correla  tions. This knowledge has considerably modi ﬁed the care of neonates born apparently blind by disclosing potentialtherapeutic targets, some of which undergo intensive stu  dies, and by providing some reliable markers predictive of the visual and extraocular outcomes. In addition, now thathigh throughput molecular diagnostic testing has become of common practice, it proved highly valuable to sort disease  causing mutations from polymorphisms, to detect non coding mutations and sometimes to redirect diagnoses.

 Evolutionary selection of oncogenic mutant clones in normal epithelia,S14.3,"P. Jones1,2","1Hinxton, United Kingdom,2Wellcome Sanger Institute,","Cambridge, United Kingdom Somatic mutations accumulate in healthy cells throughout life. Most of these mutations do not alter cell behavior and accumulate passively, but occasionally a key gene is alteredin a way that provides mutant cells with a competitive advantage. This leads to the formation of large clones that persist long term in normal tissues. However, detecting suchclones is challenging due to the dif ﬁculties of identifying mutations present in small numbers of cells. The most highly mutated normal tissue reported to date is sun exposed human skin. Most mutations are caused by ultra  violet light and it is unclear whether aged sun exposed skin represents a special case due to a lifetime exposure to apowerful mutagen. This motivated us to investigate the mutational landscape of a similar tissue, the lining of the oesophagus, which also consists of layers of keratinocytes.As in the skin, cells are continually shed from the tissue surface and replaced by proliferation throughout life. However, the exposure to mutagens and the tissue envir onment in an internal epithelium led are very different from the skin, leading us to hypothesize that normal oesophagus764 J. del Picchiamay have a distinct mutational landscape. We mapped mutant clones in normal oesophageal epithelium from nine donors aged 20 75 using ultra deep targeted sequencing for 74 genes implicated in epithelial cancers. We found the density of mutant clones increased progressively, rising to over 100/cm2by middle age. Mutations were mainly caused by age related mutational processes. There was strong Darwinian positive selection of clones carrying mutations in 14 genes that are also recurrently mutated in oesophagealcancers. By middle age NOTCH1 andTP53 mutant clones cover over 40% and 10% of the epithelium respectively. Remarkably, the prevalence of NOTCH1 mutations in nor  mal esophagus is several times higher than in oesophageal cancers. We conclude that the normal oesophagus is an evolving patchwork of mutant clones, which colonize themajority of the epithelium as we age. S15 Understanding non coding variant",2018

" Establishing the epigenome during human development:New insights of chromatin states and regulatory networks in pluripotent stem cellsP. Rugg Gunn The Babraham Institute, Hinxton, United Kingdom Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) exist in multiple states that are broadly termed naïve and primed. Both cellstates can self renew and undergo multi lineage differ entiation, but are functionally and molecularly distinct. Naïve hPSCs largely recapitulate the transcriptome andepigenome of pre implantation embryos, and primed hPSCs are similar to early post implantation embryos. This is an important distinction because these two developmentalstages differ enormously in gene regulation and in epige netic hallmarks such as X inactivation status and DNA methylation. The research in my lab is focused on under standing the mechanisms of epigenetic and gene regulatory changes as hPSCs transition between the two states, with the aim of applying that information to more preciselycontrol cell fate decisions and to better understand human development. Recently, we have mapped the transcriptional and epigenetic dynamics during cell state change, dis covering that different reprogramming methods drive dif ferent trajectories. We have also examined the 3D genome organisation of naïve and primed hPSCs. By applying newnetwork scale computational approaches, we have inter rogated the organisation at multiple genomic scales, ranging from a global overview to local communities that recapi tulate architectural domains, down to individual promoter enhancer interactions.

Epigenetic mechanisms are essential for embryonic devel  opment, but they also play an important role during adultlife. In addition to the epigenetic changes that occur that have a speci ﬁc biological purpose, genomic DNA can also accumulate epigenetic alterations or noise during lifetime. Ithas been proposed that this process, known as ""epigenetic drift"", is associated with age related diseases. Although it isAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 765well known that cancer is an age dependent disease, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still poorly under  stood. In this regard, recent work has shown that aberrant DNA hypermethylation in aging and cancer share similar chromatin signatures. It is also well established that in the processes of both aging and cancer there is a global loss ofDNA methylation. However, it remains unknown whether the chromatin signatures of DNA hypomethylation were also similar in aging and cancer. Conceptually, this is animportant issue because the similarity of the chromatin signatures of DNA hypermethylation in cancer and aging has led to the proposal that DNA methylation is a molecularlink between the two processes. In my talk, I will present recent work from our laboratory showing that: i) the genomic distribution of differentially methylated CpG sitesis similar in aging and cancer, ii) there is a considerable tissue independent component to DNA methylation chan  ges in both aging and cancer and, iii) in contrast to DNAhypermethylation, the chromatin signatures of DNA hypo  methylation in aging and cancer are different. These results reveal novel aspects of the relationship between DNAmethylation and aging that could be important to under  standing the possible role of DNA methylation as a mole  cular link between aging and cancer.

These gene expression patterns are controlled by collec tions of regulatory elements combining promoters and tissue speci ﬁc enhancers. However, it is now well  documented that regulatory elements have experiencedextensive divergence and turn over during mammalian evolution. How stable gene expression is maintained by rapidly evolving regulatory landscapes remains a funda mental question in evolutionary genetics, as well as a crucial prior to the use of animal models for human func  tional genetics. We report here on an in depth analysis of gene expression and regulation across mammalian evolution. Using liver as a representative organ, we pro ﬁled gene expression as well as histone marks typical of active promoters and enhancers in 20 different mammals. We used this data to quantify how promoters and enhancers evolve in mammals, and how thisevolution affects gene expression downstream. This analy  sis revealed a complex relationship between gene expres  sion and regulatory evolution. First, we show that promotersand enhancers are under signi ﬁcantly different evolutionary pressures: promoters remain largely active across mammals while enhancers are much more evolutionarily labile.Second, regulatory elements exhibit a broad range of evolutionary plasticity from those active across most mammals to those found in only one or a few species.We show how these degrees of conservation correlate with local gene functions, gene expression levels, and gene expression stability. Importantly, we report that highlyexpressed and stable genes are associated with complex arrays of promoters and enhancers, which can exhibit signiﬁcant turnover across species as long as the overall landscape complexity is maintained. Our results underscore how functional redundancy in regulatory programs allows for resilience at the gene expression level in mammaliangenomes. C. Berthelot: None. D. Villar: None. D.T. Odom: None.

 Regulatory principles governing enhancer function duringanimal development,S18.2,"E. K. Farley, G. A. Jindal, F. Lim, J. L. Grudzien, B. Song","UC San Diego, San Diego, CA, United StatesAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 767The human genome contains on the order of a million","enhancers. These segments of the DNA act as switches to regulate where and when the approximately 20,000 genes are expressed. As such, enhancers provide the instructions for tissue speci ﬁc gene expression, thus enabling successful development and cellular integrity. Numerous studies havedemonstrated that mutations in enhancers can alter tissue speciﬁc expression and cause phenotypic variation and disease. For example, a single mutation in a limbbud enhancer leads to aberrant expression of the gene SHH and results in extra ﬁngers and toes. In an enhancer for the membrane protein Duffy, a point mutation results inmalarial resistance. Computational analysis suggests that the majority of mutations associated with disease are located within enhancers. Despite the fundamental impor tance of enhancers for successful development and their discovery over 30 years ago, we lack a broad understanding of how enhancer sequence encodes tissue speci ﬁc expres  sion. As a result we do not understand which changes in enhancer sequence are simply inert variation between individuals and which mutations lead to phenotypicdiversity and disease. These fundamental questions remain unsolved because we cannot relate enhancer sequence to gene expression patterns and phenotype on a scale suf ﬁ  cient to identify the overarching regulatory principles. The two main challenges in deciphering the relationship between enhancer sequence and tissue speci ﬁcg e n e expression are: 1) the complexity of enhancers, and 2) the complexity of organisms. To address these problems, we have developed high throughput functional assays totest millions of enhancer variants in millions of whole developing embryos. The model organism that enables such in depth functional approaches is the marine chordateCiona intestinalis .

 Ultraconserved enhancers are required for normal development,S18.3,D. Dickel,"Berkeley, CA, United States","More than 450 regions in the human genome have perfect sequence conservation between human and rodents, andthese “ultraconserved ”sites have intrigued biologists in the decade since they were ﬁrst described. While it is knownthat many of these sequences are distant acting enhancers, the drivers of such extraordinary evolutionary constraint remain unclear. Surprisingly, initial deletion studies showed that the loss of individual ultraconserved enhancers in mice has no obvious impact on viability or fertility. To explore this apparent discrepancy between extreme evolutionaryconstraint and lack of obvious phenotypes in more depth, we examined the in vivo consequences of loss of a series of ultraconserved enhancers near the essential neuronal tran scription factor Arx. The Arxlocus has an unusually high density of ultraconserved sites, including the three longest perfectly human mouse rat conserved sequences in thegenome. Four ultraconserved regions near Arxdrive gene expression in the developing forebrain, in patterns that cumulatively recapitulate the gene ’s expression domains. Single cell transcriptome sequencing from transgenic embryos con ﬁrmed that the enhancer activity is speci ﬁct o Arx expressing neuronal subpopulations. We engineered mice missing these four enhancers singly, as well as pair  wise for enhancers that display overlapping in vivo activity patterns. While the loss of any single or pair of ultra conserved enhancers resulted in viable and fertile mice, detailed phenotyping revealed neurological or growth abnormalities in nearly all cases, including substantial def icits of cholinergic neurons, altered densities of cortical interneuron populations, and abnormalities of the dentate gyrus. Our results demonstrate the functional importance ofultraconserved enhancers and highlight that extreme sequence conservation may result from evolutionary selec  tion against ﬁtness de ﬁcits that appear subtle in a laboratory setting.

Frebourg,"Department of Genetics, Rouen University Hospital, InsermU1245, Centre for Genomic and Personalized Medicine,Rouen, France","Li Fraumeni syndrome is a remarkable predisposition to cancer due to germline mutations of the TP53 suppressor gene and characterized by early onset tumours and a wide tumourspectrum. Diagnosis criteria have sequentially been updated in order to cover the 4 different clinical presentations asso  ciated with germline TP53 mutations: Familial presentation: Proband with a LFS spectrum tumour (soft tissue sarcomas (STS), osteosarcoma, adrenocortical carcinoma (ACC), cen  tral nervous system (CNS) tumours or female breast cancer)prior to age 46 years AND at least one ﬁrst  or second degree relative with a LFS tumour before the age of 56 years or with multiple tumours. (2) Multiple tumours: Patient with multiple malignancies, two of which belonging to the LFS spectrum, theﬁrst being developed before 46 years or with a second tumour developed within a radiotherapy ﬁeld; (3) Rare tumours: Patients with ACC, choroid plexus tumours (CPT) or embryonal anaplastic subtype rhabdomyosarcoma (anRMS); (4) Breast cancer before age 31 years. Therefore, familial history is not mandatory to consider the presence of a germline TP53 mutation in a patient. Independently of the familial history, the mutation detection rate in children pre senting with ACC, CPT or anRMS is approximately 50%, and in females with breast carcinoma before 31 years 6%. The contribution to LFS of de novo mutations has recently been estimated to be at least 14% and approximately 1/5 of these denovo mutations occur during embryonic development, resulting therefore in mosaics. TP53 being included in cancer gene panels, germline TP53 mutations are now more fre  quently identi ﬁed in patients who have developed only adultcancers. The penetrance of TP53 mutations is not known and heterogeneous and depends both from the type of alteration and modi ﬁer factors. Dominant negative missense mutations are usually highly penetrant and associated with the severe forms of LFS characterized by childhood cancers. Null mutations are predominantly identi ﬁed in families with only adult cancers and have a lower penetrance. Germline TP53 mutations acting as permissive mutations to oncogenic stres  ses, their phenotypic expression is also probably dependent onenvironmental factors. The recently published surveillance protocols are heavy and are based, from the ﬁrst year of life, on abdominal ultrasound every 4 6 months, annual total bodyMRI, annual brain MRI, and in females from 20 years on annual breast MRI. Considering the diversity of the clinical severity associated to germline TP53 mutations, the bene ﬁts of such heavy protocols regardless to the psychological impacts should be carefully analyzed and discussed in each family. TP53 mutation carriers have an exceptionally high risk of developing multiple primary tumours, estimated at least to 40%. Several lines of evidence show, in agreement with the key role of p53 in response to DNA damage, thatradiotherapy and genotoxic chemotherapies contribute to the development of secondary tumours in LFS. Therefore, in patients with clinical presentations strongly suggestive ofLFS, analysis of TP53 should be performed before the initiation of treatment and in mutation carriers, radiotherapy should be, only if possible, avoided, surgical treatmentprioritized and non genotoxic treatments, such as immu  notherapies, considered in the future.

Carninci,"RIKEN Center for Integrative Medical Sciences, Yokohama,","JapanMapping 5 ’ ends of RNAs is the key to understand the gene regulation as they identify promoters, as well as long non  coding RNAs (lncRNAs) with functions. In order to com  prehensively understand regulatory elements, we developed the Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology, which enables to identify transcription start sites (TSSs) andquantitatively measure their activity throughout the genome at high throughput. In the RIKEN Functional Annotation of the Mammalian Genome 5 (FANTOM5) project, we createda very broad map of the promoterome and regulatory net  works by simultaneously mapped mRNAs and lncRNAs TSSs and measured their expression at each different pro moters with CAGE, on a comprehensive panel of human and mouse primary cells and other tissues. The study revealed the existence of 223,428 and 162,264 promotersand 65,423 and 44,459 enhancers, in human and mouse respectively, which are often tissue speci ﬁc (Forrest et al. Nature 507, 462, 2014, Andersson et al. Nature 507, 455,2014). Using CAGE, we also built an atlas of human lncRNAs with accurate 5 ’ ends (Hon et al. Nature 543, 199, 2017). Classi ﬁcation of lncRNAs revealed that most inter  genic lncRNAs are derived from enhancer like regions rather than classic promoters and GWAS trait associated SNPs enriched at lncRNA loci were speci ﬁcally expressed in cell types relevant to the speci ﬁc diseases, suggesting their roles in diseases. Ongoing FANTOM6 project is aiming at creating the broadest database of functionallncRNAs, as a valuable resource in the community. Fur  thermore, we are pursuing a strategic collaboration with the International Human Cell Atlas (HCA) project, which isaiming at the creation of a comprehensive map of all human cell types and states at single cell level, with our newly developed single cell CAGE.

In recent years, guidelines with therapeutic recommendations have become available to guide clinicians how to interpret and adjust drug therapy based upon a pharmacogenomic test result. Indeed, for some drug gene pairs (such as capecitabine –DPYD; mercaptopurine   TPMT) pre therapeutic testing has been implemented inroutine clinical care in some centers but there remain barriers for widescale implementation of pre therapeutic testing. Studies have shown that at least 90 95% of patients have an actionable genotype when tested for a panel of pharmacogenes including CYP2C9, CYP2C19, CYP2D6,CYP3A5, DYPD, SLCO1B1, TPMT, HLA B, UGT1A1 and VKORC1. Therefore, pre emptive testing (that is: multiple pharmacogenomic variants are collected prospec tively and embedded into the patient ’s medical record) of a panel of genetic variants seems a promising and cost  effective approach. We have performed a pilot study in 200 primary care patients with pre emptive testing of a PGx panel with the aim to reduce ADRs. In addition, the EU Horizon2020funded U PGx consortium was established and investigates a pre emptive genotyping approach of a panel of important PGx variants as a new model of personalised medicine. Tomeet this goal, 94 existing pharmacogenomics guidelines of the Dutch Pharmacogenomics Working Group (DPWG) of the Royal Pharmacists Association (KNMP) are combinedwith novel IT solutions. Implementation is conducted at a large scale in seven European health care environments (The Netherlands, UK, Spain, Italy, Austria, Greece andSlovenia) for a total of 8,100 patients and accounts for the diversity in health system organisations and settings. The multicenter randomized study is open since Q1 2017.Feasibility, health outcome and cost effectiveness are investigated; the study is powered to show a reduction of 30% of the incidence of grade 2 or higher adverse drugevents.

This strategy has been implemented at University of Chicago Medicine as “The 1200 Patients Project ”, which is led by Peter O ’Donnell, MD, using a genomic prescribing system (GPS). Results to date have demonstrated that pharmacogenetic results impact prescribing, and that patient satisfaction and recall of medication recommendations areenhanced. Ease of use of the GPS continues to be an issue for busy practitioners in the outpatient setting. Ongoing studies aim to assess the feasibility and impact of the GPSfor hospitalized patients, as well as those undergoing elec  tive surgery.

Several forms of monogenic bone fragility disorders, directly or indirectly related to type Icollagen, have been described. Importantly, other forms also exist, often with unique skeletal and extra skeletal features and with variable inheritance patterns. The mostcommon monogenic bone fragility disorder is osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) in which dominantly inherited mutations in the genes encoding type I collagen ( COL1A1 andCOL1A2 ) are responsible for approximately 90% of the cases. Several rare autosomal recessive forms of OI have also been described. Recent discoveries have further elucidated thegenetic determinants of early onset skeletal fragility and several forms not related to type I collagen haveAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 771been identi ﬁed. The discovery of LRP5 mutations in osteoporosis pseudoglioma syndrome and in early onset osteoporosis ﬁrst indicated that the WNT signaling pathway plays an important role in bone mass accrual. Several other studies thereafter, including our discovery of WNT1 muta  tions in early onset osteoporosis, have further highlightedthe pathway ’s signi ﬁcance in various disorders of low and high bone mass and provide evidence for the potential of WNT targeted therapies in osteoporosis treatment.X chromosomal osteoporosis caused by PLS3 gene muta  tions is another example of novel monogenic forms of osteoporosis. PLS3 osteoporosis affects especially malesand leads to severe progressive spinal osteoporosis; even females carrying the mutation may develop symptomatic osteoporosis. PLS3 may play a role in bone mineralizationbut the pathogenetic mechanisms are not fully understood. Several other monogenic forms of osteoporosis are under investigation.

 The Importance of Reproducible Research in High Throughput Biology,E06.1,K. Baggerly,"UT MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States","Modern high throughput biological assays let us ask detailed questions about how diseases operate, and promise to let us personalize therapy. Our intuition about what the answers “should ”look like in high dimensions is very poor, so careful data processing is essential. When documentation of such processing is absent or incomplete, we must apply “forensic bioinformatics ”to work backwards from the raw data and the reported results to infer what the methods must have been. Such explorations occasionally reveal errors. The most common errors we uncover are simple ones, ofteninvolving mislabeling of rows, columns, or variables. These errors are easy to make, but if documentation is adequate, they may be easy to ﬁx. Incomplete documentation is, however, pervasive in much of the scienti ﬁc literature. We give examples illustrating the potentially severe implica  tions of such mistakes for patient care, and discuss stepsjournals and US funding agencies are taking in response.

Martinez Arias,"Cambridge, United Kingdom","Embryonic Stem (ES) cells are clonal derivatives from the blastocysts of mammalian embryos which have the potentialto give rise to all lineages of the embryo and the ability to self renew this ability. Mouse ES cells have proven an excellent system in which to study developmental events, inparticular the mechanisms of cell fate decisions. However, while it is easy to coax them into elements of different tissues in culture, they do not organize themselves as theydo in embryos. Non adherent culture leads them to form aggregates in which some cell types appear in clusters but there is no overall organization. Recently we have developed a non adherent culture system in which small aggregates of mouse ES cells undergo symmetry breaking, polarized gene expression andgrowth and gastrulation like movements in vitro. Using a variety of reporter ES cell lines and comparison with the embryo we observe organization of Wnt, Nodal and FGFsignaling that mirrors events in the embryo and have shown that they can develop in culture until an equivalent of embryonic day 9 (E9). We observe that these embryonicorganoids develop anteroposterior, dorsoventral as well as bilateral asymmetries. Analysis of pattern formation in these aggregates suggests that they do not develop throughstandard self organization but that there is a strong genetic components to what otherwise would be simple thermo  dynamically driven process.

" Etiology of vascular malformations: A question of place and timingM. Vikkula Brussels, Belgium Vascular malformations are localized errors of vascular development. They are often identi ﬁed on the skin as “birthmarks ”of various sizes and shapes. They usually slowly grow with the growth of the child. They may also be encountered in other organs, such as the liver, intestine andthe brain. The lesions are consisted of tortuous vascular channels of various types, with continuous endothelium surrounded by various numbers of support cells. Most ofthese lesions occur sporadically, yet sometimes as part of a syndrome or as an inherited disorder. Genetic studies of such families and patients have led to the identi ﬁcation of a number of genes that cause various vascular malformations. The pathway to unravel the pathophysiological mechan isms of vascular anomalies started by the discovery thatinherited TIE2/TEK mutations (an endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase) are responsible for hereditary mucocuta neous venous malformations ( “cavernous hemangioma ”). Further studies to explain the multifocality of lesions in these patients made realize the importance of tissular second hits for lesion development in this autosomaldominant disease. This directed the search for causes of sporadic cases towards tissular mutations, and opened a new era, in conjunction with the advent of NGS, for somaticgenetic screens in vascular anomalies and other develop ment disorders. Genetic mutations take place during each cell division. The earlier they occur, the larger the cell population that carries the mutation is. Most of the mutations in vascular anomalies occur in endothelial cells, and they have allowedgeneration of in vitro and in vivo models, another major step towards development of novel therapies for these chronic, debilitating diseases. As most of the mutationsactivate well known oncogenes and signaling pathways, this has opened an era for repurposing of cancer drugs to vascular anomaly patients.

Rötig,"Imagine Institut, Paris, France","Neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation (NBIA) is a genetically heterogeneous condition due to iron accumu  lation in basal ganglia, manifesting as a progressive extra pyramidal syndrome with dystonia, rigidity and choreoathetosis. Mutations in eleven genes have been hitherto identi ﬁed. Only two genes are reportedly involved in iron metabolism, FTL andCP, respectively encoding the light subunit of ferritin, and ceruloplasmin. How the other NBIA proteins involved in lipid metabolism, lysosomalactivity and autophagic processes disturb iron metabolism remains poorly understood. Thanks to whole exome sequencing in patients with NBIA we identi ﬁed mutations inREPS1 gene that allowed us to better understand iron homeostasis deregulation in NBIA. REPS1 is involved in endocytosis of membrane receptors, including transferrinreceptor (TfR1) and vesicle transport. Studying ﬁbroblast cells lines from subjects carrying biallelic mutations in REPS1 and known genes ( PANK2, PLA2G6, C19ORF12 andFA2H ), we ascribe iron overload to abnormal recycling of TfR1 and reduction of TfR1 palmitoylation in NBIA. Moreover, we describe palmitoylation as a hitherto unre ported level of post translational TfR1 regulation. A widely used antimalarial agent, artesunate, rescued abnormal TfR1palmitoylation in cultured ﬁbroblasts of NBIA subjects.

 Genetic basis of male reproductive disorders,E10.1,C. Krausz,Dept. of Experimental and Clinical Biomedical Sciences,"""Mario Serio""; University of Florence, Florence, Italy Couple infertility concerns 15% of couples and male reproductive anomalies are present in about half of the cases, either as the main reason or as a cofactor. Male infertility is a multifactorial complex pathological conditionin which genetic factors play a relevant role. Azoospermic men are at highest risk for being carriers of a genetic anomaly (25%).The genetic landscape of this condition ishighly complex as semen and testis histology phenotypes are extremely heterogeneous and at least 2,000 genes are involved in spermatogenesis (Krausz et al. 2015). Knowngenetic factors can be screened in all etiologic categories of male infertility (hypothalamic pituitary axis dysfunction, quantitative and qualitative alterations of spermatogenesis,ductal obstruction/dysfunction). Genetic testing is relevant for its diagnostic value and clinical decision making and for appropriate genetic counselling (Krausz et al. 2018).Anomalies in sex chromosomes have major role in severe spermatogenic impairment: i) Y chromosome microdele  tions (AZF deletions) are the most frequent moleculargenetic causes of severe oligo/azoospermia. Carriers of complete AZFa and AZFb deletions have virtually zero chance for successful sperm recovery through TesticularSperm Extraction, hence this genetic test has also a pre  TESE prognostic value (Krausz and Casamonti, 2017); ii) X chromosome linked, TEX11 mutations are novel causes of meiotic arrest. Over the last 20 years, two approaches have been used for the discovery of novel genetic factors: i) array based analyses (SNP and CNV); ii) exome analysis. Resultsfrom whole genome association studies suggest a marginal role for common variants as causative factors. Studies on Copy number variations (CNVs) demonstrated a con siderably higher CNV load in infertile patients compared with normozoospermic controls. This phenomenon may well be an expression of a more generalized genomicinstability, which could be one of the explanations for the epidemiological observations indicating lower life774 J. del Picchiaexpectancy and higher morbidity (including cancer) in infertile men. Recently a genetic link between late onset Fanconi Anemia due to FANCA mutations and SCOS has been identi ﬁed which further link infertility to a cancer prone disease. Whole exome analysis has proved a highly successful diagnostic tool in patients belonging to con sanguineous families. It allowed the identi ﬁcation of novel candidate genes (mainly autosomal) for central hypogo  nadism, monomorphic teratozoospermia/asthenozoos permia, congenital obstructive azoospermia and quantitative spermatogenic disturbances. Despite efforts, the aetiology of infertility remains unknown in about 40% of patients andthe discovery of novel genetic factors in idiopathic inferti  lity is a major challenge for the ﬁeld of andro genetics. The large majority of idiopathic patients are affected by quan titative spermatogenic disturbances and are not familial cases (sporadic). The development of a diagnostic gene panel based on exome data originating from familial cases ishighly limited, since these are due to recessive inheritance (i.e.one mutated allele is tolerated). In sporadic cases, hemizygous mutations and heterozygous autosomal muta tions with dominant negative effect or haploinsuf ﬁciency are the most obvious candidates.While the diagnostic interpretation of a pathogenic mutation on the sex chro mosomes is relatively easy, the causative link for a het  erozygote mutation is rather complex. It is expected that ongoing, large, consortium based, whole exome and whole genome studies will accelerate the discovery of the missing genetic aetiology of idiopathic male infertility.

Aldinger2","1Seattle, WA, United States,2Seattle Children's Research","Institute, Seattle, WA, United States The cerebellum is often overlooked in assessing fetuses and children with developmental brain disorders because of multiple patterns of malformation that are inconsistently deﬁned, lack of experience in recognizing these patterns, variable severity including non penetrance, occasional co  occurrence of atrophy, and limited understanding of the underlying causes. After excluding two well known groupsof autosomal recessive disorders with recognizable patterns of malformation (Joubert syndrome and pontocerebellar hypoplasia), cerebellar malformations have been con sistently observed with only two copy number variants (deletion 3q24 or 6p25.3) and a few genes (CASK, OPHN1 and FOXC1). Recent experience has shown that prenatalevents such as late 2nd early 3rd trimester posterior fossa and cerebellar bleeds and (less often) cerebellar ischemia, can cause cerebellar injuries that mimic cerebellar mal formations. Accordingly, genetic studies have shown a lower rate of abnormalities than other developmental dis  orders such as agenesis of the corpus callosum, intellectualdisability and autism. We have performed SNP microarrays in ~250 children and whole exome sequencing data in ~100 children with cerebellar malformations. Our analysis sug gests that cerebellar hypoplasia is a variable feature in many genetic developmental brain disorders, that prenatal injuriesto the cerebellum are common and can often be recognized based on the pattern of abnormality, and that these two processes may co occur.

Sinclair,"Murdoch Children's Research Institute, Melbourne, Australia","Disorders of sex development (DSD) represent a major pediatric concern and clinical management of these condi tions can be dif ﬁcult. Uncertainty about a child ’s gender can be traumatic for the individual and their family. It may also carry profound psychological and reproductive con sequences. Most often the underlying cause of DSD is a variant in a gene or genes regulating gonadal/genital or steroidogenic pathways. Providing a molecular diagnosisfor patients with a DSD and their families can serve mul  tiple purposes: naming the underlying cause contributes to acceptance, reduces stigma or blame, and provides crucialclues and guidance for clinical management, including information on the malignancy risks associated with some types of DSD. A diagnosis is integral to genetic counselingand family planning and yet it has been found that currently as few as 13% of patients with a DSD will receive a clinical molecular genetic diagnosis. To address this we have developed a massively parallel sequencing targeted DSD gene panel which allows us to sequence 64 known diagnostic DSD genes and 1000candidate genes simultaneously. Using this we have analyzed DNA from the largest reported international cohort of patients with DSD (278 patients with 46,XYDSD and 48 with 46,XX DSD). We found variants in a total of 28 diagnostic genes highlighting the genetic spectrum of this disorder. Sequencing revealed 93 previously unreportedDSD gene variants. Overall, we identi ﬁed a likely genetic diagnosis in 43% of patients with 46,XY DSD. In patients with 46,XY disorders of androgen synthesis and action thegenetic diagnosis rate reached 60%. Surprisingly, little difference in diagnostic rate was observed between singletons and trios. In many cases our ﬁndings were informative as to the likely cause of the DSD, which will facilitate clinical management.

Humans have 48 nuclear receptors and to date, de ﬁned conditions have been reported for almost half of them. Initially, phe notypes were predicted based on the known physiology of classic ligand dependent NRs (e.g thyroid receptor beta, vitamin D receptor, androgen receptor, estrogen receptor,mineralocorticoid receptor and glucocorticoid receptor). Subsequently, defects in “orphan ”nuclear receptors were found based on genetic mapping strategies or phenotypespredicted from expression/mouse models (e.g. DAX 1/ NR0B1, SF 1/NR5A1, PPAR gamma, FXR alpha).

Developmental biolo  gists have exploited the clear distinction between the epithelium and the underlyin g mesenchyme during tooth development to elucidate reci procal epithelial/mesench  ymal interactions during organogenesis. The preserva  tion of teeth in the fossil record makes these organs invaluable for the work of pa leontologists, anthro  pologists, and evolutionary biologists. In addition, with the recent identi ﬁcation and characterization of dental stem cells, teeth have become of interest to the ﬁeld of regenerative medicine. In this talk, I will review some of the major research areas and studies in the development and evolution of teeth, inc luding morphogenesis, genetics and signaling, evolution of tooth development, and dental stem cells.

Anomalies of tooth number (hypodontia, oligodontia, ano dontia), shape, size, mineralized tissue structure (i.e. enamel (amelogenesis imperfecta), dentin (dentinogenesis imper fecta, dentin dysplasia), cement, alveolar bone), eruption, and resorption may exist as isolated symptoms or diseases, but are often part of the clinical synopsis of numeroussyndromes. A vast number of genes are implicated in these disorders. It is dif ﬁcult to distinguish syndromic versus non syndromic diseases, as the same genes are often involved inboth categories. In addition, subclinical or non observed phenotypes might be underestimated. Concerning amelo genesis imperfecta, mutations in a number of genes havebeen reported to cause isolated enamel defects, including AMELX, ENAM, KLK4, MMP20, FAM83H, WDR72, C4orf26, SLC24A4 , and LAMB3 . In addition, many other genes such as DLX3, CNNM4, ROGDI, FAM20A, STIM1, ORAI1 , and LTBP3 have been shown to be involved in developmental syndromes with enamel defects. The clinicalpresentation of the enamel phenotype (hypoplastic, hypo mineralized, hypomature, or a combination of severities), alone does not allow a reliable prediction of possible cau sative genetic mutations. Our team has documented oro dental phenotypes which are described in the D[4]/ phenodent Diagnosing Dental Defects Database registry(www.phenodent.org ), which now comprises more than 4000 patients spanning 185 diseases linked to biological sample collection. Understanding the potential geneticcause(s) of rare diseases is critical for overall health man agement of affected patient. One effective strategy to reach a genetic diagnosis is to sequence a selected gene panelchosen for a determined range of phenotypes. Here we describe the results and problems with a speci ﬁc gene panelfor orodental diseases, GenoDENT, that targets 239 known and 271 candidate genes. The overall diagnostic rate for 300 patients was 60%. This panel, often offered de ﬁnitive diagnosis, modi ﬁed previous diagnosis, identi ﬁed digenic inheritance, allowed genotype/phenotype correlations, orientated patients towards genetic counseling, targeted theclinical procedures according to the disease type, identi ﬁed new diseases/genes, and facilitated the multidisciplinary management of rare diseases patients. Conclusions: We have developed a novel targeted NGS assay for the ef ﬁcient diagnosis of a variety of isolated and syndromic oro dental diseases. This panel includes novelcandidate genes, hence is a tool for gene discovery.

Objec  tive: To develop polygenic risk scores (PRS) with high predictive value for complications of diabetes and for dis tinguishing patients responding to ADVANCE intensive antihypertensive therapy.778 J. del PicchiaMethods: Genetic variants of diabetes complications were selected from GWAS publically available catalog. PRS were generated by weighting risk alleles by their effect size. Results: A genetic model composed of 620 SNPs, sex, age and geno ethnicity had an area under the curve of thereceiver operating characteristics of 0.72 for cardiovascular death in 4098 Caucasian of ADVANCE, comparable to ADVANCE clinical score of 0.70 and exceeding Framing ham risk engine. When individuals were divided into tertiles of genetic risk, a signi ﬁcant gradient for incident and prevalent outcomes was demonstrated from 1.55 for heartfailure to over 3 fold for macroalbuminuria, myocardial infarction and stroke. For events such as albuminuria and cardiovascular death, ADVANCE blood pressure medica tion could be administered as preventive measure in the highest tertile of genetic risk model. Cox cumulative hazard plots revealed that individuals with the highest genetic riskhad a decrease in mortality by ADVANCE anti  hypertensive treatment, persisting in ADVANCE ON post trial observation.

To facilitate thetranslation of genomic research and to empower individuals to undertake risk reducing interventions, we tested the effects of returning individual cardiovascular disease (CVD)risk information to 7,328 randomly sampled middle aged individuals from Southern Finland. To communicate thepersonalized risk information, we developed an interactive graphical interface which utilizes both traditional and genomic risk data (polygenic risk score (PRS) from ~49,000 common genetic variants). While the follow up of the full cohort is underway, we here report prospective results for 1,022 subjects. When reassessed by an e questionnaire and a clinical visit 1.5 years after the baseline 88.4% of participants said that their personal risk information had inspired them to takebetter care of their health. 13.7% had achieved sustained weight loss ( 3 kg) and 17.0% of smokers had quit smoking compared to 4% annual cessation rate in the generalpopulation. The propensity for risk reducing interventions (weight loss, smoking cessation or visiting a physician), was 32.4% in subjects with predicted 10 year risk of CVD>10% and 18.4% in subjects at lower risk. An increased PRS associated with successful intervention particularly in the high risk group (p < 0.001). Our preliminary data showthat integrating genomic and traditional health information for common chronic disease prevention and communicating this information back to individuals can support lifestylechanges.

 Development of a point of carepharmacogenetic test to avoid antibiotic related hearing loss in neonates,C01.3,"J. H. McDermott1, S. Ainsworth2, M. Szynkiewicz2, G. Miele2,W .",Newman1,"1Manchester Centre for Genomic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom,2Genedrive, Manchester, United Kingdom Introduction: In conjunction with a beta lactam the UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE)recommends the use of gentamicin, an aminoglycoside, as theﬁrst choice antibiotic for empirical treatment of sepsis in the neonatal period. The mitochondrial m.1555A>G variant,with a prevalence of 1 in 500, predisposes to ototoxicity after aminoglycoside administration. This relationship is particularly profound in early childhood, with a single dosecausing irreversible profound sensorineural hearing loss. Current genetic testing can take 3 days, an unacceptable delay in the acute setting. We aimed to develop a point ofcare test (POCT) to identify the variant in a clinically relevant timeframe. Methods: We used a Genedrive ®POCT platform to genotype m.1555A>G. An asymmetric polymerase chain reaction ampli ﬁes the target region before identi ﬁcation ofAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 779the genotype via melt curve analysis. The assay was optimised using buccal cell samples from the inner cheek and the system is designed to extract DNA, genotype using the above methodology and provide an actionable readout of the variant. Results: This POCT identi ﬁes the m1555A>G genotype in less than 40 minutes with sensitivity and speci ﬁcity comparable to the validated laboratory methodology. Conclusions: Using this system we can identify the m.1555A>G variant in a clinically relevant timeframe. The assay is portable, non invasive and will allow for tailored antibiotic prescribing in the acute setting to avoid neonatalhearing loss. A feasibility study introducing the POCT into neonatal units is starting in summer 2018, representing the ﬁrst pharmacogenetic assay for use in the acute setting. J.H. McDermott: None. S.

Protein losing enteropathy (PLE) manifests as hypoalbuminemia, edema, and malabsorption due tointestinal or lymphatic disruption. We studied an extended consanguineous Muslim Arab family comprising of six patients diagnosed with PLE and hypercoagulability. Methods . Whole exome sequencing (WES) was per  formed on three patients and a healthy mother. Flow cytometry was used to test for CD55 and complementoveractivation. Three patients were treated by off label compassionate eculizumab therapy, a humanized anti C5 monoclonal antibody. Results . WES analysis revealed a homozygous frameshift variant in CD55 (c.43del; p.Leu15Serfs*46), supported by two point LOD score of 4.43 and co segregation analysis inthe extended family (n ,32). Absence of CD55 was conﬁrmed by ﬂow cytometry. Furthermore, membrane attack complex (MAC) and iC3b depositions on WBCswere signi ﬁcantly increased in patients compared to age  matched controls (p < 0.001). Signi ﬁcant clinical and laboratory improvement was observed in patients treatedwith eculizumab, including resolution of diarrhea, normal  ization of serum albumin, and 60% reduction in MAC deposition on WBCs within two months, and furtherimprovement within a year. Discussion .CD55 encodes a membrane bound comple  ment regulatory protein that inhibits the C3/C5 convertasesand protects cells against complement induced self injury. The genetic ﬁndings and evidence of abnormal complement activation prompted successful off label compassionatetherapy with eculizumab, a terminal complement inhibitor. The treatment led to rapid improvement and ultimately achieved complete amelioration of symptoms in threetreated patients. This path from genetic analysis to tailored therapy warrants studying the roles of complement and CD55 in other intestinal disorders that may bene ﬁt from similar treatment. A. Kurolap: E.

We aim to con ﬁrm and test the func  tional role of rs7298096, a polymorphism located upstream to the NINJ2 (nerve injury induced protein 2) gene in a putative enhancer region, in the clinical response to IFN βin Multiple Sclerosis (MS). Materials : a total of 928 IFN β treated MS patients have been recruited across 4 centers in Italy, Spain and Australia.We also run eQTL analysis between rs7298096 and NINJ2 expression using available GTEx data and GEO datasets, and we performed a luciferase reporter assay. Results : an association between rs7298096 Gand time to ﬁrst relapse (TTFR) after drug start was observed in the Italian discovery cohort (P discovery ,0.032) and con ﬁrmed in two additional cohorts (P replication ,0.031 and 0.025), with rs7298096 Gbeing associated with a longer TTFR (Pmeta analysis ,2x10 4; HR: 1.51). Furthermore, we discovered that the SNP has an eQTL effect on NINJ2 expression in whole blood (P ,7.0x10 6) according toGTEx data, and it is able to modulate gene expression in vitro using a luciferase assay (P < 0.01). Conclusions : This study validates the role of rs7298096 in the clinical response to IFN βin MS patients. Ex vivo and in vitro experiments suggests that the SNP is able to inﬂuence the expression of NINJ2, an adhesion molecule involved in in ﬂammation and endothelial cell activation, supporting its role in relapse occurrence and in ﬂammatory activity in MS.

Hallberg1, on behalf of Swedegene","1Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden,2Uppsala Clinical Research Center, Uppsala, Sweden,3Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,4Medical Products Agency, Uppsala, Sweden Background: Narcolepsy is an autoimmune disease char  acterized by an inability to control sleep and wakefulness. The number of young diagnosed with narcolepsy rose sharply in Sweden following vaccination with Pandemrixagainst swine in ﬂuenza 2009 2010. The most frequent form, narcolepsy type I, is caused by a loss of hypocretin neurons, and is strongly associated with HLA DQB1*0602 . However, only 0.02% of HLA DQB1*0602 carriers devel  oped narcolepsy following vaccination, and it is probable that a combination of other genetic and external risk factorsare required. Method : 43 adjudicated cases of Pandemrix induced narcolepsy from the Swedish adverse drug reaction biobankSwedegene were compared with 4891 controls from TwinGene. Genotyping was performed on Illumina arrays. The merged dataset contained 600K single nucleotidepolymorphisms (SNPs), and after phasing and imputation 8.6 million SNPs. We corrected for principal components 1  4. The genome wide signi ﬁcance p value threshold was set to p < 5x10  8. Results: Pandemrix induced narcolepsy was signi ﬁcantly associated with HLA DQB1*0602 , odds ratio (OR) 6.4 [95% con ﬁdence interval (CI) 4.2, 9.8], p ,1.4x10 17.

Conclusion: We found an association with the non  coding RNA gene GDNF AS1 , which is located head to head with GDNF and potentially regulates this gene. GDNF encodes an essential neurotrophic factor that supportsneuronal survival and has been associated with Alzheimer ’s disease.

Glis1 3 play critical roles in the regulation of a number of physiological processes and, todate, mutations in GLIS2 andGLIS3 have been implicated in human pathologies (nephronophthisis, an autosomal recessive cystic kidney disease; neonatal diabetes andcongenital hypothyroidism, respectively). The role of GLIS1 in human embryogenesis and disease is unknown,and its function is still poorly understood. We performed whole exome sequencing in two unrelated families, each with two affected siblings, and identi ﬁed ultra rare, reces  sive missense mutations in GLIS1 that segregate with dis  ease. The variations modi ﬁed highly conserved amino acids and were predicted to be deleterious by 3 different bioin formatics tools. Comparison of the clinical features of the four individuals harboring GLIS1 mutations shows pheno  typic overlap, including IUGR, arthrogryposis, short ribs,vertebral anomalies, and microretrognathia and microstomia as the predominant craniofacial dysmorphisms. Notably, individuals in these two families display a different degreeof severity: lethal (resembling the Crane Heise syndrome) and non lethal (similar to Bhoring Opitz syndromes), respectively. To establish the relevance of GLIS1 loss of function to disease, we have developed F0 glis1 zebra ﬁsh mutants and transient loss of function models. These ani  mals display signi ﬁcant defects in craniofacial cartilage patterning in comparison to controls. Together, our clinical and genetic ﬁndings as well our preliminary modeling stu  dies, indicate a likely role for GLIS1 in early developmental processes in humans, and potentially represent differing aspects of an allelic spectrum of severity.

Small for gestational age (SGA) birth is associated with adult metabolic syndrome but relevance toSRS (a cause of SGA) is unclear. Educational attainment in adults with SRS has not been assessed. We, therefore, sought to determine the phenotype, cardio metabolic pro ﬁle and academic attainment in adults with SRS and propose a scoring system. Methods: UK participants aged ≥18 years with SRS were invited to a study appointment involving a medical history, clinical examination and investigations. Results: 33 individuals (18 females) aged 13.32 69.71 years (median 29.58) were recruited. Loss of methylation at H19/IGF2 was diagnosed in 81.8%; maternal unipar  ental disomy for chromosome 7 in 18.2%. Median heightstandard deviation score (SDS) was  2.67; weight SDS 1.72; body mass index SDS  0.53; and head circumfer  ence SDS  0.95. Short stature (height SDS ≤ 2) was present in 60.6%. Asymmetry and relative macrocephaly were present in 66.7% and 57.6% respectively. Con  genital anomalies were present in 45.5%. In those aged≥18 years (n ,25), GCSEs were gained by 84%; university degrees by 48%. Type 2 diabetes mellitus (n ,3), hypertension (n ,2), and hypercholesterolaemia (n ,2) were observed. Conclusions: the clinical features show similarities and differences to childhood reports suggesting a change overtime. Educational attainment in this cohort is above the UK average but cardio metabolic pr oblems appear similar. We will propose a system for targeting epigenetic testing in adults withshort stature.

While BG dysfunction is observed in many neurodegenerative or metabolic dis orders, congenital malformations are rare. Dysplastic BG are typical of tubulinopathies but their agenesis/marked hypoplasia has never been reported to date. Material and methods: We ascertained two unrelated sporadic girls presenting with spastic tetraparesis and severe intellectual impairment, sharing a unique malformationcharacterized by agenesis/hypoplasia of BG (mainly puta  men and globus pallidus) and olfactory bulbs, and hypothalamic mesencephalic fusion. WES identi ﬁed two novel homozygous variants, c.26C> A (p.Ser9*) and c.752A> G (p.Gln251Arg) in the GSX2 gene, a member of the family of homeobox transcription factors, which arekey regulators of embryonic development. GSX2 is selectively expressed in the lateral ganglionic eminence, a protrusion of the ventral telencephalon from which, alongwith the medial ganglionic eminence, the BG and olfactory tubercles originate. Results: The truncating variant resulted in complete loss of protein expression. The missense variant affects a highly conserved residue of the homeobox domain (HD) and is consistently predict ed as pathogenic. Molecular dynamics showed impaired HD structural stability and weaker interaction with DNA. Expression studies on both patients ’ﬁbroblasts demonstrated reduced expres  sion of GSX2 itself, likely due to a ltered transcriptional self regulation, as well as signi ﬁcant expression changes of target genes ASCL1 (downregulated) and PAX6 (upregulated). Conclusions: We report for the ﬁrst time the clinical phenotype and molecular basis associated to BG agenesis inhumans. Funding: ERC Starting Grant 260888; Ricerca Finalizzata NET 2013 02356160. R.

To identify new molecular components of this system, we performed a systematic genetic interrogation via whole exome sequencing of families with isolated GnRHdeﬁciency (IGD). We report 10 families with an anosmic form of IGD (Kallmann Syndrome; [KS]) harboring auto  somal dominant loss of function mutations in TCF12 ,a transcription factor also known to cause syndromic cranio  synostosis. We observed no distinction in mutation localiza  tion on the TCF12 locus for KS versus the reported craniosynostosis alleles. Additionally, 3/10 families display both KS and craniosynostosis indicating that allelism at the driver gene alone is insuf ﬁcient to explain the phenotypic variability. To dissect this phenomenon further, we show that loss of tcf12 in zebra ﬁsh perturbs GnRH neuronal patterning with concomitant attenuation of the expression of severalpotentially downstream genes that are both mutated in other syndromic forms of IGD and map to a TCF12 af ﬁnitynetwork. Finally, rescue of tcf12 loss of function GnRH phenotypes was achieved by mRNA corresponding to one of these loci, STUB1 . In addition to extending the rapidly evolving genetic architecture of IGD, these studies begin to assemble one of the functional networks that regulate the ontogeny of GnRH neurons and potentially modulate phe notype. These ﬁndings also highlight an emerging class of pleiotropic genes including FGFR1, SMCHD1, CHD7 ,a n d now TCF12 that contribute to both IGD and distinct cranio  facial abnormalities.

Elevated risk of premature death hasbeen reported for 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS), however the effect of key 22q11.2DS associated features on all cause mortality is unknown. Methods: We studied 1265 adults ( ≥17 years): 290 with 22q11.2DS (135 male; median age 29.7, range 17.8 68.6, years), their 444 unaffected siblings and 531 unaffectedparents, followed for up to 23 years. We compared survival between groups using Kaplan Meier estimates and Cox regression (hazard ratio (HR) and 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI)) to investigate the relationship between all cause mortality and potential predictor variables including major congenital heart defects (CHD), psychotic illness, andintellectual disability. Results: Adults with 22q11.2DS had lower (p < 0.0001) survival than unaffected siblings or parents. The 22q11.2deletion (HR 10.3, 95% CI 3.2 32.5) and major CHD (HR 4.7, 95% CI 2.1 10.6) were signi ﬁcant predictors of784 J. del Picchiamortality. Within 22q11.2DS, major CHD (HR 3.0, 95% CI 1.2 7.5) remained a signi ﬁcant risk predictor when control  ling for other factors. There were 31 (10.7%; 13 M) deaths of individuals with 22q11.2DS at median age 46.4 (range 18.1 68.6) years. Conclusions: Individuals with 22q11.2DS who survive childhood have diminished life expectancy, attributable largely to the 22q11.2 deletion, with major CHD as an additional signi ﬁcant contributor. Median age at death was nearly 5 years older than when examined ~10 years ago in a smaller cohort. A substantial minority of patients outlive both parents. Further longitudinal studies are needed todetermine the underlying mechanisms, and potential modifying effects of anticipatory care. A.S. Bassett: None. T. Heung: None. E. Ng: None. J. Graf ﬁ:None.

Patients with CFC syndrome also commonly show gastrointestinal dysfunction, including feeding and swallowing dif ﬁculties and gastroesophageal reﬂux. We have previously found that knock in mice expressing a Braf Q241R mutation exhibit CFC syndrome  related phenotypes, such as growth retardation, craniofacialdysmorphisms, congenital heart defects, learning de ﬁcits and ectodermal abnormalities. However, it remains unclear whether Braf Q241R /+mice exhibit gastrointestinal dysfunc  tion. Here, we report that BrafQ241R /+mice have neonatal feeding dif ﬁculties and esophageal dilation. The esophagus tissues from BrafQ241R /+mice displayed incomplete repla  cement of smooth muscle with skeletal muscle and decreased contraction response to carbachol, an acetylcho  line receptor agonist. In contrast, achalasia like loss ofneuronal cells was not observed in the lower esophageal sphincter. The Braf Q241R /+mice also showed epithelialhyperplasia, hyperkeratosis and a thickened muscle layer in the forestomach, showing the increased expression of genes related to cell adhesion, epithelium development and kera  tin. Treatment with MEK inhibitors, including PD0325901, MEK162 and AZD6244, partly ameliorated the growth retardation, esophageal dilation, hyperkeratosis and thick ened muscle layer in the forestomach in Braf Q241R /+mice. The esophageal dilation and aberrant skeletal smooth muscle boundary were ameliorated in BrafQ241R /+mice treated with the histone H3K27 demethylase inhibitor, GSK J4.

Both host genetics and microbiome features were associated with host metabolism. 54 bacterial pathways were linked to individual metabolic risk scores for CVD; these microbial effects are largely mediated by BMI, diet and in ﬂammatory cytokines. In particular, bacterial metabolism of L methionine was consistently associated to higher level of glycoprotein N acetyls in plasma, and to atherosclerotic plaques in obese individuals. L methionine is associated tohigher metabolic risk score of CVD, higher in ﬂammatory cytokines and lower fruit intake. These ﬁndings point to the potential use of bacterial L methionine biosynthesis andother microbial pathways as a therapeutic target of meta  bolic diseases and CVD. A. Zhernakova: None. A.

Recently novel single cell multi omics methods have been developed.Importantly, such technologies now enable us to study the diversity of cancer cell states (determined by the interplay of their genome, epigenome and transcriptome) that ariseswithin a tumor, at its most fundamental level, the cell. One example is the genome and transcriptome sequencing (G&T seq) method, where DNA and RNA of the samesingle cell can be sequenced in parallel. 480 single cells of a patient with unifocal breast cancer were sequenced and we were able to computationallyseparate and identify normal and cancer cells based on the genomic and transcriptome pro ﬁles. The single cell DNA copy number landscapes disclosed clear genetic alterationspresent in subclonal populations of cells. We identi ﬁed biologically relevant marker genes from the transcriptomicproﬁles with genes involved in the negative regulation of apoptosis, metastasis, RET signaling and/or increasing cell motility. In addition, ERBB2 was identi ﬁed as a marker gene in accordance with the HER2 +molecular classi ﬁca  tion of the tumor. Furthermore, in this experiment, we were able to unambiguously study for the ﬁrst time the effect of copy number state on the transcriptome in breast tumors using the G&T seq technique.

Stegle1 1EMBL EBI, Hinxton, United Kingdom,2Stanford University, Stanford, CA, United States,3UCSD, San Diego, CA, United States,4University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States Genome wide association studies have yielded a compen  dium of genetic variants that are associated with humandiseases. However, the majority of these variants are in intergenic region, and understanding their function remains challenging. One strategy for linking these risk variants togenes are expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies. To date, most large scale eQTL studies have been per  formed in LCLs, blood, or post mortem collected tissues.However, disease causing variants often have tissue  speciﬁc effects. To understand effects manifesting in plur  ipotent and dedifferentiated cells, we mapped eQTLs in thelargest panel of human induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) considered to date. Using the data collected in the i2QTL CONSORTIUM we mapped eQTLs in a set of ~1,500 iPSC lines, derived from over 1,000 donors. Gene expression was quanti ﬁed using RNA sequencing, enabling the mapping of eQTLs togenes, exons, transcripts, splicing and UTR usage. We identi ﬁed signi ﬁcant cis eQTLs for over 63% of expressed genes (FDR < 5%), 5% of which have not been observed inother studies. Our integrative analysis identi ﬁed hundreds of trans  acting regulatory variants, including ~100 GWAS786 J. del Picchiavariants. One example is the trans  acting SNP near the transcription factor ELF2 which leads to expression changes in genes, downstream of ELF2 . Another interesting example is the observed link between a GWAS variant to atrans  egene ( MED19 ), both previously implicated in prostate carcinoma, but not previously linked. This high lights the relevance of this map for cancer and pluripotency. Currently, we are including both rare  and structural  variants to try and make a de ﬁnitive map of cis andtrans   eQTLs in iPSCs. M.J. Bonder: None. C. Smail: None. D. Jakubosky: None. C.

As part of the Human Functional Genomics Project we aim to char  acterize the genetic determinants of baseline metaboliteslevels to better understand how these changes relate to the previously observed inter individual variation in immune response. We conducted a metabolite quantitative trait locus (mQTLs) mapping for 10,431 baseline metabolic featuresmeasured by three pro ﬁling approaches (Brain Shake metabolites, general metabolites and untarget metabolites) in 500 healthy Dutch individuals. In total, we mapped >200 independent genome wide signi ﬁcant loci as being in ﬂuen  tial on 1229 metabolic features. Pathway analysis on the mQTL genes show a signi ﬁcant enrichment in metabolic processes. We found 116 nonsynonymous mQTL SNPs out of which 17 SNPs show a deleterious effect on metabolic enzyme function. Interestingly, >10 mQTLs shared com mon co regulation with Crohn disease or Celiac disease. We further systematically associated these metabolites features with 9 categories ’host factors consisting of baseline immune parameters (including 73 immune cell subpopulation frequencies), molecular pro ﬁles (including transcriptome, gut microbiome) and immune response(cytokine production capacity upon stimulation). In general, metabolites show higher correlation with monocyte derived cytokines than with lymphocyte derived cytokines. Bycombining genetic markers and metabolite measurements we achieved a signi ﬁcant improvement in predicting cytokine production when compared to solely usinggenetics (p value < 0.05). In summary, this study reveals novel genetics factors regulating blood metabolite levels and highlights theimportance of baseline metabolites in immune response. X. Chu: None. M. Jaeger: None. O.B.

However, causal relationships betweenproteins and clinical phenotypes are not fully understood. Here, we used genetics as an instrumental variable and assessed causality between circulating proteins, gut micro biome, metabolic traits and complex diseases in 1,294 individuals from the LifeLines DEEP cohort, which has genetics, proteomics, gut microbiome data and over 2,000phenotypes available. In this study, we focused on 92 CVD related proteins and ﬁrst tested their association with genetic variation and microbiome. Then we performed a two directional Mende  lian randomization analysis to assess causal relationships between proteins and microbiome, metabolic traits andclinical phenotypes. To do so, we constructed genetic risk scores (GRS) for 73 proteins, 42 microbial factors, over 1000 complex traits and diseases based on our dataset andpublished GWAS studies. We found 327 protein GRS associations signi ﬁcant at FDR < 0.05. The most signi ﬁcant proteins include GRN, SELE, PECAM 1 and ICAM 2,potentially relevant to CVD. Around one third of the associated GRS involve metabolic traits. We also see associations with GRS for lipids and immune cell traits. Wedetected numerous associations between GRS of proteins with microbiome and clinical traits. Our study suggests bi directional causal relationships between circulating proteins, gut microbiome and complex traits and diseases. We prioritize proteins as potential targets for therapeutic treatment if they are causal risk factors, andproteins as biomarkers to monitor disease progression if their alteration is a consequence of a speci ﬁc disease.

WellsChildren ’s Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United","States Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) have impli  cated >60 loci in the susceptibility to Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE). However, it is known that GWASonly reports genomic signals and not necessarily the precise localization of culprit genes. Chromatin conformation cap  ture technologies that detect contacts between distantregions of the genome offer an opportunity to physically map disease variants to effector genes. To move beyond analyzing one locus at a time, and to improve upon the lowresolution of available Hi C datasets, we developed a massively parallel, high resolution Capture C based method to characterize the genome wide interactions of all humanpromoters in any cell type. We designed a custom Agilent SureSelect RNA library targeting DpnII restriction frag  ments overlapping 36,691 promoters of protein coding,noncoding, antisense, snRNA, miRNA, snoRNA and lincRNA genes. We applied our method of SPATIaL seq (genome Scale, Promoter focused Analysis of chromaTInLooping) to primary human T follicular helper (TFH) cells from healthy tonsil, a cell type relevant to SLE. These sub  1kb datasets were intersected with ATAC seq maps of TFHopen chromatin and SLE proxy SNPs from the 63 loci, resulting in an assessment of accessible variants at 48 of these loci. Some ‘nearest ’genes to the sentinel SNP were supported e.g. STAT4 andIKZF3 , while at other loci more distant genes were implicated e.g. LCLAT1 at the ‘LBH ’ locus, and the master TFH transcription factor BCL6 at the ‘LPP TPRG1 ’locus.

MEF2C haploinsuf ﬁciency has been associated with a Rett like syndrome, characterized by severe intellectual disability,seizures and stereotypic movements. So far, 11 deletions, eight translocations and one inversion involving 5q14.3 in Rett like patients have been described, that do not directlyaffect the MEF2C coding sequence, suggesting that dis  ruption of MEF2C regulatory elements could result in this Rett like syndrome. The MEF2C regulatory network,however, is yet to be deciphered.

Results: Extensive 4C sequencing in a neuronal cell line revealed an intricate interaction network, in which the MEF2C promoter physically contacts distal putative enhancers located in the region affected in Rett likepatients. We con ﬁrmed enhancer potential for 10 out of 15 selected candidate elements using luciferase assays. Moreover, eight candidate enhancers exhibited in vivoneuronal activity in zebra ﬁsh. Six of these were active in the forebrain, of which three also displayed additional activity in speci ﬁc neurons above the eye and two in the notochord. Further, one enhancer displayed mid  and hindbrain activity and one was speci ﬁcally active in the notochord. Conclusions: In summary, we have begun to unravel the complex regulatory network governing neuronal MEF2C transcription, involving multiple distal enhancers. Disrupt ing this regulatory structure is likely detrimental to normal neurodevelopment and can give rise to neurodevelopmental disorders such as Rett like syndrome. E. D'haene: None. R.

 Personalized co expression networks reveal genetic risk factors that change the regulatory wiring of cells,C04.3,"M. G. P. van der Wijst, D. H. de Vries, H. Brugge, P. Deelen,","M. A. Swertz, Lifelines Cohort Study, BIOS Consortium,","L. Franke UMCG, Groningen, NetherlandsAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 789Expression quantitative trait locus (eQTL) analyses have taught us that genetic risk factors for disease often affect gene expression in a cell type speci ﬁc way. However, much less is known about their effect on the regulatory wiring of individual cells. In order to study how genetic variants can affect regulatory networks, we generated personalizedco expression networks for 45 different individuals by generating single cell RNA seq (scRNA seq) data for approximately 29.000 peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Weﬁrst validated our approach by replicating 261 cis  eQTLs that were previously identi ﬁed in bulk RNA seq data, and subsequently ascertained whether genetic variantscan also alter the co expression between genes (so called ‘co expression QTLs ’). We identi ﬁed several of these co  expression QTLs at a false discovery rate of 0.05 andreplicated these in large bulk RNA seq datasets. For instance, we found 93 signi ﬁcant co expression QTLs for the type I diabetes (T1D) variant rs11171739. This SNPaffects the co expression between RPS26 and 93 other genes, many of which are known to be involved in mRNA translation, which suggests that this T1D variant mightdysregulate this particular pathway. In conclusion, this study shows the feasibility of using scRNA seq data for eQTL and co expression QTL analysis.With the expected growth in scRNA seq eQTL datasets in the near future, we expect many more genetic variants will be identi ﬁed that affect the regulatory wiring within cells, and which could be used to infer personalized regulatory networks using solely genotype data.

They contain hotspots for transcrip  tion factor binding sites and are considered candidate regions harboring disease related non coding mutations.However, there is lack of information about how chromatin transcriptional regulation differs between health and (car  diac) disease. Here we focus on cardiac material of ahomogeneous Dutch founder cohort of genetic cardiomyo  pathy due to same PLN R14del mutation as compared to controls. Materials and Methods: We performed H3K27ac ChIPseq, RNA sequencing, and 4C on several tissues/cell lines related to PLN R14del cardiomyopathy and controls. Results: Based on H3K27ac ChIPseq data, 2,107 differentially acetylated peaks and 1,302 topologically associating domains (TADs) have been detected. Using awindow of +/ 5kb from TSS, we have annotated 863 genes in their proximity. Enrichment of binding motifs related to 200 transcription factors (TFs) inside these regions havebeen found. Next, we show a correlation between H3K27ac promoter occupancy and the level of RNA expression. Furthermore, we detected a condition speci ﬁcﬁngerprint by comparing the differentially active regions in PLN R14del to acetylation pro ﬁles of additional patients with ischemic cardiomyopathy and unrelated non ischemic cardiomyopa thy. iPSC derived cardiomyocyte cell lines of PLN R14del patient and control were used for 4C based annotation of most signi ﬁcant differentially acetylated regions. Conclusions: Integrative chromatin analysis based on H3K27ac ChIP seq, RNAseq and 4C identi ﬁes the major effector processes involved in PLN R14del end stagecardiomyopathy, including many novel candidates.

 Alteration of HDAC9 exons that also function as enhancers leads to TWIST1 haploinsuf ﬁciency that result in limb and craniofacial phenotypes,C04.5,"N. Hirsch1, F. shemuluvich1, T. Kaplan2, D. G. Lupiáñez3,",R. Y. B. Birnbaum1,"1Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel,2The Hebrew University of Jerusalem, Jerusalem, Israel,3Max Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany The transcription factor TWIST1 plays a vital role in mesoderm development, particularly in limb and craniofa  cial formation. TWIST1 haploinsuf ﬁciency during devel  opment could lead to craniosynostosis and limb malformation such as Saethre Chotzen syndrome. However, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism that controlsTWIST1 expression during development is yet to be eluci  date. Here, we characterized active enhancers in the TWIST1 HDAC9 locus that control transcription in the developing limb and branchial arches. Using p300 and H3K27ac ChIP seq data, we identi ﬁed 12 enhancer candi  dates encompass protein coding exons of Histone deace  tyase 9 (HDAC9 ). Using zebra ﬁsh and mouse enhancer assays, we showed that 8 candidates have limb/ ﬁn and branchial arch enhancer activity that recapitulate Twist1 expression. Each enhancer showed discrete activity pattern that together compile a spatiotemporal transcriptional reg  ulation of Twist1 in the developing limb/ ﬁn and branchial arches. Using 4C seq, we showed that Twist1 promoter interacts with Hdac9 exons that function as enhancers in the limb bud and branchial arch of mouse embryos at day 11.5.Alteration of these enhancers lead to Twist1 haploinsuf ﬁ  ciency and polydactyly in mouse models. Furthermore, TWIST1 enhancers are regulated by limb expressed tran  scription factors, including LMX1B and TFAP2 that bind and regulate their activity. Deletion of the LMX1B and TFAP2 binding sites altered TWIST1 enhancer activity. Thus, our study elucidated essential components of TWIST1 transcriptional machinery, suggesting that alteration of coding exons of HDAC9 could lead to TWIST1 hap  loinsuf ﬁciency and a similar phenotypic outcome as TWIST1 coding mutations.

 Treating Retinitis Pigmentosa with transcriptional based therapeutics,C04.6,"S. Botta, E. Marrocco, E. M. Surace","TIGEM, Pozzuoli (NA), Ita, Italy","CRISPR/Cas9, transcription activator like effectors (TAL) and zinc  ﬁnger proteins (ZF), are emerging as remarkably potent and popular DNA targeting platforms for genome editing and transcriptional regulation (gene activation andrepression) in research applications. Here we investigated the design and development of therapeutics based on tran  scriptional modulation. In particular, as experimental mod els to establish the proof of concept of transcriptional repression as therapeutic, we used a RHODOPSIN (RHO) gene gain of function mutant transgenic mouse and the pre clinical pig retina. RHO is the gene most commonly involved in the blinding disease autosomal dominant reti  nitis pigmentosa (adRP). In vivo retinal gene transfer byAdeno associated virus (AAV) vectors of transcriptional repressors based on synthetic ZF DNA binding proteins with (ZF6 R) or without (ZF6 DB) canonical repressordomain, enable the complete RHO transcriptional silencing and in turn therapy in the P347S mouse model of RHO adRP. In addition, we showed that the AAV mediatedectopic expression of the endogenous transcription factor (TF) KLF15 similarly generate robust RHO silencing. In the pig retina, comparison of speci ﬁcity by RNA sequencing, showed that ZF6 R and ZF6 DB perturbed 220 and 19 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), respectively. Sur  prisingly, the endogenous ectopic expression of the TFKLF15, showed similar high selectivity with 156 DEGs and therefore a safe pro ﬁle. Ef ﬁcacy assessed by retinal func  tional analysis in the adRP mouse model, show remarkableprevention of retinal degeneration. Collectively, these data support transcriptional modulation as a novel paradigm to generate transcriptional based therapeutics for the treatmentof human inherited disorders by gene therapy supporting their use in translational medicine.

Materials and Methods: Through whole exome and RNA sequencing, we studied three unrelated families, presenting at birth with congenital arthrogryposis, micro cephaly with consistent simpli ﬁed gyral pattern and mild cerebellar hypoplasia. The only child who survived up to six years developed also anemia and diabetes. We usedelectronic microscopy (EM) and ﬂow citometry to evaluate ultrastructural and cell cycle anomalies in patients ’ ﬁbroblast cultures. In addition, we searched for similar cellular alterations within the Connectivity library Map from Broad Institute.Results: In all patients, we identi ﬁed biallelic loss of  function mutations in SMPD4 , encoding a putative neutral sphingomyelinase without a clearly de ﬁned role, localized in the endoplasmic reticulum. Analyses on patients ’ ﬁbroblasts revealed a drastic reduction of normal SMPD4 transcript levels, a dilated rough ER with aggregates ofmisfolded proteins and excess of lysosomes and late autophagic vacuoles. In addition, cell division alterations were observed. Connectivity mapping of SMPD4 deﬁcient gene expression signatures revealed highest similarity to SPHK2 knock down. SPHK2 is one of the enzymes controlling the balance between ceramide and sphingo sine 1 phosphate, which is important for regulation of cell stress response and cell growth. SMPD4 mutant patient ﬁbroblasts were more sensitive to the SPHK2 inhibitor ABC294640 compared to control cells.

Straub1","1Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom, 2Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States Introduction: Muscular dystrophies are rare genetic dis  orders characterised by progressive skeletal muscle weak  ness and atrophy. The diseases can be exceptionallydebilitating and can directly precipitate premature mortality. Many patients remain undiagnosed even after several years of state of the art clinical work ups. With a view to resol ving this diagnostic odyssey, the MYO SEQ project applied targeted whole exome sequencing (WES) to over 1,000792 J. del PicchiaEuropean patients with suspected genetic muscle disease. Here, we detail the results for those patients with a reported age at disease onset of ≤15 years ( n,470). Materials and methods: WES was performed using Illumina exome capture (38 Mb target) and a Picard based pipeline. The variant call set was uploaded onto seqr and 429 neuromuscular disease genes examined for point mutations, small indels and copy number variations (CNVs). Results: Pathogenic variants were identi ﬁed in 59% ( n, 278) of patients across 70 genes. The average age at the time of WES diagnosis was 29 years (median 26 years,range 4 77 years). LGMD2A ( CAPN3 ) and sarcoglycano  pathies ( SGCA ,SGCB SGCD and SGCG ) were the most commonly diagnosed diseases, together accounting for athird of the solved cohort. Through an extended and modiﬁed analysis of the WES data, CNVs were detected in 8% of the solved patients and ranged in size from 0.11 kb to1,047 kb.

M. van der Maarel1 1Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands, 2University of Rochester Medical Center, Rochester, NY, United States,3Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, Netherlands,4Nice University Hospital, Nice, France Introduction: Facioscapulohumeral muscular dystrophy, known in genetic forms FSHD1 and FSHD2, is associated with D4Z4 repeat chromatin relaxation and somatic dere pression of DUX4 located in D4Z4. A complete copy of DUX4 is present on 4A chromosomes, but not on the D4Z4  like repeats of chromosomes 4B or 10. Normally, the D4Z4repeat varies between 8 100 units, while in FSHD1 it is only 1 10 units. In the rare FSHD2, a combination of a 4A allele with a D4Z4 repeat size of 8 20 units and hetero zygous variants in the chromatin modi ﬁer SMCHD1 causes DUX4 derepression and disease. We identi ﬁed FSHD2patients with unusually large 4A alleles of 21 70 D4Z4 units. Recently, in cis D4Z4 repeat duplications were described in ~2% of FSHD cases irrespective of SMCHD1 mutation status, which prompted us to investigate FSHD2 patients with unusually long D4Z4 repeats for this duplication. Materials and Methods: Genetic analysis of D4Z4 by Southern blotting and molecular combing of 251 non FSHD families, 351 FSHD1 families, 62 FSHD2 and 52 FSHD like families. Results: In 6/10 FSHD2 families with a 4A allele of 21  70 D4Z4 units, we identi ﬁed a small D4Z4 repeat duplication associated with DUX4 expression. The duplica  tion allele frequency was signi ﬁcantly higher than in typical FSHD2 families (2.0%), FSHD1 (2,3%) or non FSHDfamilies (2.6%). Interestingly, we identi ﬁed duplication alleles in 7/52 (13.5%) FSHD like families.

Brüggemann, K.",Lohmann,"Institute of Neurogenetics, Luebeck, Germany Introduction: Spastic ataxia is a clinically and genetically highly heterogeneous neurological disease. Despite a wealth of known genes causing this syndrome, many cases remain etiologically unexplained, suggesting that further geneticheterogeneity remains to be discovered. Results: Exome sequencing in a German family with two affected sisters with spastic ataxia with onset in the thirddecade of life revealed compound heterozygous variants in VPS13D [c.5409C>A [Tyr1803Ter] and c.12629C>T [Ala4210Val]) in both patients and heterozygous variantsin their unaffected parents. Sanger sequencing of cDNA revealed lower expression of the nonsense mutated allele compared to the missense mutated allele, resulting in a~50% reduction in the total mRNA level of VPS13D in the patients compared to non mutation carriers. This reduction was caused by nonsense mediated mRNA decay asdemonstrated by cycloheximide treatment in cultured cells.

Since VPS13D disrup  tion in Drosophila leads to mitochondrial abnormalities, we investigated mitochondrial morphology and function in patient derived ﬁbroblasts. While the typical mitochondrial network of elongated organelles and branches was observed in two controls, patients ’ﬁbroblasts showed rounded mitochondria and disrupted mitochondrial interconnectivity,which was con ﬁrmed by decreased mitochondrial GRP 75 protein levels. These structural mitochondrial changes were accompanied by a reduced ATP production rate.

Mutations in genes regulating ER stress can cause micro  cephaly and abnormal cortical development, e.g. EIF2AK3(OMIM#226980), and IER3IP1 (OMIM#614231) mutations.We observed a 14 days old newborn with primary microcephaly and diffuse polymicrogyria at MRI, and conﬁrmed at autopsy, who died of untreatable epilepsy. WES data revealed biallelic compound heterozygous mutations in TMX2 . Six similarly affected individuals from four additional unrelated families were found to havebiallelic TMX2 mutations. Thioredoxin(TRX) Related Transmembrane protein 2 (TMX2) is a putative oxidor  eductase enriched at the mitochondria associated membraneof the ER and known to protect against ER stress and to regulate neuronal apoptosis. Under ER stress conditions, exchange of calcium between ER and mitochondria is impaired, which leads to mitochon  drial accumulation of calcium and secondary mitochondrial OXPHOS failure. Mitochondrial energy metabolism inﬁbroblasts from two unrelated patients showed de ﬁcient OXOPHOS reserve capacity (which measures mitochon  drial tolerance to stress) and an increase of glycolyticactivity in basal conditions, suggesting a mechanism to compensate bioenergetics defect. We hypothesize that mutations in TMX2 cause defects in bioenergetics metabo  lism and ER stress induced apoptosis, leading to primary microcephaly, polymicrogyria and severe neurodegenera  tion. While mutations of mitochondrial thioredoxin 2(TXN2, TRX2 , OMIM #616811) and of cytosolic thior  edoxin reductase 1 ( TXNRD1 , OMIM #60112) have been related to early onset neurodegeneration and epilepsy, this isto our knowledge the ﬁrst observation linking one of the ER TMX family members to abnormal neurodevelopment and secondary OXPHOS de ﬁciency.

Here we investigated the whole genome sequence of single muscle stem cells from healthy individuals (21 79years of age) to identify age associated mutation processes and their functional consequences. Stem cell whole genome sequences were obtained from cultured single cell clones(n,29), circumventing disadvantages associated with sin  gle cell sequencing. This strategy, together with functional experiments on cultured clones, allowed us to discover age speciﬁc differences and to highlight their functional rele  vance in driving age related muscle decline. We show that aging affects the number of mutations and their genomedistribution. In particular, while transcribed genes of young cells were protected from mutations, old cells had lost this protection, possibly as a result of impaired transcription coupled repair. In addition, old stem cells also showed an increased non synonymous/synonymous mutation ratio compared to young cells, supporting impaired negativeselection against cells with mutations in functional regions at older ages. Using ddPCR, to detect low frequency mutations in tissue, we validated somatic mutations in themuscle bulk tissue. In summary, our results support somatic mutagenesis in muscle stem cells as a contributor to the age  related decline of muscle function. I. Franco: None. A. Johansson: None. K. Olsson: None. P.

Recently,certain genes that were identi ﬁed in hereditary cholestasis were found in families with congenital diarrhea, and vice versa ( MYO5B , explained the role of this gene in the polarization of hepatocytes and enterocytes, ABCB11 , TTC37 andSKIV2L) .Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 795Materials and Methods: We used exome sequencing to study four girls from 3 separate families, aged 4 to 23 years, presenting phenotypic constellation including cholestasis, congenital diarrhea, deafness, brittle bones and learning delays, who didn't correspond to an existing diagnostic framework. Results: None of the four patients presented identical clinical signs, and mode of entry was severe congenital diarrhea with microvilli resulting in the need for long termexclusive parenteral nutrition for two patients, and choles  tasis for the two others. Compound heterozygote or homozygote variants   truncation or missense   of theUnc 45 Myosin Chaperone A ( UNC45A) gene were identi ﬁed in three families, which allowed researchers to group the families and describe the different expression of anewly discovered syndrome. UNC45A hadn't been pre  viously associated with a condition in humans. Research on the C. elegans UNC 45 ortholog has shown the role of thisgene in motility disorders. In vitro and in vivo functional studies on a zebra ﬁsh model con ﬁrmed the involvement of UNC45A. Conclusions: These results show the importance of next generation sequencing for identi ﬁcation of new genes responsible for heterogeneous clinical presentation, andhighlight value of data sharing in research.

Symptoms include recurrent respiratory tract infections, laterality defects and adult subfertility. Disease causing mutations have been identi ﬁed in 37 genes that still only account for around 70% of cases, with additional genes still to be identi ﬁed. Subjects and Methods : 175 unrelated families from various ethnicities were recruited. We screened patients for mutations using a multi gene panel including all the known PCD genes and other potential candidates. All prioritizedvariants were con ﬁrmed in the affected individuals and segregated in available family members using Sanger sequencing. To functional characterize novel candidategenes, we analysed mutated cilia structure and the consequences of gene silencing in the unicellular aquatic ciliate, Paramecium . Results: We identi ﬁed 167 disease causing variants in known PCD genes in 128 families (79%), revealing striking population strati ﬁcation and high impact recurrent alleles. 50% of mutations were not previously reported. Variants in candidate genes not previously linked to PCD were identi ﬁed in 14 families. Mutational modelling in Para  mecium and other functional characterization of the novel C11orf70 andDNAH9 genes con ﬁrmed their role in dynein  related cilia motility, showing that loss of function muta tions lead to ultrastructural ciliary defects and consequent motile cilia dysfunction. Conclusions: Targeted NGS yields a high success rate for PCD diagnosis, overcoming pitfalls of other diagnostic measures. It reveals clinically important mutation strati ﬁca  tion and valuable potential for novel gene discovery.

Sayer1,2","1Institute of Genetic Medicine, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom,2Renal Services, The Newcastle Hospitals NHS Foundation Trust, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom Introduction: Mutations in CEP290 cause ciliopathy syn  dromes including the cerebello retinal renal syndrome known as Joubert syndrome. Materials and Methods: We established a secondary culture of human urine derived renal epithelial cells (hURECs) from a boy aged 14 years with a Joubert syndrome phenotype caused by a homozygous nonsensemutation in exon 41 of CEP290 . These cells were treated with a morpholino antisense oligonucleotide designed to induce targeted in frame skipping of CEP290 exon 41 (ex41  CEP290 MO). A Cep290 LacZ/LacZgene trap mouse that displays a mild cystic kidney phenotype was used to study in vivo delivery following tail vein injection of anoctaguanidine dendrimer modi ﬁed morpholino oligonucleo  tide designed to splice out the LacZ gene trap (vivo  LacZ MO). Results: When compared to healthy control, primary cilia of patient ’s hURECs appeared tortuous and abnormally extended in length. A similar ciliary phenotype wasobserved in cystic epithelia of Cep290 LacZ/LacZmouse. Treatment of patient ’s hURECs with ex41  CEP290 MO led to a rescue of ciliary phenotype. In vivo delivery of vivo LacZ MO to Cep290 LacZ/LacZmice resulted in wild type mRNA transcripts and rescue of Cep290 protein expression in renal tissue. Consistent with this was the observed rescueof both the ciliary length and the cystic kidney disease phenotype in vivo. Conclusions: These data support the feasibility of personalised approaches of induced exon skipping to treating cystic kidney disease secondary to CEP290 mutations and show that intravenous delivery of morpho lino oligonucleotide to murine renal tissue is ef ﬁcacious.

 Single cell RNA sequencing of T cells in Crohn ’s disease identi ﬁes tissue speci ﬁc drug targets,C06.4,"M. D. Voskuil, W. T. C. Uniken Venema, A. Vich Vila, R. K.","Weersma, E. A. M. Festen","University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Introduction: Crohn ’s disease (CD) is a chronic intestinal inﬂammatory disorder, for which 200 genetic risk loci are known. CD risk loci are enriched for genes involved in T  cell signaling. Characterization of mucosal T cells in a disease  and tissue speci ﬁc context at a single cell resolution is crucial to get insight in the underlying pathomechanisms of CD. We used single cell RNA sequencing (scRNA seq) of T cells toincrease insight in CD pathomechanisms and to identify potential novel drug targets. Methods: We performed scRNA seq of 5,292 CD3 +T  cells from peripheral blood (PBL) and from ileal mucosal biopsies of CD patients. Biopsies were dissociated into T cells from the epithelium (IEL) and the lamina propria (LPL).scRNA seq was performed with an adapted SmartSeq2 protocol, using 3 ’ end library generation and unique molecular identi ﬁers, sequenced on the Illumina NextSeq500. Results: Cytotoxic T cells (CTL) dominated the IEL, while Th17 cells were the largest population in the LPL. PBLs were mainly composed of quiescent T cells. Th17cells and CTLs show the highest proportion of differentially expressed known CD risk genes. The biological Etrolizu  mab, but not Vedolizumab, speci ﬁcally appears to target mucosal CTLs. Two potential drug repositioning targets for mucosal Th17 cells, are MSX 122, an anti tumor CXCR4  antagonist, and Rivenprost, which targets PTGER4 , and has been tested in UC patients. Conclusion: We have conducted the ﬁrst detailed transcriptomic characterization of disease  and tissue speciﬁc effector cells in Crohn ’s disease. We show that CD risk genes are signi ﬁcantly overexpressed in ileal mucosal Th17 and CTLs and provide promising targets forfuture cell speci ﬁc therapies in CD patients. M.D. Voskuil: None. W.T.C.

About three out of 10,000 pregnancies are affected, the etiology is so far unknown. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) in a family with 4 affected from 3 generations was performed. 258 LUTO patients were screened for furthervariants in the identi ﬁed candidate gene BNC2 using Sanger sequencing. Functional studies comprised in situ hybridiza  tion (ISH) studies in mouse embryos, translational knock down (KD) in developing zebra ﬁsh larvae (z ﬂ) using Morpholino oligonucleotides (MO) and ‘rescue ‘experi  ments by co injection of human BNC2 mRNA with theBnc2 MO in z ﬂ. Results: Filtering of WES Data revealed a nonsense mutation (c.2554C>T; p.Arg852*) in BNC2 (basonuclin 2).Out of 258 LUTO patients one additional family (affected father and son) carrying a novel missense mutation(c.2663A>G, p.H888R) in BNC2 could be identi ﬁed.

Franceschini3,",COGENT Kidney Consortium,"1University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom, 2University of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom, 3University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill, Chapel Hill, NC, United States Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a major public health burden and affects nearly 10% of the global population. We assembled published and de novo genome wide association studies of estimated glomerular ﬁltration rate (eGFR), a measure of kidney function used to de ﬁne CKD, in up to 192,346 individuals of diverse ancestry. We identi ﬁed 56 loci attaining genome wide signi ﬁcant evidence of asso  ciation with eGFR ( p< 5x10 8), including 10 mapping outside those previously reported for kidney function. Across loci, we identi ﬁed 78 distinct association signals at locus wide signi ﬁcance ( p<1 0 5), including four in the region mapping to SLC22A2 . Allelic effects on eGFR of index variants were consistent across populations, with noevidence of heterogeneity due to ancestry ( p HET< 6.4x10 4, Bonferroni correction). Integration with genomic annotation revealed that eGFR association signals were jointly enri ched in coding sequence, and binding sites for ATF3 and HDAC8. ATF3 expression has been shown to be elevated798 J. del Picchiain animal models of proteinuria and diabetic nephropathy, whilst class I histone deacetylases (including HDAC8) are required for embryonic kidney gene expression, growth and differentiation. Annotation informed ﬁne mapping revealed 12 variants accounting for >80% of the probability of driving eGFR association signals, including coding allelesGCKR p.Leu446Pro (rs1260326), CPS1 p.Thr1406Asn (rs1047891), CACNA1S p.Arg1539Cys (rs3850625), and non coding expression quantitative trait loci in kidney forRGS14 (rs35716097), and UMOD andGP2 (rs77924615).

Patients accepted undergo comprehensive clinical evaluation and phenotyping. Qua  lifying patients receive either whole exome sequencing atBaylor or whole genome sequencing at HudsonAlpha. Of 300 WGS cases analyzed, 88.9% had received prior genetic testing (WES ,78.1%, other ,10.8%). Primary Findings were for 51% of the analyzed genomes and for 49% of cases with an existing WES. Secondary ﬁndings were reported, for adults only, in 28% of cases. A wealth of new infor mation (gene discovery, disease phenotype expansion, etc.) has become available since 2015. At the end of 2017 we therefore began reanalysis of all unsolved cases making useof newly published diseases and phenotypes and novel tools. This review also seeks to identify variants not meet  ing clinical reporting criteria including damaging variants inGenes of Uncertain Signi ﬁcance. Through novel secondary analysis we identi ﬁed chromosomal abnormalities,mosaicism, repeat expansions, intermediate sized structural variants, and translocations, which explain disease in 19 (6.5%) of patients. Based on enhanced tertiary analyses and in depth review we identi ﬁed 38 candidate variants in GUSs; these are reported to the clinical sites and functional cores for follow up. We have made 5 de ﬁnitive new diag  noses. In total, through application of novel methods and in depth review, we have provided ﬁndings of note for ~14.4% of our participants and families.

MacArthur1,2 1Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States, 2Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, United States,3Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA, United States,4Boston Children's Hospital, Boston, MA, United States Short read sequencing technologies have enabled sequen  cing of the exomes and genomes of hundreds of thousands of people. However, most standard sequencing technologiesdo not readily provide phase, that is, assigning variants to individual haplotypes. The absence of phase information particularly complicates the identi ﬁcation of compound heterozygous variants in the diagnosis of recessive dis  orders, where mutations of both copies of a given gene are necessary to develop disease. While the phase of commonvariants can be accurately inferred using imputation, phas  ing rare variants is challenging, especially from exome sequencing due to the sparse coverage of each haplotype. Here, we leverage large scale whole exome sequencing data from the genome aggregation database (gnomAD) which contains 123,136 individuals, to infer haplotypefrequencies between pairs of rare variants (allele frequency < 1%) located in the same gene. We demonstrate that these frequencies can be used to infer compound heterozygotestatus for variants within a gene with high accuracy (92.3%) from whole exome sequencing data using 1,494 trios for which true phase can be determined by allele transmission.Notably our approach performs very well even with a single observation of each allele in gnomAD (allele frequency ~10  5). Applying our approach to the 123,136 individuals in gnomAD, we compare the burden of rare protein altering compound heterozygous variants and homozygous variantsin each gene. We show the clinical utility of our method when applied to several rare disease cases where we could either exclude or prioritize putative causative compoundheterozygous variants (validated by sequencing the pro  band ’s parents).L.C.

Achieving a rapid diagnosis augments clinical decision making, suggests mo re appropriate treatments, and may reduce length of inpatient care. The objective ofthe Next Generation Children Project (NGC) is to rapidly identify clinically relevant ra re genetic variants in the ICU within the UK National Health Service (NHS). Proband/parent trios were recruited for whole genome sequencing (WGS). To date, 112 probands (neonate   15 years) have been sequenced and analysed, 85% with both parents(319 samples at ~38 X coverage). Sequencing has been r e d u c e dt o~ 1 0d a y so na v e r a g e , bioinformatics and var  iant interpretation takes ~3 days and clinical con ﬁrmation and NHS reporting takes <7 days. A likely diagnosis was reported in 15% of cases, including encephalopathies, myopathies, skeletal dyspl asias and rare syndromes. Despite extensive phenotyping (~17 HPO terms/proband), a third of reported cases showed 2 or fewer terms over  lapping known gene terms. Preliminary ﬁndings of the NGC Project show feasibility of implementing rapid  turnaround WGS within an NHS clinical practice context. They highlight i) the utility of WGS that does not rely ongene panels; ii) the ability to diagnose diseases earlier increases the phenotypic spectrum and iii) fewer features may present early for some conditions.

We sought to investigate the clinical utility of rWGS in infant inpatients atRady Children ’s Hospital. Methods: After parental consent, blood samples were collected from patients and parents when available. DNAwas isolated, PCR free Illumina genomic library prepara  tion was performed, and Illumina WGS was undertaken to ~45X coverage. Phenotypic features of the proband weretranslated into Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) terms. Results: After 12 months of testing, 94% of families approached enrolled. rWGS was interpreted in 340 families,yielding diagnostic information in 115 families (~34%). On average, diagnosis occurred within 96 hours (fastest 37 hours). Changes in management as a result of diagnosiswere identi ﬁed in 77 families (~67% of diagnosed patients). The changes in management ranged from speci ﬁc, changes in surgical interventions, to palliative care guidance. Amongtheﬁrst 42 infants, rWGS provided over $1.3M in net cost savings over projected standard care.Conclusion: Consistent with other studies, rWGS has a high diagnostic yield and reduces time to diagnosis. This study demonstrates that early diagnosis changes acute management. rWGS improves clinical care, preventing disability and unnecessary procedures, while simulta  neously reducing acute care costs among a broad cohortof quaternary childrens hospital inpatient infants.

 Experiences of the Dutch diagnostic data share consortium;limits of the current 5 tier classi ﬁcation system,C07.6,"M. E. van Gijn1, J. Laros2, M. A. Swertz3,4, VKGL data sharing",consortium,"1Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands,2Department of Human  and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands,3Department of Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands,4Genomics Coordination Center, University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands The use of genomic information in both research and clinic has expanded enormously the last decade. Yet, the inter pretation of the obtained NGS data remains a huge chal  lenge. Since sharing of data improves patient care and facilitates harmonizing patient reports, the Dutch genomediagnostic laboratories created a national database with connections to each of the labs for automated bi directional sharing. Data are stored separately for variant classi ﬁcations and variant frequencies, using the Open Source MOLGENIS and VARDA systems. The shared variant classi ﬁcation data is used in daily practice in each labs ’NGS analysis software to improve the variant interpretation. Currently the classi ﬁ  cation database contains >70,000 DNA variants in 4,500 genes of which 66% have been classi ﬁed as (likely) benign, 18% as VUS, 14% as (likely) pathogenic and 2% unsolved. We developed a classi ﬁcation comparison tool and proce  dure for the variants classi ﬁed by multiple labs (n>10,000). There was consensus for 8828 classi ﬁcations. These valu  able curated consensus data already has been shared beyond diagnostic laboratories with the HVP share database(LOVD3) and their submission to ClinVar is underway. The 1248 variants without classi ﬁcation consensus are currently under discussion. In trying to resolve these discrepancies, weencountered the limits of the 5 tier classi ﬁcation system, which is currently a mix of functional and clinical classi ﬁ  cations. In 30 cases a variant had clear functional con sequences but an association with a low risk disease, which resulted in opposite classi ﬁcations. This could potentiallyAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 801lead to misdiagnosis. An international discussion is pro  posed to harmonize the classi ﬁcations of these variants. M.E. van Gijn: None. J. Laros: None. M.A. Swertz: None. C08 Population Genetic",2018

However, the genetic contribution to ef ﬁcient weight loss in response to dietary intervention remains unknown. Materials and Methods: We performed a GWA in two large low caloric diet intervention cohorts of obese participants: the Canadian Optifast900 ®meal replacement program (n ,1166 obese subjects from Ottawa, LCD with Optifast 900kcal/d); and the DiOGenes clinical study (n , 789 overweight/obese subjects from eight Europeancountries, LCD with Modifast 800kcal/d). Results: To improve statistical power, we performed multi marker (gene based) analyses and took advantagesof recent development in Bayesian linear mixed effect models. Two loci close to the ANK1 and RBSG4 genes respectively were identi ﬁed in the Canadian discovery cohort (genome wide FDR < 5%) and replicated in the DiOGenes sample (replication FDR < 5%). Joint  modelling of the association signal together with large scale epigenome datasets (450 annotations) restricted further the signals to two individal SNPs : rs6981587 for the ANK1 locus and rs873822 for the RBSG4 locus.Full body knockdown in Drosophila melanogaster of the ANK1 ortholog (Ank) yielded a non lethal strain with 75% mRNA reduction, and these animals exhibitedsigniﬁcantly increased body mass ( +20%) and decreased triglyceride levels ( 23%) compared to controls. Knock down of the RBSG4 gene was not possible, as this gene is not conserved in ﬂy. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate, for the ﬁrst time, an effect of genetic variants to the ef ﬁcacy of weight loss in obese subjects and identify a role for ANK1 in weight control. A. Valsesia: A.

Moreover, the reduced number ofoffspring in individuals engaging in non heterosexual behavior (NHB) presents a Darwinian paradox: why are variants that predispose to NHB are maintained in thepopulation despite apparent selection against them? We report the results from the largest study of sexual orientation by focusing on two main phenotypes: NHB, de ﬁned as having had at least one same sex partner (N ,28,486 cases and 469,427 controls) and number of partners in802 J. del Picchiaheterosexual individuals (NSP;N ,362,993 individuals) in a meta analysis of UK Biobank and 23andMe. We identi  ﬁed 4 and 41 loci signi ﬁcantly (P < 5x10 8) associated with NHB and NSP, respectively. 12 loci were sex differentiated and the genetic correlation between males and females was signiﬁcantly < 1 (rg ,0.67,P,4x10 14for NHB). By studying the association between signi ﬁcant loci and 2,500+GWAS results we highlighted pleiotropic effects with smoking behavior and hormone related phenotypes(e.g. balding). Genetic correlations indicated a shared genetic component between NHB and risk taking (P , 5.1x10  9), substance use (e.g. cannabis use,P ,3.6x10 6) and several psychiatric traits (e.g. schizophrenia,P , 1.1x10 4). A signi ﬁcant heritability enrichment in brain  expressed genes was observed for NSP, but not for NHB.The strong genetic correlation between NHB and NSP (rg,0.47,P,9.5x10  25), which replicated in an external study of adolescents (P ,0.007), is consistent with antag  onistic pleiotropy, suggesting that variants predisposing to NHB increase mating success (as measured by NSP) in heterosexuals. Overall, our results depict NHB as a com plex, heritable behavioral phenotype, partially sharing a genetic component with risk taking/substance use, partially with hormonal related phenotypes. A.

 Genome wide association of bone mineral density in the UK Biobank full release identi ﬁes 301 novel loci and implicates DAAM2 in osteoporosis,C08.3,"J. A. Morris, GEFOS Consortium","McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada","Bone mineral density (BMD) is the most clinically relevant predictor of fracture and osteoporosis, a common, aging  related disease. Previously, an estimated heel BMD (eBMD) genome wide association study (GWAS) in142,487 individuals identi ﬁed 203 loci, explained 12% of the trait variance and identi ﬁed novel determinants of osteoporosis. Here, we performed an eBMD GWAS in426,824 White British UK Biobank participants (55% female). Using statistical ﬁne mapping and functional genomics, we prioritized genes for whole animal modelexperiments and focused on dishevelled associated acti  vator of morphogenesis 2 ( DAAM2 ), a novel gene involved in Wnt signalling. We identi ﬁed 1,106 conditionally  independent signals ( P< 6.6 x10  9) mapping to 518 loci (301 novel) and explained 20% of the trait variance. Weprioritized 538 protein coding genes (247 novel) strongly enriched for bone cell expression and known osteoporosis drug target and bone disorder genes. We identi ﬁed plausibly causal DAAM2 coding SNPs and therefore generated homozygous ( Daam2 / ) and heterozygous knockout mice for skeletal phenotyping with X ray microradiography,microtomography, and biomechanical testing. Daam2  /  mice had non signi ﬁcant reductions in femur length, and reduced femur and vertebral bone mineral content. Struc tural trabecular and cortical bone parameters did not differ between wild type and Daam2  / mice. Strikingly, despite normal parameters, maximum load was greatly reduced inDaam2  / femurs and vertebrae (2.14 standard deviations below predicted strength), suggesting Daam2 de ﬁciency impaired bone quality. Here, we increased the number ofassociated loci 2.5 fold, the variance explained to 20%, provided an ef ﬁcient strategy to prioritize genes, and iden  tiﬁed a novel determinant of bone quality, DAAM2 . These results provide further insight into novel, potentially drug  gable, genes contributing to osteoporosis. J.A. Morris: None.",2018

We identify novel phenotype genotype associations, including several repli  cated associations with height and BMI, an associationbetween maternal age and a variant near HCN1 andEMB , and between multiple fetuses (e.g. twins) and NRG1 , a gene modulating thyroid function. Finally, we characterize thedistribution of circulating viral DNA at the individual and population level, and identify a unique pattern of high prevalence of hepatitis B and other clinically relevantmaternal infections.

Historically, this hasposed a challenge the only cost effective technology for proﬁling large numbers of individuals has been genotyping arrays, which measure a small fraction of genetic variation;sequencing based technologies, which enable more com prehensive pro ﬁling of genetic variation, remain too expensive for routine usage. To bridge this gap, we devel oped a low pass sequencing assay (in which less than 1x coverage of a target genome is sequenced) along with software for genotyping imputation and de novo variantdiscovery. To evaluate the performance of this assay, we sequenced 83 individuals to 1x genome coverage and genotyped the same samples on the Affymetrix AxiomPrecision Medicine Research Array. We then down sampledthe sequencing data to 0.8, 0.6, 0.4, and 0.2x cov erage. At common single nucleotide polymorphisms(SNPs), the mean imputation accuracy from the genotyping array was 90%, which was comparable to the imputation accuracy from 0.4x (88%) to 0.6x (91%) sequencing. Wethen performed de novo discovery of SNPs from the sequencing data, to test the possibility to discover pre viously unseen genetic variation. With 1x coveragesequencing we identify over 95% of genetic variants in the samples that are present in at least 10 copies, and with 0.6x coverage we identify over 95% of the genetic variants thatare present in at least 20 copies.

Furthermore, variants in proteins containing PHDﬁngers, motifs recognizing speci ﬁc histone tail modi ﬁca  tions, have been associated with several neurological and developmental delay disorders. Here, we report eight het erozygous de novo variants (one frameshift, two splice site, andﬁve missense) in the gene encoding the BAF complex subunit double plant homeodomain ﬁnger 2 (DPF2). Affected individuals share common clinical features described in individuals with Cof ﬁn Siris syndrome, including coarse facial features, global developmentaldelay, intellectual disability, speech impairment, and hypoplasia of ﬁngernails and toenails. All variants occurAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 805within the highly conserved PHD1 and PHD2 motifs. Moreover, missense variants are situated close to zinc binding sites and are predicted to disrupt these sites. Pull  down assays of recombinant proteins and histone peptides revealed that a subset of the identi ﬁed missense variants abolish or impair DPF2 binding to unmodi ﬁed and modi ﬁed H3 histone tails. These results suggest an impairment of PHD ﬁnger structural integrity and cohesion and most likely an aberrant recognition of histone modi ﬁcations. Further  more, the overexpression of these variants in HEK293 and COS7 cell lines was associated with the formation of nuclear aggregates and the recruitment of both wild typeDPF2 and BRG1 to these aggregates. Expression analysis of truncating variants found in the affected individuals indicated that the aberrant transcripts escape nonsense mediated decay. Altogether, we provide compelling evi  dence that de novo variants in DPF2 cause Cof ﬁn Siris syndrome and propose a dominant negative mechanism ofpathogenicity. G. Vasileiou: None. S.

CHD3, a member of the CHD sub  family of chromatin remodeling ATPases and subunit of theNuRD complex, has recently been shown to be speci ﬁcally involved in late neural radial migration and layer speci ﬁ  cation in the developing cortex. Unlike other members of the CHD subfamily, pathogenic alterations in the CHD3 gene have not yet been implicated in a human neurodeve  lopmental phenotype. Upon whole genome sequencing of acohort of children with rare speech disorders, we discovered an individual with a de novo missense variant in CHD3 . Through a genotype driven approach to identify more var iants disrupting the gene, we collected 35 individuals with de novo CHD3 mutations. The vast majority of individuals had missense mutations. These mutations showed a sig niﬁcant clustering within the characteristic ATPase/helicase domain of the encoded protein, in and around conserved SNF2 motifs. We used functional assays to demonstrate theeffect of the missense mutations on the ATPase activity and remodeling activity of the CHD3 protein.

Here we report monoallelic missense mutations affecting Lysine 91 in the histone H4 core (H4K91) in three individuals with a syndrome of growth delay, microcephalyand intellectual disability. The human genome contains ﬁfteen histone H4 genes, all differing at the nucleotide level but encoding an invariantH4 protein. RNA sequencing analysis of patient cells showed that ±8% of H4 cDNA molecules carried the806 J. del Picchiamutated allele. Analysis of the chromatin fraction of patient ﬁbroblasts by mass spectrometry revealed that 1 2% of histone H4 molecules contained the mutated residue. Expression of the H4 mutants in zebra ﬁsh embryos recapitulate the developmental anomalies seen in the patients. We show that the H4 mutations cause genomicinstability, resulting in increased apoptosis and cell cycle progression anomalies during early development. Mechan  istically, our ﬁndings indicate an important role for the ubiquitination of H4K91 in genomic stability during embryonic development. Our results highlight the functional importance of the histone core and establish H4K91 and its modi ﬁcations in the realm of human genetic disorders. Loss of Lysine 91 on histone H4 acts in a genetically dominant manner. On abiological level, our data presented here point at a mechanism involving inherent DNA damage accumulation and early perturbed cell cycle through which missensemutations affecting K91 are causative for an identi ﬁable syndrome consisting of dysmorphic features and intellectual disability.

Mutations in 11 out of 51 histone lysine methylases (KMT) and demethylases (KDM) encoding genes are known to cause autosomal dominant or X linkedhuman developmental disorders (DDs). We hypothesised that mutations in additional KMT/KDMs may cause novel DDs. Methods: Using gene attributes and variant frequencies in general populations, we prioritised KMT/KDMs as candidate genes for dominant or recessive DDs. We thensystematically interrogated databases of exome and array  CGH of individuals with DDs. Results: We identi ﬁed 22 KMT/KDMs as additional candidates for dominant DDs. We detected signi ﬁcant enrichment of de novo (DN) heterozygous or bi allelic protein truncating variants (PTVs) for speci ﬁc genes in individuals with DDs against controls. Detailed phenotyp  ing of affected individuals uncovered several novel disorders. These included a range of neurodevelopmentalphenotypes caused by KMT2C or ASH1L haploinsuf ﬁ  ciency and a dysmorphic overgrowth DD caused by heterozygous KMT5B PTVs. We also identi ﬁed a recogniz  able dysmorphic DD caused by bi allelic KDM5B muta  tions, ﬁrst autosomal recessive syndrome in this pathway. We also expanded the phenotype spectrum of KMT2B DNPTVs. Overall, we found that pathogenic KMT/KDM mutations underlie the diagnoses in >1.5% individuals with DDs. Conclusions: Collectively, these results emphasize the signiﬁcance of histone lysine methylation in normal and abnormal human development.

 De novo germline variants in Histone 3 Family 3A (H3F3A) andHistone 3 Family 3B (H3F3B ) associated with a severe neurodegenerative disorder with unique functional effect different from somatic mutations,C09.5,E. J. Bhoj,"Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, PA, United","States Histones are nuclear proteins that associate with DNA packaged it into condensed chromatin.

Speci ﬁc somatic muta tions in H3F3A/B have been associated with pediatric tumors, but no germline mutations have been described. Here we report 24 patients, ages 4 months to 32 years, with de novo missense germline mutations in H3F3A orH3F3B who share a core phenotype of progressive neurologic dys function and congenital anomalies, but no malignancies yet. All patients have mild to profound developmental delay, andsome also have seizures, developmental regression, con genital heart disease, and craniosynostosis.

Here we describe mutations in the SET gene, encoding a component of the “inhibitor of acetyltransferases ”complex involved in transcriptional silencing, as novel cause for ID. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was used to detect mutations in the SET gene in four ID patients and in an affected mother and son. Literature revealedfour additional patients with de novo SET mutations. Results: WES identi ﬁed three de novo loss of function (LoF) mutations and two de novo missense mutations. Besides ID the majority of patients had severe speech delay, but other clinical features were inconsistent. The mutations affected all four known alternative transcripts of the SETgene. In contrast, LoF mutations in SET are exceedingly rare in the normal population and if present they affect only one of the four SET transcripts. Conclusions: Our study identi ﬁes SET as a new component of the epigenetic regulatory modules underlying human cognitive disorders and establishes de novo muta  tions in this gene as novel cause for non syndromic ID. The pivotal role of SET in neurogenesis is evident from numerous previous in vitro and animal studies. The SETprotein interacts with several proteins encoded by known autosomal dominant ID genes, i.e. EP300, CREBBP,808 J. del PicchiaSETBP1, KMT2A, RAC1 and CTCF, most of which are involved in histone modi ﬁcation.

Knoll","University of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada","Chemotherapy resp onse varies signi ﬁcantly among cancer patients, and drug resistance is responsible for signi ﬁcant amount of this mortality. The patterns of gene expression and copy number changes in the tumour can predict treatment outcomes after chemotherapy by supervisedmachine learning (ML) 1 3. Computational models based on transcriptome gene signatures of tumor cell lines were used predict chemosensitivity and resistance for 25 cancer drugs. This learned set of genes was used to predict clinical outcomes from tumor transcriptomes. Gene sig  natures have been derived for 5  ﬂuorouracil, bortezomib, carboplatin, cisplatin, docet axel, doxorubicin, erlotinib, epirubicin, etoposide, ge ﬁtinib, gemcitabine, hydro  xycyclophosphamide, imatinib, irinotecan, Ixabepilone,methotrexate, oxaliplatin, pa clitaxel, pemetrexed, rapa  mycin, sorafenib, tamoxifen, topotecan, vinblastine, and vinorelbine. These are comprised of 3   17 biochemically relevant genes, and have misclassi ﬁcation rates from 0% to 26.1%. Validation is performed in patients with breast, bladder, ovarian, and colon cancers. Signatures derivedfrom tumour cell lines predicted complete remission from paclitaxel treatment in 84% of breast cancer patients (10% more accurate than differen tial expression analysis). Expression of MAPT correlated with survival in paclitaxel treated breast ca ncer patients. Cisplatin and hydroxycyclophosphamide resistance were respectivelypredicted with 71% and 66% accuracy in bladder and breast cancer patients. Analysis of a comprehensive set ML based gene signatures for a panel of drugs in primarytumours would be feasible to carry out prior to treatment, and could in ﬂuence selection of therapy.

University of Salamanca., Salamanca, Spain,2Institute of Biomedical Research of Salamanca (IBSAL), Salamanca, Spain,3Institute of Molecular and Cellular Biology of Cancer (IBMCC).University of Salamanca CSIC, Salamanca, Spain Introduction: Organoids are three dimensional in vitro grown structures derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, adult stem cells or embryonic stem cells capable of self renewal and self organiz ation, that exhibit the same organ functionality as the original tissue. They present organ speci ﬁc differential cells types and tissue com  partmentalization. Additionally, they can be used todetect genetic alterations in patients. In this work we studied the potential of this type of culture for modeling cancer. Materials and Methods: Organoids from fresh tumor tissues of 40 patients with several types of cancer (colon (CRC), endometrial, ovary, kidney, lung, head and necksquamous cell carcinoma) were established. Tumor tissues were dissociated into functional units, seeded in Matrigel and cultured with the appropriate medium. Results: We established organoids from six types of cancer and determined their culture conditions. The cytokines needed for each cell type were different but allof them include EGF, Noggin, Y 27632 and Wnt 3A. For organoids derived from CRC, R spondin, FGF10, FGF2, prostaglandin E2, nicotinamide, A83 01 and gastrin areneeded. Organoids derived from kidney cancer, also need VEGF. Those derived from lung cancer require VEGF and progesterone and β estradiol are necessary for organoids derived from gynecological cancers. Conclusions: Organoids can be obtained from different cancer tissues. For their development, it is essential tochoose the right cytokines to grow them in. These cultures have shown to mimic three dimensional structure of the origin tissue and could be a perfect source to determinegenetic alterations in these patients.

Many genetic variants lead to aberrant splicing and cause genetic dis eases. One prominent technique for correcting splicing  related mutations is through the use of splice switching antisense oligonuc leotides (AONs). The antisense drug Nusinersen for SMA, recently approved by the FDA, is one notable example. Cummings et al. recently identi ﬁed a highly recurrent pathogenic splice variant (c.904+189C>T) in COL6A1 as a genetic cause of Collagen VI  related dystrophies (COL6 R D). The variant, located in intron 11, leads to the inser tion of a dominantly acting pseudoexon that disrupts the gene ’s critical motif. They estimate that ~25% of all cases with COL6 RD, but negative by exon sequencing are due to this mutation.This variant was found in a de novo pattern in over 30 patients, and we recently identi ﬁe di ti no u rl a bi na4y e a r old girl with COL6 RD. As part of in silico machine learning tools we are developing in our lab, we designed 16 AONs with 2 ’ OMe modi ﬁcations and a phosphor  othioate backbone to correct the c.904 +189C>T variant. The most effective AONs were able to reduce the mutant allele by 95% in a dose dependent manner. The AONs designed in this work, as well as those designed in theindependent work by Bolduc et al., may offer a treatment for children suffering from the collagen VI like dystro  phy.

It encodes a K2P channel that controls resting membrane potential and excitability of neurons. By analyzing WT, Kcnk9 KO matandKcnk9 KOhommice in a behavioral test battery during the light phase, our data shows that the absence of Kcnk9 leads to impaired working memory, reduced acoustic startle response and abnormalsensorimotor gating. Investigations of circadian rhythms revealed selectively increased locomotor activity during the dark phase in Kcnk9 KO homand, to a signi ﬁcantly smaller extent, in Kcnk9 KOmatmice compared to controls. Using Quanti ﬁcation of Allele Speci ﬁc Expression by Pyrose  quencing (QUASEP) and Allele Speci ﬁc RT qPCR in wildtype (C57BL/6xCast/Ei)F1 hybrid mice, biallelic Kcnk9 expression from the repressed paternal allele (1  17% of transcripts) was observed in all analyzed brainregions and was particularly strong in the locus coeruleus (LC). Slice patch clamp recordings revealed wildtype like pacemaker activity during the dark phase in LC neuronsfrom Kcnk9 KO matbut not from Kcnk9 KOhommice, which discharged at signi ﬁcantly higher frequencies.

CS is characterized by facial anomalies, hyper  trichosis, extensive cardiac abnormalities and dilated cere  bral blood vessels. CS is debilitating with no speci ﬁc therapy available. Hence, we applied a novel CrispR/Cas9  based genome editing approach to create CS zebra ﬁsh models for therapeutic drug screening. We ef ﬁciently introduced three CS speci ﬁc point muta  tions in abbc9 and kcnj8 of zebra ﬁsh by combining the CrispR/Cas9 system with a short template oligonucleotideharboring the site of mutation. To demonstrate functional validity, we performed live high speed video imaging of zebra ﬁsh heart and cardinal vein to assess cardiovascular function at 5 days post fertilization. Additionally, cerebral blood vessels were examined for dilations in live kcnj8 mutants in a Tg( kdrl:GFP ) transgenic background. Analogous to CS patients, knock in ﬁsh reveal signi ﬁ  cantly enlarged ventricles with enhanced cardiac output, contractility and development of pericardial edema. Asigniﬁcantly reduced vein blood ﬂow velocity can be associated with diminished vascular tone reported in patients. Additionally, kcnj8 mutant ﬁsh display distinct cerebral vasodilation in a structure resembling the human circle of Willis. We developed a novel technique to establish CS speci ﬁc zebra ﬁsh that closely model cardiovascular features and therefore open the possibility of phenotyping based drug screening potentially repurposing sulfonylureas alreadyclinically applied to inhibit GOF KATP channels involved in neonatal diabetes.

The ZRS enhancer, which regulates Shh transcription in developing limbs, is located in the intron 5 of the constitutively transcribed gene Lmbr1 and has been involved in numerous patient cases with limb malformations. Shh and the ZRS communicate through a 1Mb large stable chromatin interaction. However the mechanism facilitating this long range contact is not known yet. Using a series of CRISPR/Cas9 engineered alleles and4C seq experiments in mouse embryos, we aim to elucidate the role of the Lmbr1 constitutive transcription as well as CTCF in the establishment of the Shh ZRS chromatin interaction. Deletion of the Lmbr1 promoter abolishes the transcription over the ZRS, yet 4C seq experiments showed that the contact frequency between Shh and its enhancer remains unchanged in these embryos allowing for normal Shhexpression. In contrast, the removal of CTCF binding sites around and within the ZRS results in the emergence ofcompensatory CTCF binding sites as well as in altered 3D chromatin architecture, diminished Shh transcription and skeletal abnormalities. Our results suggest that CTCF actsto support a robust and permissive enhancer promoter interaction that ensures normal Shhexpression. This CTCF  dependent regulatory mechanism provides a framework tounderstand the pathomechanism of unsolved structural variants described at the Shhlocus in patients with skeletal abnormalities. C.

"B Genetic landscape of kidney function: results from a trans ethnic genome wide association meta analysis of >750,000 individuals",P18.34,"C. Pattaro, CKDGen Consortium","Eurac Research, Institute for Biomedicine, Bolzano, Italy","Introduction . Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is a public health threat, which affects >10% adult population inWestern countries and is associated with increased risk of end stage renal disease, cardiovascular disease, and all cause mortality. In the absence of therapies for CKD pre  vention, understanding the biological regulators of glo  merular ﬁltration rate (GFR), the key element that de ﬁnes CKD, is of the highest relevance. Materials and methods . Within the CKDGen Consor  tium, 121 studies applied standardized protocols and scriptsto run genome wide association scans (GWAS) of estimated GFR (eGFR) on ~9 million high quality SNPs, imputed on the 1000 Genomes ph3v5 or Haplotype Reference Con sortium datasets. We performed ﬁxed effect meta analysis of GWAS data on >750,000 participants of European, East  Asian, South Asian, Hispanic, and African ancestries.Effect heterogeneity due to ancestry was investigated using trans ethnic genome wide meta regression as implemented in MR MEGA. Results . Genomic in ﬂation was negligible: lambda , 1.05 and LD score regression intercept ,1.04. Across ethnicities, we identi ﬁed 308 1 Mb segments containing ≥1 SNP associated with eGFR (p value ≤5E 08): 228 of these loci were novel and 80 validated previously identi ﬁed signals. Trans ethnic meta regression revealed limitedheterogeneity correlated with ancestry for most genomic regions. Approximate conditional analysis of the European  ancestry dataset identi ﬁed 269 independent variants, which together doubled the eGFR variance explained compared to previous estimates. Conclusions . This study represents the largest screen of kidney function genetic loci to date. The large number of identi ﬁed loci will contribute to increase our understanding of kidney function ’s biology. C. Pattaro: None.",2018

Genome  wide association studies (GWAS) of correlated phenotypeshave been developed to identify such shared genetic effects with increased power.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 813We performed a multi phenotype GWAS (MP GWAS) on three blood lipids (high /low density lipoprotein choles  terol and triglycerides, HDL C/LDL C/TG) and body mass index (BMI) in 22 European ancestry studies (N ,64,736) imputed to the 1000 Genomes reference panel (Phase 1). Weﬁtted a “reverse regression ”model between each single  nucleotide variant (SNV) and the linear combination of HDL C/LDL C/TG/BMI using the SCOPA software, i.e. for the ith variant SNV i,β1i× HDL C +β2i× LDL C + β3i×T G+β4i× BMI+εi, where εi~N (0, ơ2). Study speci ﬁc effect sizes and variance covariance matrices for each variant were combined in a meta analysis using theMETA SCOPA software. We identi ﬁed 14 novel and 41/9 established lipid/BMI loci, respectively, at genome wide signi ﬁcance ( P< 5x10  8). Nine novel ( SDC1 ,SLC8A1 ,EPHA6 ,SPATA4 ,MAGI2 , CTSB, BC014119, SMCO4 andCNTN5 ) and 32 established loci showed effects on both BMI and lipids in the jointmodel, suggesting shared genetic architecture. This obser  vation was supported through hierarchical cluster analysis, which resulted in six clades representing a mixture of lipid and BMI associated variants. We detected signi ﬁcant eQTL effects in whole blood, subcutaneous/visceral fat and liver at 16 of the identi ﬁed loci, and enrichment of association signals at HDAC6 binding sites, indicating a critical role of associated loci in various cellular events. The MP GWAS is a powerful approach to detect shared genetic effects on correlated phenotypes, as demonstrated by our analysis of lipids and BMI.

A The eQTLs Catalog and LinDA browser: a platform for prioritising target genes of GWAS variants,P18.25,"S. Onano1,2, F. Cucca1,2, M. Pala2",1Dipartimento di Scienze Biomediche   Università degli Studi,"di Sassari, Sassari, Italy,2Istituto di Ricerca Genetica e Biomedica   Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche, Cagliari, Italy The expression Quantitative Traits Loci (eQTLs) are genetic polymorphisms associated with changes in gene expressionlevels. They have been successfully used to prioritize the target genes of the variants associated with complex traits and diseases (GWAS variants). Up to date a few eQTLsdatabases exist and they collect only a small portion of the available datasets.We thus planned to build the largest publically available catalog of eQTLs, coupled with a browser, to optimize and simplify their interrogation. We collected and manually curated 51 eQTL public studies ranging from 2007 to date, corresponding to more than 100 sample types and 25 human populations for atotal of 259176 cis eQTLs and 32929 genes with at least one cis eQTL (cis eGenes). Most of the eQTLs studies were conducted in blood samples from healthy individualsof European ancestry. We found that for 93% of the known protein coding genes were eGenes, 20% of them inter  secting (r 2≥0.8) with the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog and 26% of whom considered as druggable. Furthermore, for those GWAS variants for which an eGene was known, we found that the NHGRI EBI GWAS Catalog proposed thesame gene as candidate target only for the 60% of the times. Our eQTL Catalog can be used as a reference to measure the degree of novelty for future eQTLs studies; it is provided within a platform with a web interface (LinDA) that we plan to implement with other types of quantitativetraits (i.e. epigenetic, proteomic, metabolomics and micro  biota) to better dissect the pleiotropy of the GWAS variants.

D Predicting rare allele carriers from genotyping array datausing whole genome sequencing data in the Estonian population,P18.48,"T. Sikka1, M. Palover1, T. Nikopensius2, M. Alver1,2, M. Nelis2,","A. Metspalu1,2, N. Tõnisson2, T. Esko1,2","1University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,2Estonian Genome Center, Tartu, Estonia Introduction: Genetic imputation works well with frequent alleles (minor allele frequency>1%), however, its predictive accuracy drops for rare genetic variants which can also playa role for eventual development of diseases. Exceptions to such limitations are endogamous populations like Estonia. Currently, 50,000 participants of Estonian biobank havebeen genotyped, with additional 100,000 being collected within next year, and their genetic pro ﬁles will be added to electronic health records. We performed a study to predictand verify rare mutation carriers for severe disease predis  positions such as familial breast cancer (in genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 ) and familial hypercholesterolemia ( APOB ) using long range haplotyping (LRH) and “surrogate parent ” theory. Materials and Methods: We used whole genome sequence data of 2,244 and genotyped data of 15,416 participants of the Estonian biobank. Whole genome814 J. del Picchiasequencing (WGS) with 30x coverage was carried out at Broad Institute using Illumina HiSeq xTen platform. Results: WGS identi ﬁed 14, 4 and 6 mutations carriers forBRCA1 ,BRCA2 andAPOB , respectively. We identi ﬁed 16 mutations carriers for BRCA1 and 3 for BRCA2 , and 5 carriers for APOB using LRH among genotyped samples. We failed to ﬁnd carriers for additional 6 out of 9 mutations, highlighting these as recent mutations and only present in limited historical lineages. Conclusions: LRH is a cost effective approach to predict additional rare mutation carriers for different disease predispositions from genotyped data in endogamouspopulations and will be important in the process of reporting clinically relevant mutations to Estonian biobank participants.

A Deletions at 63 GWAS catalog loci based on genome wide 1000 Genomes project CNV tagging SNPs,P18.77,"E. Loizidou1, E. Bellos1, L. Coin2, M. Johnson1, I. Prokopenko1","1Imperial College London, London, United Kingdom,","2University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia Background: Genome wide association studies (GWAS) successfully exploit the variability of most abundant DNA variants, namely single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs),but frequently fail to provide information about causal mutations. Copy number variation (CNV) impacts pheno  type variability and disease susceptibility and is one of thesources for the so called “missing heritability ”. Despite notable genomic effects of both CNVs and SNPs, the cor  relation between them is understudied, and the role ofCNVs in SNP based phenotypic effects is not established. Methods: We estimated linkage disequilibrium (LD) between CNVs and SNPs in protein coding genes using the1000 Genomes project sequencing data (1000G) from phase 3. We de ﬁned CNV tagging SNPs for variants reported in the GWAS catalog for disease/phenotype associations (July,2017) and for recently published DIAGRAM consortium type 2 diabetes (T2D) 1000G reference panel imputed meta analysis in Europeans (PMID:28566273). Results: We replicated established CNV tagging SNP effects at ten loci, including NEGR1, LCE3A/B, CFHR1 3 for obesity, psoriasis and nephropathy, respectively. Werevealed 31 novel CNVs (length 275bp to ~ 6kb), all but one being deletions. Among novel CNVs ﬁfteen are <1kb,tagging lead breast cancer and T2D/lupus erythematosus SNPs at CHST9 and JAZF1 loci among others. Novel CNVs covered drug target genes, such as HTR3D/C/E, PLEKHA1 ,a n d MGST1 and tagged SNPs associated with major depressive disorder, age related macular degenera  tion, and visceral fat, respectively. Conclusion: This is the most detailed CNV tagging SNPs catalog to date, which will help in dissecting the functional impact of SNP trait associations and could drive thedevelopment of new drugs.

Secondary mitochondrial dysfunction was reported in several proger  oid syndromes, caused by alterations in components of the nuclear envelope (Hutchinson Gilford progeria) or by impaired DNA repair (Cockayne syndrome). We present evidence that a progeroid Fontaine syndrome is caused by aprimary mitochondrial dysfunction. Four unrelated cases are reported, sharing congenitally decreased subcutaneous fat tissue and sparse hair, bonedysplasia of the skull and ﬁngers, a distinctive face, growth retardation, and early demise. Exome sequencing showed that all carried de novo missense variant c.649C>T (p. Arg217Cys) or c.650G>A (p.Arg217His) in SLC25A24 , coding for calcium binding mitochondrial carrier protein (SCaMC 1, SLC25A24). SLC25A24 allows an electro neutral and reversible exchange of ATP Mg and phosphate between the cytosol and mitochondria, required for optimal adenine nucleotide levels in the mitochondrial matrix.Molecular dynamic simulation studies predict that p. Arg217Cys and p.Arg217His narrow the substrate cavity of the protein and disrupt transporter dynamics. SLC25A24   mutant ﬁbroblasts and cells expressing p.Arg217Cys or p. Arg217His variants showed altered mitochondrial morphol  ogy, a decreased proliferation rate, increased mitochondrialmembrane potential, and decreased ATP linked mitochon  drial oxygen consumption. Our ﬁndings identify SLC25A24 mutations affecting codon 217 as the underlying genetic cause of human progeroid Fontaine syndrome and suggest that the SLC25A24 mutations lead to impaired mitochondrial ATP synthesis and cause hyperpolarization and increased proton leak in association with an impaired energy metabolism. Fontaine syndrome creates a clinical spectrum with Gorlin Chaudhry Moss syndrome, which is caused by the same mutations, shares several clinical features, but has apparent normal lifespan. K.

The complexity of these disorders has so far preventedthe development of effective therapeutic strategies. Results: We demonstrate that the microRNAs miR 181a and miR 181b (miR 181a/b) regulate key genes involved inmitochondrial biogenesis and function. We also show that these miRNAs are involved in the global regulation of mitochondrial turnover in the central nervous systemthrough the simultaneous and ﬁne tuning modulation of different gene pathways. We sought to verify whether the modulation of these miRNAs could be therapeuticallyexploited in neurodegenerative conditions associated to impaired mitochondrial activity. We show that miR 181a/b downregulation strongly protects neurons from cell deathand signi ﬁcantly ameliorates the disease phenotype in in vivo models of both primary and secondary mitochondria mediated neurodegeneration, such as Micro phthalmia with Linear Skin Lesions, Leber hereditary optic neuropathy and Parkinson ’s disease. Conclusions: Altogether our results indicate that miR  181a/b act as hubs in mitochondrial homeostasis in the central nervous system and represent novel gene  independent therapeutic targets for a wide range ofneurodegenerative diseases caused by mitochondrial dysfunction.

This has propelled whole exome sequencing (WES) into the clinical setting, achieving high diagnostic yields. Methods: The WES data of 1116 paediatric and adult individuals investigated under clinical and/or biochemical suspicion of mitochondrial disease and collected over a 5 year period, were systematically analysed. Each solved exome was coupled to clinical (HPO), biochemical and experimental data. Results: Genetic diagnosis was established in 446 (40%) individuals and included discovery of 40 novel diseasegenes. 345 (31%) individuals harboured pathogenic variant (s) within 122 mitochondrial disease associated genes. Defects in ACAD9, ECHS1, FBXL4 andMT ATP6 occurred most frequently. Defects in 45 of the 122 genes occurred only in single cases. 29 patients with molecularly veri ﬁed mitochondrial disease didn ’t demonstrate respiratory chain complex defects in muscle and/or ﬁbroblasts. 56 diagnosed  cases are amenable to treatment strategies, highlighting the importance of WES. Dif ﬁculty in mitochondrial disease deﬁnition was re ﬂected by 101 patients harbouring disease  causing variant(s) in non primarily mitochondrial disease  associated genes (84 genes including TANGO2, CAD, IARS , SLC52A2 ) and 118 individuals with unsuspected but genetically proven mitochondrial disease diagnosed in the same time period. Conclusions: This study further elucidates the hetero  geneous genetic landscape of mitochondrial disease, prompting careful consideration of diagnostic criteria byhighlighting discrepancies between clinical, biochemical and genetic means of diagnosis.

Challa1,T .",Kumarasamy1,"1CCMB, Hyderabad, India,2Nizam ’s Institute of Medical Sciences, Hyderabad, India,3Bhimavaram Hospitals, Bhimavaram, India Introduction: Mitochondrial disorders are genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous caused by mutations in mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) or nuclear genes. Their diagnosis and treatment remains challenging. The pre valence of mitochondrial disorders in India is more than the projected data available in the literature. In India, with a huge number of endogamous ethnic groups, the transmis sion rate of mitochondrial disorder is more. Materials and Methods: We used targeted exome and Sanger sequencing in 425 patients with mitochondrialdisorders to identify pathogenic mutations.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 817Results: We have identi ﬁed mutations in mtDNA and common nuclear genes in 27% of the cases. However, the majority of cases (>70%) remain genetically undeter  mined. Therefore, we performed whole exome sequencing to identify novel genes responsible for mitochondrial disease. We sequenced whol e exome of 30 patients with mitochondrial disease and identi ﬁed several novel, reported mutations and novel genes. Of the novel genes identi ﬁed, ALKBH1/ABH1 gene mutations cause severe autosomal recessive mitochondrial disease in early adult  hood; hence we have sequenced complete ALKBH1 in 275 patients with mitochondrial disease, found biallelicALKBH1 mutations in 6 patients from four different families. All mutations in a c ompound heterozygous state, disrupted the function of the gene. These mutationsshowed complete co segregation with the disease pheno  type and absent in 650 control chromosomes. Knock  down of ALKBH1 in zebra ﬁsh using morpholino oligonucleotides (MOs) showed severe developmental abnormalities and multiple mi tochondrial respiratory chain complex defects.

A disease linked to UQCRH has not yet been described. Methods: Whole exome sequencing and autozygosity mapping were performed on two male ﬁrst cousins from a consanguineous family with recurrent episodes of severeketoacidosis, excess blood ammonia and hypoglycaemia and signs of encephalopathy. Brain MRI ’s showed no abnormality and between episodes health was entirelynormal. OXPHOS protein levels and complex assembly were analysed by western blot and blue native PAGE. A mouse model was created in C57BL/6N mice by deletion ofexons 2 and 3 of UQCRH . Standard full screening of the mouse phenotypes was performed. Moreover, enzymatic activity and protein expression of OXPHOS complexeswere investigated in mouse tissue. Results: A homozygous UQCRH deletion of exons 2 and 3 was detected. Cultured patients ’primary ﬁbroblasts showed incomplete assembly and decreased steady state protein levels of CIII subunits and low CIII enzyme activity. The murine presentation was more severe with progressivefunctional impairment and premature death at the age of 6 8 weeks. Enzyme activity assays revealed a signi ﬁcant decrease in CIII activity in heart, brain and liver tissues. Conclusions: Here we describe the ﬁrst patients with biallelic mutations in UQCRH . Notably, biallelic variants in UQCRC2 andUQCRB , two other subunits of complex III, result in a similar episodic clinical presentation.

Cells syn thesize CoA de novo from pantothenate through ﬁve con  secutive enzymatic steps. Dysfunction of two enzymes, PANK2 and COASY, leads to Neurodegeneration withBrain Iron Accumulation. To our knowledge mutations in PPCS , another enzyme of the pathway, have so far not been associated with human diseases. Subjects and Methods: Five patients of two unrelated families presented with dilate d cardiomyopathy of varied severity and no neurodegeneration. Identi ﬁcation of variants was performed by WES; pathogenicity of identi ﬁed mutations evaluated by functional complemen  tation in yeast and modeling in Drosophila; biochemical consequences of PPCS de ﬁciency assessed in patients' ﬁbroblasts.Results: WES identi ﬁed rare biallelic variants in PPCS . The pathogenicity of identi ﬁed variants was assessed by functional complementation of a yeast model null for PPCS (yPPCS ). Ablation of yPPCS is lethal; yPPCS  null mutants transformed with the human wild type PPCS were able to grow, whereas mutants transformed with variant carryingPPCS constructs had clear growth defects, con ﬁrming the deleterious nature of the variants. Drosophila PPCS mutants showed a signi ﬁcant increase in heart rate, heart wall shortening and arrhythmia index, and a decrease in systolic length, indicating that homozygous variants in PPCS are associated with cardiac dysfunction. Conclusions: Identi ﬁcation of biallelic variants in PPCS in individuals with cardiomyopathy, linked for the ﬁrst time CoA synthesis with a cardiac phenotype. Since CoAbiosynthesis can occur with pantethine as a source independent from PPCS, pantethine can be envisaged as therapeutic options for the patients still alive. A. Iuso: None. M. Wiersma: None.

However, 40% of patients remainwithout molecular diagnosis despite that fact that on aver  age ~80 de novo SNVs per patients are identi ﬁed. The sheer number of these variants, overhwhelmingly non coding,make classical functional workup strategies impractical.

All patients included were array CGH and exome negative. In total we identi ﬁed 3,396 de novo mutations in the 50 patients. 5 de novo mutations were located in pre  dicted enhancer regions based on epigenetics marks. For two of these predicted enhancers we could show positive in vivo enhancer activity in transgenic mouse reporterassays. Next we used microarray based DNA synthesis to create 230 bp oligonucleotides containing all 3,396 de novo non coding variants and the corresponding wild typesequences and perform lentivirus based MPRAs in human chondrocyte cells and primary mouse limb bud cells. We experimentally measured the cis regulatory activity of 3,396 de novo non coding mutations in a single, quantitative experiment. We identi ﬁed 48 variants that showed sig  niﬁcant differential expression of the reporter gene. The positive candidates showed up to 5 fold enrichment for ENCODE TF binding motifs indicating that the mutations are likely to change TF binding and thereby contribute todisease.

Here we tested the hypothesis that, although the genetic cause isnot known, the tissue distribution of the clinical manifes  tations in GLA seems to follow a pattern of somatic mosaicism. Materials and Methods: We performed targeted high  throughput sequencing on paired blood/tissue samples from 10 GLA patients. All variants detected were con ﬁrmed using at least one orthogonal method. We isolated LECs from fresh tissue samples obtained from three GLA patients that were also used for high throughput sequencing. Finallywe used a Cre loxP system in mice LECs (Prox1 CreERT2; LSL Pik3caH1047R) to characterize the effect of excessive PI3K signalling on the structure and function of lymphatics. Results: We identi ﬁed four different mosaic PIK3CA variants in six of ten patients. The variants were detected in LMs and in LECs isolated from affected tissues. Thesesame PIK3CA variants occur in patients with PIK3CA   related overgrowth spectrum and cause hyperactivation of the PI3K signalling pathway. We show that excessive PI3Ksignalling in LECs causes mice lymphatic hyperplasia, non  functional vessels, and induces the formation of lymphatics in bone. Conclusions: We describe for the ﬁrst time the presence of somatic activating PIK3CA mutations in patients with GLA. This will help to better de ﬁne the phenotypic consequences of this pathology, and has consequences in the diagnosis, monitoring and treatment of patients.

The condition is clinically characterized by loose redundant skin folds, facial characteristics, lipodystrophy, hypotonia and cardiopulmonary involvement including pneumothorax, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy and aortic root dilatation. Similarly, to ATP6V02  related cutis laxa, impaired retro  grade Golgi transport, glycosylation abnormalities, and a dysfunctional secretory pathway have been implicated in the pathogenesis, but the pleiotropic manifestations remainlargely unexplained. We use a zebra ﬁsh model with a proviral insertion in the 5 ’UTR of atp6v1e1 . Homozygous mutant embryos show decreased pigmentation. Decreasedand delayed spontaneous hatching of the homozygous atp6v1e1b mutants suggests hypotonia, which could be quantitatively assessed by a reduced touch evoked escaperesponse. All homozygous mutant ﬁsh die by 8 days post fertilization (dpf) due to severe cardiovascular edema and insufﬁcient cardiovascular circulation. Quanti ﬁcation of cardiac function at 3 dpf indicates a signi ﬁcantly decreased cardiac output and stroke volume, but normal heart rate in homozygous mutant embryos, and a similar, but notsigniﬁcant trend in heterozygous embryos. Moreover, blood ﬂow is severely reduced in mutants compared to hetero  zygous and wild type ﬁsh. Conclusion, our zebra ﬁsh model recapitulates several important clinical features including hypotonia and cardi  omyopathy. This model provides an important asset tounravel the molecular mechanism causing ATP6V1E1   related cutis laxa and to evaluate potential therapeutic strategies. L. Pottie: None. P. Sips: None. P.

Here ﬁveFLNB mutation  negative cases from three families were hypothesised to have a recessive form of SCTS on account of sib recurrence.Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) showed that all ﬁve were heterozygous for one of two splice site variants in MYH3 . Despite 3 of the 5 cases sharing two allelic haplotypes overMYH3 , no second variant could be identi ﬁed by WES. Subsequent WGS demonstrated a variant altering a con  served splice donor site in the 5 ’UTR of MYH3 , a region of the gene not captured by exome capture platforms. Expanding the case cohort to 16 unsolved SCTS cases, 9 had truncating mutations transmitted by unaffected parents,with 6 inheriting the same 5 ’UTR variant in trans ,a n observation at variance with the allele frequency for this variant in population databases. This variant disrupts spli cing of exons 1 3 in the 5 ’UTR but is still permissive of MYH3 translational initiation, albeit with reduced ef ﬁ  ciency. Although some MYH3 variants cause dominant SCTS, these data indicate that many truncating variants do not lead to the disease except when in trans with a second hypomorphic allele. These observations make geneticdiagnosis and counselling challenging in the context of simplex presentations of SCTS especially using a genotype  ﬁrst methodology. S.P. Robertson: None. S.

Despite numerous loci identi ﬁed by genome wide association studies, the effect sizes ofcommon variants are relatively small with much of the presumed genetic contribution remaining elusive. We report exome sequencing results in 209 people from 72 multi affected families with pedigree structures consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance and variable penetrance. We describe four new NS CL/P genes encoding compo nents of the p120 catenin complex (CTNND1, PLEKHA7, PLEKHA5 ) and an epithelial splicing regulator ( ESRP2 ), inaddition to CDH1 . The ﬁndings were validated in a second cohort of 497 NS CL/P patients comprising small families and singletons. Pathogenic variants in these genes were found in 14% of multi affected families and 2% of the replication cohort of smaller families. Enriched expression of each new gene/protein in human and mouse embryonicoro palatal epithelia, demonstration of functional impact of CTNND1 andESRP2 variants, and recapitulation of the CL/ P spectrum in Ctnnd1 knockout mice support a causative role in CL/P pathogenesis. These data show that primary defects in regulators of epithelial cell adhesion are the most signiﬁcant contributors to NS CL/P identi ﬁed to date and that inherited and de novo single gene variants explain a substantial proportion of NS CL/P. <!

Because melorheostosis occurs sporadically, somatic mutations werehypothesized, but bone tissue was not previously investi  gated. Paired biopsies of affected and contralateral unaf  fected bone of 15 melorheostosis patients were utilized forDNA extraction, osteoblast cultures and histology. Using WES and ddPCR, we identi ﬁed somatic mutations in MAP2K1 , encoding the kinase MEK1, in affected, but not unaffected, bone of 8 melorheostosis patients. Mosaicism was supported by immunohistochemistry of ERK1/2 acti  vation in bone tissue and two populations of culturedosteoblasts with distinct p ERK1/2 levels on ﬂow cyto  metry. These activating mutations (p.Q56P, p.K57E, p. K57N) cluster in the MEK1 negative regulatory domain.Osteoblasts from affected bone displayed increased MEK1  ERK1/2 signaling, which enhanced osteoblast proliferation and stimulated bone remodelling, while inhibiting osteo blast differentiation and bone mineralization. This coincided with the histology of melorheostosis, featuring exuberant deposition of parallel layers of lamellar bone, followed byintense bone remodelling with elevated cellularity. Melor  heostosis provides the ﬁrst demonstration that the MAP2K1 oncogene is important to human bone formation. Interest ingly, germline mutations in the catalytic core of MAP2K1 and the negative regulatory domain of MAP2K1 and MAP2K2 were identi ﬁed in Cardio Facio Cutaneous syn  drome (CFC). CFC and other RASopathies are associated with variable cardiac, facial and neurodevelopmental defects, but not with bone overgrowth. Somatic MAP2K1 mutations in melorheostotic osteoblasts and others recently reported in extracranial arteriovenous malformations apparently have consequences distinct from germlinemutations. We conclude that outcomes of MAP2K1 muta  tions depend on mutation timing and location. H. Kang: None. S. Jha: None. Z. Deng: None. N. Fratzl Zelman: None. W.A. Cabral: None. A. Ivovic: None. F.

Prenatal exome sequencing approaches have identi ﬁed genetic diagnoses when conventional tests (kar  yotype and microarray) were not diagnostic. However,prenatal phenotyping limitations, counselling challenges regarding variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance, incidental and secondary ﬁndings, and technical problems pose unique challenges in the prenatal use of exome sequencing. Here we use a multidisciplinary approach to explore the utility of rapid targeted fetal exome sequencing for prenatal diag nosis, using skeletal dysplasias as an exemplar. Methods: Pregnant women who had had, or who were undergoing, an invasive procedure to exclude chromosomalabnormalities following ultrasound detection of fetal abnormalities suggestive of a skeletal dysplasia in UK Fetal Medicine units were identi ﬁed prospectively. After multidisciplinary review by local Fetal Medicine teams and Clinical Geneticists with expertise in fetal dysmorphology, parents were consented for targeted exome trio sequencing.Variant interpretation focused on a virtual panel of 240 genes known to cause skeletal dysplasias. Results: Deﬁnitive molecular diagnosis was made in 15/ 18 (83%) cases. In some cases fetal ultrasound ﬁndings alone were of suf ﬁcient severity for parents to opt for termination. In others, molecular diagnosis informedaccurate prediction of outcome, improved parental counsel  ling and informed parental decisions and perinatal management. Conclusions: Trio sequencing with expert multidisciplin  ary review for case selection and data interpretation yields timely, high diagnostic rates in fetuses presenting withunexpected skeletal abnormalities. This can result in improved parental counselling and pregnancy management. F. Faravelli: None. N. Chandler: None. S. Best: None. J. Hayward: None. S. Mansour: None. E. Kivuva: None. D. Tapon: None.

The aim of the study is to describe a pro ﬁle of placental temporal gene expression dynamics over the course ofhuman pregnancy. Materials and Methods: Analyzed placental samples covered the entire human gestational period: 1 sttrimester (7 10 gestational weeks; n ,8), 2ndtrimester (17 21 g.w.; n,8) and term (37 41 g.w.; n ,8). RNA Seq protocol and basic bioinformatics have been reported by Reiman et al.(2017). The current study focused on grouping placental genes based on their highly correlated expression dynamics across pregnancy trimesters. Enrichment analysis forfunctional pathways was conducted for each gene group using g:Pro ﬁler (https://biit.cs.ut.ee/gpro ﬁler/). Results: Among 14,920 genes expressed in the placenta, roughly a quarter exhibited a clear temporal expression pattern over the course of pregnancy. Enrichment analysis showed that genes overexpressed in the ﬁrst trimester are involved in cell cycle and transcription regulation; whereas mid gestation speci ﬁc genes are associated with fetal development, cell communication and differentiation oftissues. Conclusions: We show that a large proportion of genes expressed in the human placenta follow a tightly correlatedtemporal expression pro ﬁle. We hypothesize that distur  bances of this ‘gestational clock ’may lead to placental and fetal developmental abnormalities and pregnancycomplications. Reiman et al. FASEB J.

Wilkie1, A. Goriely1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,2University College London, London, United Kingdom Low level mosaicism, attributed to clonal expansion of spontaneous mutations, is prevalent in somatic tissues such as skin and blood. We have previously shown that speci ﬁc ‘selﬁsh’mutations spontaneously arising in male germline stem cells (spermatogonia) lead to clonal expansion result  ing in elevated mutation levels in sperm over time. Thisprocess, termed sel ﬁsh spermatogonial selection, explains the high spontaneous birth rate and strong paternal age effect of disorders such as achondroplasia, Apert, Noonan and Costello syndromes, with direct evidence for this pro  cess occurring at speci ﬁc positions in six genes ( FGFR2 , FGFR3 ,RET,PTPN11 ,HRAS and KRAS ). Here we per  form a discovery screen to identify novel mutations and genes under selection in the male germline by performing massively parallel simplex PCR targeting using RainDancetechnology to interrogate mutational hotspots in 71 genes (66.5kb in total) in 276 biopsies of testes from 5 men (mean age: 73 years). Ultra deep sequencing (~22,000x), a customlow frequency variant prioritization pipeline and targeted validation identi ﬁed 59 distinct variants with frequencies as low as 0.06%, including 53 variants not previously directlyassociated with sel ﬁsh selection. The majority (80%) of variants identi ﬁed were previously implicated in either developmental disorders and/or oncogenesis, includingmutations in six newly associated ( BRAF, CBL, MAP2K1 , MAP2K2, NF1 and RAF1 ) genes, all of which encode components of RAS/MAPK signalling. Our ﬁndings extend the link between mutations causing dysregulation of RAS/ MAPK signalling and sel ﬁsh selection and suggest that the ageing male germ line is a repository for such deleteriousmutations.

The apparent pau  city of X linked NOA is likely to be the consequence ofthe lack of comprehensive, whole X chromosome target  ing studies.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 825Material and Methods: X chromosome exome sequen  cing in 50 idiopathic NOA patients with known testis histology. Variants were ﬁltered and prioritized according to their minor allele frequency (MAF ≤0.01) and their predicted pathogenicity. RNA interference was used to determine the role of Caf1 55 (the human RBBP7 ortholog) in Drosophila spermatogenesis. Results: We identi ﬁed 77 rare and predicted as pathogenic variants in 42/50 NOA patients. 76 variantswere private mutations whereas one was found in two unrelated patients. Nine genes (six of them with testis speciﬁc expression or overexpression in the testis) were recurrently mutated in 16 different patients. Two patients affected by spermatogonial arrest presented pathogenic mutations in the RBBP7 gene. Conditional Caf1 55 KO showed that male mutants had tiny testis, no spermatozoa and were sterile. Conclusions : This is the ﬁrst X chromosome exome analysis in highly selected NOA patients. Our approach was relatively successful in identifying candidate genes for the NOA phenotype. Up to now, we performed functionalanalysis only for the RBBP7 gene demonstrating that the protein is essential for Drosophila spermatogenesis hence we propose it as a novel genetic factor for earlyspermatogenic failure.

Hussain3","1Department of Pharmacological and Biomolecular Sciences,","Milan, Italy,2University College of London, London, United Kingdom,3Sidra Medicine, Doha, Qatar Hypogonadotropic hypogonadism (HH) is a rare genetic disorder that impairs sexual reproduction. It can be causedby a defective development or function of Gonadotropin  releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons. Most HH cases is still idiopathic, despite recent advances in sequencing technol ogies. Here we have combined in silico with in vitro and in vivo mouse models to identify and functionally char  acterise the role of a novel gene in the etiopathogenesis ofHH. Speci ﬁcally, we have applied homozygosity mapping together with exome sequencing and computationalmodelling to identify a shared point mutation of the Semaphorin 3G ( SEMA3G ) gene in two brothers with HH, born from consanguineous parents. Further, we have shown that the mutation impairs GnRH neuron migration and Akt activation in vitro, and that mice lacking Sema3g show a reduced number of hypothalamic GnRH neurons andreduced fertility. Together, these results indicate that SEMA3G signalling is required for GnRH neuron migration and its insuf ﬁciency contributes to the pathogenesis of HH. Grants; telethon GP13142 for AC, A.

Ten Eleven Transloca tion (TET) dioxygenases and DNA repair enzyme Thymine DNA Glycosylase (TDG) are involved in active DNA demethylation by generating and removing, respectively,novel oxidized cytosine species. Mutations of TET1 and TDG , and alterations of the levels of oxidized cytosine species have been identi ﬁed in human CRC cases, but the biological signi ﬁcance of the TET TDG demethylation axis in intestinal tumorigenesis is unclear.826 J. del PicchiaMaterials and Methods: We generated ApcMinmice with additional inactivation of Tet1 and/or Tdg, and character  ized the methylome and transcriptome of intestinal adenomas by DREAM and RNA sequencing, respectively. Results: Tet1  and/or Tdg deﬁcient ApcMinmice show enhanced intestinal tumorigenesis in comparison to wildtype Tet1 and Tdg Apc Minmice. Speci ﬁcally, Tet1 and/or Tdg deﬁcient ApcMinadenomas manifested increased size or features of erosion and stroma activation. Methylomeanalysis revealed progressive loss of global DNA hypo  methylation in colonic adenomas from Tet1  and Tdg  deﬁcient Apc Minmice, and hypermethylation of CpG islands inTet1 deﬁcient ApcMinmice. In addition, RNA sequencing showed upregulation of genes in in ﬂammatory and immune response pathways in Tet1  and Tdg mutant colonic adenomas compared to control ApcMinadenomas. Conclusions: Taken together, these ﬁndings demonstrate the important role of active DNA demethylation mediatedby TET TDG in reducing intestinal tumor formation, by modulating the epigenome and in ﬂammatory/immune responses. This study highlights a novel mechanism ofepigenetic deregulation during intestinal tumorigenesis with diagnostic, therapeutic and prognostic implications. R. Tricarico: None. J. Madzo: None. G.

These epimutations can be primary, de ﬁned as purely epi  genetic events labile in the germline. They can also besecondary, caused by a cis acting genetic defect transmitted following a Mendelian inheritance pattern, with re  establishment of the epigenetic change in the offspring. InLynch syndrome, a few families with a heritable MLH1 epimutation have been reported so far, with various genetic bases including single nucleotide variations and copynumber variations. Materials and Methods: We designed a long range PCR next generation sequencing strategy to screen MLH1 entire gene and applied it to 4 French families with heritable epimutations and 10 additional patients with no proven transmission of their epimutations. Results: This strategy successfully detected the insertion of an Aluelement in MLH1 coding sequence in one family. Two previously unreported MLH1 variants were identi ﬁed in other epimutation carriers: a nucleotide substitution within intron 1 and a single nucleotide deletion in the 5 ’  UTR. A partial duplication of MLH1 gene was detected in another family. We demonstrated the segregation of these variants with MLH1 methylation and studied the functional consequences of these defects on transcription. Conclusions: This study represents the largest cohort of patients with MLH1 secondary epimutations associated with a broad spectrum of genetic defects. It provides further insightinto the complexity of molecular mechanisms leading to heritable epimutations.

Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: In pathologies such as cancer and under damaging conditions (e.x. radiation) fraction of cells undergoes cell death and releases DNA that becomes part ofthe circulating cell free DNA (cfDNA) pool. CfDNA can be oxidized under oxidative stress. We have shown that in case of cancer the level of oxidation in cfDNA increases. Materials and Methods: Model genetic construction was obtained by insertion of poly G DNA fragments in a vector with GFP gene and subsequent oxidation with UV radiationor H 2O2. Penetration was con ﬁrmed with ﬂuorescent microscopy (comparison with penetration using TurboFect (Thermo, Germany)). mRNA was isolated from MSCs and MCF 7 using RNeasy Mini kit (Qiagen, Germany). Gene expression level was assessed using RT PCR (TBP as internal standard). Protein levels were measured withﬂuorescent antibodies using ﬂow cytometry. Statistics was performed using Statgraphics software. Results: Oxidation of cfDNA transforms cfDNA frag  ments into biologically active molecules that regulate level of expression of number of genes. This was shown on a model genetic construction containing poly G insertion thatis prone to oxidation. Plasmids with oxidized poly G insertions penetrate MCF 7 and MSCs and cause rapidly  repaired DNA breaks. In concentration 10   200 ng/mloxidized plasmids activate DNA reparation processes and induce antioxidant signaling pathways regulated by NRF2, thus, inhibiting apoptosis and causing adaptive response. Inconcentrations >350 ng/ml oxidized plasmids cause apoptosis. Conclusions: Oxidation of cfDNA plays an important role in its penetration into cancer and stem cells and in adaptive response development.

The challenge ofVUS is epitomized by BRCA1 , a tumor suppressor gene integral to DNA repair and genomic stability. Germline BRCA1 loss of function variants predispose women to early onset breast and ovarian cancers. Although BRCA1 has been sequenced in millions of people, the risk asso  ciated with most newly observed variants cannot be de ﬁ  nitively assigned. To date, functional studies of BRCA1 VUS have been limited in scope and performed outside of the gene's endogenous context. Methods: We employ saturation genome editing to assay 96.5% of all possible single nucleotide variants (SNVs) in 13 exons that encode critical domains of BRCA1. Ourmultiplex, CRISPR/Cas9 based assay leverages targeted deep sequencing to measure variants' effects on cellular ﬁtness and mRNA expression in human cells dependent on BRCA1 function. Results: We obtain function scores for 3,893 SNVs. Scores are bimodally distributed and nearly perfectlyconcordant with established assessments of pathogenicity (sensitivity ,97%; speci ﬁcity,98%). Of 256 VUS, 25.0% score as non functional, as do 15.9% of 3,140 SNVscurrently unobserved clinically. RNA measurements deline  ate mechanisms by which SNVs result in loss of BRCA1 function. Hundreds of missense SNVs detrimental toprotein function are identi ﬁed, as well as dozens of exonic and intronic SNVs that compromise BRCA1 function by disrupting splicing. Conclusions: We predict this data will be directly useful for the clinical interpretation of cancer risk based on BRCA1 sequencing. Furthermore, we propose that this paradigmcan be extended to many additional clinically  actionable genes. G.M. Findlay: None. R. Daza: None. B.K. Martin: None. M.D. Zhang: None. A.P. Leith: None. M.

Huff2 1Public Health College, Harbin Medical University, Harbin, China,2The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston, TX, United States To evaluate the contribution of rare genetic variation to the development of soft tissue sarcoma, we conducted a whole  exome case control study in 219 cases and 3,507 controls ofEuropean ancestry. We controlled for technological strati  ﬁcation biases using XPAT and conducted gene based association tests using VAAST 2.1. Our cases consisted ofsamples from TCGA with one of six soft tissue sarcoma subtypes: leiomyosarcoma (LMS), dedifferentiated lipo  sarcoma (DLPS), myxo ﬁbrosarcoma (MFS), undiffer  entiated pleiomorphic sarcoma (UPS), malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors (MPNST), and synovial sarcoma (SS). We observed nominally signi ﬁcant association signals for three well established sarcoma susceptibility genes, NF1 (p,1x1 0  5),TP53 (p,0.0025), and RB1 (p,0.028). MSH2 , an HNPCC gene, was also nominally signi ﬁcant (p,0.0085); previous studies have suggested that sarcomas may be within the spectrum of HNPCC tumors. In general, the effect size estimates for variants in these genes werelarge relative to other cancer types. For likely gene dis  rupting variants, the ORs were 39.4 (95% CI: 7.1 –219.3) and 33.0 (95% CI: 2.4 –462.5) for NF1 and MSH2 , respectively. For predicted damaging missense variants, the ORs were 12.0 (95% CI: 2.4 –59.1) and ∞(95% CI: 6.7 – ∞) for RB1 and TP53 , respectively. In subtype speci ﬁc analyses, all four genes were signi ﬁcantly associated with LMS, the subtype with the largest sample size. Three of the four genes were signi ﬁcantly associated with at least one additional subtype. Our results indicate that rare coding variants can confer substantial increases in risk for multiple soft tissue sarcoma subtypes. F. Hu: None. Y. Yu: None. J. Chen: None. P. Scheet: None. C.D.

In this family, whole exome sequencing yielded rare, simultaneously het  erozygous variants in the Aicardi Goutières syndrome (AGS)genes ADAR andRNASEH2B co segregating with the tumor phenotype. AGS is a genetically induced in ﬂammatory dis  ease particularly of the brain, which has not been associatedwith a consistently increased cancer risk to date.

Tumors with ADAR orRNASEH2B variants recapitulated features of AGS, such as calciﬁcation and increased type I interferon expression.Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 829Patients carrying ADAR orRNASEH2B variants showed upregulation of interferon stimulated gene (ISG) transcripts in peripheral blood as seen in AGS. An increased ISG expression was also induced by ADAR andRNASEH2B variants in tumor cells and was blocked by the JAK inhibitor Ruxolitinib. Our data implicate rare variants in the AGS genes ADAR and RNASEH2B and a type I interferon signature in glioma and prostate carcinoma risk and tumo rigenesis, consistent with a genetic basis underlying in ﬂammation driven malignant transformation in glioma and pro state carcinoma development.

 The ARID1B spectrum: From non syndromic intellectualdisability to Cof ﬁn Siris syndrome,C15.1,"E. P. J. van der Sluijs1, J. Clayton Smith2, G. W. E. Santen1","1Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands,","2Manchester Centre For Genomic Medicine, Manchester, United Kingdom ARID1B mutations are one of the most frequent causes of ID as determined by large scale whole exome sequencing stu  dies. Most published clinical data however is obtained from clinically diagnosed Cof ﬁn Siris patients (ARID1B CSS) and it is unclear whether this data is representative for patients identi ﬁed through unbiased sequencing techniques (ARID1B  ID). Therefore we sought to determine genotypic and phe notypic differences between ARID1B ID and ARID1B CSS. We asked clinicians to add their patient ’s information to a web based survey based on previously reported ARID1Bfeatures ( www.arid1bgene.com ). In total, 144 patients (80 ARID1B CSS and 64 ARID1B ID patients) weresubmitted. All patients had truncating mutations which were distributed throughout the gene. Remarkably, no pathogenic mutations were identi ﬁed in the small in frame exon 3 and the ﬁrst 850 bases of exon 1. All but one patient were reported to have intellectual disability (ID). ARID1B  CSS patients displayed more CSS associated dysmorphicfeatures ( p< 0.001) than ARID1B ID patients. ARID1B ID patients were more inclined to have myopia (39.5% vs 18.3%, p,0.024) and cryptorchidism (67.6% vs 41.4%, p,0.005). Prevalences of motor (100%) and speech (93.8%) delay, feeding dif ﬁculties (69.2%), seizures (29.7%) and agenesis of corpus callosum (41.2%) werecomparable in both groups. Based on our data of 144 patients we conclude that except for dysmorphic features there do not seem to be majordifferences between ARID1B ID and ARID1B CSS patients. There therefore appears to be an ARID1B  spectrum, and patients should be managed similarlyregardless of clinical diagnosis. E.P.J. van der Sluijs: None. J. Clayton Smith: None. G.W.E.

NIPBL variants account for830 J. del Picchia>70% of patients and result in NIPBL haploinsuf ﬁciency. NIPBL interacts via its N terminus with MAU2, forming the kollerin complex, responsible for cohesin ’s loading onto chromatin. By CRISPR/Cas9, we generated cell lines expressing an N terminal truncated form of NIPBL de ﬁcient for complex formation with MAU2. Molecular characteriza tion revealed reduced NIPBL protein levels and loss of MAU2. However, ChIP sequencing analyses show similar chromatin bound cohesin and NIPBL in wild type and mutantcells indicating unaffected cohesin loading mechanisms. Interestingly, by genome sequencing of CdLS patients, we identi ﬁed the ﬁrstde novo variant in MAU2 . This mutation causes an in frame deletion of seven amino acids affecting an α helix important for wrapping the N terminus of NIPBL within MAU2. Accordingly, in vitro analyses revealed adramatic reduction of MAU2 heterodimerization with NIPBL. Notably, MAU2 is required for the correct folding of the N  terminus of NIPBL, which becomes unstable in the absenceof MAU2. Therefore, it might be possible that the inability of MAU2 to interact with NIPBL results in decreased NIPBL protein levels, con ﬁrming NIPBL haploinsuf ﬁciency as the major pathogenic mechanism of CdLS. In summary, we described the ﬁrstMAU2 mutation in a patient with char  acteristic CdLS phenotype. Our functional investigationsreveal a new pathogenic mechanism relevant for CdLS resulting in decreased NIPBL levels upon functional alteration of its binding partner MAU2. I. Parenti: None. S.

 New models for human diseases from the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium,C15.3,"P. Cacheiro1, T. Konopka1, D. Smedley1, A. Mallon2,T .","Meehan3, H. Parkinson3","1William Harvey Research Institute, Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom,2Medical Research Council Harwell, Mammalian Genetics Unit and Mary Lyon Centre, Harwell, United Kingdom,3European Molecular Biology Laboratory, European Bioinformatics Institute, Hinxton,United Kingdom Introduction: The International Mouse Phenotyping Con  sortium (IMPC) is conducting genome and phenome wide phenotyping on knockout mouse strains. Following a via  bility screen, homozygous viable mice enter the adultpipeline, whereas for homozygous lethal strains, hetero  zygous animals are phenotyped. The latest data release inDecember 2017 comprises 4,364 genes, which adds ~1,000 genes to those previously published, and identi ﬁes new models for human diseases. Methods: Relevant disease models were identi ﬁed by computing the similarity between the phenotypes in the mice and the human phenotypes associated to their orthologousloci in Mendelian disease. We also compared the ability of homozygous and heterozygous knockouts to phenocopy human disease, stratifying by mode of inheritance. Results: 281 new knockouts in rare disease genes have been analysed since August 2016. Approximately 40% of these partially mimic the clinical phenotypes. Homozygousmutants showed higher similarity scores. However, when divided according to mode of inheritance, these differences only remained signi ﬁcant for autosomal recessive genes, which also had better concordance with mouse zygosity. Diseases with no previous mouse models described in the literature by the Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI) group(~10% of new strains) include Spermatogenic Failure 6, an infertility condition caused by mutations in SPATA16 , now observed in homozygous mice, and Dilated Cardiomyo pathy 1BB, associated with DSG2 and mice displaying increased heart weight, left ventricular dilation, and reduced cardiac contractility. Conclusions: Novel mouse models covering diverse biological systems continue to be incorporated to the IMPC catalogue. Analysis of their phenotypes is enhancing therange of available models that are relevant for human diseases. P. Cacheiro: None. T. Konopka: None. D. Smedley: None. A. Mallon: None. T. Meehan: None.

Here, we report six patients with previously undescribed heterozygous variants clustered inthe 3 ’ coding region of ACTB. These patients present with clinical features different from BWCFF, including throm  bocytopenia, microcephaly, and mild developmental dis ability. Patient derived cells are morphologically and functionally distinct from controls. Assessment of cytos  keletal constituents identi ﬁed a discrete ﬁlament population altered in these cells, which comprises force generating and transmitting actin binding proteins (ABP) known to be associated with thrombocytopenia. In silico modelling andmolecular dynamics (MD) simulations support altered interactions between these ABP and mutant β CYA. Our results describe a new clinical syndrome associated withACTB mutations with a distinct genotype phenotype cor  relation, identify a cytoskeletal protein interaction network crucial for thrombopoiesis, and provide support for thehypomorphic nature of these actinopathy mutations.

The most common factor contributing to perinatal death is congenital abnormalities.Aim: To use WES and WGS to identify genetic causes of fetal/newborn abnormalities that result in termination of pregnancy, death in utero or in the newborn period, in viewto providing families with answers regarding cause and likelihood of recurrence. Methods: WES and/or WGS is being performed using Illumina sequencing systems, if microarray has not identi ﬁed a cause. Prospective cases are families referred to the Genetics unit (parent fetus trios) and retrospectivecases are from stored autopsy samples (singletons). High priority cases are consanguineous families, fetuses with multiple malformations, and unexplained fetal/newborndeath. Statistical, bioinformatic and experimental laboratory techniques are used to con ﬁrm causality of variants. Results: 43 prospective trios and 60 retrospective singletons have been recruited and sequenced. Of the prospective cohort, 23% of cases have been solved and an additional 26% have a single promising candidate beinginvestigated. In the retrospective cohort, 18% of cases have strong candidates identi ﬁed. Solved cases include new832 J. del Picchiadisease gene discoveries, new syndrome identi ﬁcation and novel severe fetal presentations of existing rare pediatric disease. The study has contributed directly to the birth of 3 healthy newborns. Discussion: Our results provide insights into molecular mechanisms of early development and indicate that a genomicautopsy using WES/WGS should be a routine component of the investigation of pregnancy loss and perinatal death.

This has led to the recognition that phenotypic heterogeneity resulting from allelic mutations occurs more commonly than previously appreciated. Here, we report thatmissense variants in CDC42, a gene encoding a small GTPase functioning as an intracellular signaling node, underlie a clinically heterogeneous group of phenotypescharacterized by variable growth dysregulation, facial dys  morphism, and neurodevelopmental, immunological, and hematological anomalies, including a phenotype resemblingNoonan syndrome, a developmental disorder caused by dysregulated RAS signaling. In silico, in vitro, and in vivo analyses demonstrate that mutations variably perturbCDC42 function by altering the switch between the active and inactive states of the GTPase and/or affecting CDC42 interaction with effectors, and differentially disturb cellularand developmental processes. These ﬁndings reveal the remarkably variable impact that dominantly acting CDC42 mutations have on cell function and development, creatingchallenges in syndrome de ﬁnition, and exemplify the importance of functional pro ﬁling for syndrome recognition and delineation.

" High throughput characterization of genetic effects onDNA:protein binding and gene transcriptionAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 833C. Kalita1, C. Brown2, A. Freiman1, X. Wen3, R. Pique Regi1,F . Luca1 1Wayne State University, Detroit, MI, United States, 2University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, United States, 3University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, MI, United States The majority of the human genome is composed of non coding regions containing regulatory elements, which con trol gene expression. Many variants associated with com plex traits are in these regions, and contribute to an individual's phenotype by disrupting gene regulatorysequences. Consequently, it is important to not only identify functional regulatory elements, but also to test if a variant within a binding site affects gene regulation. We developeda new streamlined protocol for high throughput reporter assay, BiT STARR seq (Biallelic targeted STARR seq), to identify allele speci ﬁc expression (ASE) while directly accounting for PCR duplicates through unique molecular identi ﬁers incorporation. We tested 75,501 oligos (43,500 SNPs) and identi ﬁed 2,720 SNPs with signi ﬁcant ASE (FDR 10%). To validate disruption of binding as one of the mechanisms underlying ASE, we performed high through put EMSA (BUNDLE seq) for NFKB p50. We tested thesame oligo library used in BiT STARR seq and identi ﬁed 2,951 SNPs with signi ﬁcant allele speci ﬁc binding (ASB) (FDR 10%). Of the SNPs with ASB, 173 also had ASE(OR,1.97, p value ,0.0006). When we focused on var iants associated with complex traits, we identi ﬁed 1,531 SNPs with ASE in the BiT STARR seq and 1,662 SNPswith ASB in the BUNDLE seq assay. We characterized the mechanism whereby the alternate allele for variant rs3810936 increases risk for Crohn ’s disease through increased NFKB binding and consequent altered gene expression. In conclusion, combining ASB and ASE in high throughput assays is a new powerful approach tovalidate the molecular mechanism for regulatory variants associated with disease traits.",C16.1,C.

 A pedigree based estimate of the human germline retrotransposition rate,C16.2,"J. E. Feusier, W. Watkins, J. Thomas, L. Baird, M. Leppert, L.",B. Jorde,"University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, United States Introduction: Mobile elements compose at least half of the human genome, and some mobile element families are still actively inserting in the genome. However, the rate ofmobile element retrotransposition has been inferred only indirectly from phylogenetic comparisons. We report the ﬁrst direct estimate of the retrotransposition rate in a large series of 3 generation human pedigrees. Materials and Methods: We performed whole genome sequencing at 30x average coverage on blood derived DNAfrom 603 CEPH individuals, comprising 34 multi  generation pedigrees. The families were joint called using Mobile Element Locator Tool (MELT) and RUFUS toidentify de novo Alu, LINE1, and SVA elements. All candidate de novo mobile element insertions (MEI) were validated using PCR and Sanger sequencing, and ﬂanking SNPs were typed to determine parent of origin. Results: The false negative and false positive rates of MEI detection were 5% and 15%, respectively. Theretrotransposition rate estimates for Alu elements, one in 50, is roughly half the rate estimated using phylogenetic analyses, a difference similar to that observed for singlenucleotide variants. The SVA and LINE1 retrotransposition rates are both approximately one in 100 150 births, which is higher than phylogenetic estimates. De novo MEIs weretransmitted at a 3 fold higher rate among fathers than mothers, with no apparent age bias. Conclusions: The directly estimated Alu retrotransposi  tion rate is roughly half of previous phylogenetically based estimates, whereas LINE1 and SVA rates are higher than previously estimated. Future studies will investigatewhether a paternal bias is a consistent hallmark of de novo retrotransposition. Support: NIH GM 59290J.E. Feusier: None. W. Watkins: None. J. Thomas: None. L.

Previous studies have identi ﬁed that genetic and non  genetic host factors play an important role in this variation of the immune response. However, alarge portion of the variation remains unexplained due to limited power of these studies and to the fact that interac  tions between genetics and environment are largely ignored.We aim to identify both the genetic and the environment  dependent genetic effects that are shared by multiple immune functions in a large population cohort. After the measurement of cytokines (protein level) in response to pathogen stimulations in 500 healthy individuals, weﬁrstly grouped cytokines based on biological relevance in monocytes (IL  β, IL 6 and TNF  α)o rTc e l l s( I F N   γ,I L 1 7 and IL22) and the pathogen used in stimulation, respectively. Subsequently, we applied a multi trait modeling strategy,where the biological relevant groups were evaluated at genome wide level. A total of 12 genome wide signi ﬁcant loci were detected, of which 6 replicate the previous single trait mapping and 6 are novel. The 12 loci are enriched for genes implicated in immune response pathways and are co  localized with genetic risk factors associated to immune mediated diseases like in ﬂammatory bowel disease and rheumatoid arthritis. In addition, several loci were identi ﬁed to regulate cytokine production differentially between genderand smoking status. Our results show that integration of multiple immune phenotypes can reveal novel genomic associations andcontext speci ﬁc cytokine QTLs, highlighting the shared genetic basis of cytokine produc tion upon stimulation that contribute to inter individual d iversity of the immune function.

 Time informative markers to date ancient Skeletons,C16.4,"U. Esposito, G. Holland, E. Elhaik","Department of Animal and Plant Sciences, University of","Shefﬁeld, Shef ﬁeld, United KingdomDuring the last years, we have witnessed a conspicuous upraise in the sequencing of ancient DNA data, with the proliferation of studies attempting to shed light on human origins and migration routes. Dating the ancient DNA is, therefore, of key importance. However, although radio  carbon dating is a well established practice, its outcome canbe altered by numerous factors, leading to inaccuracies with carbon dates older than 25,000 BP considered highly unreliable. Here, we introduce a DNA admixture baseddating method, which utilizes allele frequencies that vary over time to create dating components. We developed synthetic DNA typical to speci ﬁc time periods (e.g., 10,500  9,000 BP) and then calculated for each ancient genome the time pro ﬁle, which consisted of the frequencies of those DNA molecules. Using a dataset of ~300 ancient Eurasianswith reliable radiocarbon date ranging from 15,000 BP to 1,500 BP, we demonstrated that our predicted dates are perfectly correlated with radiocarbon dates (r 2,0.9). The average difference between our predictions and the average radiocarbon dates was 800 years. Our results con ﬁrm the usefulness of using time dependent allelic frequency forbiodating and contribute to the understanding of the com  plexity of migration and admixture events.

Materials and Methods: We have whole genome sequenced 37K Icelanders and genotyped 155K, a largefraction of the Icelandic population (11% and 46% of 338K, respectively). As part of this effort, we are performing genetic analysis of rare diseases in the clinicalsetting. We sequenced the genomes of two Icelandic brothers diagnosed with CGD in an attempt at ﬁnding the causal mutation. Results: We identi ﬁed a homozygous loss of function mutation, p.Tyr2Ter, in C17orf62 in both brothers, and found six additional homozygous individuals throughimputation of the mutation into 155K chip genotyped Icelanders. Genotype based recall, and review of hospital  based information, revealed that all eight homozygotes havesigns of CGD, manifesting as colitis, severe and recurrent infections, or an impaired neutrophil oxidative burst. Mice deﬁcient in the homolog of C17orf62 are highly susceptible to infections. Homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter associates with inﬂammatory bowel disease ( P,8.3 × 10 −8; OR (95% CI) ,67.6 (14.5, 315.5)), and growth retardation ( P,3.3 × 10 −4; Effect (95% CI) , 1.24 SD ( 1.92,  0.56) /  8.5 cm). We show that homozygosity for p.Tyr2Ter causes complete loss of the C17orf62 protein and a drastic reduction in oneof NADPH ‘s subunits, indicating a chaperone role for C17orf62. Conclusions: By leveraging a large population speci ﬁc dataset we have elucidated the role of a previously uncharacterized gene in humans, C17orf62 , and identi ﬁed a novel cause of CGD. G.A.

Compared to controls AAM was decreased in dele  tion ( Δ, 1.5 years, p ,0.01) and increased in duplication carriers ( Δ,+1.5; p,7.8 x 10  5; corrected for BMI and birthyear). We replicated these associations in 129,991 UKBB women, 22,212 EGCUT females and 67 16p11.2 clinicalpatients. A directionally consistent trend was observed in 16p11.2 UKBB and patient males. These features were accompanied by reproductive tract/fertility disorders, e.g.miscarriages (OR ,2.65; p ,0.019), oligo /amenorrhea (OR ,10.2; p ,0.01), cryptorchidism/hypospadias. We validated these results in 16p11.2 mice models by detecting signi ﬁcant changes in timing of ﬁrst ovulation (p < 0.01), estrous cycli  city (p,0.03) and uterine size (p ,8.1 x 10  3).

We found a signi ﬁcant link between the human 16p11.2 dosage, AAM and volume of hypothalamus (p FWE<0 . 0 5 ) , a structure associated with sexual development, suggesting that perturbation of the GnRH axis could be responsible for the observed phenotypes.

Although CAMK2 was one of the ﬁrst proteins shown to be essential for normal learning and synaptic plasticity in mice, its requirement forhuman brain development has not yet been established. Through a multi center collaborative study based on aAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 837whole exome sequencing approach, we identi ﬁed 20 exceedingly rare de novo CAMK2A or CAMK2B variants in 27 unrelated individuals with neurodevelopmental impair  ment. The individuals all present with intellectual disability, language and speech delay, and virtually all of them show behavioral anomalies. The variants are either in the kinasedomain or in the autoregulatory domain, suggesting they may change the kinetic function of the enzyme. Variants were assessed for their effect on CAMK2 function onneuronal migration in the developing nervous of mouse embryos transfected with cDNA constructs by in utero electroporation. For both CAMK2A and CAMK2B ,w e identi ﬁed pathogenic variants that decreased or increased CAMK2 auto phosphorylation at Thr286/Thr287. We fur  ther found that all variants affecting auto phosphorylationalso affected neuronal migration, highlighting the impor  tance of tightly regulated CAMK2 auto phosphorylation in neuronal function and neurodevelopment. Our data estab lish the importance of CAMK2A and CAMK2B and their auto phosphorylation in human brain function, and expand the phenotypic spectrum of the disorders caused by variantsin key players of the glutamatergic signaling pathway.

Mul  tiple malformations of cortical development are associatedwith abnormal centrosomal protein function. Rotatin (RTTN), localized at centrosome and basal body, is a pro  tein previously linked to a wide variety of brain mal formations, affecting neuronal proliferation, migration and organization. The molecular disease mechanism(s) have not yet been elucidated. We have gathered patient material froma cohort of 8 patients with homozygous or compound het  erozygous RTTN mutations. Quanti ﬁcation of RTTN mRNA shows residual transcript in all patients, supporting thehypothesis that complete lack of RTTN is embryonically lethal in human, as seen in RTTN  /  knockout mice. Immunocytochemistry of RTTN in control ﬁbroblasts and derived neurons shows localization at the centrosome. Furthermore, in the cohort of RTTN patients and siRTTN ﬁbroblasts, we show that RTTN de ﬁciency leads to abnor  mal centrosome ampli ﬁcation during cell division, leading to multipolar mitotic spindles and mitotic failure. This cellular phenotype has also been reported in Drosophila melanogaster homologue Ana3 knockout neuroblasts. FACS cell cycle analysis showed a highly signi ﬁcant increase of G1 phase cells and decrease in G2/M phase cellsin RTTN de ﬁcient ﬁbroblasts. Proteomics analysis shows that RTTN interacts with the non muscle cellular myosin complex (MYH9 MYH10 MYH14). This complex hasalready shown to play a role in centrosome ampli ﬁcation, ciliogenesis and nucleokinesis during neuronal migration. Mutational impairment of the RTTN Myosin binding couldexplain the cellular phenotype and cortical malformations in our patients.

Introduction: Through a multi center international col  laboration, we identi ﬁed 16 individuals with de novo or dominant variants in RORA , encoding the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) related orphan nuclear receptor alpha, bywhole exome sequencing or chromosomal microarray. The mutational spectrum included four copy number variations (two de novo deletions, one dominant deletion and one de novo duplication) and nine de novo single nucleotide var  iants. Intellectual disability (ID) was the predominant clinical feature (15/16), accompanied by seizures (11/16), autisticfeatures (5/16) and cerebellar hypoplasia or atrophy (3/16). Materials and methods: To investigate the relevance of RORA disruption to neurodevelopmental phenotypes in humans, we abrogated the D. rerio ortholog, roraa , through either transient suppression or CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing. Results: Disruption of roraa causes a signi ﬁcant reduction of cerebellar size in developing larvae. Moreover, wild type human RORA mRNA could rescue cerebellar defects caused by roraa morpholino knockdown. Through in vivo complementation and titration of variant mRNA, we observed that missense variants had two distinct pathogenicmechanisms of either haploinsuf ﬁciency or dominant toxic effects, according to their localization in the ligand  or DNA binding domains. Notably, ID and autism were hall mark features in individuals with loss of function variants, whereas ID and cerebellar features were the main pheno  types in individuals with variants harboring a dominanttoxic effect. Conclusions: Our combined genetic and functional data point to dual mutational effects that likely determine phe notypic outcome. In sum, our results show that RORA variants lead to a neurodevelopmental disorderAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 839characterized by intellectual disability, seizures, autistic features and cerebellar defects.

The most frequent cause of mono genic ID   the fragile X syndrome  is due to the absence of the RNA binding protein (RBP) FMRP. Many other ID genes involved in RNA metabolism have been recentlyidenti ﬁed. About 5% (40/721) of the ID associated genes play a role in the post transcriptional regulation of gene expression by regulating mRNA splicing, nuclear export,degradation or translation into proteins. We describe here two novel ID genes involved in RNA metabolism. We identi ﬁed 4 de novo frameshift variants in NOVA2 in patients with Angelman like ID. This gene encodes a RBP implicated in alternative splicing of axon guidance genes. The 4 mutations cluster in a small interval suggesting adominant negative mechanism. This GC and repeat rich interval is poorly covered in most exomes, and the gene may have thus been missed in large scale projects, such asDDD. We show that the mutations lead to dysfunctional truncated proteins not able to regulate speci ﬁc splicing events like the NOVA2 wild type. The inactivation ofNOVA2 by siRNA in differentiated N2A cells causes an increase of neurons with multiple neurites. We identi ﬁed 4 de novo missense variants in DDX6 , encoding a protein implicated in mRNA degradation and regulation of translation initiation. These variants alter the interaction between DDX6 and its known partners and itsability to form P bodies. These two novel ID genes highlight the important role of RNA metabolism alterations in neurodevelopmental disorders. F. Mattioli: None. B. Isidor: None. C. Balak: None. M. Benard: None. E.

The 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region con  tains up to 10 genes and is associated with numerous conditions, including autism spectrum disorder (ASD),epilepsy, schizophrenia and intellectual disability; however, the mechanisms underlying their pathogenesis remain unknown. 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region impactsten genes and it is very complex to unravel the critical gene or genes that regulates the phenotype. Materials and Methods: We combined whole genome sequencing, human brain gene expression (proteome and transcriptome), and a mouse model with a syntenic heterozygous deletion (Df(h15q13)/ +mice) and determined that the microdeletion results in abnormal development of cortical dendritic spines and dendrite outgrowth. Large scale genetic data was integrated to ﬁnd out the most critical gene (s) within the 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome region. In addition, we have applied functional analysis in vivo and in vitro to identify phenotypes in mouse and human celllines. Results: Analysis of large scale genomic, transcriptomic and proteomic data identi ﬁedOTUD7A as a critical gene for brain function. OTUD7A expression was found to localize to dendritic and spine compartments in cortical neurons, and its reduced expression in Df(h15q13)/ +cortical neurons contributed to the dendritic spine and dendrite outgrowth deﬁcits. Conclusions: Our results reveal OTUD7A as a major regulatory gene for 15q13.3 microdeletion syndrome phenotypes that contribute to the disease mechanism through abnormal cortical neuron morphologicaldevelopment.

Human accelerated regions (HARs) repre  sent conserved genomic loci with elevated divergence in humans compared to other primate and non primate species.At least some HARs are thought to contribute to neurode  velopmental functions underlying the unique social and behavioral traits of humans. If some HARs regulate human speciﬁc social and behavioral traits, then mutations would likely impact cognitive and social disorders. Recent studies support the role of HARs in complex neurodevelopmentalfunctions and associated disorders including Autism Spec  trum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia. Strikingly, through large scale whole genome and targeted HAR omesequencing we ﬁnd, for the ﬁrst time, that rare noncoding mutations in neurally active HARs contribute to simplex, multiplex, and consanguineous ASD cases. These mutationshighlight more than 20 HARs with putative essential roles in neural development. Functional validation of candidate HARs and underlying mutations using chromatin interac tion sequencing, high throughput reporter assays, and transgenic mice allowed for further functional character  ization of inherited HAR mutations in active regulatoryelements for RBFOX1 ,CUX1, PTBP2, GPC4, CDKL5 , and other genes implicated in neural function, autism spectrum disorder, or both.

Clinically, AC manifests with ventricular arrhythmias, syncope, and sudden death. Among the known causative genes, those encoding for the desmosomal proteinsplakophilin 2 (PKP2), desmoplakin (DSP), and desmoglein  2 (DSG2) are most commonly mutated. Little is known about the molecular mechanism(s) behind AC wide phe notypic variability, although it seems that the causative mutations lead to both structural and epigenetic alterations . We aimed at studying the pathogenic effects of a nonsensemutation in desmoglein 2, both at the structural and epigenetic level. Methods and Results: We generated transgenic mice with cardiac speci ﬁc overexpression of the FLAG tagged human desmoglein 2 harboring the Q558* mutation. In Tg hQ mice, desmosome density and length were signi ﬁcantly decreased and Wnt/ β catenin signalling suppressed. RNA  Seq performed in Tg hQ hearts and non transgenic hearts revealed 24 miRNAs deregulated in transgenic animals. Further bioinformatic analyses for selected miRNAs suggested that miR 217 5p, miR 499 5p, and miR 708 5pmight be involved in AC pathogenesis. Conclusions: Downregulation of the Wnt/ β catenin signaling might be considered a common key event in ACpathogenesis. We identi ﬁed the miRNA signature in AC hearts, with miR 708 5p and miR 217 5p being the most upregulated and miR 499 5p the most downregulatedmiRNAs. All of them were predicted to be involved in the regulation of the Wnt/ β catenin pathway and might reveal the potential pathophysiology of AC, as well as beuseful as therapeutic targets for the disease.

We report genetic association analysis of three BP traits in >1 million people. Methods: We undertook a combination of a one  and two stage genome wide association study (GWAS) analysis to test ~7M single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) withminor allele frequency ≥1% for systolic and diastolic BP and pulse pressure. We combined the UK Biobank (UKB) cohort (N ,458,577) with the International Consortium for Blood Pressure GWAS (N ,299,024), totalling 757,601 individuals of European descent in the discovery. Data from the Millions Veterans Program and the Estonian Biobankwas used in the two stage design as replication samples (N,249,262). Results: We identi ﬁed 535 novel loci. We also conﬁrmed all 274 published loci and a further 92 loci that had been previously reported but not replicated. Conditional analysis revealed 163 additional independentsecondary variants, hence to talling over 1,000 indepen  dent signals at 901 loci. There is substantial gain in the percentage of BP variance explained by more than 2 fold.We also observed ~10mmHg higher systolic BP in UKB for the comparison between the upper and lower quintiles of the genetic risk score dis tribution. Bi oinformatics analyses identi ﬁed new potential therapeutic targets for hypertension. Conclusions: This is the largest ever BP GWAS that has tripled the number of BP loci to a total of 901, explaining 27% of the estimated heritability of BP. This study reveals many new insights into BP regulation and drug targetingillustrating the potential for improved cardiovascular disease prevention in the future. E. Evangelou: None. H. Warren: None.

We assessed WGS for hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in which prior cardi  omyopathy gene panel sequencing, or exome sequencing,did not establish a molecular diagnosis, i.e. gene elusive HCM, and as a ﬁrst line genetic test. Methods : WGS was performed on 46 gene elusive HCM probands, 16 family members, and 12 HCM probands with no prior genetic testing. We searched for coding region variants and genomic rearrangements in 184 cardiachypertrophy genes, deep intronic variants that alter RNA splicing, and mitochondrial genome variants. All splice  altering variants were validated using RNA extracted fromfresh venous blood, or cardiomyocytes derived from induced pluripotent stem cells, of the patients. Results : We found a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in 10 out of 46 (22%) gene elusive HCM families. Four families had deep intronic variants in MYBPC3 that activate splicing of pseudo exons; one family had asynonymous MYBPC3 variant shown to disrupt splicing; one family had mitochondrial genome variant; one family had a nonsynonymous MYH7 variant that was not genotyped during exome sequencing; and three families had variants in genes not included in prior cardiomyopathy gene panel testing. As a ﬁrst line genetic test, WGS identi ﬁed a pathogenic variant in 5 out of 12 (42%) families with no prior genetic testing. Conclusions : WGS identi ﬁed additional genetic causes of HCM over targeted gene sequencing approaches. Genetic screening of deep intronic regions identi ﬁed pathogenic variants in 9% of gene elusive HCM. These ﬁndings translate to more accurate diagnosis and management in HCM families. R.D.

Previously, we identi ﬁed RASA1 mutations in 50% of patients with CM AVM. Herein we studied non RASA1 patients to further elucidate the pathogenicity of CMs and AVMs. Methods : We conducted a genome wide linkage study on a CM AVM family. Whole exome sequencing was also performed on 9 unrelated CM AVM families. We identi ﬁed a candidate gene and screened it in a large series of patients. The in ﬂuence of several missense variants on protein function was also studied in vitro. Results : We found evidence for linkage in two loci. Whole exome sequencing data unraveled four distinct damaging variants in EPHB4 inﬁve families that co  segregated with CM AVM. Overall, screening of EPHB4 detected 47 distinct mutations in 54 index patients: 27 lead844 J. del Picchiato a premature stop codon or splice site alteration, suggesting loss of function. The other 20 are non  synonymous variants that result in amino acid substitutions. In vitro expression of several mutations con ﬁrmed loss of function of EPHB4. The clinical features included multi  focal CMs, telangiectasias, and AVMs. Conclusions : We found EPHB4 mutations in patients with multifocal CMs associated with AVMs. The pheno  type, CM AVM2, mimics RASA1  related CM AVM1 and also HHT. RASA1 encoded p120RASGAP is a direct effector of EPHB4. Our data highlights the pathogenetic importance of this interaction and indicts EPHB4 RAS ERK signaling pathway as a major cause for arterio venous malformations. N. Revencu: None. M. Amyere: None.

Prognosis is related to aortic risk of dissection. MFS clinical variability is notable, for ageof onset as well as severity and number of clinical mani  festations. To identify genetic modi ﬁers, we combined genome wide approaches in 1070 clinically well characterized FBN1 disease causing variant carriers: 1) an FBN1 eQTL analysis in 80 ﬁbroblasts of FBN1 stop variant carriers, 2) a linkage analysis and 3) a kinship matrix asso ciation study in 14 clinically concordant and discordant sib  pairs, 4) a genome wide association study and 5) a whole exome sequencing in 98 extreme phenotype samples. Threegenetic mechanisms of variability were found. A new gen  otype/phenotype correlation with an excess of loss of  cysteine variants (p ,0.004) in severely affected subjects. A second pathogenic event in another thoracic aortic aneurysm gene or the COL4A1 gene (involved in cerebral aneurysm) was found in 9 individuals. A polygenic modelinvolving at least 9 modi ﬁer loci (named gMod M1 9) was observed through cross mapping of results. Notably, gMod  M2 which co localizes with PRKG1 , in which activating variants have already been described in thoracic aortic aneurysm, and gMod M3 which co localized with a metal  loprotease (proteins of extra cellular matrix regulation)cluster. Our results represent a major advance in under  standing the complex genetic architecture of MFS and pro  vide the ﬁrst steps toward prediction of clinical evolution. M. Aubart: A.

AF is a major risk factor for stroke, heart failure and premature death. Materials and Methods: We performed whole exome sequencing on 24 families with at least three family members diagnosed with AF. To investigate the effect ofgenetic variants we investigated CRISPR/Cas9 modi ﬁed zebra ﬁsh carrying truncating variant of titin ( ttn.2). Results: Four titin truncating variants (TTNtv) were identi ﬁed. These variants co segregated perfectly with disease and were signi ﬁcantly enriched in patients with familial AF (P,1.76 x 10  6), as compared to the control group (n ,663). This association was replicated in an independent cohort of early onset lone AF patients (n ,399; Odd Ratio ,36.8; P , 4.13 x 10 6). We studied CRISPR/Cas9 modi ﬁed zebra ﬁsh carrying a titin truncating variant. Using confocal microscopi we observed compromised assembly of the sarcomere in the atria at the early larval stage in homozygous ﬁsh suggesting a predisposition for disease of the atria already in the early development of the heart. We investigated the adult heterozygous mutant hearts using Transmission electronmicroscopy. The heterozygous mutant hearts lacked structu  rally intact sarcomeres. The z discs appeared fuzzy and poorly organised, and the M line was missing from all thesarcomeres in both atria and ventricle. Mutant had signi ﬁ  cantly shorter sarcomere in atria (p < 0.001). Conclusions: These results indicate that TTNtv are important risk factors for AF that predispose for disease ([OR],36.8). CRISPR/Cas9 modi ﬁed zebra ﬁshheterozygous lacked intact sarcomeres. These analyses add a new dimension to the understanding of the molecular predisposition for AF. G. Ahlberg: None. L. Refsgaard: None. P.R. Lunde  gaard: None. L.S. Andreasen: None. M.F. Ranthe: None.

 Clinical experience with shallow whole genome sequencing as a detection method for Copy Number Variations,C19.1,"B. Menten, M. De Smet, L. Raman, T. Sante, N. Van Roy, A.",Dheedene,"Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent University Hospital, De Pintelaan 185, B 9000 Ghent, Belgium, Ghent, Belgium Genomic Copy Number Va riations (CNVs) are an important cause of several human genetic disorders. Genomic microarrays are currently widely implementedas the ﬁrst tier test for CNV detection. Although it has been proven that microarrays perform well for detecting submicroscopic CNVs, throughput is still rather limited,consumable cost is high, and resolution is ﬁxed depending on the probe density on the microarray. We replaced microarrays by shallow whole genome sequencing(sWGS) for the detection of submicroscopic CNVs in a diagnostic setting. Library pr eparation is largely auto  mated on a liquid handling robot and afterwards samplesare sequenced on a HiSeq3000 instrument by means of 50bp single end sequencing. Depending on the indication, resolution can be adjusted by altering the number ofsamples per lane and hence the amount of sequence reads per sample. More sequence reads enable a smaller window size and hence a higher resolution. Since July 2017 morethan 1000 clinical samples w ere processed including postnatal blood specimen, leukemic samples (ALL, CLL), tumors, products of conception (POCs) and prenatalsamples. The plummeting costs of sequencing and the ability to automation resu lts in a more cost effective work ﬂow and a higher throughput. CNVseq shows a higher ﬂexibility towards resolution and species under investigation. Moreover, we show that both duplications and deletions are more clearly de ﬁned, enabling a better identi ﬁcation of (low grade) mosaicism. In conclusion, we show that shallow whole genome sequencing is an846 J. del Picchiaappropriate alternative for genomic microarrays for the detection of clinically relevant copy number aberrations. B.

In a study pre  sented at the 2017 ESHG meeting, we found that variants ofother, technically challenging types comprise between 9 and 19% of the pathogenic variants harbored by patients, depending on clinical indication. These variants includelarge indels, single exon CNVs, variants in repetitive regions, etc. This study has since been expanded to include over 180,000 patients with diverse indications, and leads tosimilar conclusions. Methods: We developed a synthetic specimen containing 22 challenging pathogenic variants of diverse types in 7commonly tested genes. This specimen was sequenced using 10 different NGS work ﬂows by an international group of collaborating laboratories. These tests employed differentsequencing platforms, library methods, and bioinformatics pipelines. Results: With one exception, all of the relatively ""easy"" SNVs and indels were uniformly detected. However, only 10 of the 22 challenging variants were detected by all tests, and just 3 tests detected all 22. Many, but not all of theselimitations were bioinformatic in nature. Discussion: Evaluating the sensitivity of tests for complex variants can be dif ﬁcult. Recent guidelines [Roy et al. 2017] recommend that at least 59 variants of each type be used in validation, a number that is dif ﬁcult to achieve for complex variants given the scarcity of positive controls.Methods such as ours may help, and this speci ﬁc specimenis available to members of the ESHG community and is being expanded.

One advantage of WGS is its ability to test for a variety of variant types simultaneously. Germlinerepeat expansions cause over 20 neurological disorders that can be hard to differentiate clinically from each other and from disorders caused by other variant types. We presentdata on the use of pipeline to identify repeat expansionsAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 847from WGS that uses the ExpansionHunter bioinformatics tool. Materials and Methods: A pilot dataset comprising 4,833 genomes from rare disease patients was used to genotype repeats in 20 loci. Within this cohort, 414 experimental validation results (normal alleles) across 13loci were available to assess the STR size estimates. An additional cohort of 5,529 patient genomes was then analysed to identify pathogenic expansions. Results: ExpansionHunter computed precise and accurate estimates of 99.8% normal alleles tested across all the loci analysed. Further, we identi ﬁed 10 pathogenic expansions including FXS, ALS, HTT, SCA6 and SCA12 that were consistent with the patient phenotype. Of these, 6 were externally validated and the remaining are awaitingvalidation results. Conclusions: We describe an accurate pipeline to detect repeat expansions from WGS which is suitable for use inthe future NHS genomic medicine service. Additionally we will assess the performance ExpansionHunter at a range of expanded allele sizes though the analysis of 180 positivecontrols. K. Ibanez: None. E. Dolzhenko: None. K. R Smith: None. R.

However, most target enrichment methods are reliant upon some form of ampli ﬁcation which can nega  tively impact downstream analysis. For example, ampli ﬁ  cation removes epigenetic marks present in native DNA, including nucleotide methylation, which are hypothesizedto contribute to disease mechanisms in some disorders. In addition, some genomic regions known to be causative ofmany genetic disorders have extreme GC content and/or repetitive sequences that tend to be recalcitrant to faithful ampli ﬁcation. We have developed a novel, ampli ﬁcation free enrich  ment technique that employs the CRISPR/Cas9 system to target individual genes. This method, in conjunction withthe long reads, high consensus accuracy, and uniform coverage of SMRT Sequencing, allows accurate sequence analysis of complex genomic regions that cannot beinvestigated with other technologies. Using this strategy, we have successfully targeted a number of repeat expansion disorder loci ( HTT,FMR1 ,ATXN10 , C9orf72 ). With this data, we demonstrate the ability to isolate thousands of individual on target molecules and, using theSequel System, accurately sequence through long repeats regardless of the extreme GC content. The method is compatible with multiplexing of multiple target loci andmultiple samples in a single reaction. Furthermore, because there is no ampli ﬁcation step, this technique also preserves native DNA molecules for sequencing, allowing for thedirect detection and characterization of epigenetic signa  tures. To this end, we demonstrate the detection of 5 mC in the CGG repeat of the FMR1 gene that is responsible for Fragile X syndrome. J. Ekholm: A. Employment (full or part time); Signi ﬁcant; PacBio. E.

None  theless, these methods yield data that is incomplete, and fall short of detecting all clinically relevant genetic variantspresent in individual genomes. We anticipate that long read sequencing techniques may augment genetic diagnosis for a clinically well characterized patient population with intel lectual disability that we have studied over the years. Pre  viously analyses with CNV microarrays, WES (de Ligt, NEJM 2012) and by short read WGS (Gilissen, Nature2014) all failed to detect a causal variant. We performed long read SMRT sequencing in ﬁve such patient parent trios with coverages between 15 45 fold. Per individual genome we identify >22,000 SVs between 50bp 50kb in size. More than 65% of SVs are novel compared to high depth short read sequencing (IlluminaNovaSeq). Using the trio approach we are able to ﬁlter the 500 1,000 rare SVs per patient to ~40 SVs that have no parental read support; validations of the best 5 candidate de novo SVs per case are ongoing. The high coverage genomes even allow detection of SVs/indels in the 20 50bp range; per genome >25,000 of those are called per genome. Next to identifying novel SVs our data also con ﬁrm that long read sequencing data provide coverage in >20Mb previously uncovered genome regions. Additionally long read sequencing data facilitate phasing of de novo SNVs and compound heterozygous variants. In summary, long read sequencing identi ﬁes a signi ﬁcant number of previously hidden SVs. The de novo mutation rates as well as the clinical relevance of these previously hidden genetic variants can now be further explored. A. Hoischen: None. A.M. Wenger: A.

Even if the mutation is apparently de novo , there is a recurrence risk due to parental germ line mosaicism, depending on in which gonadal generation the mutation occurred. Materials and Methods: We demonstrate the power of using SMRT sequencing and ddPCR to determine parental origin and allele frequencies of de novo mutations in germ cells in two families whom had undergone assisted reproduction. Results: In the ﬁrst family, a TCOF1 variant c.3156C>T was identi ﬁed in the proband with Treacher Collins syndrome. The variant affects splicing and was determinedAbstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 849to be of paternal origin. It was present in <1% of the paternal germ cells, suggesting a very low recurrence risk. In the second family, the couple had undergone several unsuccessful pregnancies where a de novo mutation PTPN11 c.923A>C causing Noonan syndrome was identi  ﬁed. The variant was present in 40% of the paternal germ cells suggesting a high recurrence risk. Conclusions: Ourﬁndings highlight a successful strategy to identify the parental origin of mutations and toinvestigate the recurrence risk in couples that have under  gone assisted reproduction with an unknown donor or in couples with gonadal mosaicism that will undergo pre implantation genetic diagnosis.

We now identi ﬁedde novo missense variants clustering in the BTB domain encoding region ofRHOBTB2 in ten individuals with a developmental and epileptic encephalopathy, characterized by early onset epi  lepsy, severe intellectual disability, postnatal microcephaly,movement disorders and in several individuals by (post  ictal) hemiparesis and secondary MRI anomalies. RHOBTB2 interacts with a cullin dependent ubiquitinligase complex and thus regulates auto ubiquitination and recruits other substrates to the complex. Though direct interaction of mutant RHOBTB2 with CUL3 did not appearto be impaired by co immunoprecipitation, we observed increased levels of mutant RHOBTB2 compared to wild  type 24 hours after transfection of HEK293 cells. Abol ishing this effect by adding a proteasome inhibitor indicates decreased degradation of mutant RHOBTB2 in the protea  some, probably due to impaired ubiquitination. Similarly,elevated levels of the Drosophila ortholog RhoBTB in vivo were associated with seizure susceptibility and severe locomotor defects, while knockdown of RhoBTB resultedin no or only very mild phenotypes. Knockdown of RhoBTB in the Drosophila dendritic arborization neurons, however, resulted in a signi ﬁcantly decreased number of dendrites, thus suggesting a role of RhoBTB in dendritic development.

Using NGS we were able todescribe a new paediatric neurological disease caused by variants in NFE2L2 . NRF2, encoded by NFE2L2 , is themaster regulator of defense against stress. Somatic muta  tions of NFE2L2 leading to NRF2 accumulation promote drug resistance in cancer cells. Materials and Methods: We investigated a 9 year old boy with developmental delay, failure to thrive, immuno  deﬁciency and leukoencephalopathy. We applied Mende  liome patient parent sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform and ﬁltered for pathogenic variants. GeneMatcher was used to ﬁnd further patients. NFE2L2 variant was characterized using cell biology and biochemical approaches. As a therapy approach the ﬂavone luteolin was tested. Results: We identi ﬁedde novo mutations in NFE2L2 in four children and showed that cancer related mutations as inborn de novo mutations cause an early onset multisystem disorder with failure to thrive, immunode ﬁciency and neurological symptoms. NRF2 accumulation leads to widespread misregulation of gene expression and animbalance in cytosolic redox balance. Patients ’blood show increased activity of the NRF2 regulated enzymes G 6 P  dehydrogenase and glutathione reductase as well asdecreased homocysteine level. Treatment with luteolin leads to a reduction of the NRF2 level and decreased expression of NRF2 targets in ﬁbroblasts and an improve  ment of the course of disease in one patient. Conclusions: The unique combination of white matter lesions, hypohomocysteinaemia and increased G 6 P dehydrogenase activity will facilitate early diagnosis and therapeutic intervention of this novel disorder.

Type 2A Protein Phos  phatases (PP2A) are highly expressed in brain, and catalyzedephosphorylation of phospho Ser/Thr residues in diverse substrates. Structurally, PP2A holoenzymes comprise a catalytic C, a scaffolding A, and a regulatory B type sub unit, which determines substrate speci ﬁcity and physiolo  gical function. Recently, de novo mutations in genes encoding subunits A αand B56 δ, and less frequently, B56 β and B56 γ, have been implicated in intellectual disability/ developmental delay (ID/DD). Now, we describe 12 indi  viduals with a de novo mutation in PPP2CA , encoding the catalytic C αsubunit, phenotypically characterized by mild to severe ID/DD, behavioral problems, variable types of epilepsy, hypotonia and brain abnormalities. PPP2CA mutations consist of a partial deletion, a frame shift, three nonsense (Gln125*, Arg214*, Arg295*), one single amino acid duplication, four non recurrent and one recurrentmissense mutation (His191Arg). Functional studies showed complete null alleles in the former four cases, hinting towards a haploinsuf ﬁciency mechanism. In the eight other cases, functional characterization of the mutants showed mutation speci ﬁc biochemical distortions, includingdecreased binding to the A subunit and/or speci ﬁc B type subunits, as well as mildly to severely impaired phosphatase activity. Several mutants showed increased binding to the B”’/STRN subunits, an observation previously also made for ID associated A αmutants. Thus, in the latter eight cases, a dominant mechanism could not be excluded. Weconclude that PP2A biogenesis and activity are severely compromised in individuals with ID/DD carrying de novo PPP2CA mutations, further underscoring the importance of PP2A dysfunction in genetic brain disorders.

Here, we describe an instructive and unique example of a neurodegenerative disorder associated to both coding and noncoding CNVs at the LMNB1 locus. Auto  somal Dominant adult onset demyelinating LeukoDystro  phy (ADLD) is a fatal disorder affecting myelin in the central nervous system. ADLD is due to LMNB 1 gene duplication, causing its overexpression at mRNA and pro  tein levels. We have collected four patients with clinical and MRI ﬁndings suggestive of ADLD, without LMNB1 duplication. Using array CGH, we have identi ﬁed four different overlapping deletions located upstream LMNB1 . The minimal deleted region was 167 kb and span thephysiological enhancer of the LMNB1 gene already char  acterized by our group. Furthermore, it eliminates a TAD boundary, allowing foreign interactions between theLMNB1 promoter and four brain speci ﬁc enhancers. We demonstrated LMNB1 overexpression in ﬁbroblasts, and in a postmortem brain sample. In conclusion, ADLD is causedby LMNB1 overexpression due to the duplication of the gene or to the alteration of the LMNB1 regulatory land  scape. This latter represents an emerging pathogenicmechanism that should be taken into account in clinical practice. E. Giorgio: None. M. Spielmann: None. B.C. Nmezi: None. G. Vaula: None. A. Lehman: None.

Regenerative gene based medicines aim to cure disease at the molecularlevel using innovative gene editing technologies, such as CRiSPR/Cas9 technology. Recent studies have shown the efﬁcacy of adeno associated virus (AAV) vectors which transport guide RNAs (sgRNA) and Cas9 in restoring the expression of altered proteins. Recent works have shownthat AAV9 serotype is an ef ﬁcient vector to preferentially target neuronal cells in vivo by intravenous injection. We have recently generated iPSC derived neurons from FOXG1  mutated patients, paving the way to testing perso  nalized therapeutic approaches in disease relevant cells. We have engineered a two plasmid system to correct speci ﬁc FOXG1 mutations, namely c.460dupG   p.Glu154Gly fs*300 and c.688C>T   p.Arg230Cys. The ﬁrst construct brings mutation speci ﬁc sgRNA and donor DNA and an mCherry/GFP reporter system. The second construct har  bours a self cleaving spCas9 able to inactivate itself after cleavage, avoiding off target cuts. The two plasmids havebeen encapsidated into AAV9. The ef ﬁciency of the AAV system has been tested in multiple cell types in vitro, indicating that AAV9 has indeed the highest infectionefﬁciency in neurons and ﬁbroblasts while for iPSCs and neuronal precursor cells AAV2 is more ef ﬁcient. The ef ﬁ  cacy of sequence correction has been tested by Next Gen eration Sequencing (NGS) analysis. Our proposed AAV9  CRISPR/Cas9 strategy can provide the proof of principle of the feasibility of a gene therapy strategy, opening up thepossibility of in vivo clinical trials for patients affected by the congenital variant of Rett syndrome.

The identi ﬁcation of pathogenic genetic variants in DEEs remains crucial for deciphering this complex group and for accurately caring affected patients. Using trio whole exome sequencing, we ﬁrst identi ﬁed a heterozygous missense variant in PACS2 in two unrelated patients with DEE and facial dysmorphism. National and international data sharing allowed us t o identify a recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense variant (p.Glu209Lys) in 12 other unrelated patients. All patients, aged 16 months to 16 years, presented infanti le epilepsy starting on the ﬁrst days or weeks of life and an overall developmental delay or ID with or without behavioral disorders, common cer  ebellar dysgenesis and facial dysmorphism. PACS2 encodes a multifunc tional sorting protein involved in nuclear gene expression and pathway traf ﬁc regulation. PACS2 depletion alters gene expression and causes mito chondria fragmentation, mito chondria uncoupling from the endoplasmic reticulum and disturbs cell metabolism and blocks apoptotic programs. PACS2 is an important paralog ofPACS1 t h a th a sb e e np r e v i o u s l yr e p o r t e di np a t i e n t s with intellectual disability, f acial morphological features and/or epilepsy. Both proteins harbor cargo(furin) bindingregions (FBRs) that bind cargo proteins, sorting adaptors and cellular kinase. Functiona l studies demonstrated thatthePACS2 recurrent variant red uces the ability of the predicted autoregulatory domain to modulate the interac  tion between the PACS2 FBR and client proteins, which may disturb cellular function. These ﬁndings support the causality of this recurrent de novo PACS2 heterozygous missense in DEEs with facial dysmorphim and cerebellardysgenesis. N. Jean Marçais: None. H.E. Olson: None. E.

 Detection of widespread horizontal pleiotropy in causal relationships inferred from Mendelian randomization between complex traits and diseases,C21.1,"M. Verbanck1, C. Chen2, B. Neale2, D. Ron1","1The Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine,","Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY, United States,2Analytic and Translational Genetics Unit, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA, United States Introduction: Mendelian randomization (MR) is an approach to infer causality of an exposure with an outcome. An assumption in MR is that the variant used as the instrumental variable acts on the outcome exclusivelythrough the exposure. Horizontal pleiotropy occurs when the variant has an effect on the outcome outside of the pathway of the exposure. Horizontal pleiotropy can causebias in the causal estimate in MR. Studies have shown that variants identi ﬁed from genome wide association studies are associated with multiple traits and that pleiotropy maybe common. However, the extent to which horizontal pleiotropy affects MR is unknown.854 J. del PicchiaMaterials and Methods: We have evaluated the role of horizontal pleiotropy in MR. Speci ﬁcally, we developed a method to detect and correct for horizontal pleiotropic outliers, called the Mendelian Randomization Pleiotropy RESidual Sum and Outlier (MR PRESSO) test. Results: After applying MR PRESSO to pairwise comparisons of 82 complex traits and diseases, we observed signiﬁcant horizontal pleiotropy in 922 (22%) of 4,250 MR tests in total. Amongst causal relationships, we observedthat signi ﬁcant pleiotropic outliers distorted causal estimates in MR between 168% and 189% on average. Finally, we observed that horizontal pleiotropy in MR can be correctedin some but not in all instances. Conclusions: These ﬁndings suggest that horizontal pleiotropy is pervasive and should be carefully consideredin order to maintain the validity of MR.

" Mendelian randomization combining GWAS and eQTL data reveals new loci, extensive pleiotropy and geneticdeterminants of complex and clinical traits",C21.2,"E. Porcu1,2, S.

To address this challenge, we propose a summary statistics based Mendelian Randomization (MR) approach that uses multiple SNPs jointly as instruments and multiple gene expression traits as simultaneous exposures. Such anapproach should be more robust to violations of MR assumptions than state of the art tools (GSMR, TWAS).When applied to 43 human phenotypes it uncovered 3,233 putative genes causally associated with at least one phe  notype resulting in 8,388 gene trait associations; of note 5,982 of these loci were missed by GWAS. For example, expression of CRIPT , previously associated with a Men  delian syndrome with short stature (OMIM:615789), iscausally associated with height in the general population. Similarly, expression of the RIDDLE syndrome associated RNF168 (OMIM:611943) correlates with educational attainment. Our analysis found 58% (1,866/3,233) of genes having pleiotropic causal effect, impacting up to 20 traits. Notably, ANKRD55 showed directionally consistent causal effect on rheumatoid arthritis, Crohn ’s disease and in ﬂam  matory bowel disease. Using eQTLs from multiple tissues (GTEx) revealed numerous tissue speci ﬁc causal effects, often driven by differences in gene expression. In line with previous ﬁndings, LDL level is driven speci ﬁcally by SORT1 liver expression.Our method identi ﬁes loci missed by conventional GWAS and pinpoints likely functionally relevant disease genes in known regions. Our ﬁndings unravel tissue speci ﬁc, causal gene expression networks shared among a range of phenotypes. They shed light onto key biological mechanisms underlying complex clinically important traits.

 Equivalence of LD score regression and individual level data methods,C21.3,"R. de Vlaming1, M. Johannesson2, P. K. E. Magnusson3,M .A .","Ikram4, P. M. Visscher5","1Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2Stockholm School of Economics, Stockholm, Sweden, 3Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden,4Erasmus University Medical Center, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 5University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia LD score (LDSC) regression disentangles the contribution of polygenic signal, in terms of SNP based heritability, andpopulation strati ﬁcation, in terms of a so called intercept, to GWAS test statistics. Whereas LDSC regression uses summary statistics, methods like Haseman Elston (HE)regression and genomic relatedness matrix (GRM) restric  ted maximum likelihood infer parameters such as SNP  based heritability from individual level data directly.Therefore, these two types of methods are typically con  sidered to be profoundly different. Nevertheless, recent work has revealed that LDSC and HE regression yield near identical SNP based heritability estimates when confound  ing strati ﬁcation is absent. We now extend the equivalence;Abstracts from the 51stEuropean Society of Human Genetics Conference: Oral. . . 855under the strati ﬁcation assumed by LDSC regression, we show that the intercept can be estimated from individual  level data by transforming the coef ﬁcients of a regression of the phenotype on the leading principal components from the GRM. Using simulations, considering various degrees and forms of population strati ﬁcation, we ﬁnd that intercept estimates obtained from individual level data are nearly equivalent to estimates from LDSC regression ( R2> 99%). An empirical application corroborates these ﬁndings. Hence, LDSC regression is not profoundly different from methods using individual level data; parameters that are identi ﬁed by LDSC regression are also identi ﬁed by meth  ods using individual level data. In addition, our results indicate that, under strong strati ﬁcation, there is mis  attribution of strati ﬁcation to the slope of LDSC regression, inﬂating estimates of SNP based heritability from LDSC regression ceteris paribus . Hence, the intercept is not a panacea for population strati ﬁcation. Consequently, LDSC  regression estimates should be interpreted with caution, especially when the intercept estimate is signi ﬁcantly greater than one. R. de Vlaming: None. M. Johannesson: None.

 Regional heritability analysis of complex traits usinghaplotype blocks de ﬁned by natural recombination boundaries,C21.4,"R. F. Oppong1, P. Navarro2, C. S. Haley2,3, S. Knott1","1IEB, SBS, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United","Kingdom,2MRC IGMM, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom,3The Roslin Institute and Royal (Dick) School of Veterinary Studies, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh,United Kingdom We describe a genome wide analytical approach that draws its theoretical basis from a variant of the GREML approach that uses both local and genome wide relationship matrices to provide regional estimates of the heritability acrosslocally de ﬁned regions in the genome. The novelty in this approach is that it utilises a relationship matrix that is based on local haplotype blocks de ﬁned by recombination boundaries in the genome. Compared with single SNPs, use of haplotypes provides a better strategy for capturing the true genomic relationship amongst individuals in the pre sence of rare variants and thus provides real bene ﬁt over single SNPs in recovering much of the hidden heritability and identifying novel gene variants. We hypothesize thatthis approach will complement existing GWAS analytical approaches by capturing regions in the genome contributingto the phenotypic variation that existing GWAS methods fail to capture. We implemented this approach on simulated data and explored it in some detail, with results from the simulation study supporting our hypothesis. We further demonstrate that there are real bene ﬁts to be gained from this approach by applying it to real data from circa 20,000individuals from the Generation Scotland: Scottish Family Health Study. We analysed height and major depressive disorder (MDD). We identi ﬁed four novel regions (p value between 3.75E 05 and 3.605E 06) and 32 novel regions (p  value between 4.92E 05 and 7.5E 07) harbouring a total of 64 and 1156 SNPs for height and MDD respectively. Thisapproach, therefore, offers an opportunity to capture novel genetic variants in complex traits. R.F. Oppong: None. P. Navarro: None. C.S. Haley: None. S. Knott: None.",2018

The majority of ﬁndings to date stem from genome wide association studies conducted in cosmopolitan Europeanpopulations. It is not clear whether the genetic architecture of lipids differs across populations. We used imputed genotypes from genome wide arrays and measures of high (HDL), low density lipoprotein  cholesterol (LDL) and triglycerides from UKHLS (N , 9,961), two isolated Greek populations from the HELICstudy (N ,1,641 and N ,1,945), Ugandan samples from the APCDR study (N ,4,778). We tested associations of established lipid associated SNPs identi ﬁed through Eur  opean samples and of polygenic scores based on these variants using linear mixed models. Few of the 140 loci displayed nominally signi ﬁcant associations with their target biomarker in the Greek and Ugandan samples. The polygenic scores were associated856 J. del Picchiawith highly consistent effects across the European popula  tions (p < 3 x 10 4in each case). For the Ugandan cohort, there were signi ﬁcant associations of the HDL (beta , 0.153 per SD, 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]:0.125 0.182, p ,4x1 0 26) and LDL scores (beta ,0.133, 95%CI:0.105  0.161, p ,4x1 0 20) with slightly attenuated effect sizes compared to the UK samples (beta ,0.216, 95%CI:0.197  0.235, p ,2x1 0 102and beta ,0.177, 95%CI:0.157 0.196, p,5x1 0 69, respectively). There was no evidence of association for the triglyceride score in the Ugandan samples (beta , 0.022, 95%CI: 0.050 0.007, p ,0.14).

Previous work has evaluated their impact (in terms of their total length, number of affected genes) on human health. This however fails to account forpotential interactions between deleterious variants. To estimate possible epistatic mechanisms we followed twoapproaches using our annotation of 33,000 heterozygous deletions in a cohort of 350,000 unrelated genetically British individuals from the UK Biobank. First, we analyzed all pairwise combinations of deletions and observed that some deletion pairs were identi ﬁed in the same genome signi ﬁcantly less than expected by chance. We observed that deletions that often co occur are signiﬁcantly shorter than those who co occur rarely. Our results suggest antagonistic epistasis between long dele tions, with each additional variant decreasing ﬁtness more drastically than the previous one. Second, assuming that decreased expression of a gene is an important consequence of a deletion, we expect to see more Gain of Expression (GOE) single nucleotide regula  tory alleles in hemizygous deletion carriers, with potentialcompensatory effect to partially recover the gene expression level. Indeed, we observe a signi ﬁcant increase in frequency of GOE alleles (de ﬁned as cis eQTLs in GTEx) in deletion carriers versus euploid controls, supporting our hypothesis that cases with non compensated deleterious variants have increased probability to be selected out . Altogether our results revealed abundant epistatic inter  actions both between different deletions and between deletions and single nucleotide regulatory variants, thedetermination of which will be important to reliably assess the human mutation load in the personalized health era.

This condition affects ~1:4000individuals worldwide and is highly clinically and geneti  cally heterogeneous, presenting with variable symptoms and inheritance patterns. We identi ﬁed a homozygous missense alteration (c.75C>A, p.D25E) in the CLCC1 gene, which encodes a presumptive intracellular chloride channel highly expressed in the retina, associated with autosomalrecessive RP in eight consanguineous families from Pakis  tani and the UK.

A Loss of GPNMB causes autosomal recessive amyloidosiscutis dyschromica in humans,P04.05,"C. Yang1, S. Lin2,3, C. Chiang4,5,Y .W u2,3, W. H'ng1, C. Chang1,","Y.

Families and sporadic cases have been reported predominantly in East andSoutheast Asian ethnicities; however, the genetic cause has not been elucidated. Homozygous premature nonsense mutations leading to loss of function of GPNMB contributeto the iris pigment dispersion phenotype in mouse pig  mentary glaucoma. However, no mutations in GPNMB have been identi ﬁed in human pigmentary glaucoma and pigment dispersion syndrome. We establish that the compound het  erozygosity or homozygosity of GPNMB truncating alleles is the cause of autosomal recessive ACD. Six nonsense orframeshift mutations were identi ﬁed in nine individuals diagnosed with ACD. Immuno ﬂuorescence analysis of skin biopsies showed that GPNMB is expressed in all epidermalcells, with the highest staining observed in melanocytes. GPNMB staining is signi ﬁcantly reduced in the lesional skin of affected individuals. Hyperpigmented lesionsexhibited signi ﬁcantly increased amounts of DNA/keratin  positive amyloid deposits in the papillary dermis and in ﬁl  trating macrophages compared with hypo /depigementedmacules. Depigmentation of the lesions was attributable to loss of melanocytes. Intracytoplamic ﬁbrillary aggregates were observed in keratinocytes scattered in the lesionalepidermis. Thus, our analysis indicates that loss of GPNMB, which has been implicated in melanosome858 J. del Picchiaformation, autophagy, phagocytosis, tissue repair, and negative regulation of in ﬂammation, underlies autosomal recessive ACD, and provides insights into the etiology of amyloidosis and pigment dyschromia.

D Substrate reduction therapy approach for San ﬁlippo C syndrome: use of iPSC and iPSC derived neurons from patients as cellular models,P06.64,"N. Benetó1, E. Creus Bachiller1, M.

It is characterized by a severe and progressive neurode  generation for which no effective treatment exists. Previously, we demonstrated the usefulness of siRNAs targeting EXTL2 genes (involved in HS synthesis) as an effective short term substrate reduction therapy (SRT), onSanﬁlippo C patients ’ﬁbroblasts. Now, we use different lentiviral vectors encoding shRNAs targeting EXTL2 to analyse their long term effect. We observe a clear reductioninEXTL2 mRNA levels sixty days after transduction and an evident decrease of the HS amounts. Due to the good results obtained, now we are using neurons derived from patients ’induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) as a cellular model. We are using an established protocol to differentiate those iPSC into neurons within aweek. Neurons show mature signatures and functional properties after one month. This technique will provide new insights in the usefulness of this treatment in the mainaffected cell type. To evaluate this therapeutic option, we are analysing the neurons, focusing on aspects such as the inhibition of the EXTL2 gene at the mRNA level or the accumulation of HS over time by immunocytochemistry. Our preliminary results in patients ’ﬁbroblasts indicate that shRNAs could be a long term SRT and open a door forthe development of a promising therapeutic approach for Sanﬁlippo C syndrome.

Due to the genotype variability of IMDs and the upcoming of personalized medicine has prompted theemergence of developing new models. The aim of this work was the generation of a hepatic model of methylmalonic aciduria cblB type by hepatocyte differentiation of inducedpluripotent stem cells (IPSCs) generated by reprogramming of patient derived ﬁbroblasts. This organic aciduria is caused by the de ﬁciency of ATP: cob(I)alamin adenosyl  transferase (ATR) encoded by the MMAB gene. Fibroblasts from a patient bearing a hypomorphic destabilizing muta  tion in this gene (p.Ile96Thr) were reprogrammed using acommercial kit based on Sendai virus vectors. After the molecular and functional characterization of the iPSC line, these cells were differentiated in vitro into de ﬁnitive endoderm and then incubated with speci ﬁc factors, aimed at hepatocyte differentiation. IPSC derived hepatocytes expressed relevant hepatic markers analyzed by immuno ﬂuorescence. Finally, the hepatocytes generated were used for evaluation of potential pharmacological chaperones previously described (N {[(4 chlorophenyl)carbamothioyl]amino] 2 phenylacetamide and 4 (4 (4  ﬂuorophenyl) 5  methyl 1H pyrazol 3 yl)benzene 1,3 diol)) in combination with hydroxocobalamin, providing evidences of its positiveeffect on the activity of the mutant ATR hepatocytes. Hence, our ﬁndings provide an experimental suitable model for the investigation of the hepatotoxicity of new drugs andthe pathogenesis of this severe disease serving also as ex vivo platform for organoids generation and therapeutic applications.

Defects in thestability of mitoribosomal proteins or mitoribosome assembly impair mitochondrial protein translation, causing combined OXPHOS enzyme de ﬁciency and clinical dis  ease. Here we report four autosomal recessive pathogenic mutations in the gene encoding the small mitoribosomal subunit protein, MRPS34, in six subjects from four unre lated families with Leigh syndrome and combined OXPHOS defects. Whole exome sequencing was used to independently identify all variants. Two splice site muta tions were identi ﬁed, including homozygous c.321 +1G>T in a subject of Italian ancestry and homozygous c.322  10G>A in affected sibling pairs from two unrelated familiesof Puerto Rican descent. In addition, compound hetero  zygous MRPS34 mutations were identi ﬁed in a proband of French ancestry; a missense (c.37G>A [p.Glu13Lys]) and anonsense (c.94C>T [p.Gln32*]) variant. We demonstrated that these mutations reduce MRPS34 protein levels and the synthesis of OXPHOS subunits encoded by mtDNA.Examination of the mitoribosome pro ﬁle and quantitative proteomics showed that the mitochondrial translation defect was caused by destabilization of the small mitoribosomalsubunit and impaired monosome assembly. Lentiviral  mediated expression of wild type MRPS34 rescued the defect in mitochondrial translation observed in skin ﬁbro  blasts from affected subjects, con ﬁrming the pathogenicity of MRPS34 mutations. Our data establish that MRPS34 is required for normal function of the mitoribosome in humansand furthermore demonstrate the power of quantitative proteomic analysis to identify signatures of defects in spe  ciﬁc cellular pathways in ﬁbroblasts from subjects with inherited disease.

Complex I deﬁciency is the most common biochemical diagnosis, particularly prevalent in paediatric patients. Mitochondrial disease is caused by mutations affecting the mitochon  drion ’s own genome (mtDNA) or one of the ~1150 nuclear  encoded mitoproteome components. The limited genotype: phenotype correlation in mitochondrial disease means next  generation sequencing methodologies are critical for therapid genetic diagnosis of patients.Materials and Methods Whole exome and targeted next  generation sequencing was performed for three subjects with suspected mitochondrial disease. Functional evaluation of identi ﬁed variants was undertaken using subject ﬁbroblasts and/or muscle biopsy, including cDNA studies, complexome pro ﬁling, complementation studies and assess  ment of steady state levels. Results We describe three unrelated individuals who harbour biallelic variants in NDUFAF8 , a recently identi ﬁed ancillary factor required for assembly of the complex I holoenzyme. We provide functional evidence to support the pathogenicity of these NDUFAF8 variants and unequivo  cally establish this gene as a cause of complex I de ﬁciency in association with an exclusively Leigh like clinical presentation. Conclusions Functional experimentation including com  plementation studies and complexome pro ﬁling of subject cell lines establishes NDUFAF8 as the twelfth complex I assembly factor associated with human disease and validates the importance of orphan gene characterisation.

Here, we systematically dissected the functional networks associatedwith 16p11.2 RGD from transcriptome analyses of 70 mice with reciprocal CNV of the syntenic 7qF3 region across cortex, striatum, and cerebellum, as well as liver, white andbrown adipose tissues in a subset of 16 mice (n ,250 samples). We integrated these data with brain tissues from a Kctd13 mouse model (a putative driver of 16p11.2 neu  roanatomical phenotypes, n ,50), and CRISPR engi  neered, isogenic 16p11.2 iPSC derived NSCs (n ,25) and induced neurons (n ,27). The strongest magnitude of effect sizes from 7qF3 were observed across brain regions by comparison to non brain tissues (cortex 7qF3 region aver  age p value ,8.80E 35; non brain p ,0.0013), re ﬂecting the ~3x higher basal expression changes. Coexpression network analyses isolated a consistent module of 16p11.2 genes, as well as a module that was highly enriched forconstrained genes (ExAC pLI ≥0.9), autism associated genes, early fetal development coexpression networks derived from BrainSpan, and neurological phenotypes andprocesses. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were enriched in this ‘constrained ’module network; moreover, DEGs from the Kctd13 mouse coalesced into this samemodule (cortex enrichment p ,7.82E 41), suggesting overlap in altered transcriptional networks between full length CNV and deletion of KCTD13 alone. These analysesidentify a tissue speci ﬁc impact of 16p11.2 RGD that converges on a module of co expressed genes that are intolerant to genetic perturbation and associated with criticalprocesses in human neurodevelopment.

The homeobox protein NKX6 2 is a transcription factor regulating multiple developmental processes with a main role in oligoden drocyte differentiation and regulation of myelin speci ﬁc gene expression. Materials and Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) and homozygosity mapping of selected patients from three unrelated families was undertaken. The variants identi ﬁed were validated by Sanger sequencing and cosegregation analysis. Results: Five affected subjects (three unrelated families) were documented to share biallelic inactivating mutationsaffecting the NKX6 2 homeobox domain. A trio based whole exome sequencing analysis in the ﬁrst family detected a homozygous frameshift change [c.606delinsTA;p.(Lys202Asnfs*?)]. In the second family, homozygosity mapping coupled to whole exome sequencing identi ﬁed a homozygous nucleotide substitution (c.565G>T) introdu cing a premature stop codon (p.Glu189*). In the third family, whole exome sequencing established compound heterozygosity for a non conservative missense changeaffecting a key residue participating in DNA binding (c.599G>A; p.Arg200Gln) and a nonsense substitution (c.589C>T; p.Gln197*), in both affected siblings. Theclinical presentation was homogeneous, with four subjects having severe motor delays, nystagmus and absent head control, and one individual showing gross motor delay atthe age of 6 months. All exhibited neuroimaging that was consistent with hypomyelination. Conclusions: Theﬁnding of individuals with a severe neurodevelopemental phenotype with hypomyelination associated with biallelic mutations in NKX6 2 provides direct evidence of the relevant role of NKX6 2 in CNSdevelopment in humans.

Genetic bases are prominent riskfactors for both disorders. Among others, loss of function mutations in CHD8 gene represents a recurrent risk factor for ASD, while CHD2 is more frequently mutated in epi  lepsy. Thus, the sole reduction in CHD8 orCHD2 expres  sion is able to cause cellular and molecular phenotypes that are key hallmarks to follow and rescue in assessing newtherapeutic approaches. Particularly, we aim to test SINEUPs, a novel class of synthetic antisense long non coding RNAs   able to increasethe translation of target proteins to physiological level without affecting transcription   to rescue the phenotypes caused by CHD8 orCHD2 haploinsuf ﬁciency. Since the activity of SINEUP depends on two domains, an effector domain required for translation enhancement and a binding domain conferring target speci ﬁcity, we designed SINEUP molecules able to recognize the initial and internal methionines of CHD8 and CHD2 proteins. We then proceeded to test the ef ﬁcacy of different SINEUPs on neural progenitors. From our preliminary observations, SINEUPs targeting internal methionines are more ef ﬁcient in stimulating CHD8 and CHD2 protein production, thusrepresenting a valid target to be further tested in patients ’ derived cell lines and in zebra ﬁsh, an in vivo model of the disorders. In conclusion, our studies represents the ﬁrst step towards the development of new types of RNA based therapy, with implications for a large repertory of presently incurablegenetic diseases.F.

Theamphibian Xenopus tropicalis is extremely well positioned for this approach. It shares with zebra ﬁsh the aquatic habitat and easy manipulations associated with its external devel opment. However, it manifests unique features making it a powerful organism for modeling human genetic disease. (1) unlike zebra ﬁsh,Xenopus tropicalis has a true diploid genome, precluding redundancy. (2) Its genome shows high synteny with humans, greatly facilitating identi ﬁcation of disease orthologs. (3) Gene manipulations can be restrictedto speci ﬁc tissues and organs via targeted blastomere injection. We have recently generated the ﬁrst genetic cancer models in Xenopus tropicalis . Via mosaic targeting of the tumor suppressor gene apcwe generated tadpoles that rapidly (< 1.5 months) and ef ﬁciently (>90%) developed a range of neoplasia characteristic for Familial AdenomatousPolyposis (Van Nieuwenhuysen et al., Oncoscience 2015). Similarly, we found that rb1/rbl1 double mosaic mutant tadpoles rapidly develop retinoblastoma (Naert et al. Sci.Rep. 2016). More recent work also indicates the possibility of modeling Li Fraumeni, T cell acute lymphoblastic leu  kemia and pancreatic neuroendocrine cancer. The rapidkinetics of tumor development in Xenopus pave the way for their use as pre clinical model, providing unique possibi  lities for fast identi ﬁcation of modi ﬁer genes and novel drug targets.

Material and Methods: We evaluated outputs of struc  tured oncogenetics and high risk consultations in 111 individuals from 7 HDGC families by consulting clinical/ﬁnancial records, and assessed its psycho social impact by applying an emotional distress scale (HADS) to 70/111 individuals. Results: From 2011 2016, we screened 111 individuals, from which 53% tested negative (n ,58;30M:28F) and were discharged from follow up each costing 200 €to the Hospital. 47% (n ,53;26M:27F) tested positive. From 7 probands, 2 were diagnosed with LBC and remain alive after curative surgery, while 5 diagnosed with DGC aredeceased. The hospital expenses with probands range from 30 50K €independently of cancer type. Costs with carriers opting for prophylactic approaches range from 4 8K € (higher cost/females), except if disease is identi ﬁed after theﬁrst high risk consultation, raising the cost to 27K €but life saving. Those opting for surveillance, cost ~1K€/patient. Concerning psychologic impact, carriers demon  strate higher levels of distress than non carriers.Conclusion: Structured healthcare in HDGC economic  ally bene ﬁts NHS, is life saving for carriers, reassuring non  carriers.

"A Raw Genomic Data: Storage, Access and Sharing",P20.05,"M. Shabani, D. Vears, P. Borry","KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome sequencing (WES) for diagnostic and research purposesgenerate a large volume of raw data. Previous ethical and legal discussions concerning genomic data management have mainly focused on concerns related to interpreta tion of the results and the return of both primary and secondary ﬁndings from these tests. Yet to date, issues related to the storage and re turn of primary sequencing data (such as bam (Binary Alignment) or fastq ﬁles (unaligned reads)) that all ow both the regeneration of primary results and the reanalysis of data have receivedfar less attention, particularly in the clinical setting. This is despite the huge potential f or long term data storage to lead to future data re analy sis and reinterpretation in light of new evidence. In this paper, we critically appraise three main issues, namely, data storage policies and practices of clinical laboratories, patients ’access to raw data, and sharing of raw data by individuals. We argue that there is a need for well established and transparent raw genomic dat a retention and returning policies in order to enable patients to practice their rights to access raw genomic data . In addition, pr ofessional communities could guide laboratories in adoptingbest practices for the storage and return of raw data, and introduce uniformity to these practices. As WES and WGS become more embedded in diagnostics, it istimely to consider how current data storage policies align with patients ’rights and interests to access raw data, and how these rights can be managed in the clinicalsetting.

Deep convolutional neural networks such as DeepGestalt in Face2Gene have been trained on thousands of patient photos with con ﬁrmed molecular diagnoses and learned phenotype representations of multiple disorders. These systems of arti ﬁcial intelligence support clinicians in the diagnostic workup of patients andeven excel human experts in certain classi ﬁcation tasks. We therefore wondered whether this unprecedented sensitivity to detect mutation speci ﬁc patterns in the facial gestalt could also be used to reveal information about gene function. Materials and Methods: We designed the knowledge base Deep Phenotyping for Deep Learning (DPDL) as a public resource to compile similarity scores from NGP tools and performed a cluster analysis on currently 1216 caseswith monogenic disorders. Results: A prominent cluster was formed by BRAF, PTPN11, NRAS and other genes of the MAPKinasepathway that result in phenotypes such as Noonan, LEOPARD or cardiofaciocutaneous syndrome and which are considered similar. Likewise, many genes linked toinborn errors of metabolism also clustered, mirroring a higher level feature that is referred to by clinicians as ‘coarse facies ’. Furthermore, we also found genes involved in chromatin remodeling to be near neighbors, even if no superordinate joint feature exists in medical terminology to describe the associated diseases. Conclusions: We were able to reproduce molecular interactions by information encoded in the facial gestalt by using NGP tools. Thus, the phenotype space exploration isa promising subject in the characterization of gene function. T. Hsieh: None. N. Hajjir: None. J.T. Pantel: None. M. Mensah: None. M. Zhao: None. J.

Gasparini1,2, G. Girotto1,2","1University of Trieste, Trieste, Italy,2IRCCS Burlo Garofolo, Trieste, Italy Introduction To shed light on the genetics of ARHL (the most common sensory disorder in the elderly) we analysed a large cohort of patients and developed a series of animal models. Methods 46 genes, selected on the basis of GWAS, animal models and literature updates, were analysed in 464 ARHL patients. After data ﬁltering, the most promising results were validated by either “in vitro ”or“in vivo ” studies.Results We identi ﬁedSLC9A3R1 as a new ARHL gene. An ultra rare (MAF: 7,70E 05) missense variant was detected in 2 unrelated male patients showing severe to profound high frequency hearing loss. The variant, pre  dicted as damaging, was not present in 1071 matched controls and protein modelling con ﬁrmed its pathogenic effect on protein ’s structure. In situ hybridization showed Slc9a3r1 expression in zebra ﬁsh inner ear. A zebra ﬁsh KI model, using CRISPR Cas9 technology, was generated,revealing a reduced auditory response at all frequencies in Slc9a3r1  /  compared to Slc9a3r1 +/+and Slc9a3r1 +/ . Additional phenotypic analyses demonstrated no abnorm alities in the anatomy or number of hair cells or in the volume of the stato acoustic ganglion, however, a sig  niﬁcant variation in the total volume of the saccular otolith which is responsible for sound detection, was observed in Slc9a3r1  /  compared to Slc9a3r1 +/+(while the utricular otolith, necessary for balance, was not affected, inagreement with the human phenotype). Conclusions Our data strongly support SLC9A3R1 role in the pathogenesis of ARHL in both human and zebra ﬁsh.

Prior genetic linkage pinpointed the disease locus to chromosome6q16 and 5p15. The aim was to identify causative variants and further the understanding of the disease mechanism. Materials & Methods: CRISPR technology was used to reproduce a non coding duplication between IRX1 and ADAMTS16 (chr5) recurrently identi ﬁed in NCMD families866 J. del Picchiaby whole genome sequencing. Gene expression analysis was veri ﬁed on the developing eye and limb bud. Chromo  some conformation capture (c HI C) and chromatin immu  noprecipitation performed on the same tissues, mapped chromatin architectural folding and de ﬁned regulatory elements. Results: A non coding duplication (chr5) was identi ﬁed as an ancestral allele in 12 NCMD families. Expression of PRDM13 (chr6) was substantially elevated in eye but not limb bud tissue in the mouse model versus control. c Hi C at the 5p locus showed unique chromatin interactions in developing wild type eye versus limb bud, suggestingdistinct tissue speci ﬁc regulation. Conclusions: The eye speci ﬁc over expression of PRDM13 , a previously suggested candidate, provides the ﬁrst molecular evidence that elevated PRDM13 expression may be the origin of the phenotype. It also represents the ﬁrst molecular evidence to link the two loci biologically. The possible interaction between the putative element and subsequent PRDM13 expression control remains unknown. Chromatin organization ﬁndings highlight the relevance of tissue speci ﬁc DNA contacts in development and disease.

Hardcastle2,4 1Charles University and General University Hospital in Prague, Prague, Czech Republic,2UCL Institute of Ophthalmology, London, United Kingdom,3Charles University, Prague, Czech Republic,4Moor ﬁelds Eye Hospital, London, United Kingdom In a large family of Czech origin, we mapped a new locus for an autosomal dominant corneal endothelial dystrophy, Posterior Polymorphous Corneal Dystrophy 4 (PPCD4), to 8q22.3 q24.12. Whole genome sequencing identi ﬁed a unique variant (c.20 +544G>T) in this locus, within a regulatory region in intron 1 of GRHL2 .T a r g e t e dsequencing identi ﬁed the same variant in three additional unsolved PPCD families, including a de novo occurrence that suggests this is a recurrent mutation. Two further unique variants were identi ﬁed in intron 1 of GRHL2 (c.20 +257delT and c.20 +133delA) in unrelated PPCD famil  ies. GRHL2 is a transcription factor that suppressesepithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) and is a direct transcriptional repressor of ZEB1 .ZEB1 mutations leading to haploinsuf ﬁciency cause PPCD3. We pre  viously identi ﬁed promoter mutations in OVOL2 , a gene not normally expressed in the corneal endothelium, as the cause of PPCD1. OVOL2 drives mesenchymal to epithelial transition (MET) by directly inhibiting EMT  inducing transcription factors, such as ZEB1 . Here, we demonstrate that the GRHL2 regulatory variants identi ﬁed in PPCD4 individuals induce increased transcriptional activity in vitro. Furthermore, although GRHL2 is not expressed in corneal endothelial cells in control tissue, wedetected aberrant ectopic expression of GRHL2 in the corneal ‘endothelium ’in PPCD4 patient tissue. GRHL2 patient corneal ‘endothelial ’cells also ectopically express the epithelial markers E Cadherin and Cytokeratin 7 indicating they have transitioned to an epithelial like cell type. We suggest that mutations inducing MET within thecorneal endothelium are a convergent pathogenic mechanism leading to failure of the endothelial barrier and disease. P. Liskova: None. L.

Among those, IFT140 is implicated in a variety of phenotypes ranging from isolated retinis pigmentosa to more syndromic cases such as the Bardet  Biedl syndrome. Materials and Methods: Clinical characterizations, whole genome (4 individuals) and targeted exome sequencing (~350 patients) and bioinformatics analysis were performed onciliopathy families. Patients ’skinﬁbroblasts were analyzed to assess the pathogenicity of the causative mutations. Results: Using whole genome sequencing in patients with uncharacterized ciliopathies, we identi ﬁed a novel recurrent tandem duplication of exon 27 to 30 (6.7 kb) in IFT140 , c.3454 488_4182 +2588dup p. (Tyr1152_Thr1394dup), missed by whole exome sequen  cing. Pathogenicity of the mutation was assessed on the patients ’skin ﬁbroblasts. Several hundreds of patients with a ciliopathy phenotype were screened and biallelic mutations were identi ﬁed in 11 families representing 12 pathogenic variants of which 7 are novel. Among thoseunrelated families especially with a Mainzer Saldino syndrome, 8 carried the same tandem duplication (2 at the homozygous state and 6 at the heterozygous state). Conclusions: We demonstrated the implication of structural variations in IFT140 related diseases expanding its mutation spectrum. We also provide evidences for aunique genomic event mediated by an Alu Alu recombina  tion occurring on a shared haplotype. We con ﬁrm that whole genome sequencing can be instrumental in the abilityto detect structural variants for genomic disorders. V. Geoffroy: None. C. Stoetzel: None. S. Schei  decker: None. E.

Autosomal recessive disorders have a high prevalence in con sanguineous populations, due to the extensive genomic regions of homozygosity that include alleles identical by descent. Hence, consanguineous families are the bestsource to identify novel causative autosomal recessive genes. We have analyzed more than 150 consanguineous families with diverse phenotypes related to visualimpairment. We used a strategy that combines exome sequencing of a proband and genotyping of the entire family. In two different families, we found two differenthomozygous loss of function (LoF) variants in the DNMBP gene (OMIM#611282); a stopgain (NM_015221: c.811C>T:p.Arg271Ter) in family F385 (nine affectedindividuals, LOD score: 5.18 at θ,0), and a frameshift deletion (NM_015221:c.2 947_2948delGA) in family F372 (two affected individuals; LOD score: 0.85). Thephenotypes in both families correspond to a congenital cataract and retinopathy. The expression of the DNMBP gene is enriched during eye development in mice, zebra ﬁsh and ﬂies.

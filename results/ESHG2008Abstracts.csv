Understanding the Influence of Conditional Host Karyome  microbiome interactions in Health and Disease,PL1.1,J. K. Nicholson,"Department of Biomolecular Medicine, Imperial College, London, United King   dom","Post genomic technologies are being widely applied to improve the  understanding of adverse drug reactions and the molecular basis of human disease . Metabonomics is an approach that enables multivari   ate profiling of the integrated metabolic responses of complex systems  to patho physiological stress, and so involves understanding the way  the whole metabolic regulatory system varies with interventions thus providing complementary information to genomics and proteomics .  Mammalian biochemistry is strongly influenced by the host karyome  (genome) and gut microbiome symbionts that can alter drug metabo   lism and toxicity; the study of these transgenomic interactions is termed âglobal systems biologyâ . Because these interactions are mediated by  a large number of co metabolic processes the system state integrity  can be evaluated via metabolic profiling of biofluids. With the growing  desire to apply systems biology tools to understanding human disease  processes at the population level where massive cohorts need to be  investigated, it is necessary to use analytical and statistical methods  that report on whole system state  non invasively, hence the attraction  of biofuid analyses described here . NMR spectroscopy and chromatographic linked MS methods have  been applied to characterize and quantify a wide range of metabo   lites in biological fluids and tissues to explore the biochemical con   sequences of drug induced toxicity and human disease . In disease  or toxicity states metabolic profiles and NMR and mass spectra are  changed characteristically in different toxicity or disease conditions according to the exact site and mechanism of the lesion . The use of  chemometrics allows interrogation of spectroscopic data and can give  direct diagnostic information and aid the detection of novel biomarkers of disease and the integration of metabolic data with other omics sets .  Such diagnostics can be extremely sensitive for the detection of low  level damage in a variety of organ systems and is potentially a power   ful new adjunct to conventional procedures for disease assessment  and can help explain environment gene interactions that give rise to idiosyncratic toxicity of drugs in man .

"cell competition, apoptosis and tumour progression in  Drosophila",PL1.2,G. Morata,"Centro de Biologia Molecular Severo Ochoa, CSIC UAM   Campus de Cantob   lanco, Madrid, Spain","Larvae homozygous for mutations at the tumour suppressor genes of  Drosophila lethal giant larvae (lgl), scribble (scribb) or disc large (dlg)  develop extensive neoplastic tumours that affect principally the central nervous system and the imaginal discs . Thus the lack of any of these  products is sufficient to transform normal imaginal cells into tumorous cells . However, imaginal cells mutant for any of these genes are un   able to develop a tumour if they are surrounded by non tumour cells .  We have been studying the behaviour of clones of lgl mutant cells  in the wing disc to study the interactions between tumour and non  tumour cells. We find that as a rule lgl clones are eliminated from the  wing disc by a process akin to cell competition: they enter apoptosis  mediated by the JNK pathway and the interactions leading to the dis   appearance of the mutant cells take place at the border of the clones .  We have also found that when these cells contain an additional factor  conferring a high proliferation rate, the lgl mutant cells are transformed  into âsupercompetitorsâ, which are able to eliminate surrounding non tumour cells and give rise to invasive neoplastic tumours that colonise  the entire disc",2008

Using positional cloning, we found in a total of 25 patients that biallelic  loss of function mutations in the pericentrin  (PCNT ) gene cause micro   cephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwarfism type Majewski II (MOPD II, MIM 210720) . Adults with this rare inherited condition belong to the  shortest of the short having a height of about 100 centimeters and a  brain size comparable to that of a three month old baby, but are of near normal intelligence . Truncal obesity, type 2 diabetes and a high risk of stroke have been noted in older individuals with MOPD II . PCNT is known to mediate nucleation of microtubules by anchoring  the Î³ tubulin ring complex, thus initiating the assembly of the mitotic spindle apparatus . We show that PCNT mutations cause absence of  the protein resulting in disorganized mitotic spindles, premature sister  chromatid separation and missegregation of chromosomes in patient  cells. Our findings thus characterize MOPD II as a distinct clinical en   tity linking a key protein of the centrosome to dwarfism and a high risk of diabetes and stroke . Similarities between MOPD II individuals and the Late Pleistocene  hominid fossils from the island of Flores, Indonesia, also known as  âhobbitsâ, suggest that these do not represent a diminutive, small  brained new species, Homo floresiensis , but are pathological modern  humans .Rauch et al . 2008, Science Feb 8, 319:816 9 .",2008
meta analysis of genome wide association data and large scale  replication identifies several additional susceptibility loci for  type 2 diabetes,PL2.2,"E. Zeggini1, R. Saxena2, L. J. Scott3, B. F. Voight2, for the DIAGRAM Consor   tium","1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2Harvard and Massachusetts  Institute of Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States, 3University of Michigan,  Ann Arbor, MI, United States","Genome wide association (GWA) studies have identified multiple new  loci at which common variants modestly but reproducibly contribute to risk of type 2 diabetes (T2D) . However, established variants, common and rare, explain only a small proportion of the heritability of T2D . To  increase the power to discover alleles of modest effect, we performed Plenary Lectures  meta analysis of three T2D GWA scans (DGI, FUSION, WTCCC) en   compassing 10,128 European descent individuals (4549 cases and  5579 controls) and ~2 .2 million SNPs (directly genotyped and imput   ed) . Even after excluding known type 2 diabetes loci, we saw a strong  enrichment of highly associated variants (426 with p<10 4 vs . 217 ex   pected by chance) . Sixty nine SNPs were taken forward to an initial  round of replication in up to 22,426 individuals, and 11 SNPs with repli   cation p<0 .005 were tested in additional individuals from the deCODE,  KORA, Danish and HUNT T2D studies with an effective sample size of up to 18,066 . Multiple new loci with strong evidence for associa   tion were observed, including the JAZF1 (OR[95%CI]: 1 .11[1 .08 1 .14],  p,8 .8x10 12), CDC123 /CAMK1D (OR1 .10[1 .07 1 .14], p,5 .6x10 9), AD  AMTS9 (OR1 .10[1 .07 1 .14], p,9 .5x10 9), and THADA (OR 1 .17[1 .11  1 .23], p,4 .5x10 8) gene regions . These loci provide additional biologi   cal clues about the inherited basis of T2D, and the relatively small effects point to the need for large discovery and follow up samples .",2008
G protein coupled receptor P2Y5 and its ligand LPA are involved  in maintenance of human hair growth,PL2.3,"S. M. Pasternack1, I. von KÃ¼gelgen2, K. Al Aboud3, Y. Lee4,5, F. RÃ¼schendorf5,  K.

The hair loss is diffuse and progressive, and usually begins in  early childhood . We mapped an autosomal recessive form of this dis   order to chromosome 13q14.11 13q21.33, and identified homozygous  truncating mutations in P2RY5 , a gene which encodes an orphan G  protein coupled receptor  . We analysed expression patterns of P2RY5   in various human and mouse tissues and performed western blot and  immunofluorescence analyses to characterize the protein. Further   more, we identified oleoyl L Î± lysophosphatidic acid (LPA), a bioac   tive lipid, as being a ligand for P2Y5 in reporter gene and radioligand binding experiments . Homology and studies of signalling transduction  pathways suggest that P2Y5 is a member of a subgroup of LPA recep   tors, which also includes LPA4 and LPA5 . As P2RY5  is expressed in  human hair follicle cells, but LPA4 and LPA5 are not, a loss of P2Y5  function will not be compensated for, and will ultimately lead to patho   logical changes and hair loss . Our study is the first to implicate a G protein coupled receptor as being  essential for and specific to the maintenance of human hair growth.  With the functional characterization of the P2Y5 receptor, we identify  the missing link which is required for the transmission of the LPA signal  through the cell membrane in hair follicle cells. This finding may pro   vide opportunities for new therapeutic approaches to the treatment of hair loss in humans .",2008

Disorders arising from mutations on the X chromosome are typi   cally characterized by affected males and unaffected carrier females .  In contrast, EFMR spares transmitting males and affects only carrier females . Unraveling the biology of this conundrum depends upon the  identification of the molecular defect underlying EFMR.

The two missense mutations are predicted  to affect adhesiveness of PCDH19 through impaired calcium binding .  PCDH19  is expressed in human and mouse developing brain and is  the first member of the cadherin superfamily to be directly implicated in epilepsy or mental retardation .

The use of genome wide molecular methods have  revealed the existence of Copy Number Variants (CNVs), genomic  segments ranging in size from one kb to several megabases, that are  present at variable copy number in comparison with a reference ge   nome . The aim of our study was to determine the existence of popula   tion specific genomic structural variation and to identify genes located  in these regions that might contribute to phenotypic differences as well  as to differential susceptibility to common disease and environmental exposures of human populations . We have selected 343 individuals  from 11 populations from the HGDP CEPH panel (Biaka  Mbuti Pyg   my, Bantu, Mozabite, Bedouin, Brahui, Hazara, Yakut, Papuan Mela   nesian, French, Pima and Maya) and 134 individuals from the three populations of the HapMap collection (YRI, CHB and CEU) . To detect  structural variation we have used array CGH (Agilent 244K) and array based comparative genome intensity (Illumina) . We have observed dif   ferences between populations in 179 loci . 122 of these were already  described in the Database of Genomic Variants and 58 coincide with segmental duplications . Interestingly, a number of genes involved in  different common disorders or to have phenotypic differences between  population groups were found to be variable in copy number among human populations (i .e . RHD, CFHR1, CFHR3 and PRSS1) . These  loci and others could explain differences in disease predisposition  among individuals from different populations and could provide impor   tant clues on the adaptation of humans to different environments .",2008

","Impaired fetal movement causes growth retardation, fetal hydrops,  polyhydramnios, pulmonary hypoplasia, multiple joint contractures  with or without webbing (pterygia), and other features, summarized  under the term fetal akinesia deformation sequence (FADS) . We sequenced 75 patients with severe FADS and found mutations in  the Î³, Î±1and Î´ subunit of the AChR as well as in the receptor associ   ated protein of the synapse, rapsyn . Our major conclusions are that  FADS is a frequent genetic condition .   Doctors in pre  and neonatal care are often confronted with FADS but  are not as aware of possible involvement of AChR pathway mutations as a neurologist would be .   More awareness of the potential involvement of the AChR pathway will save the lives of some newborns . Our findings are important to the understanding of cellular biology, ge   netics and clinical relevance of AChR mutations especially in pre  and neonatal care . Early neonatal diagnosis in one of our families helped to  start effective treatment for the second affected child, whereas the first affected   undiagnosed   died in infancy  . One major conclusion is that  the inclusion of clinical and molecular data from prenatally deceased  siblings is crucial to elucidate severe phenotypes of AChR pathway mutations . We suggest that the AChR pathway contributes to a broad spectrum  of intrauterine phenotypes and should be examined functionally and  genetically in patients with recurrent spontaneous abortions, fetal aki   nesia, hydrops, pterygia, or inborn contractures .",2008

Al   though several X linked MR (XLMR) genes have been reported, iden   tification of more by conventional approaches is problematic because  mutations of many genes cause MR and their associated phenotypes are similar  . Here, we have implemented a new strategy in which  the coding exons of X chromosome genes (~1Mb DNA per sample)  have been systematically resequenced for disease causing variants in individuals from more than 200 XLMR families . The strategy has yielded several new XLMR genes . However, many families remain to  be explained . The study also indicates that loss of function of ~1%  of X genes is compatible with apparently normal existence .

Despite there are  about 20,000 protein coding genes, 63% to 93% of the mammalian ge   nomes is expressed, mainly producing non coding RNAs, starting from  more than 230,000 core promoters. These are identified with CAGE  (can analysis gene expression), resulting in a finely redefinition of the promoter structure . The development of novel generation of sequencing instruments al   lows addressing the RNA complexity at a much higher definition.

Distinguished speaker Lecture: systems Biology and systems medicine,PL4.1,L. Hood,"President, Institute for Systems Biology, Seattle, WA, United States","The grand challenge for biology and medicine in the 21st century is complexity  . A currently emerging paradigm change is the idea that biology is an informational science and that most biological informa   tion is mediated by dynamical biological networks . The systems ap   proach to biology and medicine is a general category of approaches  that appear to be very effective in dealing both with biological circuits and hence with biological complexity  . Systems approaches require a  truly cross disciplinary environment and the effective integration of biology, technology and computation/mathematics . I will discuss my  views of systems biology  . Then I will discuss a systems approach to  one disease, prion disease in mice, and demonstrate how it profound   ly alters our views of disease_with regard to understanding disease  pathophysiology as well as new approaches to diagnosis, therapy and  eventually prevention . Then I will talk about the emerging measure   ment technologies that are the foundation of P4 medicine, as well as  some of the pioneering computational and mathematical tools that will be necessary to usher in this revolution in medicine . The view of bi   ology as an information science, the systems approach to disease,  the new measurement and visualization technologies and the evolving  mathematical/computation tools will catalyze this paradigm change in  medicine. I will make five predictions: 1) our current largely reactive  medicine will be transformed to a predictive, preventive, personalized  and participatory (P4) medicine over the next 10 to 20 years, 2) this will  lead to the digitalization of medicine (extracting information from single  cells, single molecules and single individuals) with even more profound  implications for society than the digitalization of communications and  information technologies, 3) systems medicine and its digitalization  will dramatically turn around the slope of ever increasing healthcare  costs to the point that the developed world will be able to export its  P4 medicine to the developing world, 4) P4 medicine will necessitate  fundamental changes in the business plans of virtually every sector  of the healthcare industry and 5) this new world of medicine will be  propelled forward by carefully chosen strategic partnerships_across  all sectors of science_academia, industry, government laboratories, in   dependent research institutes, etc_and that these partnerships will be international . ISB hopes to play an important role in catalyzing a series of these strategic partnerships .Concurrent Symposia  ESHG CONCURRENT SYMPOSIA s01.1 Dissection of structural variation in common human disease X. Estivill ;   Genes and Disease Program, Center for Genomic Regulation (CRG), Barce   lona National Genotyping Center (CeGen), Public Health and Epidemiology  Network Biomedical Research Center (CIBERESP), Pompeu Fabra University  (UPF), Barcelona, Spain. CNVs represent a new common source of genetic variability in indi   viduals (recognized by Science as the breakthrough of 2007), which  might constitute susceptibility factors for the onset, progress and se   verity of complex diseases . CNVs could directly affect the dose of  certain genes or modify loci that regulate the expression of relevant  genes, therefore providing important clues for disease and phenotype  variability  . We are using and implementing multiple technologies to  further analyze CNVs potentially involved in several complex disor   ders, mainly psychiatric diseases, neurodegenerative diseases and  inflammatory disorders. Functional validation of CNVs with respect to  disease needs: a/ verification that the genomic variants are associ   ated to changes in the expression of a gene product at the mRNA  and protein levels; and b/ characterization of the physiological con   sequences associated to changes in the dose of a gene, which might  contribute to specific traits of the disease. We have identified several  genomic regions that contain CNVs that are common in the population and that could have an enormous impact in disease predisposition .  We have preliminary results on the identification of CNVs for several  neurological, neuropsychiatric and inflammatory disorders, and we are  characterizing such genomic regions and performing genome scans to uncover the variability landscape of these disorders . s01.2 Gene copy number variation and common human disease T. J. Aitman ;   Physiological Genomics and Medicine Group, MRC Clinical Sciences Centre  and Imperial College, London, United Kingdom. Gene copy number variation is now well recognised as a source of sequence variation in the genome of humans and other mammals .  During positional cloning studies to identify genes for insulin resistance  and autoimmune glomerulonephritis in the rat, we showed that gene  copy number variants, at the Cd36  and Fcgr3  gene loci respectively,  contributed to disease susceptibility in the rat model . In humans, we  went on to show that low copy number of FCGR3B , an orthologue  of rat Fcgr3 , was associated with glomerulonephritis in the autoim   mune disease systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) . More recently we  found that low FCGR3B copy number predisposes to development of  SLE itself and to development of the systemic autoimmune diseases microscopic polyangiitis and Wegenerâs granulomatosis . These stud   ies provide direct evidence for the importance of heritable variation in  gene copy number in the evolution of genetically complex phenotypes, including susceptibility to a range of common human diseases . s01.3 Beta defensin copy number variation: measurement,  diversification and association with psoriasis J. A. L. Armour ;   Institute of Genetics, Nottingham, United Kingdom. In the current excitement surrounding the recent discoveries from case  control association studies, it is essential to avoid overenthusiastic inter   pretation of error prone data . Although this is still an important consid   eration for SNP typing, it is of particular concern in assessing the role of  copy number variation, for which the development of typing technology satisfactory for case control association studies is still in its early stages .  I will address the importance of accuracy (as well as throughput) in mea   suring copy number, with reference to our own PRT methods applied to beta defensin variation on 8p23 .1 . This copy number variation involves a  cluster of seven defensin genes, presumed to act as antimicrobials, but  which may have a wider spectrum of functions; copy number variation is commonly over the range between 2 and 7 copies per diploid genome .  The accuracy of the typing methodology has been essential in discover   ing an association between beta defensin copy number and psoriasis,  as well as in revealing an unexpected and highly unusual mechanism for generating variation in the copy number of these genes .s02.1 Mutation specific therapy: The CF experience E. Kerem ;   Hadassah University Hospital, Jerusalem, Israel. CFTR mutations cause defects of CFTR protein production and func   tion by different molecular mechanisms . The mutations can be classi   fied according to the mechanisms by which mutations disrupt CFTR function . This understanding of the different molecular mechanism  of CFTR dysfunction provides the scientific basis for development of  targeted drugs for mutation specific therapy of CF. Class I mutations  are nonsense mutations that result in the presence of premature stop  codon that leads to the production of unstable mRNA or the produc   tion of a short truncated protein that is not functional . Drugs such as  the aminoglycoside antibiotics and PTC124 can suppress premature  termination codons by disrupting translational fidelity and allowing the  incorporation of an amino acid, thus permitting translation to continue to the normal termination of the transcript . Class II mutations cause  impairment of CFTR processing and folding in the Golgi . As a result  the mutant CFTR is retained in the ER and eventually targeted for deg   radation by the quality control mechanisms . Chemical and molecular  chaperons can stabilize protein structure, and allow it to escape from  degradation in the ER and be transported to the cell membrane . Class  III mutations disrupt the function of the regulatory domain . CFTR is  resistant to phosphorylation or ATP binding . CFTR activators can over   come the affected ATP binding through direct binding to a nucleotide  binding fold . In patients carrying class IV mutations, phosphorylation  of CFTR results in reduced chloride transport . Increases in the overall  cell surface content of these mutants might overcome the relative re   duction in conductance . Activators of CFTR at the plasma membrane  may function by promoting CFTR phosphorylation, by blocking CFTR  dephosphorylation, by interacting directly with CFTR, and/or by modu   lation of CFTR protein protein interactions . Class V mutations affect  the spicing machinery and generate both aberrantly and correctly  spliced transcripts, the level of which vary among different patients  and among different organs of the same patient . Splicing factors that  promote exon inclusion or factors that promote exon skipping can pro   mote increase of correctly spliced transcripts, depending on the molec   ular defect . Inconsistent results were reported regarding the required  level of corrected or mutated CFTR that has to be reached in order to achieve normal function . s02.2synthetic lethal approaches to the development of new  therapies for cancer A. Ashworth ;   Breakthrough Breast Cancer Research Centre, The Institute of Cancer Re   search, London, United Kingdom. About one in nine women in the Western world develop cancer of the  breast and at least 5% of these cases are thought to result from a he   reditary predisposition to the disease . Two breast cancer susceptibility  (BRCA ) genes have been identified and mutations in these genes ac   count for most families with four or more cases of breast cancer diag   nosed before the age of 60 . Women who inherit loss of function muta   tions in either of these genes have an up to 85% risk of breast cancer by age 70 . As well as breast cancer, carriers of mutations in  BRCA1   and BRCA2  are at elevated risk of cancer of the ovary, prostate and  pancreas . The genes are thought to be tumour suppressor genes as  the wild type allele of the gene is observed to be lost in tumours of  heterozygous carriers. Both BRCA1 and BRCA2 have significant roles  in the maintenance of genome integrity via roles in the repair of DNA  damage via homologous recombination. The specific DNA repair de   fect in BRCA  mutant cells provides opportunities for novel therapeu   tic approaches based on selective inhibition of functionally interacting repair pathways, in particular by inhibition of the enzyme PARP  . Here  I will describe recent work defining determinants of sensitivity and re   sistance to PARP inhibitors, as well as the application of the synthetic lethal approach to other cancer types .Concurrent Symposia  s02.3 small molecule therapy for cystic Fibrosis A. S. Verkman ;   Departments of Medicine and Physiology, University of California, San Fran   cisco, San Francisco, CA, United States. The Cystic Fibrosis Transmembrane Conductance Regulator (CFTR)  is a cAMP activated chloride channel expressed in epithelia in the  lung, intestine, pancreas, testis and other tissues, where it facilitates  transepithelial fluid transport. In the intestine CFTR provides the major route for chloride secretion in certain diarrheas . Mutations in CFTR  cause the hereditary disease cystic fibrosis, where chronic lung in   fection and deterioration in lung function cause early death . CFTR is  a well validated targeted for development of inhibitors for therapy of  secretory diarrheas and polycystic kidney disease, and activators for  therapy in cystic fibrosis. Our lab has identified and optimized small  molecule inhibitors of CFTR, as well as activators of deltaF508 CFTR,  the most common mutant CFTR causing cystic fibrosis. High through   put screening of small molecule collections utilizing a cell based fluo   rescence assay of halide transport yielded thiazolidinone and glycine  hydrazide CFTR inhibitors that block enterotoxin mediated secretory  diarrhea in rodent models, including a class of non absorbable inhibi   tors that target the CFTR pore at its external entrance . Nanomolar  potency benzothiophene, phenylglycine and sulfonamide potentiators  were identified that correct the defective gating of deltaF508 CFTR chloride channels, restoring their function to that of wildtype CFTR .  Several classes of correctors of defective deltaF508 CFTR cellular  misprocessing were discovered, including bisaminomethylbithiazoles,  that improve mutant CFTR folding and facilitate its stability and target   ing to the cell plasma membrane, restoring cAMP stimulated chloride permeability  . Small molecule modulators of CFTR function are in de   velopment for the treatment of cystic fibrosis, secretory diarrhea and polycystic kidney disease .Pedemonte, N ., N .D . Sonawane, A .

Kessler ;   Department of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of California at Berkeley,  Berkeley, CA. s03.2medical genetic services in developing nations A. Christianson ;   Division of Human Genetics, National Health Laboratory Services & University  of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg, South Africa. An expert advisory group of the WHO recognized in the early 1980âs  that health (epidemiological) transition would require developing coun   tries, within the foreseeable future to develop medical genetic services .  To that end the expert advisory group developed an approach cogent  for developing nations that focused on community based medical ge   netic services integrated into primary health care and closely linked to secondary and tertiary health care services . In the latter half of the last century these approaches were refined, to  an extent based on services that were being established in a few de   veloping countries . This decade several middle income nations have  recognized the need to develop medical genetic services, initially for the care and prevention of birth defects . Following the approach pro   posed by the WHO these nations are developing medical genetic ser   vices, some with assistance from the March of Dimes and the World  Alliance of Organizations for Prevention and Treatment of Genetic and Congenital Conditions (WAO) . Numerous barriers to the establishment of these services still exist, but are being overcome .s03.3Personalized medicine and Genetic services: the Us model M. Aspinall ;   Genzyme Corporation, Westborough, MA, United States. A revolution is underway in the life sciences and health care indus   try . Fueled by the mapping of the human genome and a deepening  understanding of human genetic variation and ongoing advances in  diagnostics are expanding our understanding of the molecular basis of disease . Health care delivery is beginning to shift from trial and error medicine to patient centric medicine . Patient care is becoming  focused on highly targeted and individualized diagnostic and treatment regiments . The use of genetic services is expanding in all areas . This  revolution is known as personalized medicine . Personalized medicine is a movement away from defining diseases by  their symptoms and locations within the body, and toward understand   ing them through their underlying genetic causes . With a successful  transition to this model, more specific disease diagnoses will occur,  resulting in a personalized treatment plan for individual patients . Costs  will be reduced through more accurate diagnosis, improved drug ef   ficacy with fewer adverse drug reactions as well as improved patient drug compliance . This trend to personalized medicine and increased  use of genetic services is occurring today in the field of oncology and will expand to all areas of medicine . The field of genetics services   both testing and counseling   is es   sential to the implementation of personalized medicine . Without these  services, physicians and other healthcare providers will not be able to  access the information necessary to make the most informed choices for patients . Personalized medicine, however, must overcome multiple challenges  if it is to fully adopted. There are significant challenges involving physi   cian and patient education and acceptance . An expanded understand   ing of genetics and diagnostics and its impact on patient care will be necessary for all healthcare providers . A health information infrastruc   ture must be able to accommodate the accumulation and analysis of expanding patient and pharmacogenomic data . In this talk, I will review the current status of personalized medicine in  the United States including examples of its current impact on patient care . I will also describe the current United States diagnostic market including the current distribution systems and infrastructure design . s03.4the clinical Use of Genetic and molecular Biomarkers: A Public  Health Perspective R. Zimmern ;   PHG Foundation Cambridge, Strangeways Research Laboratory, Cambridge,  United Kingdom. Advances in genomic science have led to a much greater knowledge  of disease mechanisms and the development of novel technologies such as genetic tests and molecular biomarkers . Unlike the well trod   den pathway that exists for pharmaceutical products, we do not have  within Europe (or anywhere across the developed world) an effective framework for their clinical evaluation . The absence of mechanisms  for generating the necessary data, or of institutions that focus on their  analysis, and the lack of policy about the respective responsibilities or  the public and commercial sectors for their establishment and funding are major concerns for the practice of medicine and for public health . The lecture will argue that an approach to the introduction of tests into clinical practice based on clinical judgement is longer sustainable . The  complexities of modern diagnostics will require a more formal and in   novative approach . Tests will require explicit evaluation to identify the clinically valid and useful . Biomarkers that are predictive of complex  disease before its development, in contrast to diagnostic or prognostic  markers or to genetic tests for high penetrance single gene disorders, pose a particular challenge . The low relative risks that these show,  and the fact that each individual biomarker will be neither necessary  nor sufficient for the development of disease suggests that a different approach to their assessment will be needed .Concurrent Symposia  s04.1 microRNA Regulation of cardiac Development and Disease D. Srivastava ;   Gladstone Institute of Cardiovascular Disease, UCSF â Dep. of Pediatrics and  Biochemistry & Biophysics,  San Francisco, CA, United States. Gradients of signaling and transcription factors result in distinct cellular  responses during organ formation suggesting that the precise dose of major regulatory proteins must be tightly controlled . MicroRNAs (miR   NAs) are phylogenetically conserved small RNAs that regulate transla   tion or stability of target messenger RNAs providing a mechanism for protein dose regulation . Studies in our lab of multiple cardiac enriched  miRNAs reveal that they coordinate decisions of cellular proliferation,  differentiation and response to stress via intricate transcriptional and translational networks .  In addition to our previous work demonstrating  the role of miR 1 in differentiation of mouse and fly cardiac progenitors,  we found that targeted deletion of miR 1 2 in mouse causes defects  in cardiac morphogenesis as well as cardiac conduction and cell cycle abnormalities.  Consistent with this finding, manipulation of miR 1 and  the co transcribed miR 133 in mouse and human embryonic stem cells  revealed that these miRNAs can be used to guide pluripotent stem  cells into mesodermal cells and ultimately into the cardiac lineage, while repressing neuroectodermal and endodermal differentiation . Fi   nally, novel approaches of miRNA target identification to explain the  mechanisms underlying the described effects of cardiac miRNAs will be discussed .   s04.2 A rapidly evolved RNA gene may have played a role in the  evolution of the cerebral cortex D. Haussler ;   Center for Biomolecular Science & Engineering, University of California, Santa  Cruz, CA, United States. We have scanned the human genome for segments that have been  under negative selection during most of mammalian evolution, but  experienced a burst of changes during the last few million years of human evolution . The most dramatic such segment occurs in a previ   ously unstudied RNA gene expressed specifically in the Cajal Retzius  neurons in the developing cerebral cortex, during the time these neu   rons guide the development of the 6 layer cortical structure . Examples  like this demonstrate the power of computational reconstruction of the  evolution of the human genome, and argue that changes in non coding  functional regions may have played a significant role in the molecular events that forged our species . s04.3the RNAi strategy in cancer: t owards the Achilles Heal of  cancer R. L. Beijersbergen ;   The Netherlands Cancer Institute , Division of Molecular Carcinogenesis and  NKI Robotics and Screening Center, Amsterdam, Netherlands. The development of the RNA interference (RNAi) technology has  changed the way how we approach target discovery and validation in cancer research . The potential to study the consequence of the inac   tivation of each individual gene is a very effective tool to identify novel targets . In addition, high content imaging allows us to identify novel  components of cellular pathways involved in complex cellular pheno   types in a high throughput manner  . The combination of RNA interfer   ence and high content imaging will lead to the discovery of a new class  of targets that can be used for development of novel cancer therapies or to improve existing therapies . We have constructed a large set of retroviral vectors encoding more than 50 .000 shRNAs, which target 15 .000 different human or mouse  genes for suppression . This RNA interference library has been used  to identify genes involved in major cellular pathways such as the p53  tumor suppressor pathway  . In particular we have focused on genes  that modulate the cytotoxic response to small molecules that target the MDM2 p53 interaction . In addition we have developed novel screening  methods with the use of shRNA libraries and DNA micro arrays to be able to rapidly screen large numbers of shRNA vectors . This technol   ogy is applied to identify the mechanism of action of novel anti can   cer drugs and to identify genes involved in resistance to anti cancer drugs . Recently, we have extended our efforts into synthetic siRNA screens to allow genome wide single well high throughput screening with the goal  to study more complex phenotypes and, importantly, to identify targets  that upon inhibition would only affect tumor cells where normal cells would remain unaffected . The concept that a particular mutation has  deleterious consequences under specific conditions is known as syn   thetic lethality. Two genes are defined as synthetic lethal when cells die  if they have both genes mutated but can survive if either gene alone is mutated . The approach of exploring synthetic lethal gene gene inter   actions is attractive because it turns a hallmark of cancer cells, specific mutations, into a weakness that can be explored therapeutically  . We  explore the existence of synthetic lethal interactions with tumor spe   cific genetic alterations and large scale siRNA screens. These approaches illustrate the power of RNAi to gain insight in the  mode of action of novel cancer drugs with the goal to accelerate their  development and as a powerful way to identify a whole new class of  more specific and more efficient anticancer drugs. s05.1 Guidelines for the clinical management of Lynch syndrome and  adenomatous polyposis H. F. A. Vasen ;   Department of Gastroenterology & Hepatology, Leiden University Medical Cen   tre, Leiden, Netherlands. The Lynch syndrome (LS)(HNPCC) is characterized by the devel   opment of colorectal cancer (CRC), endometrial cancer and vari   ous other cancers and is caused by a mutation in one of the mis   match repair (MMR) genes: MLH1, MSH2, MSH6  or PMS2  . Fa  milial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a well described inherited  syndrome, characterized by the development of hundreds to thou   sands of adenomas in the colorectum . The syndrome is caused by  mutations in the APC  gene or the MUTYH  gene . Both syndromes  (LS, FAP) are responsible for at least 5 7 % of all cases of CRC .   Since 2006, annual workshops were organized by a group of Euro   pean experts in hereditary gastrointestinal cancer (the Mallorca group)  aiming to establish guidelines for the clinical management of heredi   tary CRC syndromes . Thirty one experts from nine European coun   tries participated in these workshop . Prior to the meeting, various par   ticipants prepared the key management issues of debate according to the latest publications . A systematic literature search using Pubmed  and the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, reference lists of  retrieved articles, and manual searches of relevant articles was per   formed . During the workshop all recommendations were discussed in detail . Part of the guidelines will be discussed . Moreover, the results of  recent studies on cancer risk and experience of longterm surveillance for CRC in the Lynch syndrome will be presented . References:1 .

The management of the high risk of breast and ovarian cancer in  female BRCA1/BRCA2 mutation carriers remains a vexing issue . In  order to provide alternatives to risk reducing surgery, surveillance pro   grammes have to detect the disease sufficiently early to provide a very high likelihood of cure . In particular there have been substantial doubts  about the ability of routine annual mammography and ovarian ultra   sound plus serum CA125 to meet this goal . Collaborative research be   tween the UK, the Netherlands and Norway has enabled us to provide  a more accurate assessment of the likelihood of cure within these pro   grammes. Additionally the benefits of MRI screening for breast cancer have been demonstrated by National studies in each country  . To assess the effectiveness of annual ovarian cancer screening (trans   vaginal ultrasound and serum CA125 estimation) in reducing mortal   ity from ovarian cancer in women at increased genetic risk . A cohort  of 3532 women at increased risk of ovarian cancer was screened at  five centres between January 1991 and March 2007. Survival from  diagnosis of ovarian cancer was calculated using Kaplan Meier analy   sis and compared for proven BRCA1/2  carriers with non carriers and  whether the cancer was detected at prevalence or post prevalent scan .  Screening was performed by annual transvaginal ultrasound and se   rum CA125 measurement 64 epithelial ovarian malignancies (59 invasive and 5 borderline), de   veloped in the cohort . 26 tumours were detected at prevalent round,  there were 27 incident detected cancers and 11 interval. Sixty five per   cent of cancers were stage 3 or 4, however, stage and survival were lit   tle different for prevalent versus post prevalent cancers . Five year and  10 year survival in 49 BRCA1/2  mutation carriers was 58 .6% (95%  CI 50.9 66.3%) and 36% (95% CI 27 45%), which was significantly worse than for 15 non BRCA carriers (91 .8% (95% CI 84 99 .6%) both 5 and 10 year survival p,0 .015) . Annual surveillance, by trans vagi   nal ultrasound scanning and serum CA125 measurement in women  at increased familial risk of ovarian cancer is ineffective in detecting  tumours at a sufficiently early stage to substantially influence survival  in BRCA1/2  carriers . A collaborative study between Norway and the UK has shown that  survival in prospectively detected breast cancers in BRCA1  carriers in  an annual mammography screening programme is significantly worse  than for BRCA2  and other familial groups . It appears this may be due  to relatively poor survival for small node negative cancers . Some of  this poor survival may be attributable to the failure to treat these small tumours with chemotherapy  . This is particularly relevant when assess   ing the benefits of MRI which in combination with mammography has >90% sensitivity at detecting breast cancers in an annual programme .  The benefits of the combined approach for BRCA2  appear robust with  survival likely to exceed 90% for breast cancers identified in surveil   lance programmes . s05.3managing genetic risk: some issues for BRCA  and BRCA   mutation carriers N. Hallowell ;   Public Health Sciences, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Men and women who have a number of relatives with breast, ovarian  and prostate cancer in close relatives may be at risk of developing  these diseases because they carry a dominantly inherited (BRCA1/2) mutation . These individuals need to reach a decision about managing their cancer risks . There are a number of risk management strategies  available   which can be divided into familial and individual strate   gies . The former entails DNA screening   determining whether indi   viduals and, subsequently, their relatives carry a mutation . The latter  include: bodily surveillance (breast, ovarian and prostate screening), chemoprevention (e .g . tamoxifen, oral contraception), risk reducing  pre symptomatic surgery (e .g . mastectomy, oophorectomy), which are  available to at risk confirmed and unconfirmed mutation carriers. This presentation will present an overview of some of the main issues  emerging from research which investigates the psychosocial implica   tions of cancer risk management . I will argue that both risk manage   ment decisions and the process of managing risk have both an in   dividual and familial dimension. Some of the factors influencing risk  manageme",2008

Heavy economic, social and health burdens are imposed  on the afflicted family as well as the society. In general genetic dis   eases are relatively prevalent among the Arab population . Incidence of  congenital malformations among Egyptians ranges from 1,16 to 3,17  % . This is probably due to the high consanguinity rate (20   40 %) .

Molecular Characterization of Two Families With Î´Î² Thalassemia,P01.005,"F. Bayat , A. Valaei, A. Amirian, A. Kordafshari, M. Karimipoor, S. Zeinali","Pasteur Inistitute of Iran, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Î²  thalassemia is the most common genetic disorder in Iran, caused  by reduced or absence of globin gene synthesis in Î² globin chain.More  than180 different mutations in the Î² globin gene have been reported.  Most of theses mutations are point mutations, and large deletions are  not common. Î´Î²thalassemia normally results from deletions involving  either the Î´,Î² globin genes or the AÎ³, Î´ and Î² genes. It is useful to  broadly divide Î´Î² thalassemia in to the (Î´Î²)+and(Î´Î²)Âº thalassaemia to  indicate whether there is any output of Î´ and Î² chains from the affected  chromosome.

A small number of point mutations, usually within the Î±2, have been characterized . The aim of This study was molecular analysis of Î± globin genes in some Iranian people with low MCV, MCH and normal HbA2 and HbF  . Materials and Methods: After obtaining informed consent, DNA was extracted from blood sam   ples of 100individuals referred from Primary Health Care (PHC) cen   ters by salting out method. Multiplex Gap PCR for common Î± globin gene deletions was performed . Then for individuals who did not have  known deletions, Î±2 and Î±1 globin genes were sequenced by chain termination method . The sequences were aligned against Z84721 accession number in  GenBank and results were compared with globin gene server data   base . Results: Among 100 individuals, 47 individuals have had deletions in Î± globin  gene including:  Î±3 .7(27),   Med (8),  Î±4 .2 (7),  Î±20 .5(5) . of the 53 remaining individuals who did not have known deletions in Î±  globin genes,23 samples had different mutations; including: PolyA4(8),  PolyA6 & 5nt (5), C .S(1),hemoglobin Adana,Cd28 . The most common  deletions and point mutation were  Î±3 .7 and PolyA, respectively  . Conclusion:Non deletion mutations can interact with each other or  Î±0  thalassemia deletions to produce severe forms of HbH disease or  even Hb hydrops fetalis.Thus screening for Î± thalassemia should be  considered during genetics counseling of high risk couples of thalas   semia for prenatal diagnosis.

Working on the Î² globin cluster haplotypes of some Iranian Î² thalas   semia carriers and their families, we observed a different pattern of digestion by RsaI restriction enzyme in many people .The aim of this  study was to find out the cause of this pattern. This study was performed on carriers of Î² thalassemia and normal controls . After obtaining informed consent, DNA was extracted from  peripheral blood.ARMS PCR method was exploited for finding the  common mutations in Î² globin gene.PCR RFLP was performed on  Î² RsaI polymorphic site. The primers and PCR conditions are from Weatheral & Cleggs . DNA sequencing was performed on PCR prod   ucts of Î² RsaI marker by the same primers. Some of the carriers of Î² thalassemia and their parents had a different  digestion pattern in Î² RsaI polymorphic site. In the carrier people dif   ferent mutations were found(IVSII 1, IVSI 110, IVSI 6,  88) .When poly   morphic restriction site of RsaI is absent in the sample, after digestion,  the 1200 bp PCR product is cut to 694, 411 and 95 bp bands due to two constant restriction sites . In our cases the constant restriction site  at position 411 has been changed(GTAC to GCAG)in heterozygous form . Hence, the restriction pattern by this enzyme creates 694 and  506 bp bands.

We report here a case of Hb Torino found in an Italian family: the pro   band is a young boy aged six, who presented haematological param   eters similar to Î± thalassemia. The Î± globin2 specific PCR product were amplified. Direct sequencing  of amplified PCR product showed the presence of Hb Torino (Cod43  TTC > GTC, Phe >Val) in both cromosomes in the proband . Since Hb  Torino was detected in the homozygous state and it is quite a rare vari   ant we decided to extend the analysis to patientâs parents . The father resulted to be an heterozygous carrier for Hb Torino, while the mother had a 3 .7 deletion in the heterozygous state . Then we con   cluded that proband had the Hb Torino in one chromosome and Î± 3.7 deletion in the other chromosome . The correct diagnosis, improved after the case history, included the  presence of the base substitution causing Hb Torino and the Î± 3.7 deletion, both in the heterozygous state .

Three thalassemia major patients (compound heterozygotes  for Hb Lepore and beta thalassemia mutation) and 36 heterozygous Hb Lepore carriers were characterized in 15 unrelated families . Mo   lecular detection of Hb Lepore gen was carried out by gap PCR analy   sis . Sequencing analysis showed that all Hb Lepore genes were of BW type . Moreover, they were all associated with the same intragenic  beta globin gene polymorphisms, framework 2 . Additionally, we have  studied beta globin gene cluster haplotypes and their association with  Hb Lepore gene in Serbian population by PCR RFLP analysis of 8  polymorphic sites (Hinc II/epsilon, Xmn I/5âGgamma, Hind III/Ggam   ma, Hind III/Agamma, Hinc II/pseudobeta, Hinc II/3âpseudobeta, Ava  II/beta, BamHI/3âbeta) .

Beta  globin mutations were studied using a reverse hybridization assay and  sequencing of the total Î² globin gene. The XmnI GÎ³ polymorphism,  the Sicilian Î´Î² deletion and four Î± globin mutations ( Î±3 .7,  Î±4 .2,   MED,  Î±Î±Î±anti 3 .7) were studied using PCR based techniques . The inheritance  of the XmnI GÎ³ polymorphism with severe Î² thalassemia alleles in the  homozygous or compound heterozygous state was the predominant mechanism observed in 56 .5% of individuals . In 8 .7% of cases, this  status overlapped with the  Î±3 .7/Î±Î± genotype. The second most fre   quent cause for thalassemia intermedia (15 .2%) was the inheritance  of mild Î² thalassemia alleles, including IVS I 6 (T>C),  88 (C>A) and  +113 (A>G). In 4.3% of subjects the Sicilian Î´Î² deletion was iden   tified. HbS in association with Î²0 thalassemia was found in 2 .2% of  patients, who had been misdiagnosed as thalassemia intermedia . In  21.7% of cases no causative genetic alteration could be identified.

Search  for large CFTR  rearrangements using semi quantitative fluorescent  multiplex (QFM) PCR assays is now part of the molecular diagno   sis and allows to identify 2% of CF alleles . Rearrangements mainly  comprise single or multiple exon deletions; duplications are rare and Clinical genetics are indeed more difficult to detect and characterize. Of the four CFTR   duplications reported, three were detected in our laboratory by QFM  PCR, in two CF patients and a CBAVD patient . They involved exons  4 8, 10 18 and 11 13, respectively, in trans of another CFTR  mutation .  Methods: The duplications were characterized by using a combina   tion of long range (LR) PCR, digestion of LR PCR products and se   quencing . Results: Two duplications were fully characterized, in direct  tandem each: dup10_18 (â70kb long), and dup11_13 (â17kb long). Characterization of the remaining dup4_8 is in process . However,  given the classical CF phenotype of the patient, we hypothesize that  the duplicated region is located inside the CFTR  gene and interferes  with the transcription, translation or maturation process, thus resulting in a null mutation . Conclusion: Effective tools are required to detect  duplications, which may indeed be under diagnosed. Refinement of  the breakpoints is important to confirm a deleterious effect and should contribute to understand the duplication mechanism .",2008

We consider 3 groups of  patients, as follows: group 1(21 CFLD patients), group 2(11 pts CF no CFLD), group 3(15 controls) . Groups were age matched . Patients  associating diseases who influence MBL level were excluded. MBL assay procedure was performed using MBL Oligomer ELISA kit . Data were statistically analyzed with ANOVA . Results: Among CFLD pts  (group 1) MBL average was half of controlâs average (p,0 .001) . Group  2 had an average lower with 13% comparing to controls . 46% CFLD  pts were MBL deficient. Conclusions: Lower MBL average in CFLD  patients sustains that MBL deficiency is associated factor for CFLD. Increased MBL levels in CFLD patients could be resultant of increase  growth hormone levels in childhood or predominance of âwildâ MBL2 genotype in our patients . MBL2 genotyping is necessary to identify the  patients predisposed to develop CFLD .",2008

To study patients with CF like symptoms and to relate the disease to  gene mutations of both CFTR and ENaC genes, we collected clinical data and DNA samples from 60 African patients with CF phenotype .  The CFTR gene was first analysed for mutations in all patients by DH   PLC followed by direct sequencing, whereas the SCNN1A, SCNN1B  and SCNN1G subunits of ENaC gene were analysed by sequencing in all patients who carried only one CF mutation . The frequency of all  identified ENaC variants was established in control group of 200 health individuals . In total, four different CFTR mutations, including one previously unde   scribed missense mutation (p.A204T) were identified in five patients. In  addition, ENaC gene sequencing in these 5 patients detected 8 ENaC variants, (c .72T/C and p .V573I) in SCNN1A, (p .V348M, p .G442V, c .1473+28C/T, and p .T577T) in SCNN1B, and (p .S212S, c .1176+30G/ C) in SCNN1G . The missense mutation (p .V348M) was not found in  the control group. We could also not find any p.T577T silent polymor   phism nor any c .1176+30G/C intronic nucleotide change . Our data thus show that an exploration of African patients with CF like  symptoms is mandatory and should include ENaC gene sequencing in  absence of identified two CFTR causing mutations.

This deletion is relatively common in Spanish population (0 .3%) . In order to provide  a faster detection than Southern blot we have applied quantitative real  time PCR analysis to asses this deletion in 11 uncharacterized alleles  from patients fulfilling CF criteria diagnosis. We have designed primers  (Primer express 3.0 software) for 10 exons, 8 concerning the flanking  regions (3, 4, 7, 8, 10, 11, 18, 19) and two other into the deleted re   gions (6a, 17a) .

We believe that mRNA analysis may allow researchers to  define the pathogenic role of sequence variations not yet defined and particularly splicing defects . After an extensive analysis at DNA level, in a cohort of 745 CF patients, 81 alleles (6%) were still unknown . Aim of  this work was to evaluate the role of the CFTR analysis at mRNA level  as a diagnostic method for the characterization of molecular defects in  CF patients who still had one or two unidentified alleles. RNA was ex   tracted from nasal epithelial cells and collected using cyto brush from  7 CF patients and 3 non CF controls. The cDNA was amplified in six overlapping fragments spanning the entire CFTR gene .Disease relat   ed mutations were identified in two patients; mRNA analysis performed  on two other related patients with a deletion of exon 2 at DNA level,  showed two novel transcription products carrying a deletion of exon  2 3 and an insertion of intron sequence of about 80bp near exon 6b, respectively  . Two patients presented low level of mRNA product and  should be analyzed by quantitative technique . One patient showed a  normal profile. In conclusion our data suggest that the defects at RNA  level could explain the pathogenic role of abnormal mRNA products in Cystic Fibrosis onset .

The wild type CBS activity in the presence of  PLP was taken as reference (100%) . The expression of the mutant  proteins was confirmed by Western blotting in denaturing conditions.  Mutations p .M173del and p .D281N showed null activity and a com   plete lack of response to the activators, confirming their pathogenicity, whereas p .P49L and p .P200L exhibited activities close to 30% and a  strong response to PLP  . Furthermore, p .P200L showed good response  to SAM . These mutations were found in two patients with a mild phe   notype . Mutation p .P49L was found, in combination with p .R125Q, in a  53 year old male who presented with a stroke and in his asymptomatic  51 year old sister  .",2008

Ferritin is the major intracellular iron store protein and consists H  (heavy) and L (light) subunits which are encoded in chromosomes 11  and 19, respectively  . The iron responsive element (IRE) in the 5â un   translated region (5â UTR) of L ferritin mRNA interacts with trans act   ing iron regulatory proteins (IRPs) to regulate ferritin translation . Muta   tions in the 5âUTR of the L ferritin gene, result in reduced affinity for  IRPs and subsequently in constitutive L ferritin synthesis which results in congenital cataract . In the present study, we analyzed two fami   lies with early onset bilateral cataract and marked hyperferritinemia .  Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood and the IRE L fer   ritin gene was completely sequenced . Morphology of cataracts of both  families showed different phenotypes . Onset of cataract symptoms  ranged from 15 year old to 40 year old . No other ocular or systemic anomalies were found to be present . Propositi underwent surgery with satisfactory results .

Methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from affected males and  female relatives, and the entire alpha Gal A coding as well as flanking  intronic sequences were amplified by PCR and analyzed by automat   ed sequencing . Results: Thirteen different mutations were identified, including eight  missense mutations (D155H, C174G , C202Y, N215S, Y216C , D264Y,  A292T , L415P ); two nonsense (R227X, E398X); one splice site muta   tion IVS4 1GâA and two small deletions: one complex G144fsX15   (del c .431 442, del c .448 459) and K374fsX15  (del c .1122 1125 del  AGGA) .

In a prospective nationwide  multicentric study, we have studied the prevalence of Fabry disease in a hypertrophic cardiomyopathy referral population . Methods . We have developed and validated an assay of alpha galacto   sidase A activity on dried blood paper discs . Using this method, we have  assayed alpha galactosidase A activity in 330 adult patients affected with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy who had never been diagnosed with FD .Results .  Three patients (0 .9%) were found to exhibit low alpha galacto   sidase A activity in dried blood spots. This was confirmed by a second determination of alpha galactosidase activity in leukocytes . The three  patients presented neither the typical clinical signs of classic FD, such as  acroparesthesias or hypohidrosis, nor kidney insufficiency, suggesting a variant form of FD . All patients with low alpha galactosidase activity had mutations in the GLA gene. DNA sequencing also allowed the identifica   tion of two additional hemizygotes (half brothers of the proband) in one family  . Discussion . Screening for Fabry disease should be considered in all cases of unexplained hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  . Its recognition is im   portant since specific enzyme replacement therapy is now available. The  proposed novel filter paper method favours the collection, storage and  shipment of samples. It is simple and efficient for screening programs.",2008

It is characterized by slowly progres   sive neurological dysfunction with cerebellar ataxia, pyramidal sign, intellectual decline, seizure etc . . MRI scanning is highly characteristic  and screening for organic acid(L 2 Hydroxyglutaric acid) in the urine, serum, and CSF is diagnostic . Materials & Methods: We have investigated three Iranian families with  six affected children aged (4 to 16 years) who were suspected for this rare disorder, by urine organic acid assay and MRI scanning . In two  families we analyzed the Duranin gene which is responsible for hy   droxy glutarate dehydrogenase . Results: Affected cases were evaluated because of clinical findings. Urine levels of L 2 Hydroxyglutaric acid were strongly increased . MRI  scanning of the brain showed hyper intense signal on T2 weighted  images of the sub cortical white matter, and basal ganglia in all of the  patients. We have identified the mutation in one of the families. It was  a large deletion encompassing at least exons 7 and 8, the process is ongoing yet . In this family, because the mother became pregnant we did PND, unfortunately the fetus was affected in homozygote state . Conclusions: Because of its inheritance pattern(autosomal recessive),  and high rate of consanguineous marriages in Iran, the prevalence of  this disorder might be higher, between mentally handicapped patients, especially those with macrocephaly  . So we should consider this rare  entity in our differential diagnosis .",2008

Ballabio","Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, Naples, Italy","Lysosomal storage diseases (LSDs) are a group of inherited meta   bolic disorders due to the defective activity of lysosomal hydrolases  and characterized by accumulation of undegraded substrates in the  lysosomes, leading to peripheral organ cell damage, neurodegenera   tion, and premature death in most cases (Saftig et al, 2005) . Here we  have used our mouse model for Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency (MSD)  (Settembre et al, 2007), to study the intracellular signals triggered by  intralysosomal storage. Using fluorescent weak bases to examine the  acidic lysosomal compartment from isolated splenocytes and mouse  embryonic fibroblasts, we have found an increased lysosomal mem   brane permeabilization (LMP) in MSD cells compared with their wild type counterparts . These results suggest a loss of the intralysosomal  acidic pH that can be mimicked in wild type cells by the addition of the  specific inhibitor of vesicular proton pump, Bafilomycin A1. Lysosomal  destabilization in MSD cells correlates with several hallmarks of apop   tosis such as lysosomal secretion of the aspartate protease cathepsin  D, loss of mitochondrial membrane potential, release of cytochrome C, activation of caspase 3, and annexin V staining . Interestingly, LMP  seems to be a common sign of other LSDs as suggested by the in   creased LMP observed in splenocytes from a mouse model of Hunter disease . Together, these evidences support the role of LMP and the  release of lysosomal proteases in the initiation and execution of apop   tosis in pathological situations such as LSDs .",2008

Approximately 95% of patients bear mutations in the NPC1  gene, which encodes a late endosomal integral membrane glycopro   tein, and about 5% of the patients show mutations in the NPC2  gene,  encoding a small soluble lysosomal protein with cholesterol binding properties . Both genes are involved in cholesterol and glycolipid traf   ficking and transport, so NPC patients show accumulation of unesteri   fied cholesterol and glycosphingolipids in the lysosomal/late endo   somal system . A mutational analysis was carried out in 5 non related individuals af   fected by this disorder  . Genomic and cDNA from the patients were am   plified and sequenced. All the NPC1  mutant alleles were identified; 4 of  them have not been described before and were not found in 100 con   trol alleles . The new changes were: one missense mutation: p .F1079S  (c .3236T>C); one nonsense mutation: p .E1089X (c .3265G>T) and two  intronic changes that affect the splicing process: c .2604+5G>A in the  donnor splice site of intron 17 which promotes skipping of exon 17 and c .1554 1009G>A that is located in intron 9 and results in the incorpo   ration of 194 pb of intron 9 in the cDNA as a new exon .

ZPEG301 cells belonged to the  PEX16  complementation group  as numerous punctuate structures of peroxisomes were restored after its cDNA transfection in to those cells . Moreover temperature shift as   say to permissive temperature at 30 degrees of centigrade showed a  moderate increase in peroxisomal structures in ZPEG301 cells which  is presumably due to the stabilization of peroxisomal membrane pro   teins such as PMP70 . Biochemical pattern of peroxisomal proteins  have documented our hypothesis . Taken together these results dem   onstrate that Pex16p is involved in morphological control and division  of peroxisome in mammals besides of its main role in peroxisomal  biogenesis .",2008

In the majority of cases, PKU is caused by mutations in the  PAH  gene, and it presents with different phenotypes which are classified according to Phe tolerance . More than 500 mutations have been de   scribed world wide and the PAH enzyme has been fully characterized .  The incidence of the disease in the Slovak population had been esti   mated to be 1:10 000 newborn . Seven causative mutations which have  been so far identified make up 70 % of all PKU alleles. Thus the aim of  our work was to carry out a complete mutation analysis in a sample of 48 unrelated PKU patients with 1 or with no known mutation . The DH   PLC (Denaturating High Performance Liquid Chromatography) method  was applied for screening all 13 coding exons of the  PAH gene . Identi   fied heterozygous fragments were subsequently sequenced to charac   terize the DNA variants . Sequencing revealed 16 mutations (of which  1 is new) not previously found in the Slovak population, and 2 frequent  polymorphisms in the coding region of the PAH gene . Corresponding  frequencies for all mutations were estimated, and the classification ac   cording to phenotypic categories of PKU was identified.",2008

Although numerous factors contrib   ute to the PKU phenotype, several studies showed that mutations in the PAH gene are main determinant of PKU severity  . In the study on  34 unrelated patients with phenylketonuria from Serbia, we identified  19 disease causing mutations: L48S, R408W, P281L, E390G, R261Q,  R158Q, I306V, IVS12+1G>A, Q20X, R111X, V177L, P225T, R261X, L15/S16fsCTdel, S231F, R252Q, R297H, IVS10 11G>A and R413P  .  According to pretreatment serum phenylalanine level, patients were assigned to classic PKU (65%), mild PKU (35%) and MHP (0%) . The  most frequent mutation in Serbia is L48S . Since genotype phenotype  correlation inconsistency for L48S mutation has been previously re   ported, we investigated genotypes involving L48S and their correla   tion with phenotypes . The homozygous patient for L48S had classic PKU . Also, in combination with null mutations, L48S was associated  with severe phenotype. Our findings on the effect of other mutations  were mainly in concordance with previous European studies . How   ever, functional and structural effect of the S231F mutation was not previously analyzed . Therefore, we characterized S231F PAH protein  in prokaryotic and eukaryotic expression systems . In both systems the  mutant enzyme was unstable . Its residual enzyme activity was lower than 10% showing that S231F is a severe mutation . We have found no  GroESL chaperone effect and slightly positive effect of the BH4 on the  stabilization of the protein structure. These findings elucidated severe phenotype of the patient with L48S/S231F genotype . In conclusion,  we showed that L48S is consistently severe PAH gene mutation in Serbian population .",2008

The biochemical hallmark is the urocanic aciduria . We have investigated the urocanase gene  UROC1  gene in a girl presenting ataxia with mental retardation (IQ  , 54) and extremely high levels of urocanic acid in urine, ranging be   tween 158 202 mmol/mol creatinine (normal values below 10 mmol/mol creatinine) .

Her healthy father was hetero   zygous carrier of the p .R450C mutation . In silico  analysis showed that  the L70 residue could form part of an Î± helix, and then the change to  proline may disrupt the Î± helix, possibly resulting in an alteration of the structure of the N terminal region . The R450 residue forms a salt bridge with the urocanate, substrate of the urocanase .

Consequently, the  in silico   predictions suggest that both mutations in the UROC1  gene, p .L70P  and p.R450C, are pathologic. We suggest that urocanase deficiency  or urocanic aciduria is a Mendelian disorder of the histidine metabo   lism caused by mutations in the UROC1  gene . The toxic effect of the  urocanic acid and also, the possible folate deficiency would play a no   table role in the physiopathology of this rare condition .",2008

Our microarray was designed to sequence  all exonic and their flanking intronic sequences of the FAH gene to  detect sequence variations. In brief, FAH gene has been amplified  from genomic DNA by short or long range PCR. After purification, all  PCR products were quantitated and equimolar amount of them were pooled . After the fragmentation step, fragmented PCR products were  end labeled using a biotin labeling reagent and hybridised with DNA arrays . Then, arrays were processed by steps of washing and stain   ing on fluidics station. Scanned arrays were analyzed using Affymetrix GeneChip Resequencing Analysis Software . Mutation screening results showed that 12 different type of mutations  were responsible of disease development in our cohort of Turkish tyro   sinemia patients . Four different polymorphisms were also described in our patients . Detected mutations by DNA resequencing chip technol   ogy were also reevaluated and confirmed by direct DNA sequencing. To our knowledge, this work is the first report showing the application  of DNA resequencing chip as rapid and reproducible mutation screen   ing tool for genetic analysis of patients with hereditary tyrosinemia  .

The estimated fre   quency is 1:50000   1:100000 births . CLS is caused in the majority  of cases by mutations of the RSK2  gene ( RPS6KA3 ), which maps to  Xp22 .2 and is split into 22 exons . The gene encodes for a serine/threo   nine kinase, RSK2, acting at the distal end of the MAPK/ERK signal   ling pathway  . We present two Polish patients with the clinical diagnosis of Coffin  Lowry syndrome confirmed on the molecular level. Patient 1 is a boy aged 4 years . He has moderate mental retardation, hypotonia, facial  dysmorphism, digital tapering, dental anomalies, spinal deformities, seizure and cataplexia . Molecular analysis of the  RSK2 gene revealed  the presence of a substitution G to A in the first position of intron 10 (c .845+1G>A) . The mutation appeared  de novo  . Besides, a polymor   phism in exon 10 (c.798C>A) was identified. Patient 2 is a girl aged 9 years .

It encodes for a ubiquitous protein that adds Coenzyme A to  long chain fatty acids, especially arachidonic acid; it presents a brain  specific isoform resulting from alternative splicing and containing 41  additional N terminal aminoacids. In order to define how ACSL4 ab   sence causes mental retardation, we have characterized the protein and analyzed the consequences of its absence in neurons . Our data suggest that ACSL4 is located in endoplasmic reticulum . Quantitative  mRNA expression analyses indicate that ACSL4 is expressed at high   er levels in fetal than in adult brain . Moreover, differential expression  of the alternative transcripts in different adult brain regions has been  observed. Protein analysis has confirmed this variability and revealed  a lack of linear correlation between mRNA and protein levels, suggest   ing the presence of post transcriptional regulatory mechanisms . To  characterize ACSL4 function in neurons we have silenced the gene by siRNA technology in rat primary hippocampal neurons . Our data sug   gest that ACSL4 might be important for dendritic spine formation and/ or maintenance. In fact, ACSL4 absence seems to cause a significant  reduction in dendritic spine density and alteration in spine distribution among different morphological categories . Moreover, abnormal actin  accumulation has been observed in a significant percentage of cells.  This last finding suggests that ACSL4 might directly or indirectly influ   ence actin cytoskeleton organization; it could be thus hypothesized  that the observed spine anomalies are a secondary effect of an abnor   mal actin organization due to ACSL4 absence .

In the general female population, the X inactivation process  is random, and therefore XCI ratios have a normal distribution (with  average of 50:50) with only a small percentage of females (5 8%) showing a skewed X inactivation ratio (>90:10) . Fragile X syndrome  (FXS) premutation carriers (55 200 CGG repeats) do not present FXS  symptoms but it has been shown that they have a higher risk of de   veloping premature ovarian failure (POF) and/or fragile X associated tremor/ataxia syndrome (FXTAS) . About 20% of the FXS female pre   mutation carriers present POF and around 15% FXTAS . In order to  evaluate if these pathologies are associated with skewed XCI patterns,  we have studied the X inactivation pattern in 270 FXS females carriers (41 POF, 2 FXTAS, 3 POF and FXTAS, and 224 no POF no FXTAS) .  Results showed that FXS permutation female carriers have a normal  distribution and that there is no correlation with the CGG repeat num   ber . On the basis of these observations we conclude that FXS female  premutation carriers with or without POF and/or FXTAS do not present  skewed X inactivation and therefore, other molecular or environmental factors may predispose to these conditions .

Individuals of normal intelligence, carriers  of a FMR1  unmethylated full mutation, represent rare exceptions . We  previously performed a molecular and epigenetic analysis of a lym   phoblastoid cell line (code 5106), derived from one of these individu   als . Recently, two apparently normal individuals with an unmethylated  full mutation, belonging to distinct FXS families, were identified. From  each subject (named DPM and MA) three independent lymphoblastoid  cell lines and a fibroblast colture (from MA) were established. In ac   cordance with our previous findings, these cell lines showed normal  transcription and reduced translation of the FMR1  gene, compared to  normal controls . Epigenetic analysis of the FMR1  locus demonstrated  lack of DNA methylation and the methylation pattern of lysines 4 and  27 on histone H3 was also similar to that of a normal control, in ac   cordance with the normal transcription and consistent with an euchro   matic configuration. On the other hand, the H3 and H4 acetylation and  the methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 was similar to that of a typical FXS cell line .

Analysis of fragile X premutation and grey zone in paediatric  patients,P01.094,"L. Martorell1, P. Poo2, M. Ferrando2, M. Naudo1, J. GenovÃ©s1, A. Sans2","1Molecular Genetics Section.Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u, Barcelona, Spain,  2Department of Neurology. Hospital Sant Joan de DÃ©u, Barcelona, Spain. ","INTRODUCTION: The number of CGG repeats defines the state of premutation or full mutation in fragile X syndrome (FXS) . In childhood,  full mutation has a characteristic behaviour and physical phenotype .  The adult carriers of the premutation can develop a progressive neuro   degenerative syndrome (FXTAS) . Although the clinical characteristics  of the premutation and grey zone in the childhood are less well known,  clinical experience and case reports suggest that child with premuta   tion and grey zone alleles may have similar clinical features than those  with the full mutation . PATIENTS AND METHODS: Determination of the number of CGG re   peats in samples received in our unit since 2005 for the FXS screen   ing . Detailed Clinical and cognitive evaluation in a series of 13 children (9  boys and 4 girls), born between 1989 and 2000, with clinical suspect of FXS . RESULTS: From the 1092 samples analyzed, 7% (77 cases) we de   tected alleles with 35 to 160 CGG repeats . We havenât detected any  alleles in the permutated or grey zone in the 91 control chromosomes analyzed . The 13 children evaluated clinically have a cognitive behav   ioural phenotype suggestive of full mutation and we detected alleles Clinical genetics between 35 to 53 repeats. Clinical findings in this group of patients will  be commented . CONCLUSIONS: We have detected a big number of alleles in the pre   mutation and grey zone in the population analyzed . Large independent  samples are required to confirm our impression that the grey zone and  premutation in FXS may be associated with important developmental  disabilities and to establish the genotype phenotype relation in chil   dren with this range of repeats .",2008
is FRAXE over represented among Newfoundland children with  cognitive impairment?,P01.095,"A. Dohey1, M. Crowley2, R. Green1, B. Younghusband1, B.

Fragile X syndrome due to mutations in the FMR1  gene is the com   monest cause of inherited mental retardation . In contrast, mutations in  FMR2  (FRAXE) are a much rarer cause of MR . In Newfoundland, only  one family segregating an FMR1 expansion has been identified, but 3  males from 2 families with FRAXE disease have been identified. In this  study, I reviewed the charts of all boys seen from 1994 2004 who had negative FMR1 testing . Participants were recruited using the follow   ing criteria   males with developmental delay, between the ages of 2  and19 and without a specific diagnosis. 139 of 378 individuals met the inclusion criteria, 95 (68%) consented . DNA was collected and ampli   fied using previous published primers. 93 samples were in the normal FRAXE range, 2 failed to amplify  . These 2 samples are being further  studied as possible FRAXE mutations . FRAXE alleles ranged from 4  to 23 repeats with the most common allele size being 13 . A second  part of the study describes the previously identified FRAXE families:  One proband has an FMR2 expansion of 620 repeats . He has a FSIQ  of 54 and is dysmorphic with facial features reminiscent of FRAXA  syndrome. He has a non dysmorphic first cousin with a learning dis   ability and an expansion of 200 repeats . His mother and maternal aunt carry premutations of 120 and 87 repeats respectively  . The second  proband is a non dysmorphic 11 year old with attention deficit disorder and a FSIQ in the 80âs . He has a mosaic FMR2 expansion of 120 820 repeats .",2008

Extensive  workup was normal . Since the pedigree suggested an autosomal recessive mode of in   heritance, autozygosity mapping was performed identifying a unique  region of shared homozygosity of 6,5 Mb on 16q12 between D16S411  and D16S3140 markers. We identified a homozygous missense muta   tion within FTO gene (c .947G>A, p .R316Q), which altered a highly  conserved residue, co segregated with the disease and was not found  in 400 control alleles . While recent studies have revealed a strong association between  intronic variants in FTO gene and childhood and adult obesity, the  pathophysiological mechanism underlying the phenotype observed in our family remains questionable . Noticeably, i n situ  hybridization ex   periments on human embryos showed predominant FTO expression  in tissues affected in patients (central nervous system, heart and fron   tonasal prominence) . Interestingly, a recent study showed that FTO encodes a 2 oxogluta   rate dependent nucleic acid demethylase likely involved in toxic DNA and/or RNA lesions repair  . Moreover, a R316A substitution completely  abolishes Fto activity in vitro  . We consequently propose that the pa   tientsâ mutation is a null mutation and that their phenotype is the con   sequence of defective DNA repair  . Mass spectrometry assays and cel   lular sensitivity to methylating agents measurements are underway to validate this hypothesis . In conclusion, our data suggest that homozygous FTO null mutations  are responsible for a hitherto undescribed multiple congenital anomaly syndrome .",2008

The main  symptoms are: intention tremor, ataxia, parkinsonism, and cognitive decline . Moreover the MRI shows the presence of white matter lesions  of the middle cerebellar penducles . The aim of our study was to look for FXTAS in a large group of Polish  patients affected with ataxia of unknown origin and in controls . The studied group comprised 176 male patients with sporadic cerebel   lar ataxia, with/without other neurological symptoms (age of onset â¥  50 years), in whom molecular tests carried out previously, excluded SCA1,2,3,6,7,8,12,17 and DRPLA .The group of controls was composed of 516 healthy subjects . The  number of CGG repeats was determined by comparison of PCR prod   uct size with size standard after electrophoresis on ABI PRISM377 in 4% denaturing gel . In the ataxia group we found no premutation alleles, and the largest allele found contained 52 CGG repeats . The FMR1  normal allele obtained for the control group ranged from 14  to 56 CGG repeats, with the most frequent 29 CGG alleles . These results indicate that Polish control group is characterized by  similar FMR1  gene polymorphism as other populations . And since pre   mutation in the patients group was not found, we think that FXTAS  among patients with sporadic ataxia is less frequent than we expected;  we plan to enlarge the studied group by including patients with other neurological symptoms, such as parkinsonism .",2008

","The monoamine oxidases MAOA and MAOB are isoenzymes which  catalyse the oxidative deamination of biogenic amines, with substrates  including the neurotransmitters norepinephrine, serotonin and dopa   mine . A number of behavioural traits, such as aggressive and antiso   cial behaviour, and psychiatric conditions, such as schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder, have been associated with MAOA/B dysfunction and  genetic variation at these loci . The MAOA  and MAOB genes occur in tandem but in opposite orien   tations on Xp11 .23 . The two genes share 70% identity at the amino acid level and exhibit identical organisation of their 15 exons . Previ   ous reports of MAOA  and MAOB  deletions have encompassed the  adjacent NDP  gene . Mutations in NDP  cause Norrie disease, a disor   der characterised by blindness, progressive sensorineural deafness and, frequently, mental retardation . Genotype phenotype correlations  in Norrie disease suggest that deletions of NDP  which also extend  to the MAOA/B  genes result in a more severe neurological pheno   type . However, the phenotypic contribution of MAOA/B  gene disrup   tion is difficult to dissect in this context. Here we report an individual  with a submicroscopic deletion which encompasses only the MAOA   and MAOB  genes . The 246kb deletion, which includes exons 2 15 of  MAOA  and the entire coding region of MAOB , was detected by high  resolution long oligonucleotide X chromosome array comparative ge   nomic hybridisation, and confirmed by fluorescence in situ hybridisa   tion .

While in the iso   lated group the Dup24 mutation has not been detected .conclusion:  These findings suggest that c.428_451dup testing is fea   sible and justified in determining the cause of XLMR in males negative for Fragile X syndrome, in the Western Cape region of South Africa . In   corporating this test into the diagnostic protocol stands to improve the  diagnostic yield of patients, which in turn will afford improved genetic management of families . Furthermore, better genetic management will  have a valuable impact on the burden of disease in a developing coun   try such as South Africa .",2008

Lugovska1","1Medical Genetic Clinic, University Children`s Hospital, Riga, Latvia, 2Rigas  Stradins University, Riga, Latvia","Mental retardation (MR) is one of the main reasons for referral in paediatric, child neurological and clinical genetic practice . The prevalence of mental retardation is thought to be on the order of 2 3% . X linked gene defects have long been considered to be important causes of  mental retardation, on the basis of the observation that mental retardation  is significantly more common in males than in females. Clinical observa   tions and linkage studies in families revealed that X linked mental retarda   tion (XLMR) is a highly heterogeneous condition . The most common form of XLMR is the Fragile X mental retardation syndrome (FXS) . Mutations at  FRAXA locus on distal Xq may cause mental impairment . Most common  mutation at FRAXA  locus is expansion of CGG triplet repeats located in the  5â untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1  (FMR1 ) gene . The group of 341 unrelated males with MR referred from clinical geneticists was screened for FXS . CGG repeats number was detected by Applied Bio   systems protocol on ABI Prism 310 . The prevalence of 29, 30 and 31 CGG  repeats for normal alleles were found . Six affected patients were detected  (1.76%). The final diagnosis of FXS was confirmed by Southern blotting.  DNA sequencing for the estimation of AGG inserts structure for gray zone  (34 50 repeats) alleles was used . To analyse undiagnosed XLMR patients we recently introduced the multi   plex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) method to identify de   letions and duplications of MRX genes . We use MLPA P106 MRX commer   cial kit (MRC Holland) to analyse one or more exons of 14 MRX genes .",2008

It is caused by an anomalous expansion of CGG  repeats in the 5âUTR of the FMR1 gene, which are hypermethylated, causing the absence of FMR1 expression . Clinical diagnosis of typical FXS is usually difficult to establish before  puberty and molecular testing is therefore needed to confirm it. Several PCR protocols have already been developed to amplify these repeats, but neither of them is able to amplify full mutated alleles . With a view to improving the molecular analysis of FXS, we have es   tablished a new PCR based strategy  . We analyzed 68 retrospective samples of known repeat sizes to as   sess protocol efficiency and 252 prospective samples. Two PCRs were performed followed by electrophoresis in a DNA se   quencer. Finally, a methylation specific PCR was carried out to test the promoter methylation status . Results from retrospective samples were reproduced with the new pro   tocol, supporting its capability to test the whole range of FMR1 alleles .  Additionally, its sizing accuracy made allele frequency distribution and transmission studies possible . Analysis of prospective samples revealed 13 full mutations, two pre   mutation full mutation mosaicisms, 6 premutations and 10 grey zone patients . Moreover, we have amplified and accurately sized a full mutated allele  of 817 repeats, the longest allele amplified by PCR until now. In conclusion, this PCR approach has improved and speeded up the  FXS diagnosis making it less labor intensive than standard procedures that include Southern blot analysis .Clinical genetics",2008

The study pointed out the importance of  evaluating the whole set of data generated through the analysis for a  correct interpretation of the final results. The work confirmed the sen   sitivity and reliability of the method that allowed to correctly size FMR1  alleles in the different categories of expansions and obtained a robust  amplification of full mutations with up to 600 repeats.

","The study of transcription using genomic tiling arrays has lead to  the identification of numerous additional exons. One example is the  MECP2 gene on the X chromosome; using 5âRACE and RT PCR in  human tissues and cell lines, we have found more than 15 novel ex   ons (RACEfrags) connecting to at least one exon of MECP2 gene and map up to 1 Mb telomeric to it . We subsequently asked if variation  in the novel exons is causatively associated with Rett syndrome . We  sequenced all MECP2 connected exons and flanking sequences in  3 groups: 48 Rett patients without mutations in MECP2 and CDKL5  genes (group_1); 30 Rett patients with mutations in the MECP2 gene  (group_2); 100 control individuals from the same geoethnic group  (group_3) . Approximately 14kb was sequenced per sample, (2 .6Mb  of DNA resequencing). 75 individuals had new, not yet identified rare  variants, but no statistically significant difference was found among the 3 groups . These results suggest that variants in the newly discovered  exons studied do not contribute to Rett syndrome, furthermore if some  of these variants are related to a phenotype, this must be different from Rett . Interestingly however, the variants in the novel exons are twice  as frequent as those found in flanking sequences (50 vs 24 for ap   proximately 1 .3 Mb sequenced for each class of sequences) . The sig   nificance of this result remains to be elucidated; one hypothesis is that  novel exons accumulate variants faster than the rest of the genome  (positive selection?) that could underscore the functional importance of these sequences .",2008

Almost all  are single cases in a family resulting from de novo mutations or the  inheritance of a mutation from an unaffected parent with somatic or germ line mosaicism . Point mutation testing and gene dosage analysis of a cohort of 455  cases referred to our laboratory for MECP2 gene analysis identified mutations in 118 cases . However there were four females who each  had two different de novo causative mutations, presumed to be on the  same chromosome because compound heterozygosity for two caus   ative mutations is likely to be lethal . Two of these cases had a point  mutation and a small intraexonic deletion, a third had a whole exon  deletion and a separate small intraexonic deletion and a fourth had a  small intraexonic deletion and a large duplication.

Genetic diagnosis of the craniosynostosis in spain,P01.127,"D. Arroyo , D. Corella, M. Edo","Progenie molecular, Valencia, Spain","The craniosynostosis consist in an anomalous fusion of cranial bones  that originates problems in the normal growth of the cranium and in   volves dramatic alterations in the shape of the head and the face, and  in some cases severe mental delay. The craniosynostosis is classified  under several syndromes: Apert, Crouzon, Pfeiffer, Beare Stevenson, Saethre Chotzen, Muenke and Jackson Weiss . Each one has a par   ticular pattern of inheritance and a few clinical specific characteris   tics, but in some cases they are difficult to distinguish by the external  aspect, specially when prenatal diagnosis is done by means of the ultrasound scans . The genetic diagnosis allows to detect the cranio   synostosis in the first stages of the pregnancy and to confirm the clini   cal observations . The most important genes associated to these disorders are FGFR1, FGFR 2, FGFR3 and TWIST  . The genetic study of the craniosynosto   sis is complex, and may includes the four genes involved in the pathol   ogy . In this communication we show the results obtained in the study  of these syndromes in Spain . We analysed 38 genes from 19 people, including affected people and their families . We found 5 mutations that  have been reported as the genetic basis of the disease . We also done  a prenatal genetic diagnosis that confirms a Pfeiffer syndrome, previ   ously diagnosed by ultrasound scan . Our results suggest that most of  mutation associated to craniosynostosis are located in a few regions  of these genes, in opposition to what happens with other genetic dis   eases, in which the mutations could be found along the entire gene .",2008

DPC is characterised by mild short stature, complex brachydac   tyly, and fibular aplasia. Affected individuals are homozygotes for loss  of function mutations in the highly conserved mature domain of GDF5  that result in an impaired GDF5 signaling through the Bone Morphoge   netic Protein Receptor 1B (BMPR1B) . We investigated a 20 month old  child with complex brachydactyly and mild proximal fibular hypoplasia,  consistent with DPC, in the absence of short stature and other long bonesâ and jointsâ anomalies . Mutational analysis disclosed compound  heterozygosity for two novel GDF5 mutations, the P436T mutation in  the mature domain, that most likely results in reduced binding to BM   PR1B and the R378Q mutation at the end of the prodomain . The muta   tion R378Q is located within the recognition motif at the processing site of GDF5 where the precursor protein is cleaved and probably results in  at least a partial loss of protein function. Metacarpophalangeal profile  (MCPP) analysis on radiographs of the parents disclosed unremark   able results for the P436T mutation, transmitted from the mother, while  the fatherâs R378Q mutation was associated with a MCPP showing  overlap with BDA1, including brachymesophalangy of all digits and  mild shortening of the entire first digit.

Housh   mand","Special Medical Center, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Pfeiffer syndrome is a rare autosomal dominantly inherited osteochon   drodysplasia with craniosynostosis conditions that is genetically het   erogeneous that can be caused by mutations in the fibroblast growth factor receptor 2 (FGFR2) gene . The FGFR2 gene provides instruc   tions for making a protein called fibroblast growth factor receptor 2.  More than 20 FGFR2 mutations that cause Pfeiffer syndrome have been identified. Several of these mutations change the number of cys   teine amino acids in a critical region of the FGFR2 protein known as the IgIII domain . Sporadic cases of Pfeiffer syndrome have previously been associated with advanced paternal age . The patient in our study was a 2 years old male baby  . His parents were  healthy both under 25 years and they were not consanguineous . Labor  began spontaneously and the infant was delivery vaginally at term with  a birth weight of 2,975 g with the Apgar score of 8 9 . The propositus  had a cloverleaf skull, severe exorbitism, choanal atresia, low set and  posteriorly rotated ears, broad and medially deviated halluces and partial cutaneous syndactyly of the second and third toes . The ocu   lar globes and eyelids were intact with shallow orbits that would have prevented the replacement of the eye . The ocular anterior structures were preserved, without iris or lens abnormalities . The baby developed respiratory distress . Molecular analysis of the patient revealed a heterozygous C342R mu   tation in exon 10 and a missense Tâ C in mRNA further studies on  such sporadic cases recommended enhancing the molecular informa   tion .",2008

One is a 1.9 kb deletion,  removing the entire exon IIIc of the gene and substantial portions of  the flanking introns.

Computational analysis revealed that  the inserted Alu element belongs to a new subfamily, not previously  known to be mobile, which we characterize and term Alu Yk . Previous  analysis of an AS patient with Alu insertion, and a mouse model with  an engineered exon IIIc deletion, indicate that both types of mutation  are likely to cause AS by driving ectopic expression of an FGFR2 iso   form containing the alternatively spliced IIIb exon in mesenchymal tis   sues .

AGC1 mutation screening revealed a common 4bp insertion in exon 11  (2266_2267insGGCA) (BD1) and a second, rarer transition in exon 1 ( 198C>T) (BD2) that co segregated with the disorder  . We performed  allele specific primer extension analysis of mRNA isolated from chon   drocytes of cattle heterozygous for the common insertion (BD1) mu   tation .

Breakpoints were mapped by fluo   rescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) using BAC clones . Where pos   sible, these breakpoints were further delimited using PCR fragments  as FISH probes. The identified candidate genes were screened for pathogenic mutations by direct sequencing . The SFM associated chro   mosome 2 breakpoint was localised at 120 .9 Mb, between the two  main candidate genes, GLI Kruppel family member GLI2 ( GLI2 ) and  inhibin beta B ( INHBB ). No clear pathogenic mutation was identified in  these . The second breakpoint associated with HHES was mapped 2 .5  Mb proximal at 118.4 Mb and the candidate genes identified from this  region were the insulin induced protein 2 ( INSG2 ) and the homeobox  protein engrailed 1 ( EN1). In conclusion we have confirmed the pres   ence of a new SHFM7 locus in the intergenic region between INHBB   and GLI2  . Furthermore, a locus for HHES is proposed 2 .5 Mb proximal  to the previous one . The molecular mechanism proposed for these  congenital anomalies is a sequence of alterations induced by the posi   tional effects introduced by the translocations leading to spatiotempo   ral misregulated  expression of the candidate genes .Clinical genetics",2008

At present, very little is known about the transcriptional regulation of the EXT genes . To elucidate transcriptional regulation of EXT1, we  isolated and characterized the EXT1 promoter  . Methods and results Theoretical analysis of the 10 kb upstream of the EXT1 start codon was  performed with promoter prediction programs TSSG, TSSW, FPROM,  BDGP, Promoter 2 .0 Prediction Server and Web Promoter Scan . This  showed presence of a CpG island containing CG and CAAT boxes but no TATA box which, characteristic for a housekeeping gene . Two po   tential functional promoter regions were identified located respectively ~2 .650 bp and ~900 bp upstream of the start codon . Overlapping PCR fragments of the 10 kb putative EXT1 promoter re   gion were generated and cloned in the pGL4 .72 Luciferase Reporter  Vector  . Promoter activity was determined by luciferase assays after  transfection in Human Embryonic Kidney (HEK) cells . This situated  the actual core promoter within the fragment containing the predicted  sequence ~900 bp upstream of the start codon.

In healthy bone,  a balance is achieved between the production of bone by osteoblasts, and the break down of bone by osteoclasts . In osteopetrosis, osteo   clasts donât function normally, and the production of bone by osteo   blasts leads to bones that are abnormally dense and brittle . Osteope   trosis may result from conditions which interfere with the production of osteoclasts and their ability to remove bone . Several forms of osteopetrosis exist . The most common form is au   tosomal dominant . The most severe form of osteopetrosis is termed  infantile osteopetrosis, as affected individuals usually have difficulties  soon after birth, inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern . The dis   ease is very rare, with about 1/300,000 children having severe osteo   petrosis . The candidate genes for Osteopetrosis are TCIRG1, CLCN7  genes . The spectrum of CLCN7 related osteopetrosis includes in   fantile malignant CLCN7 related autosomal recessive osteopetrosis,  intermediate autosomal and autosomal dominant osteopetrosis type  II .

Previous studies have identified a long range regulator for SHH  ex  pression in the limb bud residing in a highly conserved non coding  sequence about 1 Mb upstream from the SHH  gene itself . As shown  in mice point mutations within this non coding regulatory region desig   nated ZRS lead to ectopic expression of Shh in the anterior margin of  the limb bud and thus to preaxial extra digits .

The gene  encodes a transcription factor that functions as a repressor for GATA  mediated transcription . The activity of transcription factors is often  controlled by post translational modifications. And in fact, we have re   cently found that SUMOylation of specific sites within the repression domain (RD) of TRPS1 regulates its function . In a yeast two hybrid screen we identified two clones encoding amino acids (aa) 352 505 of the 986 aa protein ARKADIA . ARKADIA is a  RINGfinger ubiquitin ligase. In mice, Arakdia is known as a key regula   tor in the TGF beta pathway by inducing the ubiquitin dependent deg   radation of Smad7, SnoN and c Ski . By using a variety of truncated  TRPS1 and ARKADIA constructs we could narrow down the ARKA   DIA binding region within TRPS1 to the last 100 aa, which includes the RD . ARKADIA appears to interact with TRPS1 via two different  regions, which were also described to enable the interaction of ARKA   DIA with SMAD7 . TRPS1 is known to be localized within the nucleus .  Selective inhibition of the proteasome complex with lactacystin results  in cytoplasmic accumulation of TRPS1 in cells co transfected with ARKADIA . Furthermore, in luciferase reporter gene assays we could show that ARKADIA decreases the repressional activity of TRPS1 .

Variability in expression has been reported both within and among families . Mutations in VEGFR3 with resultant dysgenesis  of microlymphatic vessels cause this disease . It is inherited in an auto   somal dominant manner with incomplete penetrance (85 90%) . Objective: We describe phenotype of Milroy disease in two genera   tion Spanish family  . Molecular analysis of VEGFR3 gene has been  performed . Clinical description: A girl was referred at 2 years of age because of  bilateral swelling of feet since birth, more evident on the right foot,  which partially decreased during the first year of life. She had dys   plastic 2 4rth toenails. She was the first child of a young and non con   sanguineous couple . Her father referred swelling of feet at birth which  disappeared progressively during childhood . He had dysplastic toe   nails . Soon after a sister was born with swelling of feet and distal part of limbs as well . She is now 4 years old and the lymphedema is stable;  dysplastic nails are not present . The son of a fatherâs asymptomatic  sister has also been born with bilateral swelling of feet . Analysis of VEGFR3 gene revealed a heterozygote mutation c .3056T>C in exon 22 in the two girls and their father  .

Muta   tions in the gene, vasculo endothelial growth factor receptor, VEGFR3  (FLT4),  are known to cause Milroy disease, but there is uncertainty  about the prevalence of VEGFR3  mutations in patients with primary  lymphoedema and more specifically in those with a phenotype that resembles Milroy disease . This study addresses this issue and there   by delineates the Milroy disease phenotype . Fifty four patients with  primary lymphoedema were analysed for mutations in VEGFR3  . Pa  tients were divided into four groups: Typical Milroy disease with family  history (group I), typical Milroy disease with no family history (group  II), atypical Milroy disease (group III), and complex primary lymphoe   dema (group IV) . Results demonstrated that with rigorous phenotyping Clinical genetics the likelihood of detecting VEGFR3  mutations is optimised . Mutation  prevalence is 72% in typical Milroy patients with a family history (group  I) and 64% if positive family history is not a diagnostic criterion . A posi   tive family history is not essential in Milroy disease . The likelihood of  detecting VEGFR3  mutations in patients who have a phenotype which  is not typical of Milroy disease is very small (<5%) . For the 22 mutation  positive patients, 14 novel VEGFR3  mutations were identified, two of  which were in exon 22 and one in exon 17, confirming that these exons  should be included in VEGFR3 analysis .",2008

The SOS1  E433K mutation, identified in a patient diagnosed as CFC, has previ   ously been reported in patients with NS . In one NS patient, we also  identified a BRAF K499E mutation, previously reported in patients with CFC . We thus suggest involvement also of BRAF in the pathogenesis of NS . Taken together, our results indicate that the molecular and clinical  overlap between CFC and NS is more complex than previously sug   gested and that the syndromes might even present as allelic disorders .  Furthermore, we suggest that the diagnosis should be refined to, e.g.,  NS PTPN11 associated or CFC  BRAF associated after the genetic  defect has been established since this may have an impact on progno   sis and treatment of the patients .",2008

We established a service in 2002 to analyse exons 3 and 8 of this gene which contain ~80% of known NS mutations . Since 2005  we have screened all exons in which mutations had been identified  and thus allowed molecular confirmation of LS. Mutations in the SOS1, RAF1 and KRAS  genes, which also encode  proteins in the RAS MAPK pathway, have been identified in 10 20% of  PTPN11  negative NS cases . RAF1 mutations have also been identi   fied in a proportion of PTPN11  negative LS cases . We have set up a  diagnostic service to analyse the known mutation containing exons of  SOS1  and RAF1  and all exons of KRAS  . Testing involves a dHPLC  pre screen followed by bidirectional sequencing of any variants . We  have identified 12 pathogenic mutations in SOS1  and RAF1 in our  initial cohort of 110 PTPN11  negative cases referred for NS/LS . This  analysis is now integrated with the PTPN11  screen to facilitate a com   prehensive molecular investigation of NS and LS referrals .",2008

PTPN11  encodes SHP2, an SH2 domain contain   ing protein tyrosine phosphatase functioning as a signal transducer  .  Generally, different substitutions of a particular amino acid residue  are observed in these diseases, indicating that the crucial factor is the residue being replaced . For a few codons, only one substitution  is observed, suggesting the possibility of specific roles for the residue introduced . We analyzed the  biochemical behavior and ligand bind   ing properties of all possible substitutions arising from single base  changes affecting codons 42, 139, 279, 282 and 468 to investigate the  mechanisms underlying the invariant occurrence of the T42A, E139D  and I282V substitutions in NS and the Y279C and T468M changes in LS . Our data demonstrate that the isoleucine to valine change at co   don 282 is the only substitution at that position perturbing the stability  of SHP2âs closed conformation without impairing catalysis, while the  threonine to alanine change at codon 42, but not other substitutions of  that residue, promotes increased phosphopeptide binding affinity. The  recognition specificity of the C SH2 domain bearing the E139D sub   stitution differed substantially from its wild type counterpart acquiring  binding properties similar to those observed for the N SH2 domain, re   vealing a novel mechanism of SHP2âs functional dysregulation . Finally,  while functional selection does not seem to occur for the substitutions  at codons 279 and 468, we point to deamination of the methylated cytosine at nucleotide 1403 as the driving factor leading to the high prevalence of the T468M change in LS .",2008

Whenever necessary, mu   tations have been reevaluated at the light of the currently available techniques . The database includes 2270 entries corresponding to  2070 independent mutational events identified in either male patients (2034) or symptomatic female carriers (36) . These mutations consist  in 1420 deletions, 261 duplications, and 449 small rearrangements of which 39 .1% are nonsense . Most of them are unpublished . Experts in  the DMD gene and related diseases are responsible for data quality and accuracy  . In addition to gather mutations, the UMD DMD France  includes available data on dystrophin and RNA analysis, phenotypic groups, and transmission . The database aims to include extensive de   scription of phenotypes associated with the reported mutations to bet   ter delineate the clinical spectrum of dystrophinopathies and to allow genotype/phenotype correlations . In addition to the existing routines  in the UMD software, new tools have been specifically developed to facilitate large scale mutation analyses of the DMD gene . UMD DMD  is a searchable anonymous database which will benefit to all the sci   entific community interested in dystrophinopathies including geneti   cists, clinicians, and researchers involved in the design of therapeutic strategies . It will prove useful also to implement forthcoming global  registries of patients for clinical trials as ultimate goal within the Euro   pean network of excellence for treatment of neuromuscular disorders (TREAT NMD) .",2008
Analysis of duplications within the DmD gene,P01.201,"B. Dworniczak , E. Minor, S. Hamer, B. Hitschfeld, P. Pennekamp","University of Muenster, Muenster, Germany","The DMD gene is one of the largest human genes identified, span   ning more than 2000 kb of genomic DNA encoding a 14 kb transcript .  It is known that 60 to 65% of the mutations causing DMD/BMD are large deletions in the dystrophin gene . The deletions are nonrandomly   distributed and occur primarily in the center (80%) and less frequently  near the 5â end (20%) of the gene . The large size of the gene may account for part of the high deletion rate . However because of the  nonrandom distribution of the deletions, in addition to target size, other  factors must be involved like variation in chromosomal stability  . Although partial gene duplications in the DMD gene were reported to  be relatively frequent (5%   10%), only recently   with the development  of MLPA   detection of duplications in male patients and deletions and  duplication in female carriers became feasible in a routine setting and  first data concerning frequency and distribution of duplications within the DMD gene became available . These data show that unlike the deletion distribution, the majority of  the duplications (80%) are found at the 5â end of the gene and only  20% in the central region suggesting that deletions and duplication  originate by different mechanism . To investigate the mechanism causing duplications in more detail and  to compare this mechanism with mechanism causing deletions in the  same region of the gene we precisely mapped duplication breakpoints and sequenced six of them . First data of these comparisons will be presented .",2008

Beside myotonia of variable severity, transitory weakness (TW) can be detected, especially in recessive cases . Neurophysiologi   cally, TW corresponds to a transitory depression (TD) of the compound muscle action potential during repetitive nerve stimulation (RNS) . We  sought to correlate specific CLCN1 mutations with both TW and RNS  induced TD in 28 patients with recessive MC, by adopting a low fre   quency RNS protocol (3Hz for 500 stimuli) . The 3Hz RNS induced a  significant TD in 19 patients, all of whom experienced variable epi   sodes of TW. Several mutations appeared to correlate with specific TD patterns . In particular, the homozygous exon 9 deletion, C481X and IVS1+3A>T mutations (5 cases), as well as the compound het   erozygous mutations G482R and T550R (1 case), always resulted in marked TD . Conversely, F167L seems to associate with mild or no TD,  since 8 of 10 patients carrying this mutation (in compound heterozy   gosity with other mutations) had clinical absence of TW and a negative RNS test . Finally, the 3 patients heterozygous for the A531V change  (compound with either R377X or R894X) presented a peculiar pattern  of fluctuating TD. This study shows that the 3Hz RNS protocol, well  tolerated by patients, is able to identify distinct neurophysiological TD  patterns correlating with specific CLCN1 mutations.

Rouleau1","1Center of excellence in neuromics, Notre Dame CHUM, Montreal, Canada, QC, Canada, 2University of McGill, Montreal, QC, Canada","Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is an autosomal domi   nant late onset myopathy characterized by progressive eyelid droop   ing, swallowing difficulty and proximal limb weakness. OPMD results  from the expansion of a polyalanine repeat (GCG)8 13 in exon 1 of  the poly(A)binding protein nuclear1  (PABPN1) gene . Nuclear aggre   gates consisting of tubular filaments within muscle fibers of OPMD patients are the pathological hallmark of the disease . These aggre   gates contain expanded PABPN1 (expPABPN1), poly(A)RNA as well  as components of the ubiquitin proteasome degradation pathway and molecular chaperones . Whether nuclear aggregates are pathogenic or  simply the consequence of a molecular defense mechanism remains  controversial in OPMD and in the field of neurodegenerative disorders.  To evaluate the contribution of nuclear aggregates to cellular toxicity,  we first targeted molecular mechanisms known to interfere with exp   PABPN1 aggregation . Our cellular model shows that increasing the  availability of nuclear soluble expPABPN1 significantly exacerbates cell death . We also used time lapse imaging to follow the evolution of  cells overexpressing expPABPN1 without interfering with any cellular  pathway. Cells with nuclear aggregates show a significantly prolonged  lifespan compared to cells harbouring a diffusely distributed soluble  expPABPN1. This is the first report indicating the beneficial effect of nuclear aggregation in OPMD . The formation of nuclear aggregates  may reflect an active process by which cells sequester and inactivate the soluble toxic form of expPABPN1 . The structural change in exp   PABPN1, induced by the pathogenic alanine expansion, may lead to a  gain of aberrant protein interactions, or alternatively prevent normally occurring interactions to take place .",2008

Acute type I patients usually have one two copies and chronic type  II and III patients usually have three four copies . Traditionally, the link   age analysis with C212 and C272(ag1 CA) markers was helpful in es   timating the SMN2 copies . Quantitative real time analysis (Q RT) and  recently multiple ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) have  been incorporated into laboratory diagnosis to establish the SMN2 copies with greater accuracy  . We compared the SMN2 copy number of 22 unrelated Spanish SMA  patients with SMN1 absence, correlating the three aforementioned approaches . Using marker analysis, we determined the maximum  number of alleles by C212 or C272(ag1 CA), estimating the number of SMN2 copies . The marker results of the respective parents were used  to confirm the copy number. In 4 cases, marker analysis predicted two  SMN2 copies and Q RT (LightCycler) and MLPA revealed three SMN2 copies . This discordance may be the result of an uninformative marker  .  In 2 other cases, marker results predicted at least three SMN2 copies  although Q RT showed two copies and MLPA results were compatible  with three copies.

Here we present a comprehensive study of a large portion of the Hungarian DMD/BMD families using different molecular approaches . Deletions in the hot spots regions were identified by multiplex PCR,  whereas rare deletions and duplications were detected by Southern  blot analysis and Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique in the patients . Moreover, the same techniques were  used for detecting carrier status in female relatives and in manifesting  carriers and efficiencies of the two techniques were compared.

Although pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) Southern  blot (SB) analysis is considered as the reference method for molecular  diagnosis of CMT1A/HNPP, several methods such as fluorescence in  situ hybridization (FISH), short tandem repeat (STR) analysis, multi   plex fluorescence PCR, and real time PCR have been tried to avoid laborious and time consuming PFGE SB method . Methods: We tried to evaluate newly developed multiplex ligation me   diated probe amplification (MLPA) method for the detection of the spe   cific 1.5 Mb duplication/deletion by prospectively testing 31 patients referred for differential diagnoses of CMT1A or HNPP  . MLPA probe  mixes contain TEKT3, PMP22, FLJ25830, BX089850 and COX10 genes within the CMT1A/HNPP region . The results with MLPA method were compared with our current PFGE SB method . Results: Thirteen out of 31 patients were diagnosed as having either  duplication (n,3) or deletion (n,9) by PFGE SB method and all the results were concordant with those by MLPA analysis . The turnaround  time (TAT) by MLPA is estimated to be 4 days while TAT by PFGE SB is approximately 17 days . Conclusions: MLPA is a sensitive and specific technique for the detec   tion of duplication or deletion of PMP22 gene and its turnaround time is much shorter than the PFGE Southern blotting . Therefore, MLPA could be a good alternative method replacing laborious PFGE SB analysis .",2008

Background: Positional cloning of chromosomal translocation breakpoints in autism  patients is a valuable strategy towards the identification of candidate  genes, especially in isolated autism, and when the aberration is de novo and family history is negative for autism . (1) Objectives:  We describe a nondysmorphic patient with autism and full scale IQ  of 76, who carries a complex translocation involving chromosomes 3,5,16 and a pericentromeric inversion on chromosome 4 . Methods:  1Mb BAC array CHG was performed to uncover possible submicro   scopic imbalances. The breakpoints were finemapped with FISH. Results: On array CGH, a ~1Mb microdeletion encompassing the clone NON   SC8G10 was detected . Only 1 gene, cadherin 11 ( CDH11 ) was locat   ed in this region . Of the remaining 6 breakpoints, one disrupted the  AK13094  gene, another was near GFOD  and RANBP10  . Conclusions: In this patient with a complex chromosomal aberration, the CDH11   gene was found to be heterozygously deleted . Cdh11  is expressed in  the lymbic system and hippocampus in mice and may play a role in the organisation of central synapses . (2) Interestingly, there is evidence that  altered synaptogenesis is implicated in the pathogenesis of autism .  For instance, the cell adhesion molecules NLGN 3  and  4 are impli   cated in autism through their role in the establishment of functional presynaptic terminals in contacting axons . (3) Thus, CHD11  represents  both a positional and functional candidate gene for autism . Mutation  screening in a larger cohort of autism patients is ongoing .

These clinical features make difficult differential diagnosis with the  benign familial hematuria due to heterozygous mutations of COL4A4  .  On the other hand, we are unable to demonstrate a genotype pheno   type correlation with the type and the site of the COL4A4  mutations . A  correct diagnosis and prognosis is based on a comprehensive clinical investigation in as many family members as possible .",2008

ARA  appears to be genetically heterogeneous: it has been associated with  mutations in three genes: PITX2  (on chromosome 4q25), FOXC1 (also  named FKHL7 ) (6p25), and PAX6  (11p13) . SUBJECTS AND METHODS : Five members of a three generation  family affected by vascular leukoencephalopathy and ARA, were clini   caly and geneticaly investigated . RESULTS : Diffuse leukoencephalopathy associated with ocular mal   formations of the Axenfeld Rieger type was observed in the 5 affected individuals . Genetic linkage analyses directed toward three loci associ   ated with hereditary vasculopathies and on the four loci known to be  associated with ARA showed a possible association with the two loci  11p13( PAX6 ) and 13q34 ( COL4A1 ) . Direct sequencing of the COL4A1   gene led to the identification of a novel missense mutation p.G720D, which cosegregates with the disease . CONCLUSION : We delineate a novel association between the Axen  feld Rieger anomaly and leukoencephalopathy and stroke . Our data  confirm that mutations in the COL4A1  gene can be responsible for  ARA in humans, as suggested by previous studies in Col4a1  mutated  mice .",2008

It is a  rare, but possibly underdiagnosed, autosomal dominant condition with  variable expressivity in which the main clinical features are orofacial clefts, ectodermal defects and ocular abnormalities . The ectodermal  defects are mainly oligodontia, delayed dentition, conical crown form,  hair abnormalities (pili torti, sparse hair, eyebrows and eyelashes) and hypo/dysplastic nails . The ocular abnormalities comprise ectropion of  the lower eyelid, distichiasis of the upper eyelid, euryblepharon and lagophthalmos .

Guerrero","Hospital de la Ribera, Alzira (Valencia), Spain","Autosomal dominant nocturnal frontal lobe epilepsy (ADNFLE, OMIM  600513) has long been misdiagnosed as nocturnal paroxysmal dysto   nia, parasomnias, or psychiatric disturbances . It is characterized by  clusters of brief nocturnal motor seizures, which originate in the frontal  cortex . The results of interictal electroencephalogram are usually nor   mal, as are computed tomographic scans and magnetic resonance im   ages . Seizures are usually well controlled by carbamazepine; however,  the recurrence risk after drug withdrawal often persists for life . This  syndrome is inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with a pen   etrance of 70% to 80% . Mutations in the alfa 4 subunit of the neuronal  nicotinic acetylcholine receptor gene (CHRNA4) has been described in several families as responsible of ADNFLE . We have studied a family with ADNFLE from the east of Spain . The   clinical appearance of the disease in this family was very similar to pre   viously described cases in which mutations in exon 5 of the CHRNA4  gene were found . So, the exon 5 of the CHRNA4 gene was ampli   fied between nucleotides 535 and 825 and polymerase chain reaction  products were purified and sequenced directly. We have identified in  three affected members of family a identify a C to T transition in the  CHRNA4 gene, resulting in a Ser 248 to Phe (S248F) substitution in  the sixth amino acid position of the transmembrane domain 2 (M2) .  Some authors have suggested that the mutation caused reduced re   ceptor function .

In both  the case and control group, mothers of children with oral cleft, urinary  tract, limb reduction and neural tube defects were excluded, because  the risk of these defects are probably reduced by maternal folic acid supplementation . Potential confounding factors of periconceptional fo   lic acid use included; maternal body mass index, education, maternal  age at delivery of index baby, smoking behaviour and alcohol use dur   ing pregnancy were explored . Adequate use of periconceptional folic acid supplements revealed an odds ratio of 0 .81 (95%CI 0 .67 0 .96) for all types of CHD . Subgroup  analysis showed an odds ratio of 0 .60 (95%CI 0 .42 0 .86) for isolated  ventricular septal defects . Periconceptional folic acid supplements ap   pear to reduce the prevalence of CHD with approximately 20% .

We present data on 42 Portuguese patients with Cornelia de Lange  Syndrome, observed by Clinical Geneticists according to the same  clinical protocol, including prenatal and birth history, development,  physical features and multisystem involvement . According to their  phenotype patients were classified as mild, moderate or severe. The  entire coding region (exons 2 to 47) and exon intron junctions of the NIPBL gene was sequenced . Population screening was carried out for undocumented variants . In mutation positive cases sequence analysis was extended to the parents . Ongoing sequencing of NIPBL to date  revealed the presence of heterozygous mutations in 11 patients from 10 unrelated families, 7 of which are novel . Two individuals with a  nonsense mutation in NIPBL are siblings with a mild phenotype, pro   viding further evidence that CdLS familial cases may remain under diagnosed .

ECEMC is a hospital based case control study covering, in 2005, 22,96% of total of newborns in Spain . Here we present the results of  the epidemiological study of some clinical and etiological characteris   tics of infants with CACC registered by ECEMC programme .The ECEMC calculated a frequency of 1 .08/10,000 births for the  CACC. Non specified type of agenesia was the most frequent group and total agenesia the most infrequent . Taking into account the clinical  features, the isolated cases represented only 6% of total newborns;  the syndromic ones accounted for 29%, and multiply malformed (sev   eral congenital defects without an identified etiologic link) represented 65% . If we correlate the clinical and the anatomopathologic types, the  most frequent among the isolated cases was non specified agenesia.  Correlating the anatomopathology and the genetic aetiology, 48,21% of them had a chromosomal origin . It has been described an associa   tion of CACC with several chromosomic alterations: del(5p), del(1qter), del(18q), del(6p25), dup(3q) and del(10q) . In order to carry out a right follow up of the cases with CACC, whether  prenatal or postnatal, the most important points to take into account  are: 1) detailed ultrasound of Central Nervous System, 2) precise  familial anamnesis including three generations, 3) foetal or neonatal high resolution karyotype, and 4) Magnetic Resonance Imaging .

Linkage  analysis mapped the locus to chromosome 14q13 q21 and a F382L  causative mutation was identified in SEC23A  . Detailed molecular and  biochemical analysis of wild type and mutant SEC23A, an integral  member of the COPII mediated ER to Golgi trafficking pathway, led to  better characterization of intracellular trafficking in health and disease.  A zebrafish morpholino model recapitulated the human phenotype.  Recently, an unrelated individual with clinical features consistent with  CLSD was identified. Molecular analysis of SEC23A identified a novel heterozygous SEC23A mutation involving a highly conserved residue .  This missense mutation was inherited from the unaffected father and was not present in 400 control chromosomes . No mutations were  found in the maternal alleles and SEC23A  real time PCR analysis  showed normal expression of the alleles .

Aged 19 months, global  psychomotor delay was noted (sitting at 11 months, but no speech  or walking), as well as dysmorphic facial features, with round face,  erythematous cheeks, short hypoplastic nose, long convex philtrum, microstomia, and low set small ears . Pelvis X rays showed changes in the left femoral head, atypical for classical congenital hip dysplasia .  Based on these findings, the hypothesis of some form of chondrodys   plasia punctata was raised, but could not be substantiated radiologi   cally. Follow up confirmed the mild global learning disability with nor   mal growth parameters, apart from a leg length discrepancy, the left being 2 cm shorter  . The rarity of published patients with comparable duplications make  genotype phenotype correlations difficult. Given a previous report  of a duplication 16p13 in a patient with chondrodysplasia punctata  (Hunter, 1985), we hypothesise that overexpression of gene(s) in the  microduplication is responsible for abnormal bone development lead   ing to teratological hip dysplasia .

One of the major diagnostic criteria for cutis laxa is to detect  abnormal elastin fibers in skin biopsy. In several other, clinically simi   lar autosomal recessive syndromes, however, the classic histological  anomalies are not present, and the clinical diagnosis remains uncer   tain . In some children with cutis laxa mutations have been demonstrat   ed in the elastin and fibulin genes, but the underlying genetic etiology is still unknown in the majority of patients . Recently, mutations were  discovered in the ATP6V020  gene in several consanguineous families  with autosomal recessive cutis laxa . This genetic defect is associated  with abnormal glycosylation in the Golgi apparatus, leading to a distinct combined N  and O linked glycosylation disorder  . Interestingly, similar  mutations were also confirmed in patients with wrinkly skin syndrome,  without the presence of severe skin symptoms with elastin deficiency.  These findings suggest that the cutis laxa and wrinkly skin syndromes are phenotypic variants of the same disorder  . The variable presence  of protein glycosylation disorders in patients with diverse phenotype in  the wrinkled skin cutis laxa spectrum necessitates revisiting the defini   tion of clinical diagnostic criteria in order to offer adequate prognosis assessment and counselling . Hereby we describe the spectrum of clinical features of the various forms of ARCL syndrome .

Recently, some clinical  features of ECCL and OCCS were reviewed and diagnostic criteria were established . Herein, we describe a male infant whose clinical signs suggest ECCL . Besides the main features, he also had a com   pound odontoma, already reported but not frequent in ECCL and in similar conditions . However, the pattern of genital anomalies has not  been reported so far  . It includes asymmetrical penoscrotal transposi   tion, ectopic left hypoplasic hemiscrotum, and a pedunculated perineal  mass, whose aspect suggested a rudimentar accessory scrotum; the  phallus had a normal length with an increase of subcutaneous tissue in  prepucial region . This phenotype is quite rare and has been described  in association with perineal lipoma or lipoblastoma, which probably  arose in the perineum and divided the moving labioscrotal swelling into three parts, during early fetal life . The same mechanism is proposed  in present case, considering that in ECCL there are a few reports of  lipomas, lipomatous mass and/or skin tags located outside the cranio   facial region, including in genital area .",2008

","An eponym is a person after whom a discovery, invention, etc ., is named . Eponyms are widely used in all clinical disciplines . Recently, a  provocative editorial published in British Medical Journal argued that their use should be abandoned . The London Dysmorphology Data  base currently reports >5000 diseases: 44% of them are designated by eponyms . We wondered how eponyms are perceived among clinical geneticists in Italy  . By administering a questionnaire on the use of eponyms, we  wanted to explore also the attitude of clinical geneticists towards no   menclature and its regulation . The home made, Likert type question   naire consisted of 10 items exploring the attitude towards eponyms  through the following domains: role of historical aspects, value in  learning, use in clinical practice, facilitation of scientific discussion, convenience . Two additional items pertained to the need for rules in  nomenclature . Scores were modelled as discrete variables and anal   ysed by descriptive statistics . We collected 102 (84%) fully filled in questionnaires. The median val   ue of the total score modelling the attitude towards eponyms was close  to neutrality, with a trend in favour of eponyms . When the participants  were asked to state a radical position (keep or abolish), 73% answered  to prefer keeping use of eponyms. We found a marginally significant  correlation between attitude in favour of eponyms and both age and years of practice . Regardless their position with respect to eponyms,  the vast majority stated that the use of nomenclatures should be ruled  by guidelines. Our findings provided a surprising impression of interest in the subject and underscored the need for recommendations .",2008

Genetic testing of this rare Mendelian disorder (MIM no 249100) is effi   cient for early diagnosis, especially for atypic cases . Certain mutations  have significant correlation with renal amyloidosis, the most severe possible manifestation of FMF  . Also genetic testing is very important  for colchicine therapy correction .

Every week we have 35 50 new cases . We have revealed that FMF is caused by presense of single mutation in 18 .6% of heterozygote carriers . Our results confirm that the MEFV  gene analysis provides the objec   tive diagnostic criterion for FMF (characterisation of the two MEFV   mutated alleles in more than 90% of the patients) . Molecular testing  is also used to screen the MEFV  gene for mutations in patients with  a clinical suspicion of FMF  .

The etiology  of HPE is extremely heterogeneous and can include both a terato   genic and/or genetic basis . We studied four genes known to be in   volved in HPE, namely SHH, ZIC2, SIX3  and TGIF  by sequence and  MLPA analysis . A series of in total 72 sporadic and familial HPE cases with a variable clinical spectrum has been analysed . We detected 17  pathogenic mutations (24%) in total, of which 2 in SHH , 6 in ZIC2  and  9 in SIX3  . Only one mutation (Alanine tract expansion in ZIC2 ) was  reported previously and detected twice in this population, all others were novel . Two mutations were complete gene deletions (one  SIX3 ,  one ZIC2  deletion) of which the deletion sizes were further character   ized using the 250K nsp I Affymetrix SNP array  . The familial muta   tions displayed great phenotypic heterogeneity of the disease, which  makes it difficult to establish genotype phenotype correlations. This  phenotypic variability may be due both to environmental factors and  to potential modifier genes.

Subjects  with symptomatic HD were interviewed using a questionnaire to as   certain pre morbid lifestyle during three life stages (teens, 20s/30s,  40s/50s). Recorded activities were classified as physical, intellectual or passive, and activity scores generated . Surveys were matched with  the subjectâs age at onset and CAG repeat length . Preliminary analysis (n,92) showed a mean age at onset of 44 .9  years (range 21 76), with a strong inverse correlation to CAG repeat length (r, 0 .728, p<0 .001) . Linear regression indicated a negative as   sociation between average pre morbid leisure time passivity and age at onset (b, 0 .744, R 2,0.109, p,0.001) that remained significant when  adjusted for CAG repeat length (b, 0 .333, R2,0 .55, p,0 .048) .

","In 1970, Mabry et al . described multiple cases of persistent hyper   phosphatasia associated with developmental delay and seizures in a single consanguineous family (OMIM#239300) . The nosology of this  condition, however, is uncertain. We report five new cases that help  delineate this disorder and provide further evidence favouring autoso   mal recessive inheritance, with sib recurrence in one instance (French  non consanguinous parents), and consanguinity (Lebanese parents)  in another. Common to all five children is the Mabry triad of tonic clonic  seizures (usually beginning around one year of age), moderate to se   vere developmental delay, and persistently elevated alkaline phospha   tase activity, without any indication of liver or metabolic bone disease .  The degree of hyperphosphatasia varies considerably amongst cases (~1 .3 to 20 times the upper age adjusted reference limit) . In addition,  all five display a common facial dysmorphism, characterized by hyper   telorism, broad nasal bridge, and tented mouth . The three singleton  cases also have brachytelephalangy, but there is no evidence of skel   etal anomalies in the two siblings. In the family first described by Mabry et al ., at least one affected was noted to have intracellular inclusions  on biopsy of rectal mucosa but not liver  . In three of our cases, inclu   sions have been observed in cultured cells, but the cells are not uni   formly perturbed and characterization is still in progress . We are aware  of additional cases in the literature which suggest a wider phenotypic  spectrum, but they are consistent with an autosomal recessive con   dition characterized by hyperphosphatasia, seizures, and neurologic  deficit   a disorder we call Mabry syndrome.",2008

Disease penetrance and the risk of SCD in  mutation carriers are unknown . We investigated the prevalence of a  clinical diagnosis of HCM and the presence of risk factors for SCD at  the first cardiological evaluation after presymptomatic genetic testing  in asymptomatic carriers of a MYBPC3 gene mutation . Methods: 235 asymptomatic mutation carriers were cardiologically evaluated on the presence of HCM and risk factors for SCD . A com   parison was made for different types of MYBPC3 gene mutations .Results: A clinical diagnosis of HCM could be made in 22 .6% of car   riers . Disease penetrance at 65 years was incomplete for all types of MYBPC3 gene mutations . Women were affected less often (p,0 .003)  and disease penetrance was lower (p,0 .024) . 22 asymptomatic carri   ers had â¥ two risk factors for SCD. In nine a clinical diagnosis of HCM  could be made and they were therefore at high risk for SCD . Conclusion: A diagnosis of HCM can be made in almost one quarter  of mutation carriers at first evaluation. Disease penetrance of HCM in  MYBPC3 gene mutation carriers is incomplete at 65 years and differs between men and women . Risk factors were frequently present and 4% of carriers appeared to be at high risk for SCD .

MyBPC3 mutations  have been associated with later diagnosis and less hypertrophy than MYH7 mutations . Our objectives were to compare the prevalence of  mutations and the phenotypic characteristics associated with both genes in our patients with HCM . Methods: SSCP analysis and sequencing of fragments with abnormal  MyBPC3 gene mobility were carried out in 130 consecutive index pa   tients with HCM previously studied for the MHY7 gene (10% mutated) .  The phenotypes of patients with and without mutations in both genes were compared . Results: We identified 16 MyBPC3 different mutations (8 of them nov   el) in 20 patients (15 .4%) . Age at diagnosis was similar in MyBPC3 vs .  MYH7 patients (46 .2 vs . 46 .0, p ns) . More than 50% (11) of MyBPC3  mutated patients were diagnosed before 50 years of age, 35% (7) <  40 and 15% (3) < 30 .

FernÃ¡ndez, A. Castro Beiras, M. Hermida Prieto","Instituto Universitario de Ciencias de la Salud, A CoruÃ±a, Spain","Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), an autosomal dominant disorder  and the leading cause of sudden cardiac death in the young, is caused by mutations in genes encoding sarcomeric proteins . One of the most  common genetic causes for HCM involves mutations is MYBPC3, the gene encoding cardiac myosin binding protein C . To determine the spectrum of mutations in MyBPC3 gene, 130 index cases were tested . A total of 16 different mutations, including 8 novel ones, were iden   tified in 20 families (15.4%): 9 missense (D75N,A216T,V471E,R49 5W,R502Q[in 2 families], E542Q[in 3 families],T957S,R1022P[in 2  families],E1179K, 4 delections (Q327fs,K504del, K600fs,P955fs) and 3 intronic regions (IVS6+5G>A,IVS11 9G>A,IVS29+5G>A) . Ten of the mutations were identified on 7 of the 34 exons studied.  Exons 16 and 17 could be âhot spotsâ due to the fact that 35% of the families presented a mutation in these exons . The average of age in the index cases with mutation was 50 years . Four carriers relatives  werenât diagnosed HCM but they were below mean age of diagnose, so it is possible that they havenât yet developed the phenotype . Be   sides, there were 3 relatives without conclusive diagnostic of HCM that didnât present mutation; this could suggest mutations in other genes . In conclusion, MyBPC3 is one of the genes most commonly affected  by HCM causing mutations which leads to a relatively mild phenotype with an adult age of onset . Furthermore, the existence of individuals  with HCM but without mutation in MyBPC3, suggests the presence of additional disease causing mutations in other genes .",2008

MATERIAL & METHODS : Questionnaire data and results of physi   cal examinations on 530 ICSI children from azoospermic fathers from  whom testicular spermatozoa were obtained (period 1994 2007) were compared with control data from 2889 ICSI children . All children were  examined by a geneticist during their first year of life. A subanalysis of outcome parameters was performed in relation to the cause of azoospermia . RESULTS: Of the 657 pregnancies obtained after ICSI using testicular spermatozoa, 426 (63 .1%) were ongoing after 20 weeks leading to  the birth of 530 liveborn children: 331 singletons, 178 twins and 21 triplets . Mean birthweight, length and head circumference as well as  prematurity, low birthweight and perinatal mortality in singletons and twins did not differ from the ICSI control group . No increase in major malformations was observed in liveborn TESE children (4 .90%) when  compared to the control ICSI group . Prenatal (126) and postnatal (72)  karyotype analysis revealed 2 .02%  de novo  abnormalities and 0 .51%  inherited abnormalities compared to 0 .45% de novo  anomalies (OR  4 .57; 95%CI 1 .68 12 .38) in the general newborn population . Further subanalysis in relation to the cause of azoospermia did not  reveal any differences in neonatal outcome parameters and major malformations rate . CONCLUSIONS: Neonatal outcome and major malformations rate  were similar in TESE children compared with a control cohort of ICSI  children but more de novo  chromosomal anomalies were found com   pared to the general newborn population .",2008

Surprisingly,  whole body DEXA scan showed normal total fat mass (25 .8%) and dis   tribution, whereas MRI showed no alteration of both subcutaneous and visceral adipose tissue depots . Metabolic  alterations includes hyperi   sulinemia both basal and 2 hours after OGTT (respectively 57 .2 and 982 .4 ÂµUI/ml), insulin resistance assessed by glucose clamp (M,2 .3 mg/kg/min) .  LMNA  sequencing evidenced a novel heterozygous mis   sense mutation in exon 4 that replaces well conserved residue glutam   ic acid at position 262 to lysine (p.E262K, c.784 GâA). Her parents  were negative for the same mutation, suggesting that this mutation has  de novo  origin . Sequence analysis of 100 healthy normal controls did not reveal this sequence alteration, indicating that this mutation is not a common variation . Genetic screening of additional genes mutated in  laminophatic or lipodistrophyc disorders ( ZMPSTE24 , PPARÎ³  BSCL2)   showed a wild type sequence . This study extend the large phenotypic  spectrum of laminophaties and may lead us better understanding mo   lecular basis of this group of disease .",2008

Minor congenital defects  result from either genetic or environmental causes that act during  pregnancy and are an indirect measure of abnormal embryo and fe   tal development . The purpose of the study was to see if patients with  autism spectrum disorders have more minor congenital defects than  healthy individuals and if so, if this finding correlates with the history of the patients . The incidence and media of minor congenital defects  were determined in 76 patients with autism spectrum disorders and in unrelated control subjects matched by age and sex . The frequency  of minor anomalies was not significantly different in the two groups, 14 .47% in autistic children and teenagers, compared to 14 .80% in healthy controls . The mean number of minor congenital anomalies  was significantly higher in the autistic group, 3Â±0.70 minor defects/pa   tient, compared to 1 .43Â±0 .36 minor defects/patient in controls . None of the control subjects had three or more minor anomalies .

Lysosomal storage diseases  (LSD) are among the causes of NIHF  . Objective: Report a case of recurrent NIHF where the placental histol   ogy lead to the investigation of Mucopolysaccharidosis VII (MPS VII) . Materials and methods: Histopathological examination of the placenta  and serum beta glucuronidase (GUSB) activity were performed . Case report: In the second pregnancy of non consanguineous parents  fetal hydrops was detected by an ultrasound scan at 22 weeks of ges   tation . An earlier pregnancy resulted also in an hydropic fetus . There  was no evidence of immune hydrops, congenital infection or cardio   vascular abnormalities and a normal karyotype (46,XY) was obtained .  The pregnancy resulted in a depressed, hydropic infant, which despite of intensive care died at 3 days of age . The histopathological examination of the placenta, presented vacou   lated Hofbauer cells, which were possitive stained with Alcian Blue and negative to PAS reaction . A normal appearence of the cytotrophoblast  was noted. The electron microscopic reflected the empty appearence of the vacuoles . This features suggested a LSD with accumulation of an acid mucopolysaccharide probably MPS  VII . The diagnosis was  confirmed GUSB activity that was neglible. Conclusion: The placental histopathological examination performed in this case of recurrent NIHF led to the suspicion of MPS VII . The  diagnosis necessary had to be confirmed with the quantification of en   zyme activity  . The placental proved to be an useful tool, in order to  limit the diagnostic resources . The accurate diagnosis is important for adequate genetic counselling .",2008

No mutations were detected us   ing Inno Lipa CFTR19 and CFTR17+Tn kits . A subsequent complete  screening using DGGE and SSCP/HD was also negative (detection level of 97%) . In the search for an alternative diagnosis, an extremely  high aldosterone and renin activity levels were found suggesting the diagnosis of a multisystem primary type I pseudohypoaldosteronism .  This is a rare autosomal recessive disease that results from mutations  in the genes encoding epithelial sodium channel subunits (alfa, beta, gamma) . Most mutations have been described in the alfa subunit gene (SCNN1A) . This gene was sequenced in the patient and her parents .  A C>A substituion at position 301 resulting in a change of glutamine for lysine at amino acid 101 (Q101K) was found . The patient was homozy   gous for the mutation while parents were both heterozygous . This mu   tation has not been reported to date. Residue 101 is at the first mem   brane spanning segment of the channel inside a structural motif that has been shown to be essential to proper channel folding or assembly  .  In addition the 101Q residue is highly evolutionarily conserved . This  data strongly suggest that Q101K mutation affects channel function  and support the diagnosis of multisystem primary pseudohypoaldoste   ronism in this patient .",2008

This condition is associated with a significantly increased risk of de   veloping thoracic aortic aneurysms and acute aortic dissection . The  valve calcification often observed in BAV is a result of inappropriate  activation of osteoblast specific gene expression. Recently, an asso   ciation between mutations in NOTCH1 gene and aortic valve disease has been described . NOTCH1 encodes for a transmembrane protein  that activates a signaling pathway with an active role in cardiac em   bryogenesis, including aortic and pulmonary valve development . A 52 year old male was referred to our attention for suspected Mar   fan Syndrome. The patient did not fulfil Ghent criteria for Marfan Syn   drome . He presented dilatation of the aortic root, the ascending aorta,  and bicuspid and calcified aortic valve. The family history was positive for autosomal dominant aneurysm of the ascending aorta not associated with other syndromic features . The candidate gene NOTCH1 was screened by DHPLC and sequenc   ing of heteroduplex amplicons . A novel c .C4104T transition predicting the missense p .Ala1343Val mu   tation was identified in exon 25. This result brings the attention of clinical geneticists to evaluate the  NOTCH1 gene in patients with early onset of calcific and bicuspid aor   tic valve as plausible causative gene in the light of preventive surgery  for carryers of gene defects and mild to severe aortic root dilation .  Furthermore, this gene should be carefully evaluated in patients with  toracic aneurism dissection without syndromic features previously genotyped for TGFBR1 and TGFBR2 genes with negative results .",2008

In some instances, renal biopsy may show focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (FSGS) or diffuse mesangial proliferation . In con   trast to 2 types of hereditary nephrotic syndrome previously identified,  congenital nephrosis of the Finnish type (OMIM 256300) and diffuse  mesangial sclerosis (OMIM 256370), idiopathic nephrotic syndrome  was generally regarded as a sporadic disease although a few famil   ial cases had been reported . Most patients with idiopathic nephrotic  syndrome respond to steroid therapy and show a favorable outcome .  However, 20% are steroid resistant, with progression to end stage re   nal failure in many cases . The nephrotic syndrome may recur after  renal transplantation in such cases . NPHS2 mutations will be found  in sporadic cases of steroid resistant idiopathic nephrotic syndrome,  which represents an important cause of childhood end stage renal dis   ease . The detection of NPHS2 mutations is of clinical utility as it would prescribe against unnecessary immunosuppressive therapy  . A 12 year old girl was referred to our laboratory with a diagnosis of ste   roid resistant nephrotic syndrome from pediatric nephrology depart   ment .

It results from mutations in  BCOR  gene localized  on Xp11 .4 . All affected individuals are females and the few reported  mutations are either deletions or generate premature stop codons . A  single missense variant was identified within BCOR  in a family with  Lenz microphthalmia syndrome . OFCD syndrome has been shown to  encompass defects of laterality, including the heart and other viscera . Methods: We analyzed BCOR  gene in 26 female patients diagnosed  with OFCD syndrome, 21 males with Lenz microphtalmia, 96 patients  with isolated microphtalmia and 96 patients with cardiac laterality de   fects . Results: Mutations were identified for the 26 patients with OFCD syn   drome, and one patient with âisolatedâ microphtalmia . The same pre   viously reported missense variant was identified in a boy with Lenz  microphthalmia syndrome. No mutation vas identified in the other pa   tients tested . We report somatic mosaicism of BCOR  anomalies in two  families with OFCD syndrome . In both families, the mothers had 50%  mosaicism in leucocytes, and their daughters carried the motherâs mu   tation homogeneously. In the first family the mother, her monozygotic twin sister and her daughter were affected . In the second family, the daughter was affected but not her mother  .

Nevertheless affected females have also been reported although  most of them do not show abnormal clinical findings, probably due  to skewed, preferential inactivation of dup/del(X) chromosomes, and  subsequent selection against cells with an active abnormal X in carrier females . However, some females with dup/del(X) chromosomes and random X inactivation also exhibit developmental anomalies . There   fore, females with two X chromosomes and an active duplicated/de   leted segment are functionally disomic/monosomic for genes that are  normally subject to X inactivation and functionally trisomic/disomic for those genes that escape X inactivation . Here, we report on two unrelated females with overgrowth, Sotos  like phenotype, mental retardation, normal sexual development and  de novo X chromosome anomalies, both originated in the paternal X chromosome and showed random X inactivation .

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune  multifactorial disease that  usually develops in susceptible young adults  . A possible involvement  of mitochondria in MS has been postulated because of a higher rate  transmission of the disease from mother to child than from father to child . Also association between Leberâs Hereditary Optic Neuropathy  a mitochondrial disease and MS is another evidence . Fatigue is a com   mon problem of the MS patients which is relted to the energy produc   tion difficulty by the mitochondria. To investigate further the relation   ship between MS and mitochondria we analysed the gene encoding  for polymerase G (POLG) . Among the nearly 50 disease mutations in  the gene for the catalytic subunit of POLG , The A467T mutant enzyme  possesses only 4% of wild type DNA polymerase activity  . Polymerase gene (pol G) is a two subunit complex consisting of a  140 kDa catalytic and a 55 kDa accessory subunit (p55the Nterminal   catalytic subunit contains a trinucleotide CAG repeat encoding a poly   glutamine tract near the amino terminus of the protein . Expansions  of similar polyglutamine encoding CAG microsatellite repeats in other genes are known to cause neurodegenerative disorders . Total genomic DNA was extracted from 60 idiopathic Ms Patients and 40 controls . Primers were designed to amplify the 4 hot exones and  CAG repeat length of the gene following by sequencing . The distribu   tion of the POLG CAG repeat length in the control samples matched  the distribution reported for control samples by others  . The analysis  of our sample shows no difference between the CAG repeat length  distribution of control and ms disease samples analysis of exon 7, 8, 9,  and13 of POLG gene from 60 DNA samples of MS patients showed no mutation .

PHS has been shown to be caused by de novo  heterozygous mutations of the TCF4  gene, located in 18q21 . To ex   pand the phenotypic spectrum of mutations and deletions of the TCF4   gene, we studied 30 hitherto unexplored patients whose phenotype overlapped with PHS . Methods: The TCF4  gene was analysed by QMF PCR, followed by  sequencing . Large deletions were characterised by CGH array  . All pa   tients were karyotyped .Results: In three patients, 18q21 .1 q22 .2 deletions were revealed by Clinical genetics karyotyping . QMF PCR permitted to detect one large deletion and six  small deletions generating premature stop codons . The patients with small deletions had characteristic dysmorphic fea   tures . All patients had severe developmental delay, late (after 5 years)  or absent walking, no speech, and microcephaly  . We found a high in   cidence of myopia in all patients who had undergone eye testing . We  frequently observed a happy disposition, stereotypic movements and  strabismus . In contrast, hyperventilation, epilepsy, constipation were  inconstant, and none of them had Hirschsprung disease or visceral malformation . Conclusion: We report 10 novel TCF4  deletions, in patients whose  phenotype strongly overlapped with PHS . However, we observed phe   notypic variations between the small deletions and the large genomic  deletions, which may lay the basis for further genotype phenotype cor   relations at the TCF4  locus . Owing to the large number of deletions  and microdeletions/insertions in TCF4 we would address to start the  molecular study by a QMF PCR analysis .",2008

Embryo biopsy is an in   vasive procedure to perform preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) or screening (PGS) . The objective was to determine if embryo biopsy  might cause prenatal and/or postnatal growth restriction and induce congenital malformations . Materials and methods: In this study we compared growth and physi   cal findings between seventy 2  year  old singletons born after PGD/ PGS compared to intracytoplasmatic sperm injection (ICSI) and spon   taneous conception (SC) . Children were matched for gender, maternal educational level, mother tongue and birth order  . Results: No differences were found regarding weight, height and head   circumference standard deviation scores at birth and at age two years .  Body Mass Index standard deviation score in PGD/PGS children at age two years was lower compared to SC children (p , 0 .05) . PGD/PGS  children were more frequently born after caesarian section but had no  more congenital malformations, hospital admissions and surgical in   terventions . Growth parameters within the PGD/PGS group of children  born after biopsy of one or two blastomeres were comparable . Conclusions: Singleton children born after embryo biopsy applied in  PGD/PGS present a similar prenatal and early postnatal linear growth  compared to ICSI children and SC children . PGD/PGS singletons ap   pear not at higher risk for congenital malformations and surgical in   terventions . Body Mass Index standard deviation score was slightly lower in PGD/PGS children compared to SC children . There are no  observable detrimental effects of the PGD/PGS procedure on children  during the first years of life.",2008

","Primary Hyperoxaluria (PH) is a rare autosomal recessive disease  with impaired hepatic detoxification of glyoxylate, due to AGT (PHI)  or GRHPR (PHII) enzyme deficiency. Oxalate overproduction in turn  causes nephrolithiasis, end stage renal failure, systemic oxalosis and multi tissue damage . In responsive subjects an early biochemical and  genetic diagnosis can address to treatment with vitamin B6 (the AGT cofactor) . In many cases liver or combined liver/kidney transplant is  necessary to correct the metabolic defect . In a cohort of 47 PHI and 2 PHII Italian patients we identified the patho   genic mutation of 90/94 PHI and 4/4 PHII alleles (96% mutation detec  tion) using DHPLC and DNA sequencing . Age at presentation varied from 1 month to 49 years (median 6 y) .  AGT residual activity in liver biopsies is available for 34 subjects . In  33 it was possible to define B6 responsiveness by comparing plasma oxalate before and after oral supplementation . 23 different mutations were found (6 unpublished); missense muta   tions affect evolutionary conserved residues and are absent in 160 chromosomes of healthy ethnically matched controls . Genotype phenotype correlations show an important role of non ge   netic factors as diet or delayed diagnosis, and confirm in our popu   lation that the most frequent mutation G170R, causing mitochondrial  mistargeting, is associated with a mild phenotype (residual enzymatic activity, late onset and responsiveness to B6) . For missense (G116R)  and insdel inframe  (c .283dupGAG) mutations we presume an antimor   phic effect as they were found only in patients with a severe phenotype  despite the presence of a mild mutation on the other allele .",2008

testicular dysgenesis syndrome: more common after assisted  reproduction?,P01.363,"S. Funke , E. Flach, Z. MÃ¡nfai, T. Ertl","University of PÃ©cs, PÃ©cs, Hungary","Recent reports have demonstrated a decline in human male reproduc   tion health: increasing prevalence of cryptorchidism, hypospadias, poor  semen quality, rising incidence of testis cancer and growing demand for assisted reproduction . It is supposed that these are symptoms of one underlying entity, the testicular dysgenesis syndrome (TDS) . The  rapid rise in the prevalence of TDS may be linked to endocrine disrupt   ers affecting genetically susceptible individuals . Genetic aberrations  or polymorphisms may predispose to augmented effects by environ   mental factors . Meta analysis of in vitro fertilization (IVF) studies re   vealed that hypospadias is more common after assisted reproduction (AR) . In Hungary about 2000 infants are born following IVF yearly  . In  our study we investigated the incidence of congenital abnormalities after AR .

One could exclude coexistence of CSTB  and TMPRSS3  mutations in  this pedigree due to assumed joint transmission . For that reason we  performed haplotype analysis, genotyping seven microsatellites flank   ing TMPRSS3 and CSTB  . Haplotype analysis showed that absence of  homozygous expansion in the individual II 2 is due to a recombination  event that occurred ahead of CSTB , what was the strong indication  that homozygous mutation in the TMPRSS3 is responsible for deaf   ness .

Their prevalence is about 5 .2%, ranging from 0 to 16% (depending  on the preselection criteria and the expertise of the examining clini   cian) . Because of either their small size and/or similarity of involved  segments, these aberrations are undetectable by conventional binding techniques . Hence, they can be screened for by other methods, most  frequently by FISH with a complete set of subtelomeric probes or by  multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). We report  the diagnostic yield in a series of 109 patients with an unexplained  combination of mental retardation with dysmorphy and/or congenital anomalies . Methods: Patients were evaluated for subtelomeric rearrangements using commercially available total subtelomeric FISH (TS) . All had  normal results of GTG banded chromosomes at the 550 band level  and were referred for TS based on clinical indications suggestive for Cytogenetics chromosomal aberration. In some cases, for identification or confir   mation of detected abnormalities, specific microdeletion and telomeric  probes were used . Results: Twelve subtelomeric chromosomal aberrations were rec   ognized, which corresponds to a diagnostic yield of about 10% .  Identified rearrangements were: del(1p36); der(1)t(1;3)(q44;p25)pat; der(1)t(1;22)(p36 .1;q11 .23)mat; del(2q37) in two cases;  del(4p); der(6)t(6;7)(q27;q36)mat and der(7)t(6;7)(q27;q36)mat; der(9)t(9;20)(pter ,pter+)pat; del(9qter); del(12pter); del(22q13) .

Alteration  of replication order has been associated with aneuploidy and genetic  instability, while asynchronous replication with the formation of a dele   tion . No data on replication timing of subtelomeric regions (SR) are  available so far  . SRs are highly unstable and rearrangements have  been reported in ~7% of patients with mental retardation . The objective of this study was to determine the replication timing of  human SR . The replication pattern of SR of chromosomes 5, 7, 8 and  20 was investigated using FISH method in lymphocytes of 4 healthy donors . At least 200 cells per probe per person were studied . The rep   lication status of a locus was classified as unreplicated (âsâ single sig   nal) and replicated (âdâ  doubled signal) . The results showed that each SR had a characteristic timing of replica   tion, and that 20q (ss: 47.8Â±3.1%; dd: 18Â±1.8%) was the first of exam   ined SRs to replicate, whereas 5q (ss: 75 .9Â±1 .8%; dd: 4 .3Â±0 .5%) was the last (p<0 .001) . The analysis revealed variable level of replication synchrony of homologous SR . The frequency of sd cells hybridized  with the probes for the 5p, 7p, 8q, 20q (30.1Â±2.6%) was significantly higher (p<0 .02) compared to 5q, 7q, 8p, 20p (20 .6Â±2 .0%) .

In spite of all diagnostic tools available, the etiology can still not be established in half of the cases .The introduction of array CGH analysis  has improved the identification of novel genomic disorders. However,  this high resolution new technique open novel diagnostic challenges  when inherited private CNVs of unclear clinical significance are found.  The analysis of 84 patients with mild to severe mental retardation as   sociated to facial dysmorphisms and/or congenital anomalies revealed 10 private CNVs inherited from an healthy parent . Three were dele   tions (7q31, 14q21 .1, Xq25) and 7 duplications (12p11 .22, 12q31 .31, 13q31 .1, 17q12, Xp22 .31, Xq28) ranging between 0 .1 and 3 .8 Mb . Three small rearrangements were gene desert . The remaining 7 had a  mean gene content of 5 (ranging from 1 to 18) . None of the rearranged  genes is known to be imprinted . Three disease genes were found  in three different cases: KAL1  in dupXp22 .31, STS gene in another  dupXp22 .31 and TCF2 gene in dup17q12 . The patient carrying the last  duplication presents, among others, sex reversal, Petersâ anomaly and  renal cysts and the duplication is located 4Mb apart of the HSD17B1   gene, coding a key enzyme of testosterone biosynthesis . We suggest  that at least in this case low penetrance instead of no pathogenesis,  should be taken into account. We discuss on the final interpretation  that should be given in the clinical practice and the opportunity to re   port such rearrangements in the family reports .",2008

We present two patients with phenotypic abnormalities and de novo   cytogenetically balanced rearrangements . After analysing them by 1  Mb array CGH, imbalances were observed in both cases (just one  case involving the breakpoints) . In patient 1, who presented deafness, hidrocephaly and coloboma, the karyotype was 46,XX,t(6;13)(q23;q31)dn . Array CGH detected a 13q32 .2 deletion, 13q33 .1 duplication, 1q44 duplication and 16q21 22  deletion. The last one is the only confirmed abnormality by FISH for  the time being (BACs RP11 89O14 and RP11 468F3), but it has been described as a polymorphism . Patient 2, with a Silver Russell like phenotype, showed the karyotype 46,XX,inv(7)(q21 .12q34)dn .

In relation to patient 2, the only confirmed case for now, a review of similar reported cases has been performed . Although none of them  has an identical microdeletion, common features have been observed,  ranging from minor anomalies to growth and mental retardation, and brain, heart and lung malformations . Many genes of 3p12 .3 3p13 re   gion remain still unknown, making it difficult to establish a good geno   type phenotype correlation .

In 22 of 129 patients euchromatic imbalances have been de   tected (~17%) by aCGH and verified by FISH analyses. In seven out of  18 cases where parental samples were available for verification analy   ses, it could be shown that the euchromatic imbalance (3 deletions: 0 .4 Mb 1 .9 Mb; 4 duplications: 1 .3 Mb 5 .3 Mb) has been transmitted from  a phenotypically normal parent . Overall, in 14 of 129 patients (~11%)  a de novo aberration has been detected; some of thosw representing  well known, others recently established microdeletion and microdupli   cation syndromes . In addition to the 129 patients, 19 patient samples  were analyzed to further characterize a chromosomal aberration de   tected initially by conventional cytogenetics . In eleven of these cases  (~58%) including complex translocations and ring chromosomes, the  imbalance(s) could be characterized successfully in more detail using  aCGH . Hybridization of microdissected chromosome material of a su   pernumerary ring chromosome 19 onto a 105 K array allowed the high resolution mapping of the nonlinear euchromatic content . However,  in eight preselected cytogenetic samples no euchromatic imbalance could be detected by aCGH using whole genomic DNA . In summary,  aCGH and array hybridization of microdissected chromosomes are  highly informative methods for the detection and characterization of chromosomal imbalances in postnatal cytogenetics .",2008

With the advent of whole genome array CGH analysis,  the number especially of interstitial genomic imbalances increased dramatically  . Here we present our results of array CGH investigations  in 370 cases of patients with retardation syndromes and dysmorphic features using the Cytochip v2 BAC array (BlueGnome, Cambridge) .  Among these cases we found 55 genomic imbalances (15%) . Seven  (2,1%) of the genomic imbalances were telomeric (3 deletions, 4 du   plications) and 48 interstitial (12,9%, 28 deletions, 12 duplications) .  Of these interstitial imbalances 28 were >1 Mb in size (average 3,5)  whereas 20 were smaller or equal to 1 Mb in size . Four aberrations in   cluded terminal deletion/duplication events (three de novo, one inher   ited from a balanced father) . 8 cases (2,4%) were patients with known  microdeletion or microduplication syndromes (two microdeletions 22q11 .2, two microdeletions 17p11 .2, two microdeletions 15q11 .2q13,  two microduplications 17p11 .2) . FISH has not been performed prior  to the array CGH, as no obvious indication of the referrals existed .  All of the detected gains and losses have been confirmed by either FISH or MLPA . A small 0,8 Mb deletion in the long arm of chromosome  2 (2q22.3) lead to the molecular genetically confirmed diagnosis of Mowat Wilson syndrome . To summarize, array CGH is a very power   ful tool to detect genomic imbalances in at up to 15% of previously unresolved cases .",2008

A group of 703 individuals with normal karyotype was investigated by  using two different microarrays (Agilent 44K and 244K) which have an average resolution of about 100Kb and 20Kb respectively  .

We  are not able to establish whether the remaining 66 imbalances were  causative or not . In fact most of them were inherited from a normal parent whereas in few cases we could not investigate the parents . In   terestingly, our study highlighted some peculiar rearrangements such  as de novo  triplications or two independent genomic disorders in the  same patient . On the other hand, our study demonstrate that increas   ing the resolutions may improve the detection rate, although the per   centage of potentially causative imbalances detected using these two  platforms is not significantly different.",2008

The positional cloning of genes affected by cytogenetic anomalies as   sociated with phenotype is one of the main methods for the identifica   tion of disease related genes . However, mapping translocation break   points and rearranged chromosomal boundaries by molecular cytoge   netics is labour intensive . The isolation of the aberrant chromosomes  by either flow sorting or microdissection permits the specific analysis of  their genomic content by high throughput technologies such as aCGH or sequencing . We have applied chromosome microdissection and  aCGH to map three apparently translocation breakpoints associated  with different phenotypes: 1) 46,XY,t(4;15)(q22;q26) in a chronic my   elomonocytic leukaemia; 2) 46,XX,t(11;13)(q21;q14) in a patient with language and developmental delay; and 3) 46,XY,t(7;18)(p15 .1;q21 .1)  in a male with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. We first isolated one  of the two derivative chromosomes (6 8 chromosomes), amplified the  DNA by DOP PCR, and performed reverse FISH in order to verify the appropriate cytogenetic location of the microdissected material . Then,  we hybridized the DNA onto a BAC array and the Agilent 244K CGH oligoarray for precise mapping . All three translocation breakpoints  have been narrowed down to regions of ~8 15 Kb in each chromo   some with high reproducible signals . We are currently attempting to  further define the exact breakpoints by either tiling array or direct PCR and sequencing . In summary, the manual microdissection of aberrant  chromosomes is a cheap and reliable method to obtain target DNA for ulterior high throughput analysis with microarrays .",2008

Clinically significant  submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances were detected in 4 patients  (5.7%). Abnormal results were confirmed by FISH. The percentage of  identified abnormalities in the current study is lower than previously  reported by other studies, probably due to the fact that no specific selection criteria were applied in our patients . One deletion, one du   plication, one unbalanced translocation and one mosaic case with  both a deletion and duplication were identified. One of the detected  abnormalities was de novo, one was familial, while the remaining two are still under investigation .

After validation of the study platform using reference DNAs, first 100 individuals from 22 families were screened . About 35 genomic rear   rangements per individual were detected, most of which are reported  in the Database of Genomic Variants or present recurrently in our samples . In three families, possible disease related imbalances were found: 1 .6Mb dup(X)(p22 .31), 3 .9Mb del(15)(q13 .1q13 .2), 8 .3Mb del(7)(q31 .1q32 .1) . The detected rearrangements were not present  in unaffected family members . Cases with similar phenotypes and  aberration(s) in the overlapping regions are also reported in the DECI   PHER database .

Patsalis1","1Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus, 2Institute of Mo   lecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu/Estonian Biocentre, Tartu, Estonia","Array CGH has become the method of choice for the detection of subtle imbalances as cause of genomic disorders . Novel array CGH  modifications were introduced in order to detect smaller aberrations by varying the type and density of arrayed target sequences . At the same  time, certain limitations have become obvious, emerging the need for  alternative methodologies. Array based Multiplex Amplifiable Probe  Hybridization (array MAPH) is a recent approach, where the analysis  of copy number data is performed by conventional MAPH, followed by  rehybridization to microarrays containing DNA sequences, identical to  MAPH probes. Thus, targeted amplification and reduction of the com   plexity in genomic material is achieved . The aim of this study was to estimate whether a probe set, initially developed for array MAPH, is potentially useful for array CGH . The  same human chromosome X specific probe set was applied to com   pare array CGH and array MAPH performance and to further evaluate  the potential of array MAPH methodology to be used for genome wide  identification of locus copy number changes.   Normal male and female DNA samples were studied, as well as three  patients with known chromosome X aberrations: two patients with a 12 Mb deletion and one patient with 1 Mb duplication . Our data has proven that array MAPH clones can be also efficiently implemented in array CGH . We suggest that efforts for upgrading genomic copy number screen   ing should not only focus on new CGH microarray probes, but also on  introducing new platforms, such as array MAPH, as a reliable, flexible  and cost effective alternative to array CGH and high density genotyp   ing chips .",2008

","Genome wide array comparative genomic hybridization screening is  uncovering pathogenic submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances in patients with developmental disorders . In those patients, imbalances  appear now to be scattered across the whole genome, and most pa   tients carry different chromosomal anomalies . Screening patients with  developmental disorders can be considered a forward functional ge   nome screen . The imbalances pinpoint the location of genes that are involved in human development . Because most imbalances encom   pass regions harboring multiple genes, the challenge is to (1) identify  those genes responsible for the specific phenotype and (2) disentan   gle the role of the different genes located in an imbalanced region . We  discuss our work on novel tools and databases that we recently devel   oped to aid this gene discovery process. Identification of the functional  relevance of genes will not only deepen our understanding of human  development but will, in addition, aid in the data interpretation and im   prove genetic counseling .",2008

Array CGH studies  have shown an incidence of 10 15% of formerly undetected imbal   ances among these patients . Objective: To report array CGH screening of a series of 160 patients with idiopathic mental retardation and congenital abnormalities . Material and methods: 160 patients with normal karyotype and normal  subtelomeric results by MLPA were evaluated for cryptic chromosomal  rearrangements by array CGH using a high definition microarray con   sisting of 44 .000 probes (Agilent technologies) . Results: A total of 46 (29%) probably pathological rearrangements were detected . Of these, 11 alterations have been proved to be patho   logical, while the remaining are under study  . Deletions and duplica   tions are equally represented . Duplication sizes ranged from to 20 to 3,859 kb (mean 1,250 kb, SD 2,276) . Deletion sizes ranged from to 0 .4  to 10,314 kb (mean 1,369 kb, SD 2,319) . It is worth to note the occurrence of two de novo  alterations in one  patient: a 10,3 Mb deletion at 6q16 and a 360 kb duplication at 16p11 .  As the phenotype is comparable to other cases with 6q16 deletion, the  duplication can be considered as a de novo polymorphism . Conclusions: Array CGH should be considered an essential tool for  the genetic analysis of patients with mental retardation and congeni   tal anomalies . However, caution must be taken when interpreting the  results in order to distinguish pathological from polymorphic imbal   ances .",2008

Redon","Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Hinxton, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Multiple studies have recently described extensive structural variation in the human genome . Among the regions with most extensive varia   tion, the 17q21 .31 locus harbours a complex architecture, with several structural variants previously associated with abnormal phenotypes .  This locus is the site of a ~900kb inversion polymorphism responsible for two divergent haplotypes, named H1 and H2 . In addition, the H1  haplotype is divided into subtypes which show considerable structural heterogeneity  . While the H2 haplotype has been associated to one  microdeletion syndrome causing learning disability and dysmorphic  features, certain H1 sub haplotypes have been linked to neurodegen   erative disorders, including progressive supranuclear palsy and fron   tomental dementia . By using published copy number variation data on  270 HapMap individuals, we have defined several structural variations within the 17q21 .31 locus, including a duplication polymorphism involv   ing the 5â portion of the N ethylmaleimide sensitive factor (NSF) gene  and a second distinct CNV upstream of NSF, which is detected only in European individuals on both H1 and H2 alleles . CNV breakpoints in each sub type were also delineated using high resolution oligo array  .  We have further developed a set of quantitative PCR assays to resolve the different H1 and H2 sub haplotypes . Given the previous associa   tion of the 17q21 .31 locus with disease and the presence in this inter   val of several genes related to the brain function, this new genotyping  assay will be a valuable resource for testing the involvement of H1/H2 subtypes in neuro psychiatric disorders .",2008

Similarities with patients with the larger 2q32 deletion  include a  common behavioural phenotype and hair abnormalities . This suggests  that copy number variation of 2q32 is a necessary, but perhaps not suf   ficient component for the behavioural phenotype and further analysis  of the minimum region of overlap may help to identify important genes involved with this in particular  .

Evidence for epigenetic regulation of CDKNA  in normal human  placenta,P02.049,"E. N. Tolmacheva , A. A. Kashevarova, I. N.

These are rapid prolifera   tion, invasiveness and gene expression profiles. It is possible, that this analogy might provided by epigenetic mechanisms . To test this hypoth   esis methylation status of four tumor suppressor genes in the normal human placentas was investigated . Promoter methylation of  p14ARF,  CDKN2A, CDKN2B and RB1 genes was analyzed by methyl specific  and methylation sensitive PCR in the cytotrophoblast and extraembry   onic mesoderm of 32 first trimester induced abortions. Studied tissues  have different dynamics of epigenetic genome reprogramming and level of methylation . No methylated alleles of  p14ARF, CDKN2B and  RB1 genes were detected in normal extraembryonic tissues . However  aberrant methylation of the CDKN2A  promoter was observed in 78%  of cases in both placental tissues . Heretofore aberrant methylation of   CDKN2A  gene was frequently observed in different human cancers as  well as in 20% of hydatidiform moles, 40% of chorioncarcinomas (Xue et al ., 2004) and even up to 14% cases of spontaneously aborted em   bryos with normal karyotype (Park et al., 2008). Our data for the first  time have demonstrated that hypermethylation of  CDKN2A  with high  frequency can occur in normal human placenta . Tendency of decreas   ing in mean gestational age between embryos with (8 .4 weeks, n,7) or  without methylation (10 .2 weeks, n,25) was found . It is possible, that  several cell populations with epigenetic inactivation of the cell cycle  checkpoint genes can exist in placental tissues during some periods of  its development providing evidence for a new unresolved mechanism  of successful placentation .",2008

As some of those features are suggestive of Angelman Syndrome (AS), testing for 22q13 .3 deletion in patients with AS fea   tures without the characteristic molecular 15q abnormalities has been suggested . Forty patients with mental retardation, who had been previously re   ferred with a clinical diagnosis of AS and a normal methylation test result, were included in the study  .

This kit including four probes in the  SHANK3 gene, which is thought to be responsible for at least part of the phenotype, in particular the neurological symptoms . A 22q13 deletion was discarted in 39/40 patients (97 .5%) because no  deletions were detected by MLPA analysis . Only one patient showed  an abnormal result consisting in a deletion of the probe located in exon  9 of SHANK3 gene, but this result needs to be confirmed. This study confirms the findings of Vries (2002) et al. suggesting that  patients with an âAngelman phenotypeâ are not more likely to have a 22q13 .3 deletion than other individuals with mental retardation .",2008

First case, a 12 year old girl, was admitted in our department for neu   rological evaluation because of severe progressive toraco lumbar sco   liosis, which occurred at the age of five. She also presented severe  mental retardation, absence of speech, autistic features, gait difficul   ties with ataxia, hyperventilation episodes, and epileptic seizures . The  second case, a 4 year old boy, was referred to our department for psy   chomotor retardation . He had âhappy puppetâ appearance, ataxic gait, and severe mental retardation . Both children were born from healthy non consanguineous parents . Clinical investigations included neurological evaluation, EEG, and MRI . Chromosomal studies were performed on peripheral blood lympho   cytes, by GTG banding. Locus specific BAC probes for critical region 15q11 13 and control probes were used for FISH analysis . Normal karyotype, and 15q microdeletion was demonstrated in both cases . In the second case, the phenotype was highly suggestive for Angel   man syndrome, while in the first case, a differential diagnosis with Rett  syndrome was considered, especially because of the severe vertebral scoliosis .

Williams  syndrome is caused by the deletion of genetic material from the re   gion q11 .2 of chromosome 7, including more than 20 genes, several of these contributing to the characteristic features of this disorder  . Material and method: The patients were young children, one girl and  one boy, extremly friendly, with moderate mental retardation, short  stature, characteristic elfin face, joint laxity, systolic murmur and atrac   tion to music . They performed clinical examination, ECG, echocardiog   raphy, cardiopulmonary X ray and angio CT, and after that they were refered to the genetician, ENT and ophtalmologic department . Results: Supravalvular aortic stenosis was confirmed in both cases,  associated with hypolasia of aortic arch and large coarctation of the aorta in girl . She had from birth irreductible inguinal hernia, operated in  newborn period, followed by cardiopulmonary arrest, resuscitated . The  inghinolabial hernia reoccur  . She also still have feeding problems for  semisolid food . Barium examination reveal large esofageal stenosis in  the 1/3 inferior part . Both of them have proeminent lips with an open  mouth, defective tooth enamel and spaced teeth . The girl associated hypercalcemia . Conclusions: After examinations, both patients are able to be con   sidered Williams syndrome. The FISH test to confirm this syndrome has to be done . They are in follow up programe and we intend, after  confirmation of the genetic FISH test, to introduce them in Williams Syndrome Children Association .",2008

The  majority of BWS patients (50 60%) have an epigenetic defect at the  DMR2 of the 11p15 region . The epigenetic defect present in this region  involves loss of methylation (LOM) of the maternally inherited copy of  KvDMR (DMR2), a CpG island localised at the intron 10 of the mater   nally expressed gene KCNQ1 . In this same intron 10, this CpG island surrounds the promoter that  drives a long transcript (KCNQ1OT1) with antisense transcription to KCNQ1 . Normally, the maternal allele of DMR2 is methylated and KCNQ1OT1 is silenced . If there are epigenetic alterations in this re   gion, loss of maternal methylation of DMR2 is accompanied by bial   lelic expression of the KCNQ1OT1 transcript, usually only paternally expressed . We studied the methylation pattern by means of MS MLPA technique  (Methylation Specific MLPA). With this technique is also possible to  study the extension of the hypomethyation in the DMR2âs CpG is   lands . We studied 87 patients with BWS and among them we found that 37 presented hypomethylation at the DMR2 (42 .5%) . Moreover our re   sults are consistent with similar studies which demonstrated that the  hypomethylation includes the 5âend of the KCNQ1OT1 gene.

Su","National Taiwan university hospital, Taipei, Taiwan","Introduction: Most of the Prader Willi syndrome and Angelman syn   drome patients are caused by the deletion of chromosomal 15q11 13 or uniparental disomy of chromosome 15 . There are many diagnostic  tools available like the FISH analysis, methylation based PCR, multi   plex PCR, High Resolution Melting analysis and commercialized MS MLPA . Each of them has some disadvantages and limitations such as  high costs, time consuming and requiring DNA bisulfite treatment. We  introduce a novel, in house designed methylation specific competitive  multiplex PCR, which takes three hours for the reaction, avoids bisul   fite treatment of DNA and provides reliable results of PWS and AS. Material and methods: 68 patients with clinical suspicion of PWS, two  with AS, and 20 unaffected individuals from the general population  were analyzed. In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, we amplified  one SNRPN control gene, the KRITI gene to serve as internal control,  and the promoter of the SNRPN gene, which could be digested them with HhaI enzyme . By comparing the copy number of the three re   gions, we could differentiate the wild type, deletion type and UPD type PWS within one reaction . We also evaluated other different diagnostic technologies in clinical applications . Results: In this article, we successfully made the molecular diagno   sis of one AS patients and 46 PWS patients by several different tech   niques . In the MS competitive multiplex PCR, the total copy numbers were accurately calculated in all of the cases . Conclusions: The MS competitive multiplex PCR strategy is a good al   ternative for molecular diagnosis of PWS and AS . This approach could  serve as an alternative genotyping platform for epigenetics .",2008

In the situation of seriously limited availabil   ity of FISH testing, some narrowing of indications possibly could be  achieved in group of patients older then one month (or better, older  then one year) by considering only a specific facial dysmorphism as a diagnostic criterion . However, individual approach to the patient and  careful clinical assessment are necessary, as it is clear that non spe   cific facial dysmorphism also has an important role in clinical diagnosis of 22q11 .2 microdeletion syndrome .Cytogenetics",2008
q11 microduplication syndrome across four generations of a  single family,P02.06422,"S. A. McKee , S. McCullough, D. McManus","Northern Ireland Regional Genetics Service, Belfast, United Kingdom","Microduplication, as opposed to deletion, of the âDiGeorge regionâ on  chromosome 22q11 is an increasingly recognised finding, associated  with a very wide phenotypic range . Patients vary in the degree of dys   morphism, intellectual disability and cardiac abnormalities, and many  patients have now been reported who are classified as phenotypically normal . We report a Northern Irish family in which the proband was diagnosed with a microduplication at the age of 20 . She has mild learning prob   lems and minimal facial dysmorphism, but has subtle abnormalities of  the fingers. Her daughter developed severe seizures at birth, and has an atrial septal defect with patent ductus arteriosus . She has ocular  hypertelorism, a small mandible, and significant developmental and growth delay; she tested positive for the duplication . The probandâs mother and one of her brothers also carry the duplication . This makes  it highly likely that one of her parents in turn also carried the duplica   tion (these are reported as phenotypically normal; analysis is ongoing in this family) . Counselling as to the likely effects of this microduplication is very diffi   cult, as the spectrum is so broad even within families . In particular, pre   natal counselling presents significant challenges. As data continues to  accumulate, more accurate risks and prevalences may be established,  and potential modifying factors identified.",2008

The diagnosis is routinely performed by FISH analysis . CASE REPORT: We present a 33 years old healthy woman on is 13th  gestational week that is sent to our office for genetic counseling be   cause of a previous pregnancy that produced a newborn with Fallot te  tralogy  . Later on she had a healthy boy and a third pregnancy ended at  the 9th gestational week in spontaneous miscarriage . The 450 bands karyotype of the girl was 46,XX . The amniocentesis was performed at the 16th gestational week, and  the karyotype was 46,XY  . We extended the cytogenetic analysis and  performed FISH of 4p16 .3, 22q11 .2 and 7q11 .23 and we found that the fetus had a hemyzygous deletion of the 22q11 .2 region . The father was  a carrier of the same deletion . MATERIALS AND METHODS: FISH analysis was performed with the  Vysis probe DiGeorge/UCFS (gene TUPLE1) y ARSA (control) . The  karyotype analysis was performed by conventional GTG banding . DISCUSSION: This case illustrates de advantage of widening the pre   natal diagnostic spectrum beyond the most common aneuploidies, tai   loring the genetics tests to the family history as well as to the prenatal  data . Assuming that both the Fallot tetralogy and the miscarriage were  related to the familial deletion, the intrafamilial variability spans from  lethal to almost normal, adding further data to the few catch 22 families studied to date .",2008

ASD occurs in syndromic  forms and as non syndromic cases frequently involving cytogenetic abnormalities . Recently, array based genome wide screens have demonstrated frequent copy number variation in non syndromic ASD .  Screening 56 patients with autism and additional major or minor anom   alies with the Infinium HumanHap300 SNP platform (Illumina, Inc.,  San Diego, CA) we found in 16 patients 9 regions with deleted and 9 with duplicated signals . Aberrant signals were distributed among 16 distinct chromosomal loci . Apart from 14 patients with unique aberra   tions, 2 patients carried duplications and a 3rd patient a deletion within  the 22q11 region, of 0 .726, 2 .966, and 0 .388 Mb, respectively  . The  duplications were confirmed by multiplex ligation mediated probe am   plification and are likely to involve LCRs A, B and D. We conclude that  SNP array based screening of ASD patients uncovers an appreciable  number of CNVs, which in part overlap with loci already discovered by  other approaches. Our finding that 3 out of 56 ASD patients carried aberrations within the 22q11 region is highly unexpected . The rela   tively small size of CNVs found in this study may allow us to pinpoint candidate genes for ASD .",2008

It is caused by haplo insufficien   cy of the GATA 3 gene located at 10p15 and inherited as an autosomal dominant trait . In our study we describe a patient with HDR phenotype and associated severe autism . Molecular analysis by MLPA showed a de novo het   erozygous deletion at 10p15, encompassing the GATA3 gene without  involvment of the DGCR2. These results were confirmed by micro   satellite analysis, showing that the deleted region is located between the D10S189 and D10S1649 markers . The size of the deletion can be estimated around 2,5 Mb . The GATA3 gene has been reported as a  gene important in the embryonic development of the parathyroid, renal and auditory systems . However mental retardation or autism can not be ascribed to GATA3 mutations . Therefore we can suspect that this Cytogenetics deleted region contains a gene responsible for the cognitive impair   ment observed in our patient . 10p15 microdeletions has already been  described in few patients will almost identical symptoms and similar  dysmorphic features.

While deletions of 18p  are associated with short stature  and minor dysmorphic features, no clear cut cognitive or behavioral patterns have emerged . Included in our longitudinal study of persons  with chromosome 18 differences is a large cohort of persons with chro   mosome 18p  . Adaptive behavior assessment measures everyday ac   tivities while cognitive measures assess internal cognitive processes . Currently no information is available regarding the correspondence  between adaptive behavior and cognitive development for this pop   ulation . Methods. The adaptive behavior of 10 individuals with 18p   were evaluated using the Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (Vine   land; Sparrow, Balla & Cicchetti, 1984) and estimates of intellectual  functioning were gathered using either the Differential Abilities Scales  (DAS, Elliott, 1990) or the Bayley Scales of Infant Development Sec   ond Edition (Bailey II, Bailey, 1993) . All scores were converted to stan   dard scores with a mean of 100 and standard deviation of 15 . Results.   Intellectual  functioning varied from significant cognitive impairment  (N,3) to low average/average intellectual functioning (N, 3) . Adaptive  behavior skill development was commensurate with estimates of intel   lectual functioning in only three of the nine childrenâs profiles. In the  remaining six cases, estimates of cognitive development were lower than parental ratings of adaptive behavior  .  Conclusions.  This study  supports previous findings of significant cognitive variability within the  18p  population. It provides evidence of significant adaptive skill vari   ability and also highlights within subject variability in cognitive and be   havioral development. These findings suggest that for persons with  18p  deletions, it is critical to utilize both cognitive and behavioral mea  sures to more fully understand development .",2008

Eleven individuals with 18p  underwent an endocrine evaluation at the Chromosome 18 Clinical Research Center (the âCenterâ) . This evalua   tion included anthropomorphics, bone age studies and growth (growth factors and stimulation testing) and thyroid hormone testing . In addi   tion, a review of the available medical records for 20 additional patients was completed .  Results.  Five males and 6 females were evaluated at  the Center  . The average age was 9 8/12 years (range 2 8/12 to 18 2/12) .  Six individuals were <5th centile for height . Three of these were diag   nosed with GHD (27% of total individuals evaluated) . Ten of the 11 had  normal IGF1 and IGFBP3 levels and essentially normal thyroid results (one had a slightly low T4 level, but had normal TSH levels) . Thyroid  and IGF1/IGFBP3 results were not available on the 11th patient . Medi   cal record review of the additional 20 patients revealed that 8 had an  endocrine abnormality, including panhypopituitarism (2); precocious  puberty (1); autoimmune thyroiditis (1); treatment with growth hormone (4); and hypothyroidism (1) .  Conclusions  . Taken together, 11 of the 31  (35%) individuals with 18p  included in this study had some endocrine abnormality  .

This syndrome is most often caused by a terminal deletion of the long arm of chromosome 18 .  However, individuals with interstitial deletions have also been identi   fied. The phenotype of the disorder varies greatly between individuals,  but generally includes short stature, microcephaly, midface hypoplasia,  hypertelorism, congenital aural atresia (CAA), foot deformities, mental retardation (MR), and hypotonia . Some familial cases with directed  transmission of the deleted chromosome have been described . Here,  we describe the cytogenetic and molecular studies of the 18q dele   tion syndrome in a mother and her daughter  . The mother presented  microcephaly, developmental delay, hypertelorism, strabismus, high  palate, submucous cleft palate, bifid uvula, congenital heart disease  and facial dysmorphisms . The daughter presented developmental delay, cleft palate, short neck and facial dysmorphisms . Using FISH  and molecular analysis with polymorphic short tandem repeats (STR),  the cytogenetic karyotype could be refined showing that: mother and  daughter have the same terminal deletion, the size of the deletion  was narrowed and the breakpoints were mapped between the mark   ers D18S1313 (18q22 .1) and D18S61 (18q22 .2), the parental origin of the deletion in the mother is paternal . This case supports that the  variability in phenotype is not only determined by the size of deletion,  once mother and daughter, with similar sized deletion, present differ   ent phenotypes, suggesting that allelic variation on the haploid portion  of 18q, genes on other chromosomal regions or environmental factors are modulating the phenotype .",2008

At the age 7 years clinical evaluation revealed failure to thrive ( 2 .5 SD), microcephaly ( 5 SD), profound  mental retardation, stereotypic movements, peculiar facies   high  forehead, palpebral fissures slant up, blepharophimosis, ptosis, hy   pertelorism, epicanthal folds, strabismus, broad nasal tip, high palate, low set and dysplastic ears, and preauricular pits . Additionally he had  bilateral severe sensorineural hearing loss, kyphosis, scoliosis, spina  bifida occulta, contractures of joints, tall fingers, partial syndactyly of  II V fingers and II V toes, sandle gap of toes, micropenis, cryptorchid testes, and mild hirsutism . During pediatric evaluations psoriasis vul   garis, asthma, celiac disease, iron deficient anemia and mild hypothy   reosis was diagnosed. We have applied Infinium 2 genotyping assay with Human370CNV Duo BeadChips (Illumina Inc .), which showed a  5 .9 Mb deletion of chromosome region 17q22 q23 .3 with a breakpoint  between 48,287,327 and 54,245,662bp. The aberration was confirmed  by real time PCR analysis .Regarding to our patients findings, we suggest that a locus for senso   rineural hearing loss and a locus for tracheo esophageal fistula may be located in the region of 17q22 q23 .3 .

She was born after an unremarkable pregnancy and delivery  .  Her parents first became concerned when she was two years old be   cause her fine motor and speech milestones were delayed. Currently,  she is integrated into a regular grade three class where she receives  some remedial help; a recent developmental assessment revealed that she is functioning at the level of a six year old . She also has  some gross motor difficulties and decreased coordination. Her gen   eral health has been good . Examination revealed that her weight and  height were >97th percentile and that her head circumference was at  the 80th percentile . Her facial features were slightly coarse . There was  no other evidence on examination of any physical features associated with trisomy 13 . The patientâs karyotype was done on a blood sample  and revealed that 10 out of 20 cells analyzed were trisomic for chromo   some 13 (ie . 50%) .

According to different authors some TS patients  may have Y chromosome material present in a few cells that are not  detected by standard cytogenetic analysis.

Here we report conventional and molecular cytogenetic investigations  in a case of mosaic sex chromosome aneuploidy combined with mosa   ic trisomy 8 and the presence of low level Y mosaicism . A 12 year old  girl was presented with short stature, gonadal dysgenesis and minor craniofacial dysmorphic features . Standard chromosome analysis on peripheral blood lymphocytes  showed the presence of three cell lines, whose karyotypes were 45,X [93%], 47,XY,+8 [5%] and 46,XX [2%] . FISH analysis was performed using as probes an alpha satellite for X chromosome (CEPX, Xp11 .1  q11 .1), a satellite III for Y chromosome (CEPY, Yq12) and an alpha  satelitte for chromosome 8 (CEP 8, 8p11 .1 q11 .1) . The results of FISH  analysis were in concordance with those of conventional cytogenetic  analysis showing a slight increase in the percentage of interphase  nuclei revealing trisomy 8 and Y chromosome mosaicism (8% FISH versus 5% standard cytogenetics) . The importance of systematic search for hidden Y chromosome mo   saicism in patients with TS is justified by the possibility of developing  gonadoblastoma and it is necessary for the appropriate clinical man   agement of the patient .",2008

We describe three patients who  share developmental delay and mental retardation, including retarded  development and limited speech abilities, hypotonia, febrile seizures or  epilepsy, hypertelorism, an abnormal corpus callosum and other CNS anomalies . By high resolution oligonucleotide and SNP array based  segmental aneuploidy profiling we detected in chromosomal region 1q44 three overlapping deletions of 1 .250, 4 .210 and 9 .436 Mb in size . The three patients share a 0 .43 Mb interstitial deletion, which contains  the FAM36A, HNRPU and the EFCAB2 genes . This region does not  contain AKT3 and ZNF238, two previously proposed candidate genes  for microcephaly and agenesis of the corpus callosum . Therefore, we  conclude that the HNRPU gene, which is deleted in all deletion 1q44  patients reported thus far, may represent an additional candidate for the core features of the terminal 1q deletion syndrome . Since only one  of the two patients with deletions including the ZNF124 gene showed  a Dandy Walker Malformation, mere hemizygosity for this gene seems  not to be sufficient to cause this anomaly.Cytogenetics",2008

Case report: Our patient, after delivered from second, with polyhy   dramnion complicated pregnancy, had bradycardia and cyanosis . His gestational age was 39 weeks, and the birthweight was 2910 grams . After delivery he had to be ventilated for some minutes . He got anti   biotics because of perinatal infection . During feeding he became cya   notic . Echocardiography revealed 10 mm wide second type atrial sep   tal defect . Neurological investigations revealed generalized hypotonia .  Other characteristic finding was the babyâs strange crying. Some mi   nor anomalities could be detected, such as low and back sitting ears,  short palpebral fissure, abnormal shape of the cranium, and clubbed  fingers. In the family history was no abnormality. Because of minor ab   normalities and congenital heart defect cytogenetic investigations was done . The cytogenetic investigation with G bands and FISH revealed  the duplication of the cri du chat region [46,XY,dup(5)(p15 .2 p15 .3)] .  Parentsâ karyogram was normal . This type of cytogenetic abormality  of chromosome 5 is rare, 9 cases have been reported until now, with  similar clinical and cytogenetic findings. The feeding of the infant was  difficult, suffered often from infections, had failure to thrive. Because of  the wide ASD the cardiac function became worse, severe pulmonary hypertonia developed . He died at the age of 6 months, with symptoms  of circulatory insufficienty.Conclusion: A rare cytogenetic aberration of  chromosome 5 is described, which help to understand the genotype phenotype correlation in patients with 5p duplication .",2008

Objective To characterise 50 sSMC detected in unrelated patients with constitutional genetic disorders, mental retardation or infertility  . Methodology G banding, HR CGH and FISH (M FISH, BACs)Results Acrocentric sSMC were detected in 74% (37/50) of cases .  Inv dup(15) was the most commonly detected sSMC followed by inv dup(13 or 21) . Non acrocentric sSMC were detected in the rest of cases (26%, 13/50) . sSMC derived from chromosomes 2, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 11, 17, 18 (three cases), 20 and X were also identified and two of them were neocÃ¨ntric (those derived from chromosomes 3 and 20) . In two cases,  we detected at least 4 sSMC derived from the same chromosome but with different morphologies . In one they derived from chromosome  9 and in the other they derived from chromosome X . In general, we  found according with the literature that the presence of euchromatin in  the de novo  sSMC is linked with an abnormal phenotype .

","Recent studies have shown that up to 40% of the apparently balanced  reciprocal chromosome translocations in patients with abnormal phe   notype can be accompanied by a chromosome imbalance . We present  a 10 year old girl with mild mental retardation, abnormal EEG, and au   tistic behavior, who began to speak at 5 years . She had no dysmorphic features and her brain MRI was normal . Karyotype analysis revealed  a de novo apparently balanced translocation t(6;14)(q16;q22) . Whole  genome array CGH analysis with ~385,000 oligonucleotide probes  (NimbleGen) identified an ~1.48 Mb deletion in 6q16.1. FISH with  BAC clones mapping within and directly flanking the deleted segment  showed that the deletion arose at the translocation breakpoint . Inter   estingly, autism has been linked previously to chromosome 6q16 . The  deleted segment harbors FUT9, GPR63, FHL5, KLHL32, c6orf66, and AK091365 and two predicted genes c6orf167 and KIA0776 . GPR63  is expressed almost exclusively in the brain and encodes a G pro   tein coupled receptor for sphingosine 1 phosphate . The fucosyltrans   ferase 9 gene, FUT9, is highly conserved among humans, mice, rats, and hamsters and is highly expressed in brain during embryogenesis .  FUT9 is considered to be involved in cell cell interactions, differentia   tion, and neurodevelopmental processes.

Array CGH has been instrumental in the identification of submicrosco   pic chromosomal aberrations leading to mental retardation and con   genital abnormalities (MR/MCA), the delineation of new microdeletion  syndromes and the identification of genes implicated in MR/MCA syn   dromes . An important step prior to assigning particular phenotypic fea   tures to particular genes is the delineation of critical regions for these  specific clinical features. To this purpose, smaller interstitial deletions  can be particularly important. In some syndromes, haploinsufficiency  of a single gene appears to be responsible for most of the phenotypic  features, as is the case for the EHMT1 gene in the 9q34 subtelomeric deletion syndrome . In contrast to distal 18q deletions, proximal intersti   tial deletions encompassing chromosome band 18q12 .3 and parts of  neighboring bands (q12.2âq21.1) have been reported less frequently. Up to now, 24 patients carrying such deletions were described . Ac   curate genotype phenotype correlations are only possible for those  cases for which breakpoints have been molecularly defined.Here we describe a boy with a submicroscopic deletion of less than 1 .8 Mb of subband 18q12 .3 . The phenotypic features of the proband cor   respond well with those observed in patients with larger cytogenetically detectable deletions encompassing chromosome band 18q12 .3 . The  deletion has been characterized at the molecular level which is impor   tant for defining small regions and eventually specific genes associat   ed with specific phenotypic features. The deletion enabled us to define a critical region for the following features of the del(18)(q12 .2q21 .1)  syndrome: hypotonia, expressive language delay, short stature and behavioral problems .",2008

Here, we monitored CIN in the AT brain by interphase chromosome  specific multicolour banding allowing analysis of interphase chromo   somes in their integrity  .

The latter was found to progress with the age of patients . Paradoxically, the longevity of AT  patients was in direct proportion to CIN levels in the cerebellum . We  hypothesize that aneuploidization and acquired CIN may result from  autoactivation of aberrant processes triggered in response to progres   sive neuronal degeneration . Newly generated neural cells, being ge   netically abnormal, nevertheless, partially substitute the loss of cells  in the cerebellum and play an ameliorative role in stabilization of the  diseased brain homeostasis .

","Blepharophimosis ptosis epicanthus inversus syndrome (BPES) is a  rare genetic disorder with autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with a frequency of 1 in 50,000 . Patients with BPES have a combina   tion of congenital anomalies as small palpebral fissures, epicanthus inversus, low nasal bridge and congenital ptosis . Other features like  microphthalmos, anophthalamos, microcornea, hypermetropia, diver   gent strabismus, high arched palate, cup shaped ears, mental retar   dation and infertility in females has been reported . BPES has been  categorized into two types: type I associated with primary ovarian fol   licle and type II involves only eye malformation in both sexes . Pen   etrance is 100% in type I (transmission by males only) and 96 .5% in type II (transmission through both sexes) . Review of reported cases  concluded that a locus for eyelid development is situated at 3q . Vari   ous reports linked the deletion in 3q21, 3q22, 3q23, 3q24, 3q25 and  translocations t(3:7)(q26 qter:q+), t(X:3)(p22:q21), t(3:8)(q23:p22 .1) to  the BPES . We analyzed 10 cases of BPES by GTG banding . Six were  males with mean age of 24 years and four were females with mean  age of 27 years . Different deletions and translocation of chromosome  3 has been linked with the BPES but there is no case reported with 3q26 28 and 5q31 .3 33 .2 deletions which we found in two cases . We also found 3qter deletion which has already been linked to the BPES .  These findings represent severe manifestation of the disease.

Are evolutionary chromosome rearrangements triggered by non  random nuclear neighbourhoods?,P02.112,"S. Mueller , F. Grasser, T. Cremer, M. Neusser","Human Genetics, Munich, Germany","We investigated whether non random nuclear neighbourhoods may  have triggered evolutionary chromosome rearrangements, focussing on the fusion of human chromosome 2 and the reciprocal translocation t(5;17) in the gorilla . We analysed the nuclear topology of breakpoint flanking loci in pre   and post meiotic cells from cryo sections of Rhesus macaque testis  tissue, where the fixation of chromosomal rearrangements is expected  to occur. Chromosome 5 and 17 breakpoint flanking BAC clones did  not co localise, but were positioned toward the nuclear centre and  at the chromosome territory surface. Both findings can be correlated with their rather gene dense local genomic environment . The result   ing short distances between the two loci may have acted as probabi   listic trigger for evolutionary rearrangements of gene dense genomic regions, even more if these reside exposed at the territory surface .  Indeed, in silico analysis indicates that the majority of breakpoints in  great apes characterized so far reside in genomic environments with  elevated local gene density compared to the average of the respective chromosome . In the light of these results it was surprising to find chromosome 2  fusion point flanking BAC clones localized in the nuclear periphery.  Despite this, the two loci were frequently positioned in close physical  proximity in Rhesus macaque spermatocytes, and even to a higher degree in spematogonia . In conclusion, non random nuclear positioning of genomic loci during meiosis may have triggered these two evolutionary rearrangements .  These triggers may be probabilistic, as shown for the t(5;17), or spe   cific side by side arrangements in the case of the fusion of human chromosome 2 .",2008

It seems likely that the two skin types  represent two different genotypes, even though this has been remark   ably difficult to prove. Our aim is to describe the neurocutaneous  symptoms and skin chromosomal mosaicism spectrum in a series of 14 pediatric patients . Patients and Methods: We have reviewed the karyotype of cultured  fibroblasts from 75 pediatric patients, who presented skin lesions sug   gestive of pigmentary mosaicism, studied in our institution from August 1998 to October 2007 . Biopsies were obtained from both hypopig   mented and hyperpigmented skin . Conventional chromosome banding studies were performed and karyotyped (ISCN, 1995) . Results: We reported 14 patients with skin mosaicism: three boys and eleven girls . Six of them presented numerical abnormalities: three  cases with diploid/triploid mosaicism, two patients with a marker chro   mosome (one of them with persistence of the marker in peripheral  blood karyotype); and one patient with a chromosome 20 trisomy and West syndrome . The rest of patients (n,8) had structural chromosomal abnormalities, with different chromosomes involved . All of them had  typical linear cutaneous lesions except a two year old girl with Pal   lister Killian syndrome . Conclusion: There is an association between chromosomal mosaicism  and hypopigmentation and hyperpigmentation especially following  Blaschko lines. We did not find in all patients direct correlation be   tween a specific chromosomal abnormality and neurological affection.  Patients with atypical cutaneous lesions or with neurological symp   toms could be candidates to perform a skin karyotype even though blood karyotype is normal .",2008

","Cytogenetic methods based on chromosome aberrations analysis  (G2 assay) make it possible quantitative estimation of radiation effects  on human organism taking into account its individual peculiarities and thus to estimate its IR . The main basis for application of cytogenetic  methods in radiobiology are high radiosensitivity of human PBL and  formation of stage specific radiation induced chromosomal aberra   tions . From the other hand elevated levels of chromosomal aberrations  are considered to be the proven markers of cancer development in the calculations of cancer risk after exposure to ionizing radiation . The aim  of the presented work was evaluation of chromosomal radiosensitivity  of healthy individuals and determination those with the increased sus   ceptibility to radiogenic pathologies . On the basis of the obtained âstage effectâ and âdose effectâ depen   dencies for chromosomal aberrations modifications of G2 assay were  developed. Analysis (in the first mitosis) of chromosomal aberrations  levels induced by G2 irradiation (1,5 Gy) of PBL cultures of 110 healthy individuals revealed their high interindividual variability  . The highest  differences were registered for chromatid breaks which predominated in the spectrum (CV, 37,5%) .

Clinical pathogenetics features are discussed, mainly with regard to  the early onset of signs of dystrophinopathy in a female patient with an  heterozygous deletion of the gene DMD and to the possible phenotyp   ic causal role of the gene IL1RAPL1, whose mutations in hemizygous  males has been reported in literature as responsible of some cases of X linked mental retardation .",2008

We present a patient with rare unbalanced aberration  of chromosome 18. He was a first child of the first pregnancy from non consanguineous parents . His mother was consulted during pregnancy at the Center for Medical Genetics . Risk of congenital malformations  for foetus was calculated due to maternal age, gestation and obstetric history  . The risk of trisomy 21 was 1:1099 according to the motherâs  age . Ultrasound scan was performed at 16 th week of gestation . Neither  foetal structural malformations nor minor defects or markers of chromo   somal diseases were detected . Triple test was performed at 16th week  of gestation . Biochemical risk of trisomy 21 was 1:55, for Trisomy 18   1:1708, for neural tube defects   1:356 . According to biochemical test  results of trisomy 21 invasive procedure was performed for aneuploidy testing by QF PCR . Test results were negative . At birth the weight was  2470g and dysmorphic features were characterized   microcephaly,  low hairline, hypertelorism, prominent nasal bridge, long philtrum, short  neck, overlapping position of the fingers, micropenis and corpus callo   sum agenesis. Expressed respiratory insufficiency was also observed.  The death at sixth months was final outcome of this patient. Chromo   somal analysis of peripheral blood lymphocytes revealed 46,XY,der(18) t(4;18)(p14;q12 .2) karyotype . Cytogenetic analysis was performed from GTG banded metaphases . The resolution level was 400 500 bands . Cy   togenetic investigation of the parents showed a chromosome aberration  in mother: she presented a t(4;18) (p14;q12.2). These results identified the exact nature of the unbalanced aberration of our patient .",2008

Comparing clinical features from  our patient and others who show an overlapping deletion, a common  âdel 2q32 phenotypeâ emerge: microcephaly, long face, high forehead,  abnormal teeth, low set ears, midface hypoplasia, high palate, micro   gnathia, transparent and thin skin, sparse hair, high frequency of ingui   nal hernia, severe development impairment, and behavioral problems. Anomalies of hands and feet are also common: this might be caused  by the deletion of the HOXD cluster which is involved in distal limb morphogenesis . Cleft palate is due to the deletion of the SATB2 gene  most likely by haploinsufficiency. Both ZNF533 and MYO1B genes are located in the deleted region . They are involved in neuronal function .  These genes may be good candidates for the neurological pheno   type which is however not present to date in our patient . Is there a  new locus for ectodermal dysplasia on chromosome 2q31q33?

However, a number of patients display only minor phenotypic variations or lack congenital anomalies . Material & Methods:  Chromosomal breakage analysis using MMC and  DEB was performed to differentiate FA from aplastic anemia in 166  children aged from 2 months to 14 years with myelodysplasia with or without congenital malformations . Matched for age and sex donors were used as controls . Peripheral blood samples were analysed with  conventional cytogenetic techniques . For clastogen induced chromo   some damage both MMC and DEB were added . A minimum of 150  metaphases per case were analyzed . FA positive was concidered the  case in which the percentage of breaks was 7 10 times higher as com   pared to controls . Results:  Incuced breaks were detected in 8/166 patients tested with  both clustogens . Six were diagnosed as FA while the remaining two,  despite the high percentage of clastogenic damage, were character   ised as Silver Russell syndrome and Blackfan Diamond anemia re   spectively  . 3/6 FA patients presented with congenital anomalies and  3 only with aplastic anemia . 2/6 FA patients were dizygote twins .

Detecting of gonadal mosaicism for trisomy of chromosomes  without severe imprinting effects,P02.150,"M. Tahmasebi Hesari , N. V. Kovaleva","St.Petersburg Medical Academy of Postgraduate Studies, St. Petersburg, Rus   sian Federation. ","Gonadal mosaicism (GM) may account for both recurrent cases of  chromosomal anomalies and appreciable proportion of âsporadicâ cas   es . However even in the case of a recurrent anomaly, it is not always  easy to discover a suspected GM in the absence of the abnormal line in a somatic tissue of a carrier  . To optimize the testing procedure, we  have conceived the following algorithm . (i) Study on parental origin of the extra chromosome in the trisomic offspring . (ii) Finding appar   ent non disjunction (NDJ) is followed by testing the grandparents on the parent of originâs side . Presence of two homologs from the same  grandparent in the parent of origin (uniparental disomy, UPD) and in the trisomic proband, would indicate GM in the parent of origin . (iii)  Finding a ânewâ extra chromosome in the proband is followed by test   ing the grandparents on both sides . Presence of a grandparental ho   molog not seen in both parents in the proband, would uncover a carrier of GM . Presence of crossovers (ânewâ allele) may add to uncovering  both GM and its carrier  . Finding UPD or a ânewâ chromosome/allele in  a healthy offspring may also help to reveal the presence of GM in a  parent . (iv) Parents of origin with undetectable GM should receive a  rigorous multi tissue cytogenetic investigation for the presence of ab   normal line . We believe that expenses of labour  and time consuming  testing of families for suspected GM can be rewarded by the opportu   nity of choosing a desirable reproduction strategy  .

","Small supernumerary marker chromosomes (sSMCs) are structurally  abnormal chromosomes that cannot be characterized unambiguously by conventional cytogenetic banding techniques . Until recently, the  great variety of marker chromosomes and difficulties with their iden   tification presented a problem for the cytogenetic interpretation of the karyotype . The risk for an abnormal phenotype is about 7% when de  novo sSMCs derived from chromosomes 13, 14, 21, and 22 are ascer   tained prenatally  . In a Greek survey of 7,000 amniotic fluid samples, nine fetuses with marker chromosomes were detected in our laboratory  . Using com   bined approaches of conventional cytogenetics including special stain   ing techniques and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), we suc   cessfully characterized all of them, which assisted subsequent genetic counseling and decision making . Eight of the SMCs were proven to  be of autosomal origin . Of the autosomal SMCs, two originated from  chromosome 15, one from chromosome 9, one from chromosome  18, one from chromosome 20, and three from chromosome 22 . One  marker chromosome was of sex chromosome origin . Euchromatin ma   terial was detected in 7 cases . Five of seven de novo marker chromo   somes were associated with abnormal findings and were terminated.  Our study demonstrates that molecular cytogenetic characterization  of marker chromosomes detected at prenatal diagnosis, is of crucial  significance to risk evaluation and decision making of the couple.",2008

Chromosome anal   ysis using GTG banding technique on the probands showed a high  frequency of prophase like cells (80%) compared to normal controls (13%) . The morphology of chromosomes was very poor and appeared  fragile, twisted, curly and with raised breakage and overall very un   usual looking . This phenomenon is due to premature chromosome  condensation. Molecular investigation in the first family, using array  based homozygosity mapping and array CGH revealed deletion in the  MCPH1 gene, one of four genes that have previously been implicated in autosomal recessive mental retardation with mirocephaly  . In the  other two families, using homozygosity mapping, linkage to MCPH1 locus was suggested . MCPH1 gene is the only microcephaly gene as   sociated with premature chromosome condensation . The Cytogenetics findings demonstrating premature entry of cells into  mitosis suggested mutation of genes involved in cell cycle regulation,  which was then confirmed by molecular investigation. Our findings  emphasize the importance of chromosome studies on patients with mental retardation and microcephaly  . Findings of chromosomes with  premature condensation in such patients implicate mutation in MCPH1 gene, which would therefore warrant further molecular investigations .",2008

It is a syndrome with a very low frecuency, estimated  in 11,7 cases for each million of births, although the incidence and the prevalence are probably higher  . Objective: The aim of this study is to report a case from âbreast fed  babyâ with a extensive record: premature baby, dismorfic phenotype,  lissencephaly, agenesis of the corpus callosum and septum pellu   cidum. Molecular techniques are used to confirm the submicroscopic deletion on 17p13 .3 . Methods: It was realized a double culture of lymphocytes with conven   tional banding GTG high resolution, followed by a FISH with the probe LSI 1 (maps to the 17p13 .3 region on chromosome 17 containing the  gene localization of the MDS) . Results: The fetuÂ´s karyotype is: Male: 46, XY, del (17) (p13 .3) . After  hybridization with the probe, the SpectrumOrange LSI 1 signal was  present in only one chromosome 17 and the SprectrumGreen LSI RARA 17q21 .1 signal (control) was present in both chromosomes 17 .

Furthermore, the extent of the deletions has  not been determined in the majority of these cases, which makes phe   notype genotype correlation difficult. In this study we present a 1 year  old girl with severe neonatal hypotrophy, microcephaly, mental retar   dation, large low set and deformed ears, wide forehead, strabismus,  massive nose, long philtrum, wide mouth with thin lips, micrognatia, pectus excavatum, spinal curvature and clubfoot . METHODS: The patient was analysed using conventional cytogenet   ics, array CGH and FISH . Array CGH was carried out using a sub   megabase whole genome tiling path BAC array and the results were  verified by FISH analysis. RESULTS: Cytogenetic analysis of the patient and her parents re   vealed a de novo deletion of chromosome 21q22 .11 qter  . The deletion  was further characterized by array CGH which justified the borders of the deletion to 21q22 .12 qter (chr21:35,860,000 46,940,000, hg17) . In addition we detected a 0,9 Mb duplication on chromosome 17q12 .  Array CGH was also performed on the cytogenetically normal parents  and the results showed that the duplication was inherited from the phe   notypically normal father  .CONCLUSION: In the present study we analysed a patient with a terminal deletion of 21q22 . The clinical manifestations of our patient are mostly consistent with previously reported cases . However, since  the extent of the majority of these deletions has not been determined,  though phenotype genotype correlation is difficult. We therefore rec   ommend that patients with chromosomal abnormalities diagnosed by conventional karyotyping should be reinvestigated by array CGH .",2008

","Entropion is an inversion of the eyelid toward the globe . The lower  eyelid is more frequently affected and depending on the underlying  disorder  . Entropion may be either unilateral or bilateral . Congenital  entropion is an extremely rare disorder, usually involves the lower eyelids . It is often familial and seen more frequently in Asians . The  possible causes for this condition include structural tarsal plate de   fects (horizontal tarsal kink syndrome) and shortened posterior lamella (tarsus, conjunctiva, eyelid retractors) .

","Balanced carriers of reciprocal and Robertsonian translocations suffer  from reduced fertility and are at increased risk of recurrent spontane   ous abortions or chromosomally unbalanced offspring . During meiosis  I, segregation of the translocated chromosomes and their normal ho   mologues produces a variety of unbalanced gametes . Preimplantation  genetic diagnosis (PGD) offers to the translocation carriers an alterna   tive to prenatal diagnosis and a possible pregnancy termination . PGD  allows not only selection of normal embryos but also provides unique information about the chromosome segregation . Interphase FISH combining subtelomeric and centromeric probes was  used to examine the blastomeres of 126 embryos from 6 Robertsonian  (2 female/4 male carriers) and 12 reciprocal translocation carriers (6 female/6 male carriers) . In Robertsonian translocation carriers, 39 .3% normal and 53 .6% aneuploid (25% trisomic and 28 .6% monosomic)  embryos were found . Each reciprocal translocation had a different  segregation mode, but at least one balanced blastomere was found in  each translocation . The lengths of translocated segments varied from 7 .8Mb to 140 .4Mb (4% to 73% of the chromosome involved) . Alternate segregation (chromosome balanced) was found in 31% blastomeres . In unbalanced blastomeres, 39 .4% resulted from adjacent segrega   tion, 15 .5% from segregation 3:1 and 14 .1% of blastomeres were  haploid, polyploid or chaotic . No statistical difference between male  and female rates of chromosome abnormalities in both Robertsonian  and reciprocal translocation carriers was observed . Comparison of the  length of translocated chromosome segment and the type of segrega   tion revealed a trend for higher proportion of normal blastomeres when shorter chromosome segments were involved .",2008

After  the exposition, the cells were applied into different assays such as  conventional cytogenetic analysis for structural and numerical abnor   malities, micronuclei frequency, HER 2, C MYC and TP53 gene status  through FISH, CGH profile and apoptosis related proteins. RESULTS: Genomic changes such as chromosomal breaks, trans   locations, marker chromosomes and aneuploidy, when compared to  the controls, were detected in SAR levels above 5W/kg as well as  the increase of micronuclei frequency above 10W/kg. CGH profiles  and FISH analysis did not show a significant difference between the  controls and the exposed samples . It was observed a trend for the  detection of different genomic instability processes above SAR limits of 5 and 10W/kg .

In this study we present a retrospective study of the  cytogenetic data in 310 couples with recurrent spontaneous abortions registered in Imam Khomeini hospital in Tehran . Materials and Methods: Giemsa banding and Reverse banding tech   niques according to standard procedures were routinely applied on peripheral lymphocytes in all patients . Results: In our 310 couples with recurrent spontaneous abortions, the incidence of chromosomal rearrangements was 19 (6 .1%) . Of all  chromosomal abnormalities detected, 42% (8/19) were balanced re   ciprocal translocations, 21% (4/19) were Robertsonian translocations, 16% (3/19) were para  or pericentric inversions, 10 .5% (2/19) were X  chromosome aneuploidies, and 10 .5% (2/19) were marker chromo   somes . Pericentric inv(9)(p11;q13) were excluded because they were  considered as a normal population variant . Conclusion: In this study we found chromosomal rearrangements in 6 .1% of our patients with recurrent spontaneous abortions which  is much higher than the incidence of chromosomal abnormalities in general population .

Carriers are phenotypically normal, but at risk of  having progeny with Emanuel syndrome . It is conceivable that this  large chromatin rearrangement influences the transcription levels of  genes mapping both near, and distant, to chromosome breakpoints . To  test this, we compared gene expression profiles of lymphoblastoid cell  lines from 13 cytogenetically normal individuals, to those of 9 balanced translocation carriers and 4 unbalanced Emanuel syndrome patients . Comparison of unbalanced individuals with controls revealed twice as  many gene expression changes than the balanced/control compari   son . This was anticipated as individuals are partially aneuploid for both  HSA11 and 22 and are phenotypically affected . Consistently, a statisti   cally significant fraction of the differentially expressed genes mapped  to these two chromosomes . Permutation tests showed that, despite being lower, the number of  differentially expressed genes between the two groups with complete  genome complements is significantly higher than that observed when one compares control samples alone . This suggests that balanced re   arrangements have a greater effect on gene expression than normal variation even though individuals are phenotypically normal . Interestingly, in balanced individuals, expression of HSA11 genes is affected to a much higher degree than those on HSA22 . We hypoth   esize that the position of the derivative chromosomes is altered within  the nucleus, with derivatives chromosomes being moved to a position comparable to the normal HSA22 . This would result in HSA11 genes  being placed into an altered chromatin environment, thus altering their expression . We are currently investigating this possibility  .",2008

These structures protect from  shortening at each replication cycle . Telomerase is the enzyme which is responsible for the elongation of the telomeres, and exists only in cancer, stem and progenitor cells . A reduction in telomerase levels was  observed in HCV patients lymphocytes compared to healthy individu   als . The aim of this study was: 1) Evaluating random aneuploidy rate in lym   phocytes of chronically infected HCV patients compared to individuals who eradicated the virus (remission group) and to healthy controls . 2)  Developing new method for measuring relative telomere length . For random aneuploidy, we applied the FISH technique with probes  from chromosome 9 and 18 . For the telomere detection we used the  PNA telomere kit . A significantly higher random aneuploidy rate was found in the HCV  group as compared to the control group, while the remission group had  intermediate rates between the other tow groups . We observed significantly shorter telomere length in HCV patients compared to the controls and to the group in remission . We found a  reverse correlation between shorter telomeres and the rate of aneu   ploidy  . Random aneuploidy and short telomeres are two co existing biological  phenomena found in HCV patients; it may represent pre malignant changes which could play a role in the cascade leading to neoplasia .",2008

In our previous studies, we established translocation specific  PCR by using the sequence of the translocation junction fragments from both derivative translocation chromosomes . Using this method,  we successfully detected de novo t(11;22)s in sperm samples from  normal healthy males, but not in lymphoblasts or fibroblasts. To un   derstand how this translocation occurs during spermatogenesis, we  divided sperm samples into small aliquots prior to DNA extraction and  directly performed translocation specific PCR. Multiplex PCR allowed  us to detect der(11) and der(22) specific PCR products of de novo  origin, which were amplified concomitantly from the same aliquots.  This result suggests that the de novo t(11;22) occurs as a reciprocal translocation . Further, we changed the combinations of primer pairs,  which allowed us to identify dicentric and acentric translocation deriva   tive chromosomes . Interestingly, these two unusual derivative chromo   somes also appear concomitantly in the same aliquots .

Saltanatpouri","Department of Genetics, Cancer Institute, Imam Khomeini Medical Center,  School of Medicine, Medical Sciences / University of Tehran, Tehran, Islamic  Republic of Iran","Whole arm translocations result from centric fusion of two chromo   somes (usually nonhomologous), followed by a reciprocal exchange  with fusion of entire arms in two derivatives, each with a hybrid cen   tromere . Nevertheless, there are at least two alternatives: that both  points of interchange will be juxtacentromeric and then each deriva   tive will conserve its own whole centromere, or that one point will be  centromeric and the other juxtacentromeric, so that one derivative will  have a hybrid centromere and the other will conserve its original but reduced centromere . Although the underlying mechanisms are still  unknown, detailed molecular analyses have provided evidence that  centromere duplication may predispose to constitutional centric fusion and consequently favour the occurrence of whole arm translocations .  Constitutional whole arm translocations are rather rare and can be  identified in either a balanced or unbalanced state. Most individuals with balanced forms have a normal phenotype, but may be subfertile .  In contrast, patients with unbalanced whole arm translocations have abnormal phenotypes . Here, we describe a 34 year old healthy mar   ried man who was referred because of consanguinity  . His wife and  first child were healthy and they wished to have a second child. Chro   mosomal studies were carried on lymphocyte cultures using G band   ing . All mitoses showed a reciprocal whole arm translocation (15;16) .

Methods: A retrospective review of the cytogenetic laboratory databas   es identified all cases of prenatally diagnosed trisomy 13 and trisomy  18 from January 1997 to December 2007, and maternal age was re   corded . Ages were compared by unpaired t test, with a power of 44 .6% because the two groups had no normal distribution . A âpâ value < 0 .05  was considered statistically significant. Results: 61 affected fetuses were included: 38 cases of trisomy 18 and 23 cases of trisomy 13 . The mean maternal age in cases of trisomy 13 was 30 .3 years (16 44 years, sd , 7 .8 years), and in cases of trisomy 18 was 29 .9 years (16 46 years, sd , 9 years) .

The  frequency of patients younger than 35 years of age for trisomy 18 was  65 .7% (n,25) and for trisomy 13 was 65 .2% (n,15) . Conclusion: Our study showed that the difference in mean maternal  age among fetuses affected by trisomy 13 and trisomy 18 was not  significant. It was shown a trend of more cases diagnosed in patients younger than 35 years old . However, more data are needed to es   tablish whether this is a true phenomenon or a bias of the population studied .",2008

However, little is known about meiotic process in  men of proven fertility  . We carried out meiotic studies in spermatocytes  to establish the base line level of meiotic abnormalities in fertile males .  MATERIAL AND METHODS: Testicular biopsies were obtained from 11 fertile males aged 30 47 . Meiotic spreads were prepared by the air drying technique and cells were stained with DAPI . RESULTS: Meiotic  progression was analysed at pachytene, metaphase I and metaphase II stages, counting 1,000 pachytene spermatocytes per individual . All  males showed a normal meiotic progression, with a proportion of meta   phase II to metaphase I higher than 0 .5 . A total of 848 spermatocytes at metaphase I was studied . The overall percentage of dissociated sex  chromosomes was 21 .7% . Autosomal synaptic abnormalities were  found in 0 .9% of spermatocytes I (medium sized bivalents with one chiasmata or small bivalents as two separated univalents) . Only 0 .2% of the spermatocytes I analysed were hyperploid . Hypoploidy was not  evaluated, since it could be due to technical artefacts . The percentage  of structural chromosome aberrations per individual ranged from 0% to  5 .8% . The total mean chiasma frequency was 51 .0, ranging from 48 .7 to 53 .0 . CONCLUSION: The incidence of meiotic abnormalities (both  chromosomal and synaptic abnormalities), as well as spermatocyte  distribution and chiasma count in fertile males could be used as refer   ence data in further studies on males with idiopathic infertility  .

modelling reduced male fertility in mice,P02.232,"E. Bolcun Filas, R. Speed, M. Taggart, H. J. Cooke","MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Human fertility is highly variable and a substantial part of that variation is genetic . The phenotype is hard to measure and involves input from  two individuals making whole genome association studies difficult if not impossible to design robustly  . Candidate gene approaches based  on a knowledge of the underlying processes of gametogenesis have  had only limited success. This is a reflection both of the large number  of genes thought to be required, particularly for sperm production, and  the likelihood that the majority of mutations are recessive requiring  rare homozygosity for a mutation at any one locus to produce a phe   notype . Recognising this we have asked if compound heterozygosity at genes encoding proteins required for meiosis can be a factor  . SYCE1 and  SYCE2 are proteins of the meiotic Synaptonemal Complex . We have  shown that SYCE2 is essential for male and female fertility in mice and here we show that this is also true for SYCE1 . Heterozygous null  animals are fertile in the case of both genes . Mice heterozygous for  both null alleles have a ten fold elevation in XY asynapsis and also an  increase in unpaired autosomes . Lack of pairing is predicted to result in cell death and a consequent reduction in sperm count . We observe  a reduction in sperm count of up to 40% showing that compound hemi   zygosity in genes involved in the same pathway can have a significant impact .",2008

Analysis of these gene clusters using IPA software revealed  an interesting down regulated gene network directly related with sper   matogenesis, with the most significant network centred around YBX2  gene (Y box binding protein 2), involved in RNA storage during game   togenesis .

The contribution of male factors to patients is about 30 50%  . The  main genetic factors in male infertility are somatic chromosomal ab   normalities and Y chromosomal microdeletions within Yq11 region .  The genes which control spermatogenesis are located in Yq11 region and are known as azoospermia factor genes (AZF) .The AZF region  has 3 non overlapping loci AZFa, AZFb, AZFc which are required for normal spermatogenesis . All these genes are expressed in testicular tissue showing that they play roles in human spermatogenesis . Here,  we aimed to detect somatic cytogenetic abnormalities and AZF micro   deletions in a sample of 187 Turkish infertile men and to evaluate the  frequencies and the characteristics of our primary male infertility data in order to perform appropriate genetic counseling . Cytogenetic study revealed chromosomal abnormality in 9 subjects (4 .8%) . In remaining 178 subjects, 7 subjects (3 .93%) were detected to have Y chromosome microdeletions . The AZFc region was the most frequently involved region in affected subjects . One of these subjects  showed microdeletion in all 3 regions(AZFa, AZFb, AZFc) and one subject had microdeletions in both AZFb and AZFc regions . Other 5  subjects had microdeletions in only AZFc region . All subjects having  microdeletion were azoospermic . In conclusion, cytogenetic and molecular study should be performed  to obtain reliable genetic information for the genetic counseling of pri   mary infertile man . Y chromosome microdeletion diagnosis is useful  in decision making for assisted reproductive techniques because the  association between some deletions and residual spermatogenesis capacity has been proven .",2008

The murine Sox9   gene is expressed in embryonic and postnatal Sertoli cells of the mouse  testis, and inactivation of Sox9  before the sex determination stage at  E11 .5 leads to complete XY sex reversal . To see whether Sox9  is re   quired for testis development after testis induction, we crossed S ox  9flox mice with an AMH (Anti MÃ¼llerian Hormone)  Cre transgenic line .  Conditional Sox9  null mutants, SOX9 negative at E14 .0, are initially  fertile, but become sterile from complete meiotic arrest at around 5  months . As Sox8 , a Sox9  related transcription factor, i) is expressed  similar to Sox9  during murine testis development, ii) has been shown  in vitro to activate AMH, a Sox9  target during testis development, iii) is  expressed normally in AMH Cre;Sox9flox/flox mutants, and iv) as homo   zygous Sox8  null mutants show no obvious early gonadal phenotype,  we hypothesized that Sox8  may compensate for the absence of Sox9  .  We therefore generated a Sox9  conditional knockout on a Sox8 mu  tant background . In double mutants heterozygous for Sox8 , testes de   velop normally up to post natal day 10 (P10), but subsequently show spermatogenic arrest . Homozygous double mutants show normal tes   tis cord formation at E15 .5, but subsequent testis cord development  is impaired; at P6, testis cords are completely irregular in shape and  appear fibrotic, resulting in complete infertility. In summary, concerted  function of Sox9  and Sox8  in post E14 .0 Sertoli cells is essential for the  maintencance of testicular function .",2008

Total number of the gene copies is es   timated from 20 to 40. Testis specific expression indicates a role in meiotic or post meiotic processes during spermatogenesis . The aims of this work are: 1) Confirmation of our previous findings (Vodicka R, et al., TSPY gene copy number as a potential new risk factor for male infertility  . Reprod  Biomed Online . 2007 May;14(5):579 87 .) 2) Analyses and comparison of a new DNA samples from infertile and seminoma patients . Material and method: There were included 104 infertile and 6 semi   noma patients and 50 healthy controls into study  . Copy number relative quantification was measured using the combina   tion of two Real  Time PCRs by Y quantifiler kit and by SYBR green kit . Results: Our results confirmed increasing copy number in infertile pa   tients (in average 53 relative TSPY copies) compare to controls (in average 31 relative copies) even after enlarged collection of samples .

Recently, several studies have proposed  that partial AZFc deletions/duplications may represent a risk factor for spermatogenic impairment . Here we describe a multiplex quantitative  fluorescent (QF) PCR method that allows detection of these common genetic causes and risk factors of male infertility  . The 11 plex QF PCR  included the amplification of amelogenine gene; four polymorphic  X specific short tandem repeats (STR) markers (XHPRT, DXS6803,  DXS981 and exon 1 of the AR gene), non polymorphic Y specific  marker (SRY gene), polymorphic Y specific STR marker (DYS448),  as well as co amplification of DAZL/DAZ, MYPT2/MYPT2Y and two  CDY1/CDY2 fragments that allowed for the determination of the DAZ, MYPT2Y and CDY gene copy number  . A total of 348 DNA samples  from infertile/subfertile patients (n,204) and fertile controls (n,144) were included in the study  . We detected 14 infertile males with sex  chromosomal aneuploidies (10 individuals with Klinefelterâs syndrome, two XX and two XYY males) . All previously detected AZF deletions;  AZFc (n8), AZFb (n1), AZFb+c (n1), gr/gr (n11), gr/gr with b2/b4 du   plication (n3) and b2/b3 (n5) gave a specific pattern with the 11 plex QF PCR . In addition, 29 DNA samples showed pattern consistent with the presence of gr/gr and two with b2/b3 duplication . In conclusion,  multiplex QF PCR is a rapid, simple, reliable and inexpensive method  that can be used as a first step genetic analysis in infertile/subfertile patients . P03.

The objective of our study is to evaluate the feasibility of BAC arrays in the analysis of prenatal samples . METHODS: Chorionic villus and amniotic fluid samples are obtained using standard clinical procedures . DNA is extracted and labelled for  the aCGH analysis . For samples with limited amounts of DNA, we per   form whole genome amplification (WGA). Two types of arrays are used:  arrays targeted to constitutional syndromes (Constitutional ChipÂ® 3 .0),  and 1 Mb resolution arrays covering whole genome (Spectral ChipTM) .  The arrays are scanned with ScanArrayÂ®, and data is analysed with  SpectralWareÂ® . All samples are also analysed by conventional karyo   typing. Potential aCGH findings are confirmed with FISH using the cor   responding BAC DNA as probe . RESULTS: To reduce the turn around time, DNA is extracted directly  from the samples. For direct amplification, we have compared three  suppliers for their WGA performance . In addition, some cases have  been tested both with native and amplified DNA to address potential  bias caused by amplification. Results are promising, and a larger set  of samples will confirm the best practices. CONCLUSION: The use of samples without cell culturing combined  with simultaneous detection numerous genomic imbalances can have  great benefit to prenatal diagnosis. The difficulty in discriminating the  pathologic and benign copy number variations and the possibility to  detect potentially unwanted information will undoubtedly be challeng   ing for the professionals interpreting the data but also for array manu   factures .",2008

","Introduction: Recently it has been shown that rapid QF PCR can detect  the great majority of chromosome abnormalities in prenatal samples  despite being deliberately targeted to chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y . Main advantages of the assay are low cost, speed and automation allowing large scale application . Methods: We developed a QF PCR assay that has been applied on 38 .000 clinical samples . Most frequent indications were increased bio   chemical risk (32%) and advanced maternal age (30%), 6% of these  cases were also associated with increased nuchal translucency; pa   rental anxiety and abnormal ultrasound were present in 22% and 7% of samples respectively  . Cytogenetic analysis was performed in all  cases and results compared . Results: All 1278 non mosaic aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21,  18, 13 X and Y were detected with 100% sensitivity and specificity;  several cases of mosaicism and partial trisomies were also identified.  QF PCR detected 95% of clinically significant abnormalities diagnosed by cytogenetic analysis in samples referred for abnormal ultrasound .  Affected pregnancies could be terminated without further waiting for  completion of fetal karyotype Conclusions: Large scale application of QF PCR could reduce the  load of prenatal cytogenetics if all pregnancies are carefully monitored by non invasive methods . In cases of negative QF PCR results cyto   genetic analyses might only be performed for fetuses with abnormal  ultrasound; affected pregnancies identified by QF PCR can be termi   nated in a few hours from sampling . In countries where large scale  cytogenetics is hampered by its cost and lack of technical expertise QF PCR may be used as the only prenatal diagnostic test .",2008

Labrune","Antoine BÃ©clÃ¨re hospital, Clamart, France","Introduction Alpha feto protein (AFP) is a major plasma protein produced by the yolk sac and the liver during the foetal period . During the 2nd trimester  of pregnancy, AFP combined with Î²hCG are commonly used for Down  syndrome risk evaluation. Deficiency of AFP is a rare phenomenon  (estimated to occur in 1/105000 newborns) and only one sequence  alteration in AFP gene was reported . Here we report a new mutation  in exon 5 of the foetal AFP gene leading to a total absence of AFP  on 2nd trimester maternal serum screening for Down syndrome, con   firmed on the amniotic fluid. Despite this, foetal development and birth were normal . Methods After PCR amplification, the whole AFP gene was sequenced . To de   termine the amniotic fluid profile, proteins were separated by electro   phoresis and compared with 10 normal amniotic fluids sampled at the same gestational age (18 weeks) . Results The new mutation observed was a guanine to adenine transition in position 543 creating a premature stop codon in position 181 . A new  SNP was characterised in the exon 12 (c .1641A>G) . Albumin rate in  the amniotic fluid was reduced compared to controls, whereas alpha1  and beta protein fractions were increased . Discussion   Conclusion The c.543G>A mutation is the second sequence modification identified  so far in the AFP gene, responsible for its complete deficiency. Elec   trophoresis results suggest that deficiency may modify protein fraction  repartition, particularly albumin, alpha1 and beta fractions suggesting complex molecular mechanisms of compensation . Studies on other  families with AFP deficiency are necessary to confirm this observa   tion .",2008

Genetic counseling of  patients with SMC can be difficult, especially in prenatal testing, due to the complexity in establishing a karyotype phenotype correlation . In  fact, it has been estimated that about 37% of prenatal diagnosed SMC are associated with an abnormal phenotype . We report two cases of  prenatal diagnosed SMC, detected by G banding and completed by  C banding and NOR staining. In the first case, the marker was familial, segregating from a mother with non mosaic karyotype . In the second case, the SMC was de novo and present in the 78% of cells . The fol   lowing FISH procedures were performed to confirm and specify the  material present in the marker chromosomes: locus specific identifier,  24 colour FISH, CGH, chromosomal manual microdissection and re   verse FISH. These techniques identified both SMC as derivatives of  chromosome 22. In the first case, the inherited SMC was an iso(22p)  and the child was delivered successfully without phenotypic abnormal   ities . In the second case, the SMC was a der(22)(q11 .2), resulting in a  partial trisomy of band 22q11 .2, which has been associated with Cat  eye syndrome (CES) in the literature . In this case the pregnancy was interrupted . It can be concluded with this study that familial markers representing an iso(22p) can be correlated with a normal phenotype .

Recent evidence suggests that there is considerable  variation in the extent to which these guidelines translate into practice .  This is particularly evident in cross country comparisons . This paper  presents findings from a values survey that assessed the extent to  which informed choice in the context of prenatal testing is a universally held value . Method: Values attached to choice in the context of prenatal diagnosis  were assessed among 1) general populations (n,1200) and 2) obste   tricians (n,1117) in Europe (UK, Netherlands, Italy and Greece) and Asia (China and India) . Results: Findings from both samples suggest that there is a sharp di   vide between first Northern European countries and second, Southern European and Asian countries in the extent to which choice is valued .  Most respondents from Northern European countries perceived that  undergoing prenatal testing should reflect a parental choice (71%  86%), compared with a minority from Southern European and Asian countries (16% 33%) . Comparison across the populations suggests  that health professionals are more strongly in favour of choice than general populations . Given the political endorsement of informed  choice, the latter may reflect a tendency for professional identities to dominate over personal values .

In the present study, chromosome study was carried out on young couple who was married for 1 .5 yrs and  had three consecutive missed abortions . However, chromosome study  was not carried out in any of the abortus . Couples karyotyping follow   ing PHA stimulated blood culture detected constitutive abnormality in husband with 46,XY,t(13;14)(q22 .1;q24 .3) pattern . The translocation  between the two chromosomes was a balanced one with no significant phenotypic effect . The wife had a normal female karyotype . The pos   sible genetic make up of the male gametes and subsequently of the  fetus could be: i) both normal 13 and 14, ii) rearranged 13 with normal  14, iii) rearranged 14 with normal 13, and iv) both rearranged 13 and 14 . Mathematically, she has a 1 in 4 (25%) chance of having baby  entirely chromosomally normal and the others will be a translocation âcarrierâ just like father or carrier of a recombinant 13 or 14 . There   fore, 3/4 of her babies are at risk for being chromosomally abnormal .  These babies could have severe congenital malformations and if they  manage to survive birth and the neonatal period, profound metabolic disturbances and mental retardation could persist life long .

","Amniocentesis was carried out at 17 weeks gestation on a 27 years old woman following an abnormal maternal serum screening test (MSS) .  MSS test was carried out primarily to estimate the risk of trisomy for chromosomes 21 and 18 . The maternal serum markers used were  alpha fetoprotein (AFP), human chorionic gonadotrophin (HCG), and unconjugated estriol (UE3) together with maternal age . The fetus was  identified as screen positive for Edwardâs syndrome (trisomy18), with low UE3, normal AFP and hCG levels . The calculated risk for trisomy 18 was more than 1:50 . To identify any possible chromosomal abnormality, cytogenetics inves  tigation was carried out on amniotic fluid sample. The fetusâs kayo   type was triploid with 69, XXX chromosome complement in all the  metaphase spreads obtained from three different cultures, using GTG banding technique . Upon termination of the fetus, gross abnormalities  indicative of triploidy were present in the fetus . This is one of a few cases reported so far where abnormal maternal  serum screening indicative of trisomy 18, ends up as a triploid fetus .  Maternal serum screening is an essential approach for detecting chro   mosome abnormality prenatally, and thus helping with prevention of the birth of a genetically abnormal fetus .",2008

Methods: CVS analyses obtained by transabdominal biopsy in first  and second trimester of 57 pregnant women with ultrasonographic evidence of missed abortion were performed . For chromosome analy   sis conventional cultures of CVS and GTG banding techniques were used . Results: Of total 579 CVS analysed, 57 CVS were performed for missed abortion . The mean maternal age was 35,86 (22 46) years, and mean gestational week was 9,75 (8 16) .

Although it reduces maternal anxiety by discarding the most fre   quent chromosomal anomalies, some other like terminal deletions are missed . In addition, rapid detection of unbalanced products of parental  balanced translocations requires the use of additional specific FISH probes . In contrast, MLPA technique with subtelomeric probe mixes  provides information about copy number changes of every chromo   some in a rapid (24 h) and simple protocol requiring few material . Al   though specific probe mixes for the detection of common anomalies in  prenatal diagnosis have been validated, the aim of the present study  was to evaluate the use of subtelomeric probe mixes for the rapid de   tection of aneuploidy, unbalanced reciprocal translocations and termi   nal chromosomal rearrangements of every chromosome on a hundred  and twenty five consecutive chorion villi  samples . Terminal deletion or  duplication was suspected when two different probes for a chromo   somal arm appeared deleted or duplicated, respectively  . Aneuploidy  was suspected if probes for both arms of a chromosome appear de   leted (monosomy) or duplicated (trisomy) . Results demonstrate the  capability of MLPA on detecting not only numerical but also structural chromosomal anomalies on prenatal samples . Thus, this technique  can also be a rapid and simple approach for the detection of balanced or unbalanced products of translocations .",2008

When de   tected in prenatal diagnosis is a troublesome problem on interpreta   tion and genetic counselling . We present three cases with low level of  mosaicism:1 .  Twenty cells anlysed from two independent vessels showed  47,XXX, which is a good prognostic result . But a culture performed  in another laboratory showed a 45,X/47,XXX with a 75% of monoso   mic cells . We revised our slides and found 7/40 of 45,X cells, which  changed the genetic counselling . 2.  The first culture showed 1/50 of 47,XY,+21 cells, the second and the third showed 5/50 and 2/25 trisomic cells, respectively  . This was  an ambiguous result, with 6% of +21 cells . We performed QF PCR  analysis for common aneuploidies with a portion of fresh amniotic fluid and the result was compatible with trisomy 21 . 3: The cell culture in this case was slow and poor, in order to ensure the diagnosis, we decided to perform QF PCR . The result was a nor   mal male . Finally, we could obtain some metafases for cytogenetic analysis and the result was 37 cells with a 45,X karyotype .

Karyotyping vs MLPA in spontaneous (late) pregnancy losses.,P03.62,"T. Dijkhuizen , H. H. Faber, G. Drok, K. B. J. Gerssen Schoorl, B. Sikkema  Raddatz, K. Bouman","Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands","Early spontaneous abortions (less than 16 weeks of pregnancy) have  a variety of chromosome aberrations, most of them aneuploidies of whole chromosomes . Chromosome abnormalities occur to a lesser extent in second and third trimester pregnancy losses . Chromosome  analysis provides valuable information about the possible cause of fe   tal death and the recurrence risk . Yet it is hampered by a high rate  of culture failure. Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification  (MLPA) overcomes the problem of culture failure if DNA is extracted directly out of the fetal tissue before culture . Using a subtelomere dedi   cated test, it can provide information on the ploidy status of all chromo   some (arm)s . In the present study we compared routine chromosome with MLPA  analysis in a series of more than hundred fetal tissue samples of spon   taneous (late) second and third trimester pregnancy losses . Routine  chromosome analysis succeeded in 20% of cases, of which 8% had an abnormal chromosome complement . For MLPA, two different subtelo   mere specific tests (P036 and P070) were used to examine all chro   mosomes for ploidy status . We obtained interpretable results in 83% of  cases . Abnormal ratio spreads were observed in 6% of them . Detailed  data will be presented on the poster  . In conclusion, MLPA increases the success rate for chromosome analysis dramatically by overcoming the problem of culture failure . Al   though it is suggested that culture failure could be caused by the fact  that the fetus has a chromosome abnormality, the percentage of ge   netically abnormal tissue samples remains similar for both techniques, MLPA and karyotyping .",2008

However, chromosome 18 appears to be most  frequently involved in these structural rearrangements, according to published cases . We report a further case detected by prenatal diag   nosis . CVS was performed on a pregnant woman due to increased Prenental diagnostics nuchal translucency  . Cytogenetic analysis after short term culture  showed four different abnormal cell lines involving chromosome 18,  and the karyotype was described as: mos 46,XX,18p+[15]/r(18)[14]/i(18q)[1]/45,XX, 18[3] . Amniocente   sis was subsequently performed . Ultrasound examination showed a  septate translucency as the only abnormal finding. QF PCR analysis  showed homozygosity for all 18p markers, suggesting a 18p mono   somy  . The karyotype obtained was 46,XX,del(18p) in all cells . The pre   gnancy was terminated and pathologic studies are being performed at  present. We propose a model to explain the cytogenetic findings. A first  postzygotic error, probably an unequal sister chromatid exchange gi   ving rise to a cell line with del(18p) and the complementary with 18p+,  may have most likely happened before the first post zygotic division, since no normal cells have been detected . Isochromosome(18q) and  ring(18) seem to be secondary to del(18p), and monosomy 18 may have derived from the ring(18) cell line, given the instability of rings . An  unequal distribution of the different cell lines between the trophoblast  and the inner cell mass, and differences on the viability of each cell  line in different tissues, may explain why the fetal tissues only show the 18p deletion whereas the trophoblast presents the other cell lines .",2008

Thus, mutation at codon 1061 represents the 23% (5  /13) of the Catalonian positive families whereas was not found in 17  APC positive Galician families . The same trend was observed for the  codon 1309 mutation . Similar results had been already observed in a  previous study with Galician families and could be due to the genetic isolation of this population .

Scarce previous series (1 38 patients) have reported exceptional fa  milial aggregation and unknown prevalence with predilection for Eu   ropean population . Aim: To study the prevalence and characteristics of HPS in our region (600,000 inhabitants) . Methods: Retrospective search of patients from the familial cancer  registry, gastroenterology and pathology departments fulfilling WHO criteria, or showing essential traits of HPS . Results: 12 patients from 9 different families fulfilled WHO criteria with a mean of 39 HP per patient (pp), 75% (9/12) mainly right sided; 3 .44 adenomas (pp); 2 .33 serrated adenomas (pp), and an incidence of co   lon cancer of 33% (4/12) (mean age, 41y) . Remarkably, in two families  HPS seemed to be transmitted as a hereditary condition . In the rest,  60% of the patients had at least one 1st degree relative with colon  cancer (mean age,56y) and 30% had relatives with >5 HP  . Besides,  we have characterized 6 extra individuals from 5 different families not  fulfilling WHO criteria but who met more than one of the essential char   acteristic of HPS . Conclusion: The prominent number of patients with hyperplastic pol   yposis and the familial aggregation in our series support the hypoth   esis of a higher prevalence of this condition in our region, suggesting  a common genetic background . Furthermore, in specially predisposed  populations, a reassessment of WHO criteria is probably needed for the diagnosis of additional cases .",2008

However  it is not known whether genomic instability is a necessary initiating  factor  . We are currently recruiting patients with a known family history of  colorectal carcinoma or who are undergoing surveillance colonoscopy for recurrent polyps . These patients attend screening colonoscopy,  where polyps are identified and removed. To date, 137 patients have been recruited with a total of 195 polyps . A pilot study, looking at markers (K ras, BRAF, MSI, LOH) of genomic  instability in 168 polyps in 107 patients demonstrated that this was technically feasible . We will collect 50 hyperplastic polyps and 300 adenomatous polyps,  including 30 serrated adenomas, and 10 polyps from patients with Lynch syndrome . Isolated crypts will be extracted from polyps and tested for genomic in   stability using several parameters: chromosomal loss/gain, copy num   ber variation, LoH, MSI and CPG Island Promoter Methylation . We will  also screen for mutations in known target genes . Results will be compared with normal tissue, to determine when/if  genomic instability occurs, and itâs relationship to other (epi)genetic  changes Conclusions We hope to elucidate the earliest drivers of colorectal carcinogenesis:  when each form of genomic instability occurs, whether they initiate  carcinogenesis and how this relates to family history and clinico patho   logical features .",2008

","Inactivation of the genes involved in DNA mismatch repair is asso   ciated with microsatellite instability (MSI) and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) . Mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 genes are usually the cause of  hereditary colorectal cancers (CRC), such as HNPCC, while microsat   ellite instability in sporadic CRC often results from epigenetic inactiva   tion of hMLH1  due to DNA promotor methylation . We examined MSI in 98 patients with sporadic CRC and the methyla   tion status of the MLH1  and MSH2  promotor regions in the cases with  MSI/LOH. MSI was evaluated in a panel of five microsatellite markers  (BAT26, D5S346, D18S35, D2S123 and FGA ) and the hypermethyl   ation assessed by methyl specific PCR (MSP) of bisulfite converted DNA . The PCR products were analyzed on agarose gel electrophore   sis, following by direct sequencing .Our results demonstrated MSI/LOH in 29 patients (29 .5%) with spo   radic colorectal cancer  . Among them the promoter hypermethylation  of MLH1  was observed in 14 (48 .3%) of the cases, whereas promotor  hypermethylation of MSH2  was observed only in one case (3 .4%) . The  epigenetic changes of MLH1 were associated with loss of the protein  expression . Conclusions:  Widespread promotor methylation of tumor suppressor  genes is a common mechanism of gene inactivation during tumori   genesis . Our results suggest that microsatellite instability in Bulgarian  patients with sporadic CRC and the epigenetic inactivation of hMLH1  in association with DNA methylation occurs in similar frequency to rela   tive studies of sporadic colorectal cancer  . The promoter hypermetila   tion of MSH2 , although a rare event, is also a possible cause of mis   match repair system deficiency in this type of CRC.",2008

NF1 coding region screening was  performed by dHPLC (denaturing high performance liquid chroma   tography), sequencing and MLPA (multiple ligation dependent probe  amplification). KRAS  and BRAF  were analyzed by sequencing . 40%  (26/65) of the samples carried a mutation in KRAS , 22% (14/64) in  BRAF , and 13% (3/24) in NF1 . We found that 62% (40/65) of the sam   ples had alterations in one or more of the components, meaning they have a dysregulation of the RAS pathway  .  BRAF  and KRAS  mutations  were mutually exclusive . BRAF  mutation was strongly associated with  microsatellite instability (MSI), female gender, and proximal location .  Among the 24 samples analyzed for mutations in NF1, we found 2  missense and 2 splicing mutations . All NF1 mutations occurred in MSI,  proximal, and female derived tumors with BRAF  mutation . In addition,  we found that 3 of the samples had duplication of parts or the whole  NF1 gene . In conclusion RAS pathway is dysregulated by mutually  exclusive mutations of KRAS  and BRAF  in the majority of CRC . We  show that the activity of RAS signaling is likely to be enhanced in more  than 10% of the tumors since they harbor mutations in both BRAF  and  NF1 .",2008

A total of 343 patients with sporadic (FAP & HNPCC ex   cluded) tumors treated by surgery were enrolled in the study  . DNA was  isolated from peripheral blood and fresh tumor tissues obtained imme   diately after surgery, and paired samples were evaluated for the pres   ence of MSI and/or LOH using Real Time PCR or multiplex qfPCR .  The evaluation included 23 SNP or STR markers located at 1p, 2p, 2q,  4q, 5q, 8p, 11q, 12q, 17p, 17q, 18p, 18q, 21q from either NCI panel or located in regions harboring genes implicated in CRC pathogenesis .  Younger patients comprise 6% of CRC in our population . They are  predominantly males (76% vs . 57% of older patients) with tumors in proximal colon (40 vs . 27%) and with MSI H genotype (23 vs . 9 .6%) .  On the contrary, the frequency of LOH is higher in tumors from older patients: 59 vs . 36% at 18q, 55 vs . 20% at 8p, 42 vs . 25% at 1p and  37 vs . 30% at 5q . In 46% of younger and 30% of older patients neither  MSI nor LOH was detected . Our data suggest that CRC pathogenesis  evolves through different pathways in patients with early compared to patients with late onset of the disease .",2008

To characterise the genom   ic differences amongst the distinct breast cancer classes using the  array based comparative genomic hybridization technique, we have  collected 20 tumours associated with BRCA1 mutation, 24 tumours  from mutation carriers in BRCA2, 32 BRCAX tumours, and 19 spo   radic samples . Breast tumours associated with mutations in BRCA1 or BRCA2 had  greater genomic instability than BRCAX or sporadic samples, and a  trend to alter specific chromosomal regions. However, we have demon   strated a common heterogeneity between familial and sporadic breast  cancer in terms of estrogen receptor (ER) status and breast cancer subtypes . First, ER negative tumours showed higher genomic instabil   ity and a specific genomic aberration pattern compared with ER posi   tive tumours. Second, familial breast tumours have been profiled into molecular subtypes: basal, ERBB2, luminal A, and luminal B . BRCA1  tumours were associated with the basal phenotype, which presented  the highest genomic instability, whereas BRCAX samples were related to the luminal A subtype . Luminal B tumours had the greatest number  of high level DNA amplifications. Two regions with high level DNA amplifications in familial breast can   cer have also been studied: 8p11 p12 and 13q34 . The former one was  related to higher cell proliferation, whereas the latter one was charac   teristic of basal tumours, had 1â6Mb length, and was correlated with overexpression of candidate genes such as TFDP1 .",2008

Screening for mutations in these genes is now stan   dard practice for HBOC cases in Europe, and permits medical follow  up and genetic counselling adapted to the needs of individuals in such families . As very little information is available in Romania, we started  the first characterization of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer risk in north eastern Romania . Our study consists in HBOC families iden   tification and recruitment, DNA collection achievement from these pa   tients, implementation of molecular technology for mutations analysis and oncogenetic follow up of mutations bearers . We managed to identify and recruit so far several HBOC families with  unique features such as 5 ovarian plus 1 breast cancer, or 8 breast cancer cases within the same family line . All recruited families are now  under systematic DNA sequencing for BRCA screening . We also investigated, within HBOC families and sporadic cases, the  status of three known founder mutations (185delAG and 5382insC on  BRCA1 and 6174delT on BRCA2), by optimization and comparison  of several multiplex PCR techniques . This part of our study showed a very important random factor within all multiplex PCR methods . We  demonstrate that although they are cheap, rapid and easy techniques,  they often generate false results like primer dimmers, undesirable am   plification products apparition or heteroduplexes.

Our algorithm  consists in a sequential cascade of complementary techniques using genomic DNA . First, we study copy number variations by using com   mercial MLPA kits (MRC Holland) . Samples showing positive MLPA  results are always confirmed by a different approach. Samples with  no copy number variations undergo SNPlex analysis, designed spe   cifically to detect 38 Spanish common polymorphisms and 9 recurrent  mutations. Direct sequencing is applied to confirm recurrent mutations.  Negative samples for the previous steps are submitted to our chosen  technique for mutational search for nucleotide changes, the CSCE approach (conformation sensitive capillary electrophoresis) . CSCE  analysis allows detecting altered electrophoresis patterns when DNA changes are present in heterozygosis in a given fragment . The screen   ing of the whole coding region of both genes is performed by analysing 79 different fragments . Abnormal patterns are sequenced to determine the DNA change responsible for the observed mobility shift . When a  DNA change is suspected to alter the correct splicing of the genes, mRNA studies are performed . We are applying this comprehensive  approach since July 2007 in our routine setting and although numbers  are still too low, results are promising and comparable to those report   ed in the literature .

Since BRCA1/2  are large  genes the majority of mutation detection procedures include screening methods which are time consuming and expensive . High resolution  melting (HRM) is a recent promising screening method that combines  the simplicity, cost effectiveness and rapid identification of genetic variants . The aim of the study is to evaluate HRM in the screening of the reported Spanish mutations . Methods: We studied 40 BRCA1 and 47 BRCA2  DNA samples con   taining different Spanish mutations . We also included a reference  group of 20 unknown DNAs from patients with sporadic BC . The assay  was carried out on LightCycler 480 (Roche) using LightCyclerÂ® 480  HRM Master and performing 21 and 25 independent PCR for the study  of BRCA1/2  gene mutations, respectively  . The melting analysis was  performed with LightCyclerÂ® 480 Gene Scanning Software v  .1 .0 . All  mutations and genetic variants detected were confirmed by sequenc   ing the PCR products . Results: The HRM could discriminate the 87 BRCA1/2  Spanish muta   tions analyzed from wild type DNA . Besides, 82 out 87 mutations were clearly differentiated from each other  . In the sporadic BC group we did  not detect any deleterious mutations, however, we detected polymor   phisms and unclassified variants in both genes.

The BRCA1/BRCA2 gene products help to  maintain genomic integrity after DNA damage . To investigate this ca   pacity in BRCA1 /2 heterozygous cells, we have evaluated their in vitro   sensitivity to chromosomal damage induced by two mutagenic agents: ionising radiation and mitomycin C (MMC) . STUDY SUBJECTS AND METHODS: Lymphocyte cultures were  established from 20 BRCA1  mutation carriers (12 with cancer and 8  without), 21 BRCA2  mutation carriers (11 with cancer and 10 without)  and 11 non carrier controls . The chromosomal damage (chromosome  breakage and chromosome loss) induced in vitro  was assessed quan   tifying bi nucleated cells with micronuclei (MN) . MN can be used as a measure of DNA repair capacity  . Six cultures were set up for each  subject (2 treated with 2Gy gamma irradiation from Co 60, 2 treated  with 0,05 Î¼g/ml of MMC and 2 without treatment). RESULTS: The BRCA1 /BRCA2  heterozygous lymphocytes did not  show a higher level of radiation induced MN compared to the non car   rier controls lymphocytes . In contrast, the BRCA2  lymphocytes, from  both women with and without cancer, presented higher levels of MN  after exposure to MMC than the lymphocytes of BRCA1  carriers and  women without mutation . CONCLUSION: The haploinsufficiency of BRCA1 /BRCA2  in periph   eral blood lymphocytes does not affect the repair of radioinduced DNA lesions . But the absent of one  BRCA2  functional allele is associated to  a higher level of chromosomal damage induced by MMC probably due to an impaired DNA repair capacity  .",2008

Purpose: elaboration of an algorithm for BRCA1/2  mutation screening in Portuguese high risk breast cancer families .  Methods:  Integration of clinical and previous molecular data showing  that c .156_157insAlu in the BRCA2 gene is a Portuguese founder mu   tation , BRCA1 immunohistochemistry helps in selection for screening  as well as the prevalence of multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli   fication (MLPA) detected rearrangements .

We also optimized a methodology for the screening of this  mutation .  Patients and methods:  All new high risk patients coun   selled for BRCA1/2 screening in our Centre are pre screened for this  mutation with a 3 step PCR method (Patent pending): 1) exon 3 PCR  and sequencing, 2) nested PCR with primers 3 AluF/3AluR and 3) RT  PCR and cDNA sequencing . Other Centres, in Portugal and abroad, are implementing this PCR based method to screen for this mutation .  Additional family inquiries are made due to the founder effect of this  mutation . Results:  Twenty nine apparently nonrelated Portuguese  c.156_157insAlu  positive families were diagnosed in our Centre and  one BC/OC family of Portuguese ancestry was also diagnosed in  Caen, France, using our method. Also, a first degree relative of one  of our new probands had been studied in USA and diagnosed with an unknown variant (Q2731E) . Exhaustive family inquiries allowed us to  connect 3 of these new and apparently non related families with fami   lies already identified. conclusion:  The correct option to screen the  c.156_157insAlu BRCA2 Portuguese founder mutation is the 3 step  PCR method we described .

HFE mutations, which lead to iron uptake increase, have been evaluat   ed as risk factor  . Some studies concluded that BC risk increase is also  dependent on HFE interacting genes, such as the transferrin receptor  (TFR) and the combination between HFE TFR genotypes . To assess if HFE mutations, TFR S142G polymorphism and HFE TFR   genotypes are related to BC risk, we compared C282Y, H63D and  S142G frequencies in 86 BC women and in 183 gender/age matched healthy controls . Samples were obtained after written informed con   sent . The C282Y allele frequency in the BC group was 4 .07%, higher than  in control group, 3 .28%; while H63D mutation showed a similar fre   quency in BC, 21 .51%, and controls, 21 .04% . Although both groups  were stratified according to menopausal status, odds ratio (OR) analy   sis for cancer risk associated with HFE mutations was not statistically  significant. Regarding S142G polymorphism, the frequency of S142S, S142G and G142G genotypes were equivalent in both groups . In order  to extend the search for a supposed BC susceptibility for HFE TFR   genotypes, we analysed BC and controls according to compound gen   otypes . Again, OR for all HFE TFR genotype combinations revealed  no increased risk for BC . In conclusion, the results suggest that HFE mutations are not associ   ated with an increased risk for BC . TFR polymorphism was not an  independent risk factor and did not modify the disease risk .

Copy number changes of 1q21 .3 were established in 9 .64% of malignant, in 8 .33% of LMP and in 13 .13% of benign ovarian tumors .  Copy number changes of 1q23 .3 were found in 17 .78% of malignant,  in 16 .67% of LMP and in 12 .64% of benign ovarian tumors . We have  found significantly more frequent gain of 1q23.3 in non epithelial tu   mors (50%) compared to epithelial ones (14 .73%) (p<0 .03) . According to our results the gain of 1q21 .3 prevailed in non serous (especially  mucinous) malignant and LMP ovarian tumors in comparison to serous tumors . In non serous tumors both gains were associated with higher grade . The gain of 1q23 .3 was 2 .5 times more frequent than the gain  of 1q21 .3 in ovarian cancers .",2008

Deletions including the  loci at 9p22.2 (n,2), 11p14.1 (n,2), 7p22.3 (n,2), and amplifications  including the loci at 16p13 .12 (n,2), 19q13 .32 (n,2) are observed in at least two different patients . Our preliminary results indicate that ar   ray CGH analysis provide additional information about cryptic genetic aberrations during cytogenetic studies of adult ALL patients .",2008

Whole arm translo   cations of chromosome 7 are rarely described . Translocation with the  long arm of chromosome 1 occurs nonrandomly in myelodysplastic syndrome and AML. While there have been reports on significantly  better clinical outcome than other  7/7q cases the same rearrange   ment was also recognized as very poor prognostic feature . In april 2007 a 23 year old woman was admitted to the hospital . Di   agnosis workup confirmed myelo monocitic leukemia (AML M4/M5).  Cytogenetic examination of bone marrow cells revealed that one nor   mal chromosome 7 and 10 were lost and replaced by an abnormal  chromosome consisting of the long arm of chromosome 10 and the  short arm of chromosome 7 . Additionally, a small marker chromosome was observed in all analyzed metaphases . The whole arm exchange  was confirmed by FISH using WCP and CEP probes as well as a locus  specific probe (7q32). Combining the results of standard and molecu   lar cytogenetics the karyotype was interpreted as: 46,XX,der(7;10)(p10;q10),+mar  . The marker chromosome was found to consist of the  chromosome 7 centromeric material . The patient is in cytogenetic re   mission now.

However, besides chromosomal changes with  known prognostic impact, such as deletions of 6q, 11q (ATM), 13q,  17p (p53) detected routinely, the other additional abnormalities can be found . It is presently not clear whether other aberrations that are   not detected by the standard FISH panel have any impact on prog   nosis and disease progression . Therefore, we performed clinical and  laboratory analysis of 7 CLL patients (males) with detected gains of chromosome 2p . The aim of the genetic study was supported by the  fact, that gains of genetic material can lead to oncogenic activation of protooncogenes located within the gained regions . Since 2p23~p11  harbors many protooncogenes already known to be involved in human  tumorigenesis, we desided to check a few selected genes: ALK, N MYC, REL, BCL11a and their protein levels . Comparative genomic hybridization (CGH) or 1 Mb arrayCGH re   vealed gain of 2p23~p11 region . For detailed mapping of gained region we used iFISH with commercial available and BAC derived probes .

In >95% acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL),  t(15;17) is the hallmark of pathogenesis while remaining cases have  cryptic insertion or more complex rearrangements where RARA  is con   stantly involved .

All trans retinoic acid receptor (ATRA) is able to interact with  this mechanism and prevent life threatening thromboembolic/bleeding complications . We have investigated 30 APL patients by conventional  G banding and detected two (7%) cases with t(11;17)(q23;q22), which  leads to fusion of PLZF  (promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger) and RARA  Cancer genetics0 genes .

High mRNA expression of BAALC and WT1 have been shown to be  an adverse risk factor in newly diagnosed AML patients with normal cytogenetics . Independent confirmation is required to validate the initial results so  that BAALC and WT1 expression may be exploited for risk adapted  treatment stratification of AML patients with normal cytogenetics. We analyzed patients selected from newly diagnosed cases of AML and a control group of healthy individuals . Total RNA from leukocytes was extracted from blood samples treat   ed with RNA later (QIAGEN) following the manufacturerâs directions  (RiboPure   blood kit, Ambion) . For semiquatitative RT PCR we used  One step RT PCR kit (QIAGEN), with gene specific, intron spanning  primers for BAALC,WT1 and GPDH as housekeeping gene . Compara   tive real time RT PCR assays were performed for each sample in trip   licate . The results showed a significantly increased level of expression for  BAALC and WT1genes in de novo acute myeloid leukemia patients  with normal cytogenetics comparative with healthy individuals from the control group . In conclusion, the analyse of BAALC and WT1 genes expression in  AML patients is a molecular marker which can be used for the evalua   tion of disease aggressivenes and prognosis for patients with normal cytogenetics .

The CALM (Clathrin Assembly Lymphoid Myeloid leukemia Cancer genetics gene) protein is a clathrin assembly protein which plays a role in cla   thrin mediated endocytosis and trans Golgi network trafficking. AF10  is a putative transcription factor likely involved in processes related to  chromatin organization . To learn about the function of CALM/AF10 fusion protein, we searched  for protein interaction partners of CALM using a yeast two hybrid as   say and identified FHL2 as a putative CALM interacting partner. The  CALM FHL2 interaction was confirmed by GST pull down and CoIP experiments . In co localization studies a translocation from cytoplasm to the nucleus is seen . Expression analysis (Affymetrix based) in CML and different AML sub   types showed a significantly higher expression of FHL2 in CML and  AML with complex aberrant karyotypes compared to AML with normal  karyotypes or balanced chromosomal translocations like the t(8;21), inv(16) or t(15;17) . Reporter gene assays using a GAL4 DNA binding domain FHL2 fu   sion protein and a GAL4 responsive luciferase reporter were able  to demonstrate a transcriptional activation function of FHL2 that got  inhibited when adding CALM but not CALM/AF10.

The tri colour dual  fusion system showed excellent correlation with D FISH for cases with der(9) deletion . In particular, the added aqua  ASS probe allowed the  discrimination of random signal overlap from genuine BCR/ABL  fusion  in the interphase cells (group 4) . Conclusion: Although the D FISH probe remains valuable in establish   ing the different patterns of aberrant signals and monitoring patients  with the classic 2 fusion signals in CML, the tri colour dual fusion  translocation probe should be used for patients with der(9) deletion to monitor response to treatment .",2008

","Imatinib mesylate, a targeted BCR ABL tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI)  has become the standard drug for the treatment of chronic myelog   enous leukemia (CML) . Mutations in the kinase domain (KD) of BCR  ABL and nonrandom, karyotypic abnormalities (referred to as clonal evolution) contribute to imatinib resistance . Imatinib resistance may  be defined as primary or secondary, hematologic or cytogenetic and it occurs in 10 15% of patients with CML . The aim of our study was to  screen for BCR ABL KD mutations and additional chromosomal abnor   malities (ACA) in 35 Hungarian patients (33 CML and 2 Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL) with imatinib resistance . Point mutations  in the entire tyrosine kinase domain (aa 230 490) were detected by Sanger sequencing after two separate, two step semi nested PCR .  The presence of T315I, M244V, Y253H, M351T, F359V, L384M muta   tions were confirmed by PCR RFLP. Clonal alterations were assessed by standard cytogenetic techniques . Overall, twelve different mutations  (aa . exchange M244V, G250E, Y253H, E255V, E279K, D276G, T315I,  M351T, F359I/V, V379E, L384M, E460K) were identified in 21 patients.  M244V was the most frequent mutation (4 patients) . T315I occurred in 2 ALL and one CML patients . In three cases, double mutations, and in 8 patients, extra Philadelphia chromosome were detected . ACA was  present overall in 13 patients . KD mutations were found in 75% (9/12)  in hematologic, and 43% (9/21) in cytogenetic TKI resistance . In sum   mary, BCR ABL KD mutations and clonal evolution are common in imatinib resistant CML patients . Early detection of emerging mutant  clones may guide therapeutic decisions, because the degree of ima   tinib resistance varies among different mutants .",2008

The aim of our study was to optimise the testing protocol for  establishing the chimeric status of patients performing allo HSCT  . We  compared the efficacy of two different multiplex STR PCR kits, focus   ing on their sensitivity and sensibility  . Method .  DNA samples, provided by 17 patients and their haploidenti   cal donors were tested at various intervals in order to determine the  chimeric status . The samples were analysed using two different com   mercial kits, each of them containing a set of 16 STRs (AmpFlSTR  Identifiler, Applied Biosystems; PowerPlex 16 System, Promega). For  each case, the most informative markers were selected and analysed  in dynamics. Artificial mixtures prepared from recipients and their do   nors samples were analysed to set up reconstruction curves . Results .  Complete chimerism was detected for 15 patients, while 2  patients exhibited mixed profiles. Both commercial kits gave similar re   sults concerning the chimeric status . The reconstruction curves showed  a slightly higher sensitivity for the Identifiler kit, which quantified more  accurately the low concentrations of minor DNA component .Conclusions .  Our data indicate that both commercial STR PCR kits  were able to establish an accurate chimeric status . A kit selection  should be performed in an objective manner, after analyzing its per   formances regarding the typing sensitivity and sensibility for artificial mixtures .

Moreover, in  both cases, FISH and/or qRT PCR showed this fusion in a substantial  proportion (10% 90%) of marrow cells with morphologically intact dif   ferentiation during the preleukaemic phase . In the MLL/FOXO3A case  we were able to document its presence in lymphoid as well as myeloid lineage, thus indicating the fusion arose in a multipotent progenitor  .

A microRNA profile has been identified as associated to the most fre   quently chromosomal aberration described in MCL . Thus losses of  9p21 pter, 1p, 13q, 11q21; and gains of 15q and 3q were associated with distinctive miRNA changes . Taken together, MCL seems to combine a disease specific miRNA sig   nature that correlates with specific chromosomal changes.",2008

inducible expression of the oncogenic transcription factor EVI   in human myeloid cells leads to phenotypes characteristic of myelodysplastic syndromes (mDs),P04.109,"T. Konrad, R.

Its overexpression in AML has been studied intensively because it is associated with particularly aggressive disease . However,  recent bone marrow transduction/transplantation studies in mice have  shown that EVI1  overexpression by itself causes MDS, while AML aris   es only in the presence of additional, cooperating genetic events . To gain a better understanding of the biological properties of EVI1 , an  HA tagged version of the human EVI1  cDNA was expressed in human  U937 myelomonocytic cells in a tetracycline regulable manner  . Induc   tion of EVI1  in this system strongly inhibited cellular multiplication, an  effect that was in part due to cell cycle arrest, and in part to increased rates of apoptosis . Exposure of  EVI1  expressing cells to differentia   tion stimuli caused cells to die rather than to differentiate . The c myc   gene, which is implicated in the control of cellular proliferation, was  downregulated rapidly after the induction of EVI1 , suggesting that it  may be a direct target of this transcription factor, and may play a role in its phenotypic effects . The phenotypes observed after induction of EVI1  correspond well to  what would be expected for a gene involved in the pathogenesis of  MDS, and have also been observed with other MDS associated on   cogenes . We have therefore established a suitable model system to  explore the role of EVI1  in the pathogenesis of this fatal disease .",2008

However, the answer to the question âwhat sort of sequence variation in ATM confers increased risk of BCâ has been controversial .  To address this question, we have pooled available ATM mutation  screening data and carried out a combined analysis of truncating vari   ants, splice junction variants, and rare missense substitutions (carrier  freq â¥ 1%). The analysis of rare missense substitutions was accom   plished by constructing a sufficiently informative protein multiple se   quence alignment of ATM from full length sequences of seven species  and using a missense analysis program Align GVGD with developed  new classifiers. Systematic case control analysis of the missense sub   stitutions indipendantly provided evidence that ATM is a BC suscepti   bility gene . We found that a combined analysis of truncating mutations,  splice junction mutations, and rare missense substitutions provides  stronger evidence that ATM is a BC susceptibility gene than simple consideration of truncating plus splice junction variants alone . We also  found significant evidence of risk both in truncating plus splice junction  variants and in the in silico predicted highest risk class of missense substitutions . Taken together, these results led us to two conclusions: (1) Careful analysis of missense substitutions by measuring risk attrib   utable to rare missense substitutions in a known or candidate suscep  Cancer genetics tibility gene will have real utility in case control mutation screening .

It is caused by mutations in the gene coding for folliculin, a protein involved in mTOR signaling . As the rela   tive risk of developing renal malignancies is around 5, BHD syndrome  is generally considered to be a relatively benign condition for which  annual follow up suffices. However, the possibility that the pre exist   ing gene defect might act to modify the behavior of other cancers that arise in patients with BHD syndrome has so far not been considered .  We describe a patient with BHD syndrome who succumbed to an ex   tremely malignant neuro endocrine tumor of prostatic or bladder origin within 6 weeks of its discovery  . Tumor tissue showed elevated staining  of phosphorylated mTOR and phosphorylated p70S6K, as did foci in  clinically normal skin and kidney, confirming that folliculin is a negative regulator of mTOR signaling . We propose that the behavior of this can   cer might have been modulated by the germline FLCN mutation and  propose that patients with BHD syndrome be more closely monitored than is currently the case .",2008

Chi   maerin proteins have a catalytic GAP domain, a C1 domain that binds  DAG and phorbol esters, and a SH2 domain that is only present in Î±2  and Î²2 chimaerin isoforms. The Î² chimaerin gene is located in the 7p15 locus and consists of 13 exons . In addition to the initial start site in exon 1, it posses an alter   native start of transcription in intron 6 that is used to render the Î²1 chimaerin isoform .

This way, it protects the genetic informa   tion in the DNA molecule by wasting with each replication cycle . Telom   erase carries its own RNA molecule, used as a template for elongating telomeres . Cancer cells are expressing telomerase activity, while the most of the somatic normal cells do not . We induced skin cancer in mice, by injecting them with dexamethasone and irradiating them with an UVB lamp . The mice were divided in two groups . One group was not treated . The other group was treated with cisplatin . Telomere lengths were analyzed in squamous cells from the  carcinomic tissue of these mice by using the PCR / STELA technique .  We found that the cisplatin treatment gradually reduces the telomere  lengths in mice treated with this compound vs mice untreated, by de   creasing telomeraseâs activity. We conclude that our findings support  the idea that platinum compounds may have other ways of action in  the cell nucleus, beside the classical one accepted .",2008

","Human cytochrome P4501B1 is an important enzyme in the activation of diverse procarcinogens . CYP1B1 gene is polymorphic and hyper   active variants can lead to a higher susceptibility to estrogen related cancers . Several single nucleotide polymorphisms have previously  been reported in the human CYP1B1 gene . Previous studies have  revealed a relation between Ala119Ser allele and breast cancer and  between Leu432Val and prostate cancer, two polymorphisms that re   sult in a higher catalytic activity of the enzyme . Mexican population  shows a lower incidence of this type of cancers in comparison with  other western countries . In the present study we analyzed the frequen   cy of five CYP1B1 polymorphic sites to initially explore the possible  relation between the lower incidence of estrogen related cancer and the presence of these alleles in Mexican population . The genetic dis   tribution of CYP1B1 variants was evaluated in 100 Mexican healthy subjects through genomic DNA sequencing analysis . The frequency  of homozygous hyperactive variant Ala119Ser (23%) was higher than those reported in other populations . The frequencies of polymorphic  variants 4326C>G (Leu432Val) and 4390A>G (Asn453Ser) (3% and  0%, respectively) were significantly lower than those observed in other populations except for Japanese population . The homozygous variant  4390A>G was not identified in our population. our data demonstrates  that the CYP1B1 alleles encoding hyperactive variants, And the silent  polymorphism 1347C>T, are significantly less frequent in Mexican population than those observed in western countries .

Specific software for automatic identification of differentially methyl   ated fragments have been developed as well as the software capable  of identifying the AIMS fragments in silico  by comparison with avail   able genome databases . Additional computer service is available to  assist in experimentation design respective to specific applications.  With technical variations this approach may be elaborated to identify  novel targets of DNA methylation/demethylation as well as to roughly characterize epigenomic status as a whole .

Malignant and non malignant tissues of 72 gastric ad   enocarcinoma cases who underwent surgery from 2004 2007 were analyzed by immunohistochemical methods . Higher prevalence of H  pylori in males, lack of AR expression in normal cells of females and lower expression of AR in tumoral cells of females (p,0 .03) were the  first significant differences between two genders. H pylori infection was  evaluated as a relative risk factor of AR expression in males (OR,5)  and females (OR,3) that means most of AR (+) tumors had history of H .pylori infection in their normal cells .

Morphologically, GCTs  show osteoclast like giant cells mixed with mononuclear putative neo   plastic cells . Cytogenetically, GCTs often show telomeric associations (tas) paralleled by an otherwise normal karyotype . It remains to be  established whether tas in GCT represent deregulation of cis regula   tory or trans  regulatory mechanisms at the telomere, or a combination  thereof, or are caused by other yet unknown mechanisms . METHODS: DNA was extracted from fresh frozen biopsies of 20 GCTs for telomere length analysis . From the same 20 cases, RNA was ex   tracted for quantitative RT PCR analysis concerning the expression  levels of four genes ( TERT, TRF1, TRF2  and POT1 ) involved in telo   mere function . FISH analysis was performed to evaluate the frequency  of telomere negative chromosome ends . RESULTS: No correlation between presence of clonal chromosome  aberrations and telomere length in tumor cells could be detected . At  FISH analysis there was a correlation between frequency of tas and number of telomere negative chromosome ends . Expression of  TERT,  TRF1, TRF2  and POT1  was found in all tumors . Analysis regarding the  correlation between expression levels of individual genes and cytoge   netic and clinical features is ongoing . CONCLUSION: In view of our preliminary data, it is unlikely that the  high frequency of tas could be explained by altered expression levels of any of the investigated genes . However, it can not be ruled out that  altered function at the protein level of TERT, TRF1, TRF2 or POT1 is involved in tas formation .",2008

Impaired detoxification of carcino   gens found in tobacco smoke appears to increase the risk for tobacco associated cancers . Glutathione S transferases (GSTs) are involved in the metabolism of a wide range of carcinogenic chemicals . In humans,  cytosol GSTs are divided into several classes, and polymorphisms  of these enzymes are associated with variations in enzyme activity  which in turn may affect the concentration of activated carcinogenic chemicals in the body  . We have investigated the association between  the polymorphism in one of the cytosolic GSTs gene (GSTM1) and  susceptibility to oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and basal cell carcinoma (BCC) of the skin . For that purpose 45 SCC, 42 BCC and  40 control specimens have been subjected to PCR analysis of the GSTM1 gene . The frequency of GSTM null homozygous genotype  was as follows: 48% in BCCs, 44% in SCCs and 20% in controls . The  deletion of the GSTM1 gene was more frequent in SCC, than is con   trols (p,0 .017) and the same was true for BCCs (p,0 .016) . Although cytosolic glutathione S transferase (GST) enzymes occupy  a key position in biological detoxification processes, GSTM1 1 gene  is deleted in a high percentage of the healthy human population, with  major ethnic differences.

Magnetic anti CD3, anti CD15 and anti  CD19 beads were used to capture T cells, myeloid cells and B cells,  respectively, from peripheral blood and bone marrow samples prior to isolation of DNA . Twelve different polymorphic short tandem repeats  (STR) loci were amplified in a single multiplex reaction. Chimerism  analysis performed on specific cellular lineages was most useful in  early detection of relapse than unfractionated whole blood analysis due the increased sensitivity in the enriched cell subpopulations . De   termination of the level of donor T cells appears to be critical for suc   cessful engraftment and could predict graft rejection .",2008

Influence of the focal adhesion protein leupaxin on invasion and metastasis in tRAmP prostate carcinomas,P04.154,"S. Beckemeyer1, S. Schweyer2, P. Burfeind1, S.

Down regulation  of leupaxin expression using RNAi resulted in apoptosis of more than  50% of androgen dependent LNCaP PCa cells and in a significant re   duction of invasiveness and migratory ability of androgen independent PC 3 and DU145 PCa cells . To analyse the role of leuapxin in progression and invasion of PCa  in vivo we bred transgenic mice expressing prostate specific leupaxin with TRAMP mice to generate double transgenic heterozygous mice .  The transgenic adenocarcinoma of the mouse prostate (TRAMP) mod   el develops, as a consequence of transgene SV40 T/t antigen expres   sion, progressive prostate cancer that is invasive and capable of meta   static spread . Histopathological analysis showed that at the age of 22  weeks 91% of double heterozygous mice display a poorly differenti   ated tumor  . In addition, 65% of these mice developed metastasis to the  lymph nodes . In single heterozygous TRAMP mice only 50% showed  a well differentiated tumor while none of them developed metastasis .  Furthermore, our recent studies could demonstrate that the expres   sion of the cell cell adhesion molecule catenin delta 1 (p120CTN)  negatively correlated with the expression of leupaxin . No expression  of p120CTN could be detected in progressive and invasive prostate tumors of double transgenic TRAMP/leupaxin mice . In conclusion, the  results of our studies indicate that leupaxin expression enhances the  progression of PCa towards a more aggressive and metastatic tumor  and that the loss of p120ctn expression due to leupaxin overexpres   sion represents one possible cause of the invasive behavior  .",2008
Does nonsense mediated RNA decay support tP53  haploinsufficiency as the cause of tumour development in Li  Fraumeni syndrome?,P04.155,"K. Prochazkova1, M. Mrhalova2, A. Augustinakova2, D.

The syndrome is associated with germline TP53 mutations, usually missense . The aberrant protein produced from  the mutated TP53 allele is expected to cause tumour development .  However, a possibility remains that haploinsufficiency of the normal  TP53 allele could also be responsible for the phenotype . We analysed two LFS families with nonsense germline TP53 mutations . Nonsense  mediated RNA decay (NMD) eliminates transcripts with premature ter   mination codons (PTC) . In LFS families with nonsense mutations NMD  could thus influence phenotype, because the removal of mutated tran   scripts would lead to the absence of the aberrant protein . TP53 alleles  were analysed in normal tissues (lymphocytes, adrenal gland) and in tumours of both families on DNA and RNA levels . In normal tissues  the transcripts of mutated alleles were eliminated, similar to some of  the tumours. This may support the notion that TP53 haploinsufficiency, and not the mutated protein, could be responsible for tumour devel   opment in LFS . However, in some tumours both types of transcripts  (or only mutated transcripts) were present. This could reflect either  differences in NMD between different tissues, or global inactivation of NMD in tumours . In quest to distinguish between these possibilities  we tested expression of several genes (U2AF35, RPL3, TM1, PTB2,  PTB1, ABCC4) with PTC containing alternative transcripts, which should undergo NMD under physiological conditions . However, these  analyses were inconclusive, mainly because the patterns of removal of some transcripts described in the literature could not be replicated .

Most of the alterations corresponded to missense mutations  (67%) and we identified in 4 families (5%) genomic deletions. These  results represent a definitive argument demonstrating that LFS results  from TP53 haplo deficiency. Nevertheless, this does not explain the  remarkable TP53 germline mutation spectrum characterized by the predominance of missense mutations . The different tumour spectrum  observed between TP53 wt/mt and wt/  mice led us to compare the  mean ages of tumour onset between patients harbouring either TP53  missense mutations or other types of alterations. We found a signifi   cant difference, missense mutations being associated with a 9 year  earlier tumour onset, confirming that missense mutations not only in   activate p53 but also have an additional oncogenic effect . The obser   vation of a later age of tumour onset associated with null mutations led  us to perform TP53 analysis in patients suggestive of LFS, but with a  first tumour being diagnosed after 40 years of age and we had the sur   prise to identify germline TP53 mutations in such families . Germline al   terations of TP53 that lead exclusively to loss of function are therefore  associated with a later age of tumour onset and the presence of such  mutations should be considered in atypical LFS families with tumours diagnosed after 40 years .",2008

Three of them were excluded (MGMT, SYK  and GSTP) because showed no evidence of promoter hypermethyl   ation. CpG island methylator phenotype (CIMP) status was defined as hypermethylation of more than 50% from the 17 genes analyzed . We found that some genes as TMS1, CASP8, THBS1, CCND2,  RASSF1A, BLU, EMP3 or DR4 are more frequently methylated in NB  cases with a poor prognosis. CIMP status was significantly associ   ated with disease stage (P,0,0002), risk group (P,0,00004), age at  diagnosis ((P,0,0007), N myc amplification (P,0,005) and 1p deletion (P,0,003) . By a Kaplan Meier analysis, the 27 CIMP+ cases showed  significantly poorer disease free survival (DFS) (P,0,0084) and overall survival (OS) (P,0,0062) than the 55 CIMP  cases . However, Cox re   gression analysis failed to demonstrate that CIMP was an independent factor to the remaining variables, except for the clinical stage . We conclude that CIMP status could strongly influence on OS in NB tu   mors, being a better prognosis factor than the other high risk variables except for the disease stage . Thus the presence of CIMP may lead to a poor prognosis by induction of CGIs methylation .",2008

The NBN protein is a  component of the MRE11/RAD50/NBN complex involved in process   ing DNA double strand breaks . It is therefore particularly important to  study abnormal recombination events in NBS patients, given the inher   ited predisposition to develop lymphomas and leukemias . Objectives: The aim of this study was a longitudinal analysis of T cell  receptor (TCR) and immunoglobulin/B cell receptor (BCR) gene re   arrangements in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) in NBS patients, and their correlation with eventual lymphoma development . Patients and methods: A total of 50 NBS patients (all carrying the  657del5 mutation on both alleles of the NBN  gene) were periodical   ly monitored for clonality of TCR and BCR gene rearrangements in PBMC by multiplex PCR heteroduplex analysis . The same method was also used for molecular analysis of lymphoma tissues . Identity of  clonal blood and/or tissue rearrangements was determined by direct sequencing . Results: Seventeen NBS patients showed long lasting clonal TCR  and/or BCR rearrangements in PBMC, and identical clones persisted up to 4 years . Seven of these patients developed lymphomas, and  in some of them clonal blood rearrangements preceded diagnosis of lymphoma with identical clonality by 2 years . Conclusions: NBS patients often show clonal TCR and/or BCR gene  rearrangements in PBMC. However, the clinical significance of this phenomenon requires further investigation .

GB almost exclusively af   fects a subset of patients with Disorders of sex development (DSD),  in which tumor development is associated with the presence of an  extra Y chromosome (either normal or abnormal), or with molecular evidence for Y derived sequences . GB in dysgenetic gonads and its  counterpart, carcinoma in situ (CIS) in well differentiated testicular tis   sue, may be the earliest stages in the development of malignant germ cell tumors (GCTs) . Although the mechanisms that trigger neoplastic  progression are still unknown, several pathways have been proposed .  Abnormal OCT3/4 expression is the most robust risk factor for malig   nant transformation . This transcription factor regulates the pluripotency  of embryonic stem cells and is necessary for the survival and migra   tion of primordial germ cells and has been associated with the germ  cell neoplastic process. OCT3/4 and Î² catenin might both be involved  in the same oncogenic pathway, both genes are master regulators of  cell differentiation and overexpression of either gene may result in  cancer development. The mechanism by which Î² catenin participates  in GB transformation is not completely clear  . In an effort to elucidate  the participation of Î² catenin and E cadherin, as well as OCT3/4, in  the GB oncogenic pathways, we analyzed those molecules in seven patients with mixed gonadal dysgenesis and GB . Proposing that the  proliferation of immature germ cells in GB may be due to an interac   tion between OCT3/4 and accumulated Î² catenin in the nuclei of the immature germ cells .",2008

We report the first case of inherited  frameshift complex I mutation in the ND5 gene associated with a spe   cific tumor phenotype. The mtDNA was sequenced in microdissected areas from an onco   cytic nasopharynx tumor and in different non neoplastic tissues from  the patient and two of his siblings in order to confirm inheritance of the mutation . Immunohistochemical analysis for complex I subunits  was performed on tumor tissue to study protein expression and re   sults confirmed by western blot. Quantification of the mutation load  in mitochondria and of the total mtDNA copy number in the tissues analyzed for the patient and his siblings was performed . The oncocy   toma harbors a frameshift homoplasmic (all mtDNA copies mutated)  ND5 mutation which correlated with lack of expression of another mi   tochondrially coded complex I subunit (ND6) . Conversely, oncocytic  cells expressing ND6 show heteroplasmy for the ND5 mutation and a de novo homoplasmic pathogenic ND1 mutation . Such cells also pres   ent a lower degree of mitochondrial hyperplasia as shown by mtDNA copy number  . The ND5 mutation is heteroplasmic in all normal tissues  of the patient and his siblings indicating a shift to homoplasmy only in the tumor  . Since shift to homoplasmy of ND1and ND5 mutations occurs exclu   sively in tumor cells, we conclude that complex I mutations may have a selective advantage and accompany oncocytic transformation .",2008

Two  of the most important cancer genes, contributing to pathogenesis of oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) are p53 and bcl 2 . Mutated  p53 gene is associated with the inability of the cell to repair DNA le   sions or to induce apoptosis . Consequently, increased expression of the antiapoptotic marker bcl 2 in tumour cells is expected . Based on  this regulation pathway, in the present study we analyzed the asso   ciation between the presence of mutated p53 gene and expression of bcl 2 protein . Mutational analysis of exons 5 8 of p53 was done by SSCP followed by sequencing . Expression of bcl 2 was analyzed by immunohistochemistry  . According to results of mutational and im   munohistochemical analyses, performed on 28 specimens of OSCCs,  60% of samples showed simultaneously the presence of mutated p53 gene and expressed bcl 2 oncoprotein . Independently of p53 status, the expression of bcl 2 was detected in 68% cases . Both analyzed  markers showed an increased rate of mutation/expression in tumors of higher clinical stages . The positive association between changes in p53 and bcl 2, point  at deep deregulation of apoptosis which is in agreement with the in   creased proliferative potential of OSCCs .

Hence, all three neigh   boring regions seem to contribute independently to the PC risk, and  the combined effects of SNPs across regions follow a multiplicative  model . In order to examine the association between the PC risk and all  three regions of 8q24 we designed a case control study of randomly  selected PC patients and controls without history of any malignant dis   ease . Herein, we present the results of the association of PC risk and  rs10505470 variant which is known to be in strong LD with rs6983267 in region 3 . The rs10505470 genotypes were determined using cus   tom designed TaqMan SNP genotyping assay on a Real time PCR analyzer (MxPro 3005P) . We did not observe a difference in overall al   lelic frequencies and genotype distribution {(A allele 0 .518 for patients; 0 .516 for controls); (AA 28 .24%, AG 47 .06%, GG 24 .71% for patients; AA 27 .60%, AG 47 .92%, GG 24 .48% for controls)} . Furthermore there  was no significant difference after stratification of patients in subgroups  according to age and Gleason score. Our findings led us to conclude  that rs10505470 variant is not implicated with PC risk, time of onset or PC aggressiveness in Macedonian population .",2008

Specifically, it catalyses the con   version of ( R) Î±   methyl branched chain fatty acyl CoAs to their ( S)  stereoisomers, because only stereoisomers with the 2 methyl group  in the ( S) position can be metabolized by peroxisomal oxidases, the  first enzymes in the Ã oxidation pathway  .

mutation in siRNA target sequence can impair RNAi mediated  inhibition of EA gene expression in HEK 293,P04.197,"H. Vosgha , M. Behmanesh, M. Sadeghizadeh","Tarbiat Modares University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","RNA interference (RNAi) has emerged as an effective method for si   lencing gene expression in eukaryotic cells . It has tremendous poten   tial as both a research tool and a therapeutic strategy  . The key player  in RNAi is small RNA (~ 22nt) termed siRNA . So in this report we used  the E1A specific siRNA coding plasmid under U6 snRNA promoter to suppress E1A gene expression . Then these constructs were transfect   ed into the HEK 293 cancerous and successfully transfected cells colo   nies were selected based on Neomycin antibiotic resistance . Changes in E1A gene expression were analysis using RT PCR technique . Final  findings showed no obvious difference in E1A gene expression level  in suppression and control groups upon transfection with constructed plasmids . In order to deduce the rationale behind no suppression of  the E1A gene expression, we analyzed the PCR amplified sequence  of the siRNA target region of the E1A gene using sequencing tech   nique. The findings illustrated certain mutations in this region. It has  been established previously that in RNAi process, occurrence of any  mutation in mRNA sequence of target gene at the siRNA binding site might cause impaired interference in gene expression . Therefore even a single mutation in mRNA sequence cause inhibition of interference .",2008

We therefore screened  90 non small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) samples, initially for muta   tions in S100A2 and then also for mutations in P53 and K RAS genes . Alterations were detected in 46 .7 % of squamous lung cancer (SCC)  samples, but we detected only one novel tumour specific mutation, Q23X in squamous carcinoma . We detected four polymorphisms, two  of them published for the first time (144+109 C/G and 297+75A/G) and  two already published: S62N, in coding region and related to squa   mous cell carcinoma, and 297+17T/C . In one tumour with the S62N  polymorphism, P53 and K RAS genes were also mutated, while two tumours with the Q23X mutation have a P53 but no K RAS mutation .  Expression profiles of hTERT and COX 2 revealed no significant cor   relation with tumours having also the S100A2 alterations .

The role of this poly   morphism in development of prostate cancer and hyperplasia was in   vestigated . Material and Methods:Using ASO PCR method, association between  the T (Leu) to C (Pro) polymorphism at codon10 of the TGF Ã1 gene  (TGFB1) and the risk of PCa or BPH in 100 controls were deter   mined . Results: Significant differences in the CC versus TT genotype distribu   tion between PCa patients and male controls (P , 0 .009), and between BPH patients and male controls (P , 0 .005) were noticed . Males with  the TT genotype had a 1.67 fold increased risk of PCa [95% confi   dence interval (95% CI) , 1 .49 1 .87, P , 0 .009] and TC /TT genotype,  1.14 fold increased risk of PCa [95% confidence interval (95% CI) , 1 .02 1 .26, P , 0 .047] and a 1 .54 fold increased risk of BPH with the TT genotype (95% CI , 0 .98 1 .14, P , 0 .005) and 1 .06 fold increased risk of BPH with the TT/TC genotype (95% CI , 0 .98 1 .14, P , 0 .061)  compared with those with the CC genotype respectively  .

Investigation of the specific genetic mechanisms respon   sible for the malignant behavior of UM could play an important role for the development of new approaches to UM diagnosis and treatment .  We investigated 105 UM for allelic losses at chromosomal regions 3p,  3q, 1p, 9p23, 10q23, 13q14, close or within some tumor suppressor  genes ( VHL, FHIT, RASSF1A, CDKN2A, PTEN, RB1 ) . Moreover, we  investigated the methylation status of the promoter regions of these genes . 45 UM (43%) had LOH at all informative loci of chromosome 3, indicat   ing of monosomy 3 . Methylation analysis discovered frequent methyla   tion of RASSF1A (24 patients, 23%), located at 3p21 .3 and inactivated  in a large number of human cancers . Important to notice, methylation  of RASSF1A  was found predominantly in UM without monosomy 3 (20  patients). These findings could reinforce the role of RASSF1A in the  pathogenesis of UM . LOH at 1p was found in 28 samples mainly at all informative loci (5 MS markers, 1p31 .3 to 1p36 .3) without any relation to the monosomy 3 .  Five samples had partial allelic losses at 1p31 .3 or 1p36 .3 . 1p contains  wide range of TSGs, and for the moment we could not identify those  who might be candidate genes for the UM .Additionally, we conclude  that inactivation of the regulation pathway CDKN2A âRB1 with pro   moter methylation  or LOH is not the major mechanism of the patho   genesis  in UM unlike cutaneous melanoma .",2008

Primers  were designed to amplify each exon and its surrounding sequences .  Since intron 9 is relatively small exons 9 and 10 were coamplified. No  mutation within the coding region was detected, instead all four pa   tients carried the haplotype TGTCG corresponding to polymorphisms  C129T on exon 3, A( 24)G on intron 3, C261T on exon 4, G(+160)C  polymorphism on intron 9 and A(+24)G on intron 11 .

In contrast, the colocalization of  p53 and gamma tubulin takes place in Mre11 defective cells estab   lished from an AT LD patient . In conclusion, the monitoring of the mi   totic spindle appears to be an ATM dependent phenomenon .Oricchio E ., Saladino C ., Iacovelli S ., Soddu S ., Cundari E . Cell Cycle  5/1, 88 92, 2006",2008

To date mutation screening has resulted  in the identification of approximately 70% of the causative mutations,  indicating that additional BBS genes have to be identified.

In this study we employed high density SNP  genotyping for homozygosity mapping in the identification of gene mu   tations to simplify this task in consanguineous families . Nine consanguineous families were analyzed, and in five of them link   age to a known BBS loci was detected .

","Primary distal renal tubular acidosis (dRTA) is characterized by de   fective secretion of H+ ions by intercalary cells of the collecting duct .  Both autosomal dominant (AD) and recessive (AR) forms have been described . The AD form is caused by mutations of the  SLC4A1  gene .  The AR form has been associated with mutations of either ATP6V1B1     in individuals who usually display sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL)    or ATP6V0A4    in individuals who do not have SNHL or show hearing  loss only after the first decades of life. We report on the first investigation of the ATP6V1B1  and ATP6V0A4   genes in dRTA patients in Italy. Mutations were identified in 8/8 pa   tients analyzed . The ATP6V0A4  Arg807Gln mutation was found at the homozygous  state in a patient with severe early onset SNHL, that is generally not  observed in subjects with ATP6V0A4 defects . Only another case with  the same genotype, who had a comparably severe phenotype, is re   ported in the literature . A monoallelic de novo  ATP6V1B1 mutation (Arg394Gln) was observed  in one patient with a typical dRTA renal phenotype without deafness .

We also detected three previously unreported mutations, two in AT  P6V0A4 and one in ATP6V1B1  . Our results shed further light on phenotype genotype correlations in  dRTA. In particular, the association of a specific monoallelic ATP6V1B1   mutation with a dRTA phenotype without hearing loss suggests that  other genetic mechanisms, in addition to autosomal recessive inheri   tance, may be associated with ATP6V1B1  alterations .",2008

We have developed a strategy for molecular testing  of the EYA1  gene causing BOR syndrome consisting of 1) sequencing  of the complete coding region and flanking intronic regions and 2) mul   tiple ligation probe amplification (MLPA) analysis. Using this strategy  EYA1  mutations were identified in 82% (14/17) of a cohort of paediatric  BOR syndrome probands. Forty five percent (5/11) of BOR syndrome  probands in our cohort had de novo  EYA1 mutations, suggesting that  the incidence of de novo  cases in BOR syndrome is higher than 10% previously reported . We also describe a previously unreported recur   rent EYA1  gene mutation c .867+5G>A found in 21% (3/14) of EYA1   mutation positive BOR probands in our patient cohort . RNA analysis indicates that the c .867+5G>A mutation affects splicing of the  EYA1   gene, and produces an aberrant mRNA transcript skipping exon 8 and  leading to a premature termination signal in exon 9 . The aberrant tran   script lacking exon 8 was present at approximately 50% level of wild   type EYA1  mRNA in fibroblasts, and suggests that certain transcripts  of EYA1  escape nonsense mediated decay and encode truncated EYA  protein capable of dominant negative interactions causing disease .",2008

Whilst mutations in AGPAT2, a member of the  acyltransferase family, likely cause lipodystrophy by reducing triglyc   eride synthesis in adipose tissue, the pathogenic effects of mutations in BSCL2 on a molecular level are not yet fully understood . Further  clinical features of both subtypes include severe insulin resistance,  acanthosis nigricans, muscular hypertrophy, hepatomegaly, diabetes mellitus and hypertriglyceridemia . However patients with CGL2 show a  more severe phenotype with lack of both metabolically active and me   chanical adipose tissue, a higher prevalence of mild mental retardation and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  . To elucidate the function of BSCL2 in adipogenesis we generated  BSCL2 knock out flies. These knock out strains showed altered ar   chitecture and distribution of lipid droplets in adipose tissue .

The  objective of our work was to assess functional importance of the three promoter mutations on the C1NH gene expression . Results of lucifer   ase reporter gene assay showed that two of the mutations,  40 C>G and  45 C>A, have negligible effect on C1INH expression .

Expression of ceruloplasmin and ferroportin in human  peripheral blood lymphocytes: a new link between iron  metabolism and the immune system,P05.022,"L. Marques , J. Banha, R. Oliveira, L. Costa","Instituto Nacional de SaÃºde Dr.Ricardo Jorge, Lisboa, Portugal. ","Background: Ceruloplasmin (Cp) is a multicopper oxidase with a rel   evant role in iron (Fe) metabolism mainly due to its ferroxidase activity  .  Cp exists in a secreted form (sCp) and a membrane glycosylphos   phatidylinositol anchored form (GPI Cp) . Recent studies showed that  Cp ferroxidase activity is required for ferroportin (Fpn) stability on cell surface . Herein we report the expression of both Cp isoforms and Fpn in human peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) . Material and Methods: PBL were isolated followed by total RNA extrac   tion, cDNA synthesis and subsequent analysis of Cp and Fpn tran   scripts by PCR . For immunoblotting, protein extracts from membrane  and cytosolic fractions were prepared. For immunofluorescence, cells  were cultured with and without PI PLC (an enzyme that cleaves GPI  groups) followed by immunolabeling for Cp and analysis by confocal microscopy  . Results and Conclusion: Both Cp isoforms and Fpn were shown to be expressed at both mRNA and protein level . Cp and Fpn were also  shown to be localized at PBL membrane . Confocal analysis of immu   nolabeled PBL treated with PI PLC showed a significant reduction of  Cp labeling compared to untreated PBL, showing that at least part of Molecular and biochemical basis of disease Cp expressed at PBL membrane is GPI anchored . Altogether, these  data show that human PBL express both sCp, GPI Cp and Fpn . Study   ing the expression of these proteins in cells of the immune system (IS)  may contribute to understanding the regulation of the Fe homeostasis  by the IS and also allow to access Cp isoforms and Fpn activities as   sociated to pathological conditions, often neurological, in cells from peripheral blood .",2008
Myotonia congenita: identification of eleven new mutations in the cLcN1 gene,P05.023,"J. F. Quesada , I. S. Pascual, J. MartiÃ¡Ã±ez, J. M. Molano","Hospital Universitario La Paz, Madrid, Spain","Introduction . Myotonia congenita (MC) is a rare autosomal inher   ited disorder characterized by muscle stiffness and hypertrophy  . MC  is inherited in two different forms: a dominant form, designated as  ThomsenÂ´s myotonia, or a recessive form, designated as BeckerÂ´s generalized myotonia . However, both forms are caused by mutations  in a unique gene, the CLCN1 gene, which encodes the major chloride  channel in skeletal muscle. In this communication, we identified 11 new mutations in Spanish patients . We assumed these are disease caus   ing mutations and no polymorphisms because the mutated amino acid residues are conserved through evolution . Our future project is to char   acterize, using patch clamp analysis, the effect of these mutations on the clc1 channel function . Patients and Methods . We analyzed DNA extracted from peripheral  blood of patients attending to Neurology Services from several tertiary  Spanish hospitals  . Each CLCN1 exon and boundary intron regions  were amplified by the DNA polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and prod   ucts were DNA sequenced in an ABI PrismÂ® 3130 XL instrument .Results . We analyzed DNA from 103 patients (51 families) with myo   tonia as major symptom having previously excluded the myotonic dys   trophies . We have found 20 different mutations, including 11 mutations that are not described before . Four mutations (F167L, Y302H, M485V and R894X) were recurrent in our serie . Conclusions . Analysis of mutations in CLCN1 gene in 51 Spanish fami   lies with myotonia suggest that there are remarkable differences in the  mutation profiles between Spanish and other Caucasian populations.",2008

Its gene is located on chromosome 11p12,  to which suggestive linkage was observed in a Maltese family with coeliac disease . Sequencing of CD59, APAF 1 interacting protein and CD44 genes, re   vealed a number of variants . Two synonymous variants, a C/T transi   tion (rs1071695) in CD44 and a novel G/A change within CD59, were co segregating with the linked haplotype in all affected individuals .  Only one A allele, from 442 chromosomes, was found in the general population (0 .23%)and was completely absent in a group of coeliac patients, showing that this is a rare variant found within this family  . Two constructs consisting of normal and mutated exons together with  adjacent introns were cloned into pSPL3, and transfected into HeLa and COS 7 . Reverse transcriptase PCR was performed, followed by agarose gel electrophoresis and sequencing . Both wild type and mu   tated constructs for the CD59 variant resulted in a normally and an ab   normally spliced transcript lacking the exon involved (coding for signal peptide), which was more pronounced in the presence of the A allele .  No abnormally spliced transcripts were observed for the other variant within CD44 . In this study, a novel synonymous variant within the CD59 gene was  shown to affect splicing, possibly due to effects on the secondary  structure of pre mRNA, increasing the susceptibility to coeliac disease in this family  . 1 .

","Nephrotic syndrome (NS) is characterized by gross proteinuria, hypo   albumenia, edema and hyperlipidemia, which in CNS manifest in utero  or within 3 months after birth . Inherited impairments of the glomerular  filtration barrier are an important cause of NS, and in CNS and infan   tile NS ~60% of cases are caused by mutations in 4 genes: Nephrin  (NPHS1), Podocin (NPHS2), Laminin Î²2 (LAMB2) and Wilmâs Tumor  suppressor gene (WT1). In a newborn with clinical findings compat   ible with CNS, and his parents, the 27 exons of the NPHS1 gene and  8 exons of the NPHS2 gene were subject to direct DNA sequencing  analysis and mutation detection analysis (Surveyor mutation detection kit, Transgenomic, Elancourt, France) .

The two defects affecting biosynthesis, namely arginine  glycine amidinotransferase (AGAT) and guanidinoacetate methyltrans   ferase (GAMT) are autosomal recessive traits, whereas the creatine transporter (CRTR) is an X linked disorder  . We present the results of a collaborative CDS prospective screening  based on abnormal metabolite excretion or decreased creatine signal  in brain MRS in a cohort of patients with mental retardation (MR) and/or suspected metabolic disorder  . Three GAMT and nine CRTR cases  were selected. Confirmatory diagnosis was assessed by measuring  GAMT activity or creatine uptake in fibroblasts using MS/MS methods.  Direct sequencing analysis of GAMT and SLC6A8 genes was carried out . In two of the three potential GAMT patients, deficient activity was  confirmed in fibroblasts (<4 % of matched control), and three new se   quence variations were detected: c .145delT (p .Y49fs), which appeared in homozygous fashion, and c .316C>T (p .Q106X) and c .407C>T  (p .T136M), both in heterozygous fashion . Four out of the nine CRTR  cases selected (two from the same family) presented a deficient cre   atine transport in fibroblasts.

The knowledge and attitudes  identified allow healthcare staff to recognise where genetic tests will  inform clinical management within the limits of their role and where referral is appropriate . Healthcare staff will also be equipped to recog   nise any social, ethical or legal implications in ordering the genetic laboratory test . To integrate these skills into clinical practice, the Centre has targeted  health professionals for whom genetics is highly relevant and is work   ing with these groups and other professional bodies to identify how genetics affects their clinical practice . Using this information, the Centre is creating tools allowing healthcare staff to recognise where genetics impacts on their clinical practice .

According to  the Villefranche nosology, she fulfilled the criteria of EDS vascular type for laboratory testing . Total sequencing of COL3A1 cDNA (obtain form  skin cultured fibroblasts) identified an homozygous nucleotide dupli   cation (c .479_480dupT) resulting in a premature termination codon (p .Val160fsX46) . Studies in genomic DNA showed that this mutation  in exon 5 of the COL3A1 gene was inherited from each parent . As  expected, the expression analysis (RT PCR, quantitative PCR, Immu   nohistochemistry, WB) showed a strong mRNA decay, which results in  an absence of type III collagen in the proband . This case, shows that a deficit in collagen III is viable in early child   hood in Man. Here, the expected COL3A1 haploinsufficiency in her  asymptomatic ascendants did not lead to the severe clinical manifes   tations of EDS vascular type cause by haploinsufficiency of one allele as described in the literature . This case provides evidences for a sto   chastic effect of COL3A1 haploinsufficiency in Man with (a) modifying  factor(s), which remains to be identified.",2008

","Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a clinically and genetically heteroge   neous group of heritable skin disorders . It is characterised by skin blis   tering and mucous membrane . EB has been divided into three major  categories based on the level of blister formation in dermal epidermal junction zone . EB is diagnosed by evaluation of clinical findings, by transmission  electron microscopic examination of a skin biopsy and immunohisto   chemical mapping of protein components of dermal epidermal junction zone from a skin biopsy  . Molecular genetic diagnostics of EB was initi   ated in 2004 . Dystrophic EB (EBD) is caused by mutations in the collagen type VII (COL7A1), which consists of 118 exons . EB simplex (EBS) is caused  by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5), which consists of 9 exons and keratin 14 (KRT14), which consists of 8 exons . DNA from EB patients and their relatives were screened for mutations in COL7A1, KRT5 and KRT14 genes . Analysis was performed using  PCR, denaturing high performance liquid chromatography, high reso   lution melting analysis and direct sequencing . We could identify KRT5 or KRT14 dominant mutations in 11 out of 18 EBS families . As regards  27 EBD probands, we revealed disease causative mutations in 16 pa   tients and screening of COL7A1 is in progress . Prenatal diagnosis of  one pregnancy in family with occurrence of EBS predicted the fetus being normal and subsequently a healthy child was born . Determination of EB at the level of DNA has important implication for  final confirmation of diagnosis, possibility of genetic counselling and early prenatal diagnosis .This work was supported by IGA MH NR9346 3 .",2008

","Familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) is an autosomal dominant disor   der associated with high risk of coronary heart disease . FH is caused  mainly by inherited defects on the Low Density Lipoprotein Receptor gene (LDLR) resulting in increased circulating LDL cholesterol . Of the  many different LDLR mutations found in FH patients worldwide, about  6 % of single base substitutions are located near or within introns  and are predicted to result in exon skipping, retention of an intron or activation of cryptic sites during mRNA splicing . Ten such mutations,  four of them novel, were found in the âPortuguese FH Studyâ, and  those whose effect on splicing was untested have been investigated  by RT PCR of  LDLR  mRNA isolated from fresh blood mononuclear  cells . Four of these variants (313+6 T>C, 1060+1G>A, c .2389G>T (p .V776L), 2547+1G>A) caused exon skipping, and one caused reten   tion of an intron (c .1359 5C>G),while two others (c .2140+5 G>A and c .1061 8T>C) had no apparent effect .

The aim of this study  is to determine the frequency of the mutations which has been re   ported comparatively rare, to define the most effective mutation set,  and to select the most suitable DNA analysis system for Turkish FMF patients . 1709 patients were referred by specialists to the Moleculer Genetic  Diagnostic Centrum of Duzen Laboratuaries Groups from various regions of Turkey  . First, mutation screening of the MEFV gene was  performed for the 3 most common mutations, namely M694V, M680I,  V726A, in 1182 unrelated patients by polymerase chain reaction and restriction enzyme digestion analysis . The rate of mutation detection was 46 .2% and these three mutations accounted for 64 .4%, 22 .6%  and 12 .7% of the alleles, respectively  . . Second, we investigated 12  mutations (E148Q, P369S, F479L, M680I G>C, M680 G>A, 1692del,  M694V, M694I, K695R, V726A, A744S and R761H) in 527 patients  using reverse dot blot hybridization (RDBH) assay  . We found the rate  of detection to be 50 .5% . The most common mutations were found to  be M694V, E148Q, M680I, V726A and R761H . Percengate of these  mutations were 47 .7, 19 .9, 14 .3, 9 .8 and 4 .1, respectively  . Our study  showed that the RDBH method increased the detection rate of FMF  mutations about 4% compared to PCR RFLP method for Turkish pop   ulation .",2008

Here, we study the molecular consequences of  17 naturally occurring FOXL2 missense mutations on subcellular local   ization and transactivation capacities in cellular systems .

Several mutants led to a loss of function, while others might induce a dominant negative effect . Interestingly, one mutant that  is located outside the FHD (S217F), proved to be hypermorphic and to have no effect on intracellular protein distribution . Clinically this mu   tation gives rise to a mild BPES phenotype, and to growth hormone  deficiency. In general, missense mutations located in the FHD lead to  a classical BPES phenotype, but cannot be correlated with the pres   ence of an ovarian phenotype . However, a potential predictive value  of localization and transactivation assays in the making of genotype  phenotype correlations is proposed.

Primary aldosteronism (PA) is currently considered the  most frequent form of endocrine hypertension . Glucocorticoid remedi   able aldosteronism (GRA) is a genetic variety of PA, affecting about  1% of patients, which is inherited in an  autosomal dominant pattern .  GRA is caused by a chimaeric gene with aldosterone synthase activ   ity originating from an unequal crossing over between the CYP11B1 (11 beta hydroxylase) and CYP11B2 (aldosterone synthase) genes .  Hypertension in GRA can be severe leading to cerebrovascular com   plications at a young age and female carriers of the mutation have a higher incidence of preeclampsia during pregnancy  . On the other  hand GRA can be successfully treated by glucocorticoids, which justi   fies its screening and early diagnosis. Objective.

However, little is  known about GTF2IRD2 , a multicopy gene that is variably deleted in  WBS patients, and thus a candidate to influence the variable severity  of the phenotype . We have studied the function of the three expressed  GTF2IRD2 copies termed medial, telomeric and the chimeric found in  some WBS patients . In vitro  transfection assays in COS7 cells revealed  that all three GTF2IRD2 proteins formed heterodimers with GTF2I, but only the GTF2IRD2 tel copy could interact with GTF2IRD1 . The cellular  localization pattern was different among the three proteins . GTF2IRD2  tel protein appears mainly nuclear while the GTF2IRD2 chi was found  to be mostly cytoplasmatic . The GTF2IRD2 tel and GTF2IRD2 med  proteins, but not the GTF2IRD2 chi, changed their distribution pattern when co transfected with GTF2I and GTF2IRD1 . In addition, the GT   F2IRD2 tel protein was able to activate transcription of the c fos  gene  in a synergistic way with GTF2I .

We identified a novel heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA (m .4322dupC) mutation in tRNA Ile gene associ   ated with isolated dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) as maternal trait .  Mutation screening techniques and automated DNA sequencing were  performed to identify mtDNA mutations and to assess heteroplasmy in familyâs proband and healthy control subjects . All family members tested had heteroplasmic mtDNA (m .4322dupC) mutation . We also  screened 350 normal controls for this mutation and found no evidence of heteroplasmy  . The m .4322dupC mutation was found in the skeletal tissue from the  proband that exhibited slightly reduced deficiency of mitochondrial re   spiratory chain enzymes (complex III) . The present study reports the novel m .4322dupC mutation in tRNA Ile gene, which is possibly associ   ated to the disease, to isolated DCM . It was localized in a hot spot  region for mutations and is possibly pathogenic because of a cosegre   gation with the matrilineal transmission of DCM .",2008

With the objective to clarify the molecular ba   sis of this geneâs regulation, we have characterized the mouse Dfna5   promoter region . Initially,  in silico  analyses of the mouse Dfna5  promoter region were  performed followed by 5â RACE experiments using mouse  cochlear   cDNA . The latter enabled us to identify the cochlear Dfna5  transcription  initiation site (TIS) in vitro  . Subsequently, constructs were generated  for transfection experiments in HEK293 cells.

In ~70% of congenitally deaf newborns the loss is nonsyndromic . The purpose of this study has been to determine the cause of syn   dromic and non syndromic hearing loss in the Iranian population . Over a 10 year period, 2434 families segregating deafness have been referred to Genetics Research Center in Tehran . In each of these fami   lies, informed consent was obtained . Every family was screened for  mutations in GJB2  and GJB6  . Following this screen, in 300 families  with three and more affected individuals with presumed ARNSHL, we screened total of 22 loci by STR markers . In families in which autozy   gosity by descent was not identified at any of these loci, a genome wide screen was completed . Our data show that 15 .3% of the Iranian population with ARNSHL seg   regate mutations in GJB2  . The most prevalent mutation in this gene  was 35delG, although more than 20 mutations have been identified,  five of which are unique to the Iranian population. We also identi   fied novel GJB2  mutation in an endogenous population segregating  ADNSHL in village north of Iran . The second and third most prevalent causes of ARNSHL were muta   tions in SLC26A4  and TECTA  . We have also found mutations in PJVK   and TMC1  in one family each . We have identified a number of families segregating syndromic hear   ing loss .Totally, we have been able to determine the genetic cause of  hearing loss in over 30% of families referred to our center  .",2008

We studied 56 patients (43 families, 33 of them Galician, 10 from other regions of Spain), most with uncomplicated forms of HSP  .  The 17 exons of SPG4  and exon intron boundaries were sequenced .  Novel mutations and sequence variations of unknown significance  were checked in 186 Galician controls. We identified six mutations, three of them novel . The same truncating mutation was present in four apparently unrelated pedigrees . We found four sequence variations of  unknown significance, one synonymous polymorphism and six other  sequence alterations not found in the literature or databases but un   likely to be pathogenic (either present in controls or not co segregat   ing with the phenotype when several affected family members were available) . In summary, 9/43 families (21%) were positive for SPG4  mutations and another four families (9%) harbour sequence variations  of unknown significance. If we consider only the cases with definitive  autosomal dominant inheritance, the frequency of SPG4 mutations  rises up to 60% in our series, confirming that SPG4 causes most of the AD HSP also in our community  .

Fibrodysplasia Ossificans Progressiva (FOP, MIM 135100) is a rare  genetic disorder characterized by the presence of a congenital great  toe malformation and progressive heterotopic ossification that trans   forms skeletal muscles to bone following a well defined anatomic pat   tern of progression. Heterotopic ossification begins in childhood, either  spontaneously or upon induction of stimuli such as trauma, and pro   gresses episodically throughout adulthood . FOP is usually sporadic,  however, some familial cases with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with variable expression have been described . Linkage  analysis in these families led to identification of ACVR1/ALK2 as the gene responsible for FOP  . All familial and sporadic cases with a clas   sic FOP phenotype that have been analysed are heterozygous for the identical mutation, c .617G>A leading to R206H substitution . The only  reported exception is a recently described de novo mutation, G356R, associated with a slowly progressing form of FOP  . The ACVR1 gene  encodes the activin A type I receptor, a serine/threonine kinase recep   tor for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) belonging to the TGF beta receptor family  . In this study, we report ACVR1 mutational analy   sis in a group of 17 Italian FOP patients. We confirmed the presence  of the recurrent R206H substitution in 14 patients and we identified a novel mutation (R258S) in the ACVR1 kinase domain in one patient .

Up to  78% of the HHT patients show hepatic arteriovenous malformations (HAVM), but the molecular basis of liver involvement is still unknown .  In approximately 75% of the patients, mutations can be identified by  sequencing of the two known HHT genes, ACVRL1  (ALK1 ) and ENG  .  Genotype phenotype correlations are not yet fully defined, but previ   ously, we and others showed that hepatic involvement is associated  with ACVRL1  mutations, but rarely caused by mutations in the ENG   gene . Patients and methods: In a new cohort of 18 adult HHT patients we  performed sequencing analysis of the ACVRL1  and ENG  gene . Results: Eight novel and 8 already described mutations (10 missense  mutations, 2 small in frame deletions, 3 premature stop mutations  and 1 small frameshift deletion) were identified. Analysis of our entire  data revealed statistically significant differences in the distribution of  ACVRL1  and ENG  mutations among HHT patients with and without  HAVM (p,0 .0016) . Conclusion: Our data support the growing evidence for a significant  correlation between mutations in the ACVRL1  gene and liver involve   ment in HHT, and suggest that molecular genetic testing in HHT pa   tients is important for prognosis with respect to liver disease .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease",2008

Because of its  etiopathogenesis it results tempting to speculate that additional sig   nalling pathways implicated in intestinal neurodevelopment could also be involved in HSCR . In this way, the NTF3/TrkC signalling pathway  had been shown to play an essential role in the development of the  ENS, together with the evidences showed by murine models lacking or  over expressing NTF 3, and the differential localization of the receptor  in ganglionic versus  aganglionic region of HSCR intestine suggest a  potential role for those genes in the pathogenesis of HSCR .

It is a progressive autosomal dominant neuro  degenerative disorder that is caused by a CAG repeat expansion in the  HD gene, resulting in an expansion of polyglutamines at the N terminal  end of the encoded protein, designated huntingtin, and the accumula   tion of cytoplasmic and nuclear aggregates . Not only is there a loss of  normal huntingtin function, upon expansion of the CAG repeat there is  also a gain of toxic function of the huntingtin protein and this affects a wide range of cellular processes .

Variants in the MyBPC3 gene, coding for myosin bind   ing protein C (MYBP C), are associated with human HCM . The muta   tion A31P in MyBPC3 is associated with familial HCM in MCO and  we screened a large cohort of unrelated MCO cats to establish the association between this mutation and feline HCM .Two hundred eighty seven MCO cats (mean age of 2 .2 years, 23 with  HCM) were genotyped for the A31P  . Mutation screening was performed  by DNA sequencing . Heart proteins were extracted from two MCO cats,  separated by SDS PAGE, the MYBP C band was trypsin digested and  sequence variants identified by mass spectrometry (MS). A31P had a minor allele frequency of 0 .20 . The odds ratio for having  HCM was 10.7 (95% cfi: 3.3   34.4) in homozygous cats. The presence  of MYBP C with the A31P variant in heart tissue was verified by MS in a homozygous MCO cat . MyBPC3 associated HCM in MCO express itself as a recessive disease  in young cats, as a single A31P allele does not confer an increased risk of HCM . However, the potential for late onset of disease may cause  the significance of the genetic variant to be underestimated.

Most of the ICF patients  were born from consanguineous marriages and about 60% have mu   tations in the DNMT3B, a de novo  DNA methyltransferase . ICF syn   drome is characterized by a marked immunodeficiency (patients tend  to have low levels of immunoglobulins); facial anomalies are a hetero   geneous trait and centromeric instability is the most typical feature of the disease . The juxtacentromeric heterochromatin of chromosome 1,  9, and 16 is markedly undercondensed and is involved in chromosome rearrangements and multiradiate associations . The instability corre   lates with a severe hypomethylation of the classical satellites 2 and 3, which are the major components of constitutive heterochromatin . It is  unknown how loss of DNA methylation in non coding sequences ac   counts for the multiple symptoms associated with the ICF syndrome .  Having observed that in tumor cells and cancer cell lines heterochro   matic genes become hypomethylated and escape from silencing, we asked whether the same process is found in ICF syndrome . In this  work we showed that heterochromatic genes are strongly hypomethyl   ated and some of them escape from silencing in ICF cells relative to controls . Having observed that some heterochromatic genes remain  silent, in spite of loss of methylation, we concluded that hypomethyl   ation is necessary but not sufficient to have transcription in heterochro   matic regions . ChIP experiments will show whether the activation of  heterochromatic genes is regulated by histone modifications. Aberrant  transcription of heterochromatic genes may contribute to some of the symptoms that are associated with ICF syndrome .",2008

The Mann Whitney U test was used to analyse gene  expression differences between groups . CS transcript levels positively correlated with all germ cell stages num   ber but a negative correlation was found with Sertoli cells supporting the greater contribution of germ cells to CS transcription . Transcript  levels of CS were significantly decreased in spermatogenic failure af   fected samples (p,0.01), suggesting to play a role in the efficiency of  spermatogenesis.

IKs protein is the slowly activating de   layer rectifier potassium channel. Mutations in single genes reduce the  IKs current and cause the similar Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) pheno   type . LQTS is a cardiovascular disorder characterized by an abnormal   ity in repolarization, leading to a prolonged QT interval . KCNQ1  consists of 16 exons and encodes a protein of 676 amino  acids. There have been identified 246 mutations in this gene. KCNE1   consists of just 3 exons, encoding a protein of 129 amino acids . Only  30 mutations of this gene have been found . For the mutation scanning we have used multiplex SSCP with sensi   tivity about 80 % . Now, we detect the mutations using high resolution  melting analysis . This method is based on PCR in the presence of the  double strand DNA binding dye, and tracking the nucleic acid melting  by monitoring the fluorescence of the sample across a defined tem   perature range. Melting profiles can be used to identify the presence of sequence variation within the amplicon . The method has almost 100%  sensitivity and specificity when used on products up to 400bp. We  have used this method for detection of 7 described mutations (S225L,  T312I, G314S, G325R, T587M, A590T and R591H) in KCNQ1  and two  SNPs (S38G and D85N) in KCNE1  with the sensitivity 100 % .

So far,  four genes have been documented that associated with AI, AMELEX, ENAM, KLK4 and MMP20 genes . We performed molecular genetic  studies on 10 Iranian families with different models of inheritances according to pedigree analysis . In this study, three genes including  ENAM, KLK4, and MMP20 which account for majority of AI and auto   somally inherited were chosen for mutation detection by a polymerase  chain reaction (PCR) and single stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) . Our results from SSCP revealed genetic alterations in ENAM, MMP20 and KLK4 genes . We found mutations in KLK4 exon 3 in 7  patients . In order to identify the type of mutation, samples were sub   jected for DNA sequencing.

The  diagnosis is based on clinical symptoms and low lactase activity in intestinal biopsy specimens . Five mutations in the lactase gene (LCT)  have so far been identified to underlie CLD. Methods: To search for new mutations underlying CLD we assayed  disaccharidase activities in intestinal biopsy specimens and screened  the coding region of LCT gene by direct sequencing from one Italian,  two Finnish and two Turkish patients with clinical symptoms compat   ible to CLD  . Results: Three novel mutations in the LCT gene were identified. A sin   gle nucleotide substitution leading to an amino acid change S688P in  exon 7 and a premature stop codon E1612X in exon 12 of the LCT were present in the patient of Italian origin . A novel substitution of R1587H in exon 12 was found in a heterozygous form from one Finnish patient .  Both Finnish patients were heterozygous for the Finnish founder muta   tion Y1370X . Analyses of another Finnish patient are still ongoing . The  previously reported missense mutation G1363S in exon 9 was found in a homozygous state in two siblings of Turkish origin .

Mutations in the LDLR  cause familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH),  which results in defective catabolism of LDL leading to premature ath   erosclerosis and CHD . Five missense mutations found in the LDLR gene during the âPor   tuguese FH Studyâ, responsible for protein variants V408L, W469R,  S627P, P664S and V838M, were studied in order to assess their pathogenicity  . The different LDLR mutants were generated by site directed mutagen   esis and expressed in CHO ldlA7 cells lacking endogenous expres   sion of LDLR . To determine the effects of mutations on LDLR function  we measured saturable binding plus internalization and degradation of  125I labelled LDL at 37ÂºC and estimated mature LDLR at cell surface  by immunoblotting . All mutant constructs resulted in production of a detectable mature  protein in CHO A7 cells, except variant W469R which accumulated the precursor form . Variants W469R and V408L were severely im   paired in their ability to mediate uptake and degradation of 125I LDL  and showed reduced amounts of LDLR at cell surface . Variant S627P  retained ~40% and P664S ~60% of normal LDLR activity  . V838M vari   ant showed essentially the same activity as the wild type LDLR . Results suggest that four of the variants studied are mutations caus   ing disease in patients carrying those alterations and V838M is a rare  non pathogenic variant . The severe effect that V408L mutation has in  LDLR function does not correlate with the patientâs phenotype, sug   gesting other genetic or/and environmental factors may be involved in phenotype modulation .",2008

Kun   kel1,2","1Childrenâs Hospital Boston, Boston, MA, United States, 2Howard Hughes Medi   cal Institute, Boston, MA, United States","The muscular disorders are a heterogeneous group of inherited dis   eases characterized by muscle wasting and progressive weakness,  resulting in significant morbidity and disability. Although considerable  progress has been made in the understanding of these disorders, the underlying molecular pathways remain poorly understood . In light of  their involvement in modulating cellular phenotypes we hypothesized  that miRNAs might be involved in the regulation of the pathological pathways leading to muscle dysfunction . We describe a comprehen   sive miRNA expression profile aiming to identify new elements involved  in the regulatory networks of muscle and the signature pattern of 185  miRNAs associated with ten common myopathological conditions in  human. While five miRNAs were found to be consistently dysregulated in all samples analyzed suggesting that these miRNAs are involved in  a common underlying regulatory pathway among all diseases, other  miRNAs were identified to be dysregulated only in one given disease  and not in any of the others thus pointing to their involvement in a unique regulatory mechanism . The subsequent identification of potential target genes and the un   raveling of biological signaling pathways involved in this regulatory  level in these disorders, point to an additional dimension of regulation of muscle function mediated by miRNAs . Together with the tight post  transcriptional regulation at the mRNA level identified in Duchenne and  Miyoshi myopathy and specific mRNA:miRNA predicted interactions,  some of which are directly involved in compensatory secondary re   sponse functions and others in muscle regeneration, these findings  suggest an important role of miRNAs in the pathology of muscular dystrophy  .",2008

To assess relationship between mtDNA haplogroups  and MS, we have sequenced the mtDNA HVS I in 54 MS patients and 100 control subjects . In this study, kinetic analysis of mitochondrial  respiratory chain complex I enzyme was performed on intact mito   chondria isolated from fresh skeletal muscle in MS patients (n ,10) and control subjects (n ,11) . The frequencies of the Asian (M, BM)  and European (N, J, K) mtDNA haplogroups in five major regions of Iran was investigated . Unexpectedly, the frequencies of the Asian hap   logroups M and BM were low in Iran (2 .34% for haplogroup M; 17 .6% for haplogroup BM and 80 .06% for haplogroup N) . We have found that haplogroups A and K are significantly more abun   dant in MS patients ( P,0 .042 for haplogroup A and P,0 .0005 for hap   logroup K). Our findings showed that complex I activities were signifi   cantly reduced ( P,0 .007) in patients compared with control . However,  we could not find deletion in mtDNA of patients with MS. Our results revealed that 15 (75%) out of 20 MS patients had point mutations .  This study suggested that point mutation occurred in mtDNA might be involved in pathogenesis of MS . Our data suggest that Iranian tribes  probably played a remarkable role in the formation of these ethnic groups . It gives the indication that the haplogroup J may be older than  6000 10000 years, and probably developed in Iran, and then expand   ed to different regions in Europe and Northwest Asia .",2008

To determine mtDNA damage, we investigated deletions based in four  areas of mitochondrial DNA, in a group of 120 patients clinically di   agnosed with one of mentioned neurological disorders . We screened  for tRNALeu , tRNALys , COII, ATPase6/8  and NDI genes of mtDNA of  patients with HD, SCA, MS, AT, FA and DMD . Results showed that ATPase 6 gene is a hot spot region rather than other regions . Several new nucleotide variations resulting in amino  acid changes were observed in patients that altered protein structure regarding to essential changes in amino acids . The secondary mitochondrial respiratory chain defects encountered in  these disorders can also be explained by mitochondrial that degener   ate either as part of a more widespread cellular insult, or as a conse   quence of a different specific defect. Most mitochondrial proteins have to be imported from the cytoplasm and directed to the mitochondria .  So this study suggests that the high rate of mutations in ATPase 6 could be result in interaction of nuclear protein with mtDNA genome .",2008

The main concep   tion of our hypothesis is that exist an interaction between MTHFR poly   morphisms and development of myopathyc process . Methods:We analyzed DNA from a case control study in the RM of 50 DMD probands and 114controls . MTHFR variant alleles were deter   mined by a PCR RFLP  .

The inheritance is usually  recessive, autosomal or X linked . The autosomal dominant varieties  include Alexander disease, CADASIL, and the phenotype recently  described in four families with adult onset (40 50 yrs) and initial au   tonomic dysfunctions due to duplication of the LMNB1 gene (Padiath  et al, 2006) . To better define the prevalence of lamin B1 gene defects, we selected  eight unrelated Italian probands with hereditary, adult onset diffuse leukoencephalopathy  . Seven showed pyramidal/cerebellar symptoms;  six were compatible with an autosomal dominant transmission . LMNB1  full gene deletion/duplication and point mutations were tested by Taq   man real time PCR and direct sequencing . One proband carried a 140 190 Kb duplication involving the entire LMNB1, the AX748201 transcript and the 3â end of MARCH3 . Clini   cal and neuroimaging data of this proband and an affected relative  overlapped with the features of the LMNB1 duplication described by  Padiath et al. No LMNB1 gene defects were identified in the remaining seven probands .In conclusion, LMNB1 duplication appears to be associated only to a  subset of the adult onset, autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathies,  sharing the following features: onset with autonomic dysfunction, dif   fuse T2 hyperintensity of supra  and infra tentorial white matter, spar   ing of U fibers and optic radiations. The more variable phenotypes in  the seven families lacking LMNB1 defects, suggests that other genes might be involved in the autosomal dominant leukoencephalopathies .",2008

LOX 1 activation  is an important mechanism that contributes to plaque instability and subsequent development of acute coronary syndromes . Association  studies have implicated OLR1  gene variants in myocardial infarction  (MI) susceptibility/protection. We identified a new functional splicing  isoform of the OLR1  gene, named LOXIN lacking the extracellular lec   tin binding domain . In vivo and in vitro  studies revealed that this iso   form is protective against myocardial infarction . This effect is mediated  by a dominant negative mechanism on LOX 1 function through the formation of non functional LOX 1/LOXIN hetero oligomers . Genomic  and expression studies performed in mice and in non human primates demonstrate the absence of LOXIN in these species . This suggests  that LOXIN might be a recently selected allele. All these results confirm  and extend the importance of OLR1  gene in the pathogenesis of myo   cardial infarction making LOXIN an attractive new target for prevention and treatment of acute coronary syndromes .",2008

Therefore,  every organism has mechanisms to control cellular uptake, distribu   tion, detoxification and elimination of copper. Genetic defects in any of  these mechanisms as well as ecological abnormalities of copper bal   ance result in neurodegenerative diseases . The systems that maintain  copper homeostasis in mammalian brain are investigated poorly  . This work was done using Wistar rats received 50 mg AgCl per kg of  body weight, daily, in four weeks . This model is characterized with cop   per deficit in blood serum and normal copper metabolism in liver. Concentration of copper, zinc, iron, and silver was determined in cor   tex, cerebellum, hippocamp, hypothalamus, amygdaloid body, hy   pophysis by atomic absorptive spectrometry  . Copper transporting pro   teins (CTR1, ATP7A/B, APP) and cuproenzymes (ceruloplasmin (Cp),  GPI Cp, SOD1, COX (Cox4i1)) mRNA levels were determined with semiquantitative RT PCR .

Several groups have demonstrated that PINK1 protein  can be localized to mitochondria in vitro . Moreover, functional stud   ies have shown that PINK1 protein may have a neuroprotective role  as wild type PINK1 protects cells against proteasomal inhibition . This protective effect is abrogated by mutations in the PINK1 gene . Herein  we investigated a possible association of PINK1 gene mutations in southern Italian families with monogenic parkinsonism . Fourteen families with PD were investigated for the presence of PINK1  mutations; five had EOP (mean age at onset 36 years) and 9 had fa   milial late onset disease (LOP, mean age at onset 65 years) . Genomic  DNA was extracted from blood. PINK1 exons were amplified by PCR and sequenced . We characterized a novel homozygous mutation (889delG,  D297fsX318) in the exon 4 of PINK1 gene in two brothers with EOP from a Sicilian consanguineous family  . This mutation causes a frame   shift in translation and a premature termination of PINK1 protein lead   ing to the loss of most of its kinase catalytic domain . No other family  members carried the homozygous deletion in the exon 4 . We did not  find this mutation in 200 chromosomes from healthy Sicilian individu   als . In conclusion, PINK1 mutations are uncommon in our southern Italian  families with EOP and LOP. The present study confirms that PINK1  mutations are a cause, even if rare, of EOP in the examined popula   tion .",2008

The  cardinal clinical signs are muscle rigidity, resting tremor, bradykinesia and, in more advanced cases, postural instability  . miRNAS are abundant in the brain and are essential for efficient brain function . Increasing evidence implicates miRNA dysfunction in PD pathogenesis . Although much has been learned in recent years about  the genetic aetiology of familial PD, far less is known about the molec   ular mechanisms underlying the vast majority of cases, which are the focus of our study  . To identify novel susceptibility genes for idiopathic  PD, we are using the âgenomic convergenceâ approach with microR   NA profiling. This strategy converges data from whole genome link   age studies with expression profiling experiments to determine which candidate genes to test in family based association studies . We are  currently conducting microRNA expression profiles in peripheral blood  mononuclear cells of 20 PD patients and 20 controls using microarrays spotted with probes for 452 human microRNAs . The microRNAs dif   ferentially expressed and respective target genes mapping to linkage  peaks will later be tested for allelic, haplotypic and genotypic associa  tion with PD .

In addition LRRK2 also contains a WD40 and  a leucine rich repeat domain, as well as a predicted tyrosine kinase catalytic domain . A yeast two hybrid was performed to help elucidate  the function of LRRK2 . LRRK2 was found to interact with fasciculation and elongation factor  zeta 2 (FEZ2), a mammalian orthologue of the Caenorhabditis elegans  UNC 76 protein, which is involved in the axonal outgrowth and synap   tic organization . FEZ2 is ubiquitously expressed in mammalian tissues  with the majority of information about its function being inferred from  studies of its homolog, FEZ1 . FEZ1 appears to be involved in neuri   togenesis upon phosphorylation by PKCÎ¶. Knockout of UNC 76 from C elegans leads to locomotion and axonal transport defects . Given the  role of FEZ1 in axonal outgrowth and normal synaptic function, FEZ2  and LRRK2 may co operate in maintaining SN neuritic length and branching, and makes FEZ2 a good functional interactor for LRRK2 . In  support of this hypothesis, recent evidence has suggested that LRRK2 plays a role in maintaining neuronal morphology in vitro and in vivo .",2008

It is characterized  by a deficiency of porphobilinogen deaminase (PBGD, EC 4.3.1.8), the third enzyme in heme biosynthesis . Expression of the disease is highly  variable, determined in part by environmental, metabolic and hormonal factors . Clinical expression of AIP is associated with an acute neuro   logic syndrome, which includes both neuropsychiatric symptoms and neurodegenerative changes . Autonomic neuropathy may underlie se   vere abdominal pain, the most typical symptom of acute attack . Por   phobilinogen deaminase is monomeric protein with a single catalytic  active site and is organized in three domains approximately equal in size . Several crystallographic structures of PBGD from E . coli have been determined . To establish the effects of newly found mutations on the protein struc   ture of PBGD, we expressed mutant constructs with the described mu   tations in E . coli, and we analyzed their biochemical and enzymatic  properties. All purified enzymes carrying causative mutations had rela   tive activities dramatically decreased according to the average level expressed by the normal allele .E . coli and human PBGD amino acid sequences have 35% homology  and more than 70 % similarity, and considering this fact, it is possible  to extrapolate structure/function relationships for human mutations leading to simple amino acid substitution based on comparative E . coli/human analyses . These analyses together with the kinetic stud   ies of existing mutations can help predict the impact on the enzyme  function in the living organism and further improve our understanding  in this field.

These processes are important in early development and may be dis   turbed by mutations in mtDNA, thereby leading to spontaneous mis   carriage . Phenotype causing mutations are usually heteroplasmic and  cause a phenotype when the proportion of mutant mtDNA increases beyond a threshold . This proportion can shift at cell division/when in   herited and therefore the phenotype often shows remarkable variation within a family  . Accordingly, such a shift can occur from a mother with  mild or no phenotype to an embryo with significant enrichment of mu   tated mtDNA causing fetal demise and possibly recurrent miscarriage (RM) . To study the role of mtDNA mutations in RM we screened 48 women  with RM for mitochondrial mutations using dHPLC, a sensitive method which can detect ~5% heteroplasmy  . So far, 10 different heteroplasmic  variations have been detected . By screening placental samples avail   able from 3 women with different variations we have been able to show  that the variations have been inherited by the fetus, and are in some  cases present in a higher proportion of mtDNAs in the fetus compared to the mother  . So far, we have been able to determine the exact se   quence change of three variations . Two changes are previously re   ported in the Mitomap database as normal variations . One variation  is not reported in the database and is predicted to be a synonymous  change in the mtND6 gene. Futher studies are ongoing to define the  remaining variations to determine if the variations may be the actual cause of miscarriages .",2008

Genetica Medica, Bologna, Italy, 2Bio3/Bioinformatics and Molecular  Genetics, Albert Ludwigs University of Freiburg, Freiburg, Germany. ","RET encodes a tyrosine kinase receptor mainly expressed in neural crest derived and urogenital cells . Two major isoforms of RET are pro   duced by alternative splicing: RET51 and RET9 . Mutations of RET protooncogene have been associated with both neo   plasia (MEN2A, MEN2B and FMTC) and Hirschsprung disease . The precise role of RET in the maturation of the periferic nervous sys   tem, in kidney morphogenesis and in spermatogenesis has been esta   bilished . RET is responsive to signals induced by neurotrophic factors of the GDNF family ligands .Recent studies have shown that RET binds the neurotrophin NGF  .  This suggests a functional role of RET in the Central Nervous System (CNS) . Nonetheless, no signaling pathway involving RET is known in  the CNS . Hence we developed a strategy aimed at identifying novel in   teractors that may help us to reconstruct the pathway connecting RET  and NGF  . To accomplish this task, we applied to RET51 the technique  of the yeast two hybrid split ubiquitin system, that allows detection of interacting molecules belonging to the cytoplasm and the membrane . A first screening for RET 51 interactors has revealed 10 candidates. Among these we focused on a neurotrophic factor  . Validation of the  interaction was carried out through a co immunoprecipitation assay in HEK293 cells . We either ascertained that this interaction occurs via a  specific amino acid residue activated after binding of NGF. On the basis of these preliminary results, we are currently testing the  hypothesis that RET 51 might have a central role in the growth and the trophism of CNS cells .",2008

","Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP) is a highly heterogeneous genetic disease, where more than 30 causative genes have been already reported . RP  is characterised by progressive retinal neurodegeneration due to pho   toreceptor apoptosis. Our group identified a previously unannotated  gene, CERKL, as responsible for this disease in 3 different spanish families . CERKL encodes a pressumptive lipid kinase that shares simi   larity to the human ceramide kinase . Ceramides are sphingolipids, a  group of membrane lipids that have been increasingly involved in the  regulation of relevant cellular and physiological processes, such as  cell growth, differentiation, apoptosis and inflammation. Therefore, we  hypothesised that CERKL would play a key role in controlling pho   toreceptor survival/death . Overexpression of the CERKL enzyme in  transiently transfected cultured cells clearly protects cells from apop   tosis under oxidative stress conditions . This protection starts as early  as 4 hours, but becomes more prominent at 24 hours post treatment, where apoptosis is reduced two fold by CERKL expression . We are now actively searching for its retinal substrate . Our in vitro and in vivo  preliminary results do not support that ceramide/s are the direct sub   strate for this enzyme . Subcellular localisation of CERKL shows that  it is associated to membranes, such as endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi  and Trans Golgi vesicles, although it can also be found in the nucleus  in some cells, pointing to shifts in localisation depending on the cel   lular state . Dissecting the function of CERKL will provide new clues  on the sphingolipid role on photoreceptors and unveil new targets for therapeutical approaches .",2008

Retinitis pigmentosa, the most  common hereditary cause of blindness, comprises a clinically and ge   netically heterogeneous group of retinal disorders . It affects about one  in 5 000 individuals worldwide Methods: 37 patients with adRP confirmed by pedigrees were ex   amined clinically and with visual function tests . The 5 exons of RHO  and 3 exons of RDS genes  were analyzed for sequence changes by  single strand conformation polymorphism analysis (SSCP) and further sequencing . Results: We detected known mutation Pro347Leu, novel mutation Arg   252Pro and two polymorphisms IVS1+10g>a, IVS3+4c>t in RHO gene . There were statistically significant differences in allele and genotype  frequencies of sequence change IVS3+4c>t of RHO gene in affected patients with adRP and in controls . According to our data, this poly   morphism might be pathogenic . Recently were reported 16 possible  combinations of the exon 3 RDS gene four SNPs and detected four  from 16 possible combinations (minihaplotypes): G1147A1166G1250C1291  (I), C1147A1166A1250C1291 (II), C1147G1166A1250C1291 (III) and G1147A1166G1250T1291  (IV) . Sequencing results for variant positions in exon 3 RDS gene in  adRP patients from Volga Ural region revealed all four minihaplotypes  described above and minihaplotype C1147A1166A1250T1291 (V) . Minihaplo   type C1147A1166A1250C1291 (II) was revealed only in patients and it might  be linked with RP  .

We used RNA interference  (RNAi) to down regulate steady state level of Cox5a subunit and ana   lyzed impact of its knock down on COX assembly  . We constructed seven derivatives of pCMV GIN ZEO plasmid coding for hairpins aimed at different positions of COX5A mRNA . A Cox5a pro   tein has a long half life (a level of the protein is 48 hours post nucleo   fection unchanged using immunoblotting) . Therefore we introduced  COX5A coding sequence into the maxFP Red   N plasmid to encode fusion protein . The marker plasmid was co transfected with RNAi  mediating plasmid derivatives (the higher the level of fusion protein the higher the leakage of individual hairpin mediated RISC systems) .  A fluorescence of fusion protein was found rapidly lower compared  to maxFPRed marker thereby complicating a setting of FACS mea   surements, but Western Blot of fusion protein with COX5A antibody gave an acceptable result . To optimize the detection of RNAi poten   tial through fluorescence by FACS, we re cloned COX5A coding se   quence into 3Â´UTR of maxFPRed marker. The final transcript contains  target sequence for RNAi but leads to translation of merely maxFPRed marker  . Fluorescence intensities were comparable with that obtained  at empty plasmid . Based on the above mentioned methods, we chose three candidate  shRNAs and prepared stable cell lines, where depletion of Cox5a was  confirmed using SDS immunoblotting. Also specific activity of COX was revealed decreased . BN PAGE showed diminished level of COX holoenzyme and its assembly intermediates . Supported by GACR 305/08/H037 and GAUK 1/2006/R .",2008

Certain RYR1 related disorders may exhibit both autosomal dominant  and recessive modes of inheritance; it is not always certain whether we  are searching for one or two mutations. The identification of missense  changes of unknown pathological significance complicates this. Our mutation screening is further complicated due to the marked phe   notypic variability: mutations in RYR1 can manifest in a wide range  of clinical phenotypes whilst similar phenotypes may result from mu   tations in a number of different genes excluding RYR1 .

SCA10 was first described in Mexi   can families with ataxia and seizures . We have previously described  an expansion of the ATTCT repeat in two Brazilian families presenting ataxia without seizures . We found reduced penetrance alleles of 360  370 repeats, in elderly asymptomatic subjects . To investigate a previous hypothesis of interruptions in the (ATTCT)n  tract, functioning as a disease modifier, we assessed the interruption  in another family with ataxia and seizures, and more than 2000 ATTCT  units . By a modified PCR technique, an abnormal discontinuous ladder, ex   ceeding the range observed for normal alleles, was detected in this  Brazilian family, presenting progressive cerebellar ataxia with associ   ated seizures and onset during or after the 3rd decade . This suggested  the presence of interruptions within the ATTCT expansion. Modified  PCR products of patients showing an interrupted pattern were aga   rose gel purified and cloned with TOPO TA cloning kit for sequencing analysis and determination of the interrupted motif . In this family, the ATTCT repeat seems to be interrupted by a large  stretch, unrelated to the repeat sequence, and patients show progres   sive cerebellar ataxia with associated seizures . In contrast, the previ   ous SCA10 families identified by us, showed cerebellar ataxia without seizures, caused by the expansion of uninterrupted ATTCT tracts . This  newly identified family reinforces the hypothesis that interruptions in  the (ATTCT)n tract function as a disease modifier.",2008

We have pre   viously shown that the expanded CAG repeat in SCA3 is prone to  1  ribosomal frameshifting, leading to the production and aggregation of proteins containing polyalanine stretches . These frameshifted mol   ecules confer increased toxicity to cells when compared to constructs  containing expanded CAA repeats, which code for polyglutamine in the main frame but lack the ability to frameshift into an alanine frame . An   isomycin (a ribosome interacting antibiotic that reduces  1 frameshift   ing) decreases frameshifting in expanded CAG tracts and ameliorates the cellular toxic phenotype . Aims: To model expCAG repeat  1 frameshifting in vivo ; to assess the  contribution of  1 frameshifting to expCAG toxicity in the fly. Methods: Full length ATXN3  Drosophila  transgenic lines carrying ei   ther wtCAG, expCAG or expCAA constructs containing epitope tags in  the three possible reading frames were generated and comparatively analysed . Results: We show that: (1) transgenic expression of expCAG ATXN3   constructs is deleterious in the fly; (2) transgenic expression of exp  CAA ATXN3  constructs, despite adequate levels of protein expression,  is not toxic; (3)  1 frameshifting occurs in Drosophila  and is restricted to  the expanded CAG transgenic lines . Conclusions: We propose that  1 ribosomal frameshifting is a major contributor to the toxicity observed in expanded CAG repeat diseases .

","Introduction . Sotos syndrome (SS) is a rare genetic condition char   acterized by overgrowth, macrocephaly, large forehead, large hands  and feet, accelerated bone age, typical gestalt, mental retardation of variable degree and a slight predisposition to develop tumours . This  condition is due to an abnormality of the NSD1  gene caused by dele   tions or spontaneous mutations .Material and methods . From November 2003 to November 2007, we  evaluated 215 patients with presumed diagnosis of SS, referred to the Spanish Overgrowth Syndrome Registry  . The patients were evaluated  in their local hospitals and referred by geneticists, paediatricians, neu   rologists and other health professionals . An initial study by microsatel   lite genotyping, a MLPA specific for the NSD1  critical region and neigh   bouring genes and analysis of the coding regions of NSD1  by dHPLC  and/or bi directional direct sequencing were made in all of them . Results . We completed all the studies in 186 out of the 215 patients  referred . One hundred and twelve presented complete clinical data or  a clear phenotype of SS, evaluated by 2 clinical geneticists trained in SS patients . We found 76 genetic alterations, 17 of them  NSD1 dele  tions and 59 point mutations; a detection rate of about 68% . Some of  these mutations are novel and others are recurrent . Comments . The detection rate of mutations in patients with clear clini   cal neurobehavioural phenotype of SS is nearly 70%. Our figures are  similar to that reported in other series. The finding of several recurrent  mutations suggests that there are âhot spotsâ in NSD1 , meaning com   mon molecular mechanisms responsible for the disease .",2008

We have previ   ously demonstrated that this expanded CAG tract is subject to  1 ribo   somal frameshifting into the alanine frame, which seems to confer an  increased toxicity, and that the antibiotic anisomycin reduces both  1 frameshifting and cell toxicity  . Currently, dual tagged  ATXN3  reporter  constructs were created to express DsRED in the main (glutamine)  frame and EGFP in the  1 (alanine) reading frame, and these reporter  constructs contained either 14 CAG repeats, 89 CAG repeats, or 92 CAA repeats . Constructs were transfected into COS 1 cells as well as  mouse cortical organotypic slice culture preparations, and were moni   tored for the production of red or green fluorescence signals using  time lapse live cell two wave fluorescent microscopy. Employing this  technique, we have confirmed the occurrence of  1 frameshifting for  the CAG89 construct, whereas the constructs bearing wild type CAG  or expanded CAA repeats did not show significant frameshifting. We  also determined that there is a marked time delay between the onset of  glutamine containing protein expression and the production of frame   shifted species, as well as a correlation between frameshifitng and cell  death. These findings argue in favour of local glutamine codon starva   tion, followed by a shift in the reading frame to resume translation of  the protein in the alanine frame and seem to confirm the implication of  1 ribosomal frameshifting in the pathogenesis of SCA3 .",2008

The frameshift mutation (p .Phe36fs44) was found in the exon 1 of  WASP  gene in heterozy   gosity  . Also, the prenatal diagnosis of Wiskott Aldrich syndrome was  carried out for this family  . In the second case the missense mutation  (p .Asp224Gly) was found in the exon 7 . Probandâs mother was hetero   zygous for the mutation . In the third and fourth families the splice site  mutations were found in the intron 8 of WASP  gene   IVS 8 + 1nt G â  C and IVS 8 + 1nt G â A, respectively. Probands mothers were het   erozygous for found mutations . Also, in the last case probandâs brother  had the same mutation and maternal aunt and grandmother were non carriers of this mutation .One novel mutation p .Asp224Gly was found in this molecular inves   tigation, the others have been reported .

We  report the results of one case that showed atypical melting curves in the LightCycler analysis . The patient was a 53 year old man with cerebral ischemia diagnosed by computed tomography  . A genetic analysis showed that he was het   erozygote for the prothrombin G20210A mutation and showed atypi   cal melting curves when the C46T polymorphism was analyzed . The  family study revealed that his father, his sisters and one son were also  carriers of the G20210A and they showed the same atypical melting curves for C46T  . Subsequent sequencing revealed a G47A heterozy   gous variant . This variant was not detected in 250 healthy controls indicating that this variant is extremely rare . Although the G47A variant is rare, its position adjacent to the C46T  polymorphism imposes some diagnostic limitations in that C46T might be undetectable . In addition individuals with C46T exhibit low levels of  FXII because this variant generates an alternative initial methionine  and as consequence a stop codon resulting in the synthesis of a pre   mature protein . The presence of both, G47A and C46T in such close  positions prevents the generation of an alternative methionine and consequently cancels the effect of C46T  .

Several genetic variants in the coding region of  the TPH2  gene have been reported but, thus far, only few of them have  been functionally characterized . Here we present functional analysis of  the THP2  variants L36Q, P206S, P312P, A328V and D479E . The enzyme variants were heterologously expressed in PC12 and HEK293 cells . Enzyme activity of the protein variants was assessed as  amount of intracellular serotonin or 5 hydroxy tryptophan measured by HPLC . The expression rates were controlled by qRT PCR and West   ern blot . The 328V variant showed significantly decreased activity both in PC 12 (only 28% of the wild type activity, P<0 .002 Mann Whitney U test) and HEK293 cells (16%, P<0 .05) . The P206S substitution led to de   crease of the TPH2 activity in HEK293 cells (32%, p<0 .05), but not in  PC 12 cells . The L36Q and D479E substitutions showed no effect on  the enzyme activity in both cells tested . The common silent variant P312P did not effect enzyme expression or activity  . Furthermore, no  effect of the P312P variant on the TPH2  splicing could be shown in an  exon trapping assay  .

Introduction: Usher syndrome (USH) is an autosomal recessive ge   netic disease defined by the association of sensorineural hearing loss  and visual impairment due to retinitis pimentosa (RP), with or without vestibular affectation . USH is clinically and genetically heterogeneous .  Nine genes have been identified which codify for proteins that are in   tegrated in a protein network known as Usher interactome . The central  core of the interactome is formed by the PDZ domain containing homo   logues harmonin and whirlin with the rest of USH proteins assembling Molecular and biochemical basis of disease to this core . Additional interacting proteins assembling to the USH pro   tein network are candidates to be responsible for Usher syndrome,  non syndromic hearing loss or retinal dystrophies . Hypothesis: The protein product predicted for PDZK7 (NM_024895)  shows high homology to both harmonin and whirlin and could have a similar function . Thus, it is a candidate member for the Usher interac   tome . Objective: The aim of the present work was to determine the exis   tence of interactions between PDZK7 and the proteins of the Usher  interactome: usherin, NBC3, VLGR1, cadherin 23, protocadherin 15 and SANS . Methods: Interactions were tested by yeast two hybrid (Y2H) assays and by co expression and co  localization in cos 1 cells studies . Results: No interaction was found between PDZK7 and USH pro   teins . Conclusions: The absence of interactions between PDZK7 and USH proteins indicates that it is not part of the USH interactome .",2008

Affected patients show moderate to severe hearing loss (HL) and vari   able evolution of RP  . Typical USH2 audiograms have a gently down  sloping configuration from moderate in the low frequencies to severe  or profound in the high frequencies . High variability is recognised and  clinical diagnosis of USH2 can be missed suggesting that USH2 is likely to be more frequent than estimated .

Some  dominant mutations of the same WFS1  gene have been associated  with nonsyndromic deafness, preferentially affecting low frequencies (DFNA6/14/38) . Unlike the Wolframâs mutations, the dominant muta   tions are essentially located in the exon 8 of the WFS1  gene . Methods: We have analysed exon 8 of the WFS1  gene in a cohort of  64 unrelated individuals affected by nonsyndromic hearing loss (HL) .  23 individuals presented with an ascending audiometric curve and 41 presented with a U shape curve . Results: In four different families, we identified a heterozygous muta   tion: c .923C>G (p .Ser308Cys), c .1079G>A (p .Cys360Tyr), c .2141A>G (p .Asn714Ser) and c .2421C>A (p .Ser807Arg) . These new  WFS1  vari  ations segregate perfectly with the HL, are missense mutations affect   ing highly conserved residues, and are absent from 100 control DNA samples . These 4 French families are affected with isolated autosomal dominant HL . In a same family, a mutation can cause an HL characterised by  an ascending curve or a U shape curve, and evolution between these two shapes has been observed . The exhaustive audiological and  clinical examination of the 17 affected patients allowed us to precise DFNA6/14/38 phenotype . Conclusion: The molecular screening of WFS1  gene is useful for pa   tients presenting with sporadic or familial non syndromic hearing loss, with an ascending or U shape audiometric curve . Moreover, our study  leads to clarify the spectrum of WFS1  mutations and the related phe   notype in non syndromic hearing impairment DFNA6/14/38 .",2008

Due to the dual  role of XPB and absence of animal  models, the underlying molecular mechanisms of XPB XPCS have  remained obscure. Here, with the first Xpb mouse models we demon   strate that severe alterations in Xpb are lethal, providing explanation to the relative scarcity of XPB associated disease . Furthermore, we show  that knock in mice with an XPCS patient derived XPB mutation mimic  the UV sensitivity typical for XP, but fail to show CS features and age normally  . However, further ablation of DNA repair capacity by cross   ings the Xpb mutant mice to other NER mutants causes appearance  of CS like features such as premature aging and increase in cellular  sensitivity to chronic oxidative stress, demonstrating the causative  role of DNA repair defect in the onset of XPB associated accelerated aging . The Xpb/Xpa double mutants display a novel NER phenotype,  with intermediate severity of ageing symptoms and remarkable inter animal variance . This large variance provides experimental evidence  to the hypothesis that stochastic DNA damage accumulation is an im   portant determinant of clinical variance in NER syndromes .

In the present study, we analyse, by PCR, heterodu   plex analysis and automatic sequencing, the full coding region and the  exon intron boundaries of the EDA gene in DNA from peripheral blood of one Spanish family with XLHED . We found an alteration in the EDA gene in two members of the studied family  . This alteration consists in a duplication of 2bp (c .974 975ins   GA) in the 5 exon that produces a change in the DNA sequence of col   lagen like domain rich in Gly X Y motifs . This domain is important for  multimerization of the protein . Furthermore this duplication produces a  truncation of the last exon that codes for a part of a TNF like domain,  which can affect the NF ÎºB and c Jun kinase pathway. The two affected members of the family show remarkable phenotypic  characteristics on skin, teeth, eyebrows, lips and head hear, but ag   gravated in one of them .

We generated a tamoxifen inducible, kidney epithelium specific Pkd1   deletion mouse model . Deletion of the Pkd1  gene in adult mice result   ed in a mild cystic phenotype . However, in newborn mice, this results  in massive cyst formation . In young mice, tubular cell proliferation still  takes place to elongate the nephron, in contrast to the adult kidney  .  Therefore, we hypothesized that renal injury followed by a tissue repair  response, including epithelial cell proliferation, accelerates cyst forma   tion in adult Pkd1  deletion mice . Inducible Pkd1  deletion mice were treated with the nephrotoxicant  DCVC upon Pkd1  gene inactivation . 10 14 weeks after DCVC treat   ment, renal function rapidly declined in DCVC treated Pkd1  deletion  mice, as determined by blood urea concentration .

","Disruption of circadian rhythms, including abnormalities of circadian  phase position and melatonin secretion, have been described in mood  disorders (MD) but the molecular mechanisms underlying their pathol   ogy are largely unknown . Arylalkylamine N acetyltransferase (AANAT)  is a key enzyme involved in circadian oscillations of melatonin levels .  In order to assess the possible contribution of AANAT gene variability  to the susceptibility to MD, we systematically investigated common and  rare variation in the AANAT gene through a sequential sequencing and  single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) based genotyping approach .  Our sample consists of 445 unrelated patients with MD (257 unipolar  major depressive disorder, 188 bipolar disorder) diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria and 440 screened control subjects . The entire cod   ing region, the exon intron boundaries, the promoter and 3âUTR of the  AANAT gene were directly sequenced in a subset of 360 MD patients by PCR, identifying 17 changes . Thirteen out of the 17 changes repre   sent novel sequence variations and four had been described before: rs3760138, rs4238989, rs4646261 and rs8150 . The novel and previ   ously reported variants in dbSNP public database were genotyped in  the rest of the MD sample and in the control sample using SNPlex ge   notyping system . Non rare variants (MAF>2%) were further included in  a case control association study. The results showed significant differ   ences in genotype distributions for two SNPs located in the promoter  region of AANAT gene (p,0.00006; p,0.004), which remained signifi   cant after correcting for multiple comparisons .

Methods . We investigated 241 unrelated, consecutively enrolled pa   tients with ischaemic stroke, 148 patients with coronary heart disease  (CHD) and 191 blood donors as healthy controls for allele frequencies  (AF) of four common ABCG8 polymorphisms (D19H, Y54C, T400K,  A632V) .Results . Linkage disequilibrium test revealed linkage between the re   spective neighbouring loci of ABCG8 . Estimated haplotype frequen   cies were similar for the three investigated groups (stroke or CHD patients and healthy controls) . AFs of the investigated polymorphisms  in patient groups showed no significant differences compared to con  trols . There was a tendency toward reduced YY54 genotype frequency  in the entire stroke group. Upon stratification by age at disease onset,  male stroke patients under the age of 50 (n,15) showed significantly reduced frequency of YY54 compared to control males (24 .2% vs .  41 .3%; OR:2 .205 [95%CI:1 .079 4 .504]; p,0 .0377) .

Of the genes identi   fied with variable expression between strains, one encodes a Beta 1,4  N acetyl galactosaminyl transferase (galgt1) . A galgt1 paralog, galgt2,  was identified as a modifier gene in a mouse model of another human bleeding disorder, von Willebrandâs disease(1) . By RT PCR, we found  that galgt1 expression increases in the liver of C57BL/6 mice from P0 to P30 . In contrast, galgt1 expression is low in FVB/N mice at birth and  declines with age. Using strain specific polymorphisms and sequenc   ing of RT PCR products, we determined the expression of C57BL/6 and FVB/N galgt1 alleles in livers from F1 hybrid mice . Both alleles  were expressed at P0, but only the C57BL/6 allele was detected at P30 . Using pyrosequencing, the FVB/N allele expression was 22 .8% at P0 and undetectable at P30 . We are investigating the genetic basis  for this differential allelic expression and whether it can explain strain  specific phenotypic variation in FGA /  mice.

","Understanding the genetic basis of multiple sclerosis (MS) remains a major challenge, despite decades of intensive researches . Whole  genome linkage studies were carried out in different populations and  from these analyses the prediction of at least 38 potential non MHC susceptibility regions emerged (Abdeen et al ., 2006) . Among these,  chromosomal portions of specific interest to some populations came  out: the region 2q14 in the Irish and English population (Heggarty et al ., 2003; Mann et al ., 2002), the region 2q36 in the Sardinians (Co   raddu et al, 2003) and the region 2p21 22 in Continental Italian popula   tion (Liguori et al ., 2003) . The main objective of this study was to investigate the role of 2q13 14 region in the pathogenesis of MS . The investigation was conducted on  120 patients, with clinically defined MS, and on 249 healthy subjects collected from the North Italian population .  Using CHROMSCAN (Ma  niatis et al, 2002, 2005) , a map in LD units, under the MalÃ©cot model  for multiple markers, was constructed . The block step structure of the  2q13 14 region was based on 70 SNPs (validated in the Caucasian  population) selected from the HapMap database, with rare variant fre   quencies higher than 10% and evenly covering a region of 1 .2 Mb within the segment 2q13 14 . We tested the association with the disease through both allelic as   sociation and by association mapping with the MalÃ©cot Model (Morton et al . 2007) . The present results support a possible association between this candi   date region and MS in the North Italian population .",2008

","Atherogenic dyslipidemia (AD), characterized by increased plasma  levels of triglycerides or combined hyperlipidemia (hypertriglyceride   mia and low plasma HDL level), is the most common in patients with type 2 diabetes (DM2) . Apolipoprotein (apo) A5 gene S19W polymor   phism has been shown to associate with increased plasma TG levels .  So, the goal of this study was to define types of AD in patients with  DM2 and to estimate the allele and genotype frequencies distribution of S19W APOA5 in groups of patients with different types of AD . A total  of 232 patients with DM2 (168 women and 64 men, mean age 57Â±7)  were classified as belonging to a group with isolated hypertriglyceride   mia (62 subjects), a group with isolated hypoalphalipoproteinemia (13  subjects), a group with combined hyperlipidemia (27 subjects) and a normolipidemic group (118 subjects) . APOA5 S19W genetic polymor   phism was studied using the PCR RFLP method . For statistical analy   sis of the allele and genotype frequencies distribution, the AD groups  were compared with a normolipidemic group using the chi squared test or the Fisherâs exact test . We found out the allele and genotype  frequencies in the group with isolated hypertriglyceridemia differed sig   nificantly from the same in the normolipidemic group (p< 0.001). At the  same time there was a statistically significant difference in allele and genotype frequencies between the patients with combined hyperlipid   emia and the normolipidemic group (p,0 .01) . The DM2 patients with  hypertriglyceridemia both isolated and combined have significantly  higher 19W allele frequency in comparison with normolipidemic group of patients with DM2 .",2008

This is partly due to  small family sizes and low consanguinity rates in industrialized societ   ies, both of which have hampered gene mapping and identification.  To shed more light on the causes of ARID and as a prerequisite for  diagnosis, counselling and therapy, we have set out in 2003 to perform  systematic clinical and molecular studies in large consanguineous Ira   nian families with several mentally retarded children . This has already  led us to the discovery of 12 novel ARID loci, eight of which had a  LOD score above three, and in one of them we were recently able to identify a mutation in GRIK2 . Contrary to previous observations which  prima facie argued against the existence of frequently mutated genes,  investigations in our expanding cohort of more than 200 families have  now led to the identification of three loci (on chromosomes 1, 5 and  19), that show overlapping autozygosity regions of three, four and six families, respectively  . At each of these loci a minimum of two overlap   ping linkage intervals were solitary in the respective family and showed  a significant LOD score of or above three. Mutation screening in order  to elucidate the underlying gene defects is ongoing and likely to reveal frequent ARID genes . The outcome of our project will broaden the ba   sis for genetic counselling and provide insight into the molecular basis of brain function .",2008

The 5,10 methylentetrahydrofolate reductase gene (MTHFR) is considered to be an important candidate gene of MDD . A single  base mutation C677T results in production of a mildly dysfunctional thermolabile enzyme . The MTHFR 677T/T genotype and, to a lesser  extent the 677C/T genotype, is associated with a significant elevation  in the circulating concentrations of the homocystein and a decrease in  serum folate concentrations, which may be parallel a similar reduction  in 5 methyltetrahydrofolate in CNS and may lead to reduction in mono   amine neurotransmitter function and greater risk of UD . This study  examined association of the MTHFR gene C677T polymorphism with UD in Russian and Tatar patients .

Processing of pro   filaggrin to biologically active filaggrin monomers involves several de   phosphorylation and proteolytic steps, and their impairment might also  disturb skin barrier function . Among the proteases suggested to be  implicated in profilaggrin processing is the stratum corneum chymo   tryptic enzyme (SCCE), which is possibly regulated by SPINK5  de  rived serine proteinase inhibitor LEKTI. An insertion in the 3â² untrans   lated region of the kallikrein 7 gene ( KLK7 ) encoding SCCE as well as  a SPINK5  variant have been reported to be associated with AE, but  could not be replicated so far  . In our study we aimed at clarifying the role of these genetic variants for  AE.

Association analysis was carried out in a cohort of 486 German fami   lies as well as in a cohort of 773 cases and 2924 supernormal controls .  Whereas the strong effect of FLG polymorphisms was confirmed, no  association of the KLK7  insertion could be detected .

Intriguing observations,  such as increased BDNF levels in autistic children and NTRK2  muta   tions in children with developmental delays, raise the hypothesis that  an abnormal function/expression of NTRK2  might be involved in au   tism . 38 tag SNPs, spanning the NTRK2  gene, were tested for as   sociation with autism in 323 Portuguese trios.

We recently found that a SNP  (rs17822931) of the ABCC11 gene is the determinant of the earwax  types . In the present study, a total of 79 individuals with axillary os   midrosis (AO), who received a surgical operation to remove bilateral  axillary apocrine glands, were examined for their earwax types by ge   notyping at the rs17822931 polymorphic locus . The earwax type fre   quency among them was compared with that in the general Japanese population . The result showed a strong association between AO and the wet earwax type (c2 , 90 .00, p < 2 .5x10 21) . In addition, immu   nohistochemical study of the axillary and ceruminous apocrine gland  tissues using an anti ABCC11 protein antibody revealed that ABCC11  is strongly expressed and localized in the apical membrane of the both gland cells . The result indicates that ABCC11 protein (MRP8) functions  in the axillary apocrine gland as well as in the ceruminous gland, and supports the association between axillary odor and earwax type .",2008

S2G (Syndrome to Gene): Novel software for the identification of  genes associated with human genetic syndromes,P06.040,"A. Gefen , R. Cohen, O. S. Birk","National Institute for Biotechnology in the Negev, Beer sheva, Israel","The identification of genomic loci associated with human genetic syn   dromes has been significantly facilitated through the generation of  high density SNP arrays. However, the identification of the specific dis   ease associated genes within such loci is still a tedious labor intensive  bottleneck. Optimal selection of candidate genes from within a defined  genomic locus is a crucial step in the process . We have generated novel software that selects optimal candidate genes, using a two step procedure . For any given syndrome, the soft   ware seeks all genes associated with syndromes containing similar phenotypes . It then searches through the entire human genome for  other genes that are associated with these reference genes . This  search takes into account interacting biochemical pathways, protein  protein interactions, transcription factor cascades, etc . A gene list is  generated with an order of priority (degree of possible interaction with  the reference gene(s)). This list is then filtered for the specific genomic  locus in question   and a prioritized list of candidate genes is gener   ated . S2G can be used also in clinical genetics: when S2G gets a query  for related syndromes of a given one, the score vector of the given  syndrome is sorted creating a list of syndromes starting with the clos   est related syndrome . The result of the query is a list of syndromes  with their known causing genes, so one can view and explore which  genes are associated with similar phenotypes to those of the query syndrome .",2008

There is consistent evidence for an association  of the DTNBP1 gene with schizophrenia, and thus this gene has also become a focus of further investigation in bipolar disorder (BD) . Methods: The aim of our study is to explore the association of DTNBP1  gene with BD and with a sub phenotype such as presence/ absence  of psychotic symptoms in a sample of 465 patients with BD (ICD10/ DSMIV) and 478 ethnically matched control subjects recruited from the UK . Seven SNPs of the DTNBP1: rs2743852 (SNP C), rs760761  (P1320), rs1011313 (P1325), rs3213207 (P1635), rs2619539 (P1655),  rs16876571 and rs17470454 were investigated using SNPlex geno   typing system . Results: We report significant differences in genotypic and allelic fre   quencies of rs3213207 and rs760761 of DTNBP1 gene between the bipolar patients and controls . We also show a global haplotypic as   sociation and an association of a specific haplotype within this gene with BD . Conclusions: Our results are consistent with previous studies in term  of a general association between the dysbindin gene and bipolar dis   order and provide additional molecular genetic evidence that a portion  of the genotypic overlap between schizophrenia and bipolar affective disorder is attributable to this gene .

Panic attacks are anxiety related phenomena defined as discrete pe   riods of abruptly escalating intense fear or discomfort with multiple somatic and cognitive symptoms . Panic induction or challenge tests  in healthy subjects provide certain advantages in the investigation of genetic mechanisms of panic . Understanding why some, but not  all, healthy subjects demonstrate panic response to a challenge test  may advance knowledge about the pathogenesis of panic attacks and panic disorder  . In the present study we used the Illumina Human 6 v2 Beadchips for  whole genome expression profiling in healthy subjects (n,31) partici   pating in a cholecystokinin tetrapeptide (CCK 4) challenge test . We  aimed to explore the association between gene expression signatures,  the occurrence of panic attacks, and the influence of the CCK 4 chal   lenge on peripheral transcriptional activity  . The results showed that, after summarizing gene expression profiles  before and after CCK 4 provocation, 16 genes were differently ex   pressed between panickers and non panickers (p<0 .05) . Considering  the higher susceptibility to panic attacks in females, we also performed separate analyses by gender  . The transcriptional levels of 8 genes  distinguished female panickers from female non panickers . In males,  17 genes differed between panickers and non panickers . Comparison  of gene expression profiles in males and females revealed 5 genes  expressed differently between genders.

We have investigated five microsattelite markers D2S292 in TGFA  gene, D14S61 in TGFB3 gene, D15S97 in GABRB3 gene, D17S1335  in RARA gene and BCL3 in BCL3 gene in 120 triads (child with non   syndromic CL+/ CP and both parents)   102 triads with a child with  nonsyndromic cleft lip with or without cleft palate (NS CL+/ P) and 18  triads with a child with nonsyndromic cleft palate only (NS CPO) . As   sociation analysis was performed by using transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) . Allele wise and genotype wise analysis gave no statistically significant results (p>0 .05) .

The func   tional activity of P glycoprotein is under genetic control by the Multi Drug Resistance 1 (MDR 1) gene . If genetic variations of MDR 1 con   tribute to variability in clopidogrel response in patients with coronary artery disease remains poorly explored . Methods: The C1236T (rs1128503) polymorphism of the MDR 1 gene was assessed in 62 patients . Patients were divided into 2 groups: car   riers and non carriers of the T allele . Platelet aggregation was per   formed before and 24 hours after clopidogrel administration . Standard  (300mg; n,45) and high (600mg: n,17) loading dose regimens were used . All patients were on treatment with aspirin (100mg/day) . Peak  platelet aggregation was assessed by LTA using 6 Î¼mol/L ADP stimuli.  Post treatment platelet reactivity and percentage inhibition of platelet aggregation (IPA) were determined . Results: 71% and 29% of the study population were T and non T allele carriers, respectively  . At baseline, there were no differences in platelet  aggregation between the two groups . At 24 hours there were no dif   ferences in post treatment platelet reactivity between groups follow   ing a 300mg loading dose administration . However, following a 600mg  loading dose administration, post treatment platelet reactivity was sig   nificantly higher in T allele carriers (35Â±11% vs 16Â±3%; p,0.006). Ac   cordingly, there were no differences in IPA following a 300mg dose and  IPA was significantly lower in T allele carriers following a 600mg dose (44Â±18% vs 73Â±5%, p,0 .001) .

Tolerance,  sensitization, craving and abstinence are common features in drug  addiction, and may be related to neuronal processes such as plastic   ity and remodeling . Animal and pharmacological studies suggest that  neurotrophins may play an important role in cocaine addiction through their effect on these processes . To evaluate the contribution of the  Brain Derived Neurotrophic Factor (BDNF) and its specific receptor  Neurotrophic Tyrosine Kinase Receptor 2 (NTRK2) we genotyped two  SNPs in the BDNF  gene and three SNPs in the NTRK2 gene in a  Spanish sample of 91 cocaine dependent patients and 91 sex and age matched healthy controls .

","Ullrich Congenital Muscular Dystrophy (UCMD) and the milder Beth   lem Myopathy (BM) are caused by mutations in COL6A1, COL6A2 and COL6A3 which collectively are comprised of 106 coding exons .  Neither phenotypic nor immunohistochemical analyses are able to pin   point which of these genes to target for mutation screening . We have established a diagnostic mutation screening service for these  three genes based on sequencing cDNA derived from fibroblast cul   tures . This requires only 26 overlapping cDNA fragments, compared  with over 100 fragments needed to cover the genes using genomic sequencing . Mutations have been detected in 14 out of an initial cohort of 16 pa   tients; this 87 .5% detection rate compares favourably with the 62%  detection reported in Lampe et al . This higher rate of detection can  be partly attributed to the sequential use of clinical and immunohisto   chemical screening prior to molecular analysis and partly to the RNA  based approach . In particular a change ten bases from the start of  the exon in COL6A2 (c .1117 10A>G) is likely to be responsible for the  splicing out of exon 13 in one patient, and in a second patient an ab   sence of exon 10 at the cDNA level of the same gene has as yet no  confirmed mechanism at the DNA level. Surprisingly eight patients with a UCMD phenotype, previously thought  of as a recessively inherited form, have a single mutation; this rein   forces current thinking that the two disorders represent either end of a  phenotypic spectrum .Lampe, A .

Using loci that are in LD decreases the accuracy of parentage assign   ments . Groups of SNPs in linkage disequilibrium (LD) were simulated to verify the effects of linkage on relatedness assignment . The prob   ability of genetic relatedness was computed using the single SNPs  and treating the SNPs as composite markers with different rÂ² threshold values . Haplotypes were probabilistically inferred using the PHASE and Gerbil programs . False positive rate and power were assessed by  simulation in unrelated individuals and in pedigrees . As an example of results, in order to estimate the support for II degree  relatedness with power 80%, and false positive rate 5%, the follow   ing was needed: 100 SNPs with no linkage; 275 SNPs having rÂ²,0 .4;  20 probabilistically inferred haplotypes (100 SNPs having rÂ²,0 .4); 40  probabilistically inferred haplotypes (200 SNPs having rÂ²,0 .8) .

Autosomal dominant laterality disorders are infre   quent and have only been reported in a few families . In this study, we analyzed a large three generation family with cardiac left isomerism . Methods and results We obtained phenotypic information, including physical examination,  electrocardiography, echocardiography and blood samples of 22 fam   ily members . Thirteen individuals had a cardiac anomaly, with consid   erable variation between patients . Cardiac anomalies considered to  be part of the  left isomerism spectrum were, among others, bilateral  left atrial appendages, septal defects, persistent left superior caval  vein and specific electrocardiographic disturbances compatible with absence of the sinoatrial node . Other heart defects were present as well . The condition was inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern .  Subsequent genome wide linkage analysis demonstrated linkage to  a single locus on chromosome 9q shared by all affected individuals, with a multipoint maximum LOD score of 2 .20 at marker D9S283 . The  shared locus was delineated by markers D9S167 and D9S1677, was 26 Mb in size and contained 218 genes . Sequence analysis of three  candidate genes in this region (Inversin, TGFBR1 and IPPK) revealed no mutations . Conclusions The mapping of a suggestive locus for this autosomal dominant lateral   ity disorder on chromosome 9q represents an important step toward the discovery of genes implied in laterality disorders .

Copy number variation (CNV) is likely to be a substantial source of  human genetic diversity, influencing the variable susceptibility to multi   factorial disorders . However, the relatively high cost and false positive  rate of genome wide methodologies have still precluded large scale association studies in patients and controls . Schizophrenia is a com   plex illness thought to be caused by a number of genetic and environ   mental effects, few of which have been clearly defined. We have used  a multiplex ligation PCR amplification based method to target previ   ously reported and putatively relevant gene containing CNV regions .  A total of 122 genes were studied in 451 schizophrenic patients and 304 matched controls for association studies . Most genotyped CNVs  (84%) showed very low (<1%) population frequency, while only few were common variants whose frequency did not differ between groups .  A few rare variants were only present in patients suggesting a possible  pathogenic involvement. We found two patients with amplification of two consecutive probes in 22q11 .23 that were further characterized . Both patients showed 1 .2 Mb overlapping duplications spanning 24  genes, being de novo  in the case for whom the parents were available .  A specific assay targeting this complex 22q11.23 region revealed two  additional CNVs significantly associated with increased risk for schizo   phrenia, the duplication of the DDT gene and the positive genotypes  of the GSTT2  gene (Fisher, p<0 .01) . Our data provide complemen   tary evidence for chromosome 22q11 .23 as a susceptibility locus for  schizophrenia, and suggest that CNV within this region may influence risk .",2008

A  number of polymorhisms, including the insertion (I) or deletion (D) of a  287 bp Alu repeat sequence polymorhism of angiotensin I converting  enzyme (ACE) gene and a point mutation (C677T) of 5,10 methylene   tetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene have been implicated in the pathogenesis of CAD . We investigated ACE and MTHFR genotypes  in patients with angiographically documented CAD in Turkish popula   tion . Methods: 184 patients (aged between 23 72, mean 45 Â± 7 .5 years)  were included in the study  . DNAs from 89 patients with angiographi   cally proven CAD (age<45 for male, <55 for female) and 95 controls  without CAD were amplified. Results: The ACE genotype DD was present in 32 .6% of patients with CAD as compared to 37 .9% in the controls (p , 0 .45) . Genotype fre   quencies in all groups for II, ID and DD were: 21 .7%, 42 .9%, 35 .4% respectively  . The overall frequency of the MTHFR genotypes were  %70 .7 (CC), %22 .8 (CT) and %6 .5 (TT) . The MTHFR genotype TT was present in 4 .5% of patients with CAD as compared to 8 .4% in con   trols (p , 0.38). Subgroup analysis showed no significant differences between CAD and CAD free subjects . Also, the ACE DD and MTHFR  TT genotypes were not found more common in patients having multi   vessel CAD when compared to single vessel disease . Conclusion: I/D polymorphism of ACE gene and C677T polymorphism  of MTHFR gene are not independent risk factors for CAD in the studied Turkish population . Paraoxonase, PAI1 and e NOS polymorphism de   tections are in progress for these patients .",2008
Quantitative t rait mapping of signaling Pathways in Human  Primary cells,P06.066,"L. Cuninkova , S. A. Brown","Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, Zurich, Switzerland","Thousands of mammalian cell types each express a unique comple   ment of receptors, ion channels, and enzymes . Nevertheless, the sig   naling pathways that transduce outside signals to the transcriptional machinery in these cells remain exquisitely conserved . Their down   stream effector molecules are generally regulated by phosphorylation,  and bind to conserved elements in hundreds of promoters to control a variety of processes . Such elements include CRE boxes, bound by  CREB to mediate adenyl cyclase dependent transcription; SRE boxes,  bound by SRF to mediate JNK  and ERK family MAP kinase depen   dent transcription; and E boxes, which are bound by CLOCK:BMAL1 heterodimers to mediate circadian transcription . We are generating a  series of viral reporters for these pathways that are capable of infecting human primary cell cultures . The signals from these reporters can be  used as quantitative traits in association and linkage studies to iden   tify human modifier loci for these pathways. For example, using an E  box reporter, we have been able to explore the molecular properties  of the circadian clock in people of early and late chronotype (âlarksâ and âowlsâ) . We hope to use these cellular assays to map the genes  that determine human differences in a variety of difficult to access  behavioral phenotypes that might include daily behavior, mood, and memory  .",2008

The aim of this study was to evalu   ate the prevalence of CARD15 polymorphisms and their phenotypic correlation in Serbian patients with CD . 131 patients with well de   fined CD and 88 healthy controls were genotyped for three common polymorphisms (R702W, G908R and Leu1007insC) by PCR  RFLP  .  CARD15 variant was found in 46/131 (35 .11%) patients with CD and 13/88 (14 .77%) of healthy controls (p, 0 .001) . The frameshift polymor   phism (L1007fs) showed a significant association with CD (15.27%) compared to control group (0 .00%) (p<0 .0001) . The frequency of  R702W was remarkably higher in control group (14 .77%) and almost  equal to occurrence of this particular polymorphism in patients with  CD (20.63%). Polymorphism G908R was observed significantly more  frequent in patients with CD (5 .3%) than in control group (0 .00%) (p,0 .043) .

Rather than focusing on  a known genetic factor, we applied a new method to determine whether  or not a given exposure is susceptible to interact with unspecified ge   netic factors, using the degree of familial aggregation as a surrogate .  The Odds Recurrence Ratio ( ORR ) is an indirect measure of interac   tion since it contrasts recurrence risks in sibs of affected indexes when stratifying on the exposure of indexes .

The female genetic map was restricted to 21q .The distribution of chiasma shows a difference  throughout the length of chromosome arm(21q) with more recombina   tion towards telomeric end in comparison to control data . The telo   meric exchange is a significant risk factor for meiotic I nondisjunction, irrespective of the age of the mother  . Analysis of crossover events indi   cates that in younger mother (< 29) there was an increase in both zero  and one exchange events, suggesting reduction of recombination . The  linkage map of 21q(39.58cM) was significantly shorter than the control female linkage map, indicating an overall reduction of recombination .  Thus, reduced recombination may be responsible , at least in part, for the etiology of nondisjunction in trisomy 21 .",2008

There are two major forms of the dis   ease: Dyschromatosis symmetrica hereditaria (DSH), where the mac   ulae are restricted to the dorsal aspects of the extremities, and Dys   chromatosis universalis hereditaria (DUH), where patients are affected by a generalized distribution of the maculae over most of their body  .  Usually, both disorders show autosomal dominant inheritance, but in some cases autosomal recessive inheritance was reported . Autosomal dominant DSH was mapped to chromosome 1q21 .3, and mutations in  the ADAR   (DSRAD  ) gene were identified. A second dyschromatosis  locus was mapped on chromosome 6q24 .2 q25 .2, but the two ana   lyzed families, which were initially reported to be affected with DSH, were later suggested to have autosomal dominant DUH . Patients and methods: We investigated whether one of the two known  Dyschromatosis loci is involved in the development of DUH in a con   sanguineous family from Saudi Arabia (four siblings were affected, three siblings and the parents were unaffected) . Results: After confirmation that neither of the two known loci is linked  to the disease in this family, a SNP based genome wide linkage analy   sis was performed and a new locus for dyschromatosis was identified on chromosome 12q21 q23 . The candidate region (LOD score of 3 .4) contains 125 known or predicted genes .

We have previously performed a genome wide linkage study in a set of  psoriasis families and have identified a susceptibility locus on chromo   some 19p13 (PSORS6) . In a follow up linkage disequilibrium (LD) study  in an independent family based cohort, we found evidence for associa   tion to two newly discovered microsatellites at this locus (D19SPS20:  P < 2 .7*10 2, D19SPS21: P < 5 .3*10 5) . An association scan in 300  trios, based on the LD structure of the region, revealed association to  several single SNPs in one LD block. When we stratified this cohort for  carrying the PSORS1 risk allele at the HLA C locus on chromosome  6p, evidence for association became much stronger at single SNP and haplotype levels (p values between 2 .0*10  4 and 9 .0*10 4) . In a  population based replication study of 1,114 psoriasis patients and 937  control individuals, evidence for association was observed again after  stratification to the PSORS1 risk allele. In both study groups, logistic  regression showed evidence for interaction between the risk alleles at PSORS1 and PSORS6 . The associated LD block did not comprise any known genes . Interestingly, an adjacent gene,  MUC16 , coding for a  large glycosylated protein expressed in epithelia, could be shown to be  also expressed in tissues relevant for pathogenesis of psoriasis such  as skin and thymus. In summary, we confirmed and refined the sus   ceptibility locus at PSORS6 which seems to be restricted to patients with early onset psoriasis carrying the PSORS1 risk allele .",2008

In order to assess the genetic contribution of all known  recessive genes in EOPD in the Dutch population we investigated  the prevalence and nature of mutations in the PROPARK (PROfiling PARKinsonâs disease) patient cohort .  methods  A total of 186 unre   lated Dutch EOPD patients (mean age at onset: 41 .1 Â± 6 .6 years, 130  sporadic, 56 familial) with an age at onset (AAO) â¤ 50 years were stud   ied . The genetic screening was performed by direct sequencing and dosage analysis of the three genes .  Results  Mutations were found in  9% (16/186) of the patients however PD may be explained in only six  (3%) patients who carried homozygous or heterozygous compound  mutations in Parkin  (n,5) or DJ 1  (n,1) . No homozygous or compound  heterozygous mutations were detected in PINK1  gene . In addition, 6  (3%), 3 (2%) and 2 (1%) patients carried a single heterozygous muta   tion in Parkin , DJ 1  and PINK1  genes, respectively  . Interestingly, two novel mutations were found in one patient in heterozygous state but not in 700 ethnically matched control chromosomes . conclusions   Parkin  was the most frequently mutated gene in EOPD, followed by  DJ 1  and PINK1  . The low overall mutation frequency observed indi   cates that caution has to be taken with the extrapolation of mutation  frequencies found in other studies and populations and suggests that other genes and risk factors for PD remain to be discovered .",2008

Endometriosis is considered to be an estro   gen dependent disease with a genetic background . The aim of this  study was to evaluate possible associations between endometriosis  and polymorphisms in the estrogen receptor Î± ( ESR1 ) and Î² ( ESR2 )  genes . Materials and methods . 123 women (age: 18 44 years) with surgically  confirmed endometriosis were enrolled in the study. 200 fertile women  (at least two children; age: 30 50 years) from general population were  used as controls. The 397 T/C polymorphism in the first intron of the  ESR1  gene was determined by PCR RFLP analysis, using the restric   tion endonuclease PvuII.

AA is the precursor of a cascade of  mediators, such as eicosanoids, with inflammatory properties. Single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in FADS1 and FADS2 have been  associated with different levels of AA and LA, with possible functional consequences on desaturase activity  . Methods and Results: Thirteen FADS SNPs and AA/LA ratio on red  blood cell (RBC) membranes, a marker of desaturase activity, were  evaluated in 876 subjects with (n,610) or without (n,266) angiographi   cally documented coronary artery disease (CAD) . AA/LA ratio was higher in CAD patients (2 .17Â±0 .41 versus 1 .99Â±0 .36; P,2 .5Ã10 10),  and an increased AA/LA ratio resulted an independent risk factors for CAD (OR 2 .22, 95%CI 1 .37 3 .61 for higher versus lower ratio tertile) .  Furthermore, hs CRP levels increased progressively across AA/LA ra   tio tertiles . In a linear regression model including all the 13 SNPs anal   ysed, 4 resulted to be independent predictors of AA/LA ratio variability  .  The subjects carrying the highest number of alleles associated with a  raised ratio, as well as haplotypes with the highest number of such al   leles, presented proportionally more elevated hs CRP concentrations and an increased probability of having CAD . Conclusions: An increased desaturase activity is associated with an elevated hs CRP and, in turn, with an increased risk for CAD . Subjects  carrying FADS genotypes associated with an higher desaturase activ   ity may be prone to a proinflammatory response favouring atheroscle   rotic vascular damage .",2008

Abnormalities in FcÎ³R  mediated immune complex clearance could be involved in the disease  and polymorphisms of FcÎ³Rs  may affect the susceptibility and sever   ity of SLE . In this study, we have examined SNP rs1801274 and SNP  rs396991, two non synonymous variations coding for amino acids lo   cated in the extracellular domain of FcÎ³RIIa and FcÎ³RIIIa, respectively.  430 SLE patients and 387 healthy controls of Hong Kong Chinese were  genotyped for these two SNPs. The G allele of rs1801274 in FcÎ³RIIa  codes for R131, which was shown to have low binding affinity to IgG.  Our study found that the G/G genotype for this site was more frequent (14 .2%) in SLE patients in our population compared to healthy con   trols (10.1%). No significant difference was seen in FcÎ³RIIIa polymor   phisms in Hong Kong Chinese . We are planning more extensive stud   ies on this important locus and hypothesize that loss of balance among  the receptors with opposing functions in this locus may confer disease susceptibility to SLE in Hong Kong Chinese .",2008

It is well known that genetic factors play an impor   tant role in susceptibility to FS. Although specific genes that affect the  majority of FS cases have not yet been identified, genetic loci for FS  on chromosomes 8 (FEB1), 19 (FEB2), 2 (FEB3), 5 (FEB4), 6 (FEB5), and 18 (FEB6) have been reported recently  . However, the mode of  inheritance still remains unclear  . Polygenic, autosomal dominant and  autosomal recessive models have received support . Aim: Our aim was to investigate the mode of inheritance in familial FS, to conduct the linkage analysis to FEB1 (8q13 21) and FEB2 (19p13 .3)  loci in Serbian population and to investigate the correlation between  the specific locus and seizure type. Methods: We investigated ten nonconsanguinous families with at least  three members whose diagnosis of FS was established by the stan   dard diagnostic criteria . The mode of inheritance was determined by pedigree analysis . In order to investigate the linkage of FS to FEB1  and FEB2 loci we analyzed microsatellite markers D8S1840, D8S530, D19S209, D19S216, D19S591 . Alleles were determined after PCR  and gel electrophoresis and linkage was estimated by LOD score cal   culation . Results: In ten investigated families we found the autosomal domi   nant mode of inheritance with reduced penetrance . Linkage analysis  showed no significant correlation between febrile seizures and exam   ined loci in our sample . Maximum LOD score of 0 .98 at recombination  fraction of Î¸,0.00 was obtained at locus D19S209. That confirmed pre   viously presumed genetic heterogeneity of the disorder  .",2008

This gene encodes torsinA protein,  whose role has been suggested to be involved in regulating nuclear envelope and endoplasmatic reticule organization . This 3 bp deletion  removes a codon in the C terminus of torsinA that normally encodes a  glutamic acid residue, producing an altered protein, with reduced or no activity, which forms perinuclear inclusions . A recent study described the effects of a new polimorphism in position c .646 (G>C) which causes the development of inclusions similar to those described for deltaGAG deletion . Moreover, this D216H amino   acid change reduced the number of torsinA inclusions in cultured cells with deltaGAG deletion . Many groups have studied the implication of  this and other polymorphisms in this gene in primary dystonia but re   sults are controversial. In this work we will try to find a risk haplotype for primary focal dystonia . We analyzed 6 different polymorphisms in individuals with focal dys   tonia (n , 60) and a control healthy population (n , 50) . None of them presented the GAG deletion in TOR1A exon 5 .

These results are discordant with  known data on association of allele A with increased level of produc   tion of TNF alpha . There might be several explanations of the discrep   ancy, including population specificity of genetic predisposition to vari   ous diseases and different LD structure in adjacent regions of genome  (including 3â UTR region of the gene) in different populations, as well  as different environmental factors that can influence realization of a âgenetic backgroundâ .",2008
somatic genome structural variations,P06.114,"V. Sgaramella , J. L. Williams, F. Salamini","CERSA, Lodi, Italy","The notion that cells of common ancestry harbour genomes different from each other is strengthening . The differences may be either sched   uled (e . g ., immune response), or unscheduled (e .g ., damage effects),  and alter DNA structures . Simple repeats, interspersed sequences,  (retro)transposons, pseudogenes, transgenes, etc, may assume un   usual non B conformations, affecting recognition by DNA metabolizing  enzymes . This may trigger a crescendo of variations, from base substi   tutions to aneuploidy. Epigenetics modifies chromatin and modulates transcription in somatic cells, but can be erased in germ cells . The  resulting RNA may activate novel priming and retrotranscription thus  concurring to genome rearrangements, competent to drive evolution and contribute to development . The resulting somatic genome struc   tural variations (SGSV) may accelerate cell duplication and favour  clonal amplification, occasionally optimizing some functions, but often deranging growth . Consequently, multicellular organisms are bound to be eventually genomic mosaic . We report on: 1. the amplification of the genome of as few cells as  possible of diverse somatic tissues, as a prerequisite for detecting  SGSV; 2. their identification and characterization. For step 1, we have  developed a modified isothermal whole genome strand displacement  amplification based on the circularization of restricted genomes. For  step 2, we are investigating two approaches, based on AFLP and dif   ferential 2D gel electrophoresis; others are being considered such as  mass sequencing and comparative genome hybridization.

We hypothesize  that genetic variants, including SNPs and CNVs (Copy Number Varia  Molecular and biochemical basis of disease tions) in the GSK3beta gene could partially underlie the susceptibility  to mood disorders, just as much to unipolar major depression as to  bipolar disorder  . We performed a genetic case control study including  440 screened control subjects and 445 patients with MD (257 Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder, 188 Bipolar Disorder) . First, we selected  a set of 11 TagSNPs polymorphisms representative of the patterns of  common variation identified in European population in the genomic  region containing the GSK3beta gene and genotyped them using SN   Plex Genotyping System . Moreover, we are replicating the experiment of Lachman et al . in our Spanish sample of MD patients . They found  a statistical significant increased number of gains in a CNV partially  overlapping GSK3beta in bipolar patients compared with control indi   viduals . All the results were analyzed using SNPassoc package, from R software . Regarding TagSNPs analyses, nominal associations were  found once stratified by polarity, even though they did not remain sig   nificant after correction for multiple comparisons. Overall, although ge   netic variants in GSK3beta gene might be a contributing factor to the  development of mood disorders, further studies in larger samples are needed to obtain more conclusive results .",2008

Endometriosis is regarded as one of the multifactorial diseases caused by an interaction between the environment and multiple genes . Glutathione S transferases (GSTs) are enzymes involved in the phase  II detoxification process of xenobiotics including carcinogens and mu   tagens . Gene polymorphisms of members of the GSTs family might  impair detoxification function and increase the risk of the disorder. The  present study was carried out to investigate if deletion/insertion poly   morphisms of GSTM1, GSTT1  and there combination are useful mark   ers for predicting endometriosis susceptibility  . DNA was extracted from blood of 40 patients with reliable diagnosis of endometriosis and 50 healthy women (control group) . DNA samples  were amplified by polymerase chain reaction and detected by elec   trophoresis . The relative frequencies of the GSTM1 wild/null and the   GSTT1 wild/null genotypes between both groups were compared . The proportion of individuals with GSTM1  null mutation was 45% in  the endometriosis group and 30% in the control group (P > 0 .05) , the  proportions of  GSTT1  wild/null allels in both groups were 22 .5%/18%  accordingly (P > 0 .05) . The proportions of GSTM1 (null/null) +   GSTT1 (null/null) genotype were 12 .5%/2% (P > 0 .05) . The distribution  of the polymorphisms and there combination was not significantly dif   ferent between the two groups . These results suggest that the GSTM1   and the  GSTT1 null mutations arenât associated with a risk of the de   velopment of endometriosis in Russian women .",2008

FVIII inhibitors appearance in haemophiliacs is related to  several factors, like substitution with native plasma products, frequent  changing of FVIII concentrates, high rate of HBV and HCV infection, pseudotumours and other massive muscular haematomas, etc . Objective . Starting from particularities of haemophilia treatment in our  country, we evaluated the variables impact on inhibitors development .  We assessed frequency and inhibitors titer, in correlation with risk fac   tors . Material and method: retrospective single center study based on 219  hemophilia patients registered and treated in the IIIrd Pediatric Clinic  Timisoara, using Bethesda assay. We evaluated the influence of some  parameters on frequency and inhibitors titer: haemophilia severity,  gene mutations, family history, type of substitutive product used, hepa   titis C or B infection, Interferon alpha therapy, surgical interventions, and bolus vs . intravenous infusion of FVIII .Results . Between January 1997  2002, inhibitors frequency was 47 .5%, whereas after January 2002 only 19 .19% of patients had inhibitors due  to reactants and methodology change . The majority of inhibitors were  in severe haemophilia (78 .95%), 15 of these patients being positive for intron 22 inversion . Family history and exposure to FVIII were important risk factors of in   hibitors development . Hepatitis C or B infection, Interferon alpha ther   apy, surgical interventions and intravenous infusion of FVIII havenât  been significantly correlated with inhibitorsâ development.Conclusions . In our patients, we found only the following risk factors for  inhibitors development: exposure to FVIII, type of FVIII gene mutations and familial predisposition .

","Primary osteoarthritis (OA) is a common late onset arthritis that dem   onstrates a complex mode of transmittance with both joint site and  gender specific heterogeneity. In OA anti inflammatory and anabolic  cytokines which are usually responsible for the control of cartilage homeostasis are altered or inadequate . Hitherto, functional study had  been mainly focused on the IL13/IL 4/IL 4R system which has a strong  chondroprotective role and it is reasonable to speculate that polymor   phism within these genes may be risk factors for OA . We therefore  investigated polymorphisms in these genes as potential OA suscep   tibility loci by genotyping fifteen SNPs using TaqManÂ® Technology in  413 patients (26 male, 387 female) with hand OA and 326 healthy controls (14 male, 312 female) .Although the majority of these SNPs  had already shown an association with OA in previous studies, in our  case control study only one SNP (dbSNP rs1805013) was associated  with P values of 0 .0125 . This association was attributable to an in   creased frequency in the probands of the minor T allele regardless of gender and disease severity  . This SNP results in the substitution of a  serine with a leucine in the codon 411 of IL4R and consequently of an  aliphatic hydrophobic residue for a polar hydrophilic one, a change that could have effects on protein function . Further functional studies for  the S411L substitutions will clarify the role of this SNP on osteoarthritis predisposition .",2008

In  this study we report a genome wide association analysis performed on  1631 European monozygotic female twin pairs from the GenomEUtwin consortium . One of each pair was genotyped with the Illumina Human   Hap300 duo chip . Whole genome association analysis was performed  with the PLINK program . Area of residence and age were used as co   variates in all of the analyses . Our study had two goals: We wanted  to reduce the environmental variance by using the mean of each pair  as a phenotype . We observed an association (p , 3 .14*10 6) on 8q24  locus underlying the linkage peak identified previously in our linkage scan on European dizygotic twins (LOD 3 .28) .

Hepcidin peptide (HAMP)  down regulates iron absorption; decreased HAMP expression is com   mon in many HH forms and HAMP gene mutations are associated with juvenile HH . Aim of this study was to investigate HAMP gene in 93 HH adult pa   tients, negative for the most common HFE gene mutations, presenting >70% transferrin saturation . Three exons and a promoter region of the gene were screened using DHPLC and sequencing . An additional upstream putative regulating  region was also investigated . The analysis did not show any classical mutations, but many previous   ly undescribed variants were detected: 2 synonymous (L14L and T84T  found in two patients), 5 variants in promoter and 5âUTR region, and  one in the third intron . Interspecies comparison of HAMP sequences showed that 14 and 84 codons are highly conserved . The analysis of  mRNA secondary structure, performed by MFOLD software, showed  that the synonymous mutations here detected considerably modified  the structure, particularly the 5â and 3âUTR regions . The novel pro   moter variant g .232C>T was found in 17% among patients and in 24% among healthy controls (p>0 .05) . The other promoter variants resulted sporadic in HH and absent in controls . In conclusion, gene mutations causing defective HAMP peptide are not detected in our adult HFE negative patients . However, HAMP vari   ants might contribute to iron overload susceptibility, in addition to other genetic and/or environmental factors .

The genotypes of 37 patients with idiopathic bronchiectasis and 102  controls were determined by conformation sensitive gel electropho   resis for MMP1 G 1607GG gene variant and PCR RFLP for MMP9 C 1562T polymorphism . The distribution of  1607GG allele was significantly higher in patient group (p,0 .014) . Heterozygote carriers of  1607GG allele had a 5 .3 fold increased risk for bronchiectasis development (62 .2%  vs. 50%,  p,0 .013) . The OR was even greater (8 .7) for homozygous  1607GG genotype (29 .7%  vs. 18 .6%, p,0 .006) compared with homozygotes  for 1G allele . The MMP9 C 1562T allelic and genotype frequencies did not show  significant differences between the groups.

However, variability in clopidogrel induced antiplatelet effects has  been observed among T2DM and those with elevated platelet reactiv   ity have a higher risk of atherothrombotic events . Since variation in  insulin sensitivity modulates platelet P2Y12 signaling, the aim of this  study was to evaluate if SNPs of the insulin receptor substrate 1 (IRS  1) are associated with variation in the response to clopidogrel in T2DM patients . Methods: A total of 7 tagSNPs (rs1801278, rs11683087, rs1801123,  rs1896832, rs956115, rs2251692, rs6725330) were determined in 180  T2DM patients with coronary artery disease in a steady state phase of  clopidogrel therapy. Patients were classified into carriers and non car   riers of the variant allele for each SNP according to a dominant model .  In addition, haplotype distribution of IRS 1 genes within our population was assessed . Platelet function was determined by LTA following 20  Î¼M adenosine diphosphate stimuli (ADP). Platelet aggregation accord   ing to genotype and haplotype was determined . Results: The 7 tagSNPs were accountable for 93% of the haplotype distribution of the IRS 1 gene . Platelet aggregation was 55Â±15% in the overall population .

We genotyped 306 polymorphic SNPs from the  25 candidate genes in 376 stroke patients and 354 matched healthy controls from Singapore . Using genotype based trend test, we iden   tified 3 novel polymorphic loci from 3 genes (MTRR, SHMT1 and TCN2) which act as potential genetic risk factors for ischemic stroke .  The effects of these loci are independent from each other as well as  other known risk factors including age, gender, smoking, diabetes, hy   pertension and hyperlipidemia . We also found that the association of  TCN2 variants with stroke appears to be more predominant in patients with lacunar infaction (LACI) than in other stroke subtype (non LACI) .  In summary, the variants of these genes potentially affect individual  susceptibility to ischemic stroke through the homocysteine metabolic pathway  .

The variable multiorgan  involvement (mainly the retina and kidneys) defines several pleiotropic  conditions (Joubert Syndrome Related Disorders, JSRDs) sharing the  MTS. The nosological definition of JSRDs has long remained prob   lematical, and a recently proposed classification is now based on the  extent of retinal and renal involvement. Two loci (JBTS1 2) and five  genes (NPHP1, AHI1, CEP290, MKS3, RPGRIP1L) have been identi   fied so far. All genes encode for ciliary proteins, and JSRDs present  clinical and genetic overlap with other ciliopathies, such as nephro   nophthisis and Meckel syndrome . Over the past 3 years, on behalf of the International JSRD Study  Group, we have performed mutation screening of known genes in  large cohorts of about 100 150 patients representative of all JSRD  phenotypes . These allowed estimating the prevalence of gene mu   tations in different subgroups and drawing preliminary gene pheno   type correlates . Pure JS is mostly caused by AHI1 mutations (~10% of cases), and occasionally by MKS3 . Cerebello retinal phenotypes are also mainly related to AHI1 (~20% of cases) although CEP290 can be rarely responsible . The genes most frequently causative of cer   ebello renal phenotypes are NPHP1 and RPGRIP1L (~10% of cases each) . Up to 50% of cerebello oculo renal cases are due to mutations  in CEP290, while a minority relates to NPHP1 deletions .

However, af   ter controlling for age and smoking, there was a negative correlation  between the number of high risk alleles and HDL C levels with border   line statistical significance (p,0.07). These 3 genetic polymorphisms are susceptibility loci and are neither  necessary nor sufficient for prediction of HDL C, but co existence of high risk alleles may contribute to low HDL C levels .",2008

The frequency  of these mutations in the Volga Ural region of Russia remained to be established . To determine the prevalence of G2019S, G2385R, I2020T  mutations in the Volga Ural region, we recruited 341PD patients (129  Russians, 156 Tatars and 56 Bashkirs) and 360 controls (103 Rus   sians, 131 Tatars, 126 Bashkirs) and conducted genetic analysis of these mutations . All patients exhibited at least two of the four principal  signs of PD: resting tremor, rigidity, bradykinesia, or postural reflex im   pairment . Exclusion criteria included prior history of multiple cerebro   vascular events or other causes of parkinsonian symptoms . Controls  were matched for age, ethnic origin and area of residence . Hetero   zygous G2019S was detected in one late onset Bashkir patient with  akinetic rigid trembling form (1 .79%) . Interestingly, that this patient  doesnât carry a SNP in intron 13 (IVS13+104 G/A) which is in strong  LD with the mutation and tags the commonest haplotype shared by all patients with this mutation in the Mediterranean populations . The âAsianâ risk factor, G2385R, was rare, but found in 2 Tatar PD pa   tients (1 .28%) . We observed no I2020T mutations in this study sample .  All mutations were confirmed by direct sequencing. These data have  implications both for understanding the molecular mechanisms of PD, and for directing the genetic screening in clinical practice .",2008

increasing power of variance component linkage analysis of  large pedigrees,P06.156,"T. I. Axenovich , I. V. Zorkoltseva, G. R. Svischeva","Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation","Most methods of linkage analysis of quantitative traits are based on the variance component approach . IBD calculation is the most com   putationally intensive step of this approach . The size of IBD matrix for  large pedigrees and especially for those coming from isolated popu   lations is too large for practical calculation . To solve this problem a  pedigree is split on smaller non overlapping fragments and then the fragments are analyzed as independent pedigrees . The split leads to  increase the number of IBD matrix elements with zero values . This in  turn decreases the linkage power  . To diminish this effect we suggested  to increase the number of non zero elements of IBD matrix by addi   tional alternative splitting of the pedigree, for example, on overlapping  fragments . Using the pedigree with 207 members in 6 generations, we  estimated the expected linkage power when IBDs were calculated for  a) pairs of genotyped members of each non overlapping fragments of  size no more than 18 bit and b) for (a) plus additional pairs of geno   typed relatives from overlapping fragments of size no more than 18 bit .  The results demonstrated the effectiveness of our method: the power for variant (b) based on 964 IBDs was 1 .2   1 .7 times greater than for variant (a) based on 844 IBDs .

We aimed to identify gene regions influencing HDLC  levels by a genome wide association (GWA) analysis in the popula   tion based KORA Study  . Methods: In KORA S3/F3 (n,1,643), we analyzed the 377,865 quality  checked single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of the 500K Affyme   trix SNP array, complemented by the publicly available GWA results  from the Diabetes Genetics Initiative (DGI, n,2,631) and by replication  studies in KORA S4 (n,4,037) and the Copenhagen City Heart Study (n,9,205) . Results: Among the 13 SNPs selected from the KORA S3/F3 500K p  value list, three SNPs showed consistent associations in subsequent  replications: two from so far unreported regions 50 kb downstream of  LIPG or upstream of CETP and one from already reported regions of the LPL .

So development of the  mental fatigue is the significant problem for people who work with big amount of data and constantly need focused attention .Molecular mechanisms of MF origin still are not clear  . It is known that  basal ganglia play a key role in the development of MF (Chaudhuri et al ., 2000) . Dopamine is one of the most prevalent neurotransmitters in the basal ganglia . Therefore we suppose that alterations in the func   tioning of dopamine system provided by genes variations may influ   ence the development of the MF  . We tested the hypothesis that allelic  variation of the DRD2 and DAT genes located mostly in the striatum could be associated with differences in the onset of MF  .

Association studies  using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in miRNA genomic re   gions might help to evaluate the contribution of functional miRNA allele variants to complex disease susceptibility  . We constructed a panel of  768 SNPs covering 164 miRNA regions and spanning 2 Mb of ge   nomic DNA including 326 known human miRNAs precursor sequences (MiRBase, 7 .1) and at least 5 kb upstream and downstream of the miRNA regions . For an optimal selection of informative SNPs we used  tagSNPs and included 18 SNPs located inside premiRNA sequences .  Genotyping of 340 unrelated Spanish controls was performed using  a custom Golden Gate assay (Illumina) . Nine out of the 18 SNPs lo   cated in premiRNAs were monomorphic, which is suggestive of se   lective constraint on miRNA sequences . A high correlation (R2,0 .86)  was shown between allele frequencies in the Spanish and HapMap  CEU sample confirming the applicability of our SNP panel to study the Spanish population . Further, we performed association analysis in a  sample of 294 patients with different types of eating disorders and 340 controls .

Two brain specific miRNAs  (microRNAs) have been recently reported as modulators of endog   enous circadian clock located in the suprachiasmatic nucleus in mice .  The authors have functionally characterized miR 132 and miR 219  within the context of circadian clock and gave experimental evidences  of genes Rfx4 and Phlpp as respective targets. We first explored the  conservation between species for both miRNAs and once the exis   tence of hsa miR 132 and hsa miR 219 was corroborated in humans,  we used different prediction programs to check the experimentally  supported target sites RFX4 and PHLPP in humans. Specifically, mi   Randa predicted hsa miR 132 to target RFX4 and TargetScan pre   dicted PHLPP as a target site for hsa miR 219, consistent with previ   ous work in mice . Once both miRNAs with their respective target sites  were confirmed in humans, we questioned whether these two miRNAs  and their target genes RFX4 and PHLPP are altered in mood disorder patients . Thus, we re sequenced both miRNAs and their respective  target sites at RFX4 and PHLPP genes in a sample consisting of 365  unrelated patients (218 Unipolar Major Depressive Disorder and 147 Bipolar Disorder) diagnosed according to DSM IV criteria . All patients  completed the Spanish versions of the Seasonal Pattern Assessment  Questionnaire and the Horne Ãstberg Morningness Eveningness  Questionnaire. This is the first time that the circadian clock regulation  by miRNAs is explored in mood disorder, representing a first step to  elucidate the underlying mechanism of these proteins and the role of these miRNAs in mood disorders .",2008

Genetic diagnosis of Ataxia t elangectasia and role of  mitochondria on it,P06.180,M. Houshmand,"NIGEB, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Ataxia telangiectasia (AT) is an autosomal recessive disorder in 1/40,000 to 1/100,000 in reported populations . There is a 25% pos   sibility for having an affected child when parents are carrier for the ATM gene mutation . There is no cure available for this disease and  prenatal testing is strongly recommended for prevention of this dis   ease . Although the preferred method is the direct mutation analysis of  the ATM gene, the large size of the ATM gene with 63 exons and the  large number of possible mutations in patients considerably limit ef   ficiency of mutation analysis as a diagnostic choice. In this study, four  molecular markers: D11S2179, D11S1787, D11S535, D11S1343 are genotyped in 19 unrelated families from different regions of Iran . All carriers and affected patients were diagnosed accurately  . This method  is effectively useful in prenatal diagnosis of AT  . We also investigated mt DNA deletions and haplogroups in AT patients .  In this study, 24 Iranian patients suffering from AT and 100 normal controls were examined . mt DNA was extracted from whole blood and examined by 6 primers for existence of mitochondrial deletions . We  also amplified and sequenced the mtDNA HVS I by standard sequenc   ing techniques . mtDNA deletions were observed in 54 .1% (13/24) of  patients (8 .9 kb deletion in all samples, 5 .0 kb in one and 7 .5 kb in two  patients), representing mtDNA damage which may be due to oxidative  stress in mitochondria .

Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) could be considered a  candidate modifier factor for FA disease, since mitochondrial oxidative stress is thought to be involved in the pathogenesis of this disease . The  expansion (GAA) repeat in the first intron causes decreased frataxin expression by interfering with transcription .: Activity of mitochondrial  respiratory chain complex I (measured as NADH ferricyanide reduc   tase) and intracellular ATP measurement was performed on lympho   cyte of FA patients (n ,12) and control subjects (n ,25) . Common dele   tion were identified and confirmed by southern blotting in FA patients.Homozygous GAA expansion was found in 21 (84%) of all cases . In  four cases (16%), no expansion was observed, ruling out the diagnosis 0 of Friedreichâs ataxia . In cases with GAA expansions, ataxia, scoliosis  and pes cavus, cardiac abnormalities and some neurological findings  occurred more frequently than in our patients without GAA expansion .  mtDNA deletions were present in 76% of our patients representing  mtDNA damage, which may be due to iron accumulation in mitochon   dria. Our findings showed that complex I activities and intracellular  ATP were significantly reduced (P,0.001) in patients compared with control . 8 .6 kb deletion in mtDNA was detected in all of patients by  multiplex PCR but Southern blot analysis confirmed the presence of deletion in 9 of 12 patients .",2008

Besides, in recent  study, researchers found a relationship between biochemical defect in complex I enzyme activity and pathogenesis of MS . Complex I is the largest complex of mitochondrial respiratory chain that contains 43 subunits . Thirty six subunits being encoded by nuclear and 7 subunits being encoded by mitochondrial DNA . As mutations in  NDUFS1 gene were reported previously in patients afflicted by com   plex I deficiency and also biochemical defect in complex I enzyme  was found in Iranian MS patients, we encouraged to study relation   ship between NDUFS1 gene and MS disease in Iranian MS patients .  This gene is a nuclear gene encoding catalytic subunit of complex I enzyme . So we analyzed four exons of NDUFS1 gene (8, 9, 15 &  19) that some mutations are identified in patients with complex I de   ficiency. We amplified these exons by PCR and screened them for  finding any variations by SSCP method. Suspicious samples for muta   tion were sequenced. Finally, in our samples, we could not find any variation in these regions of NDUFS1 gene . To identify the relation  between NDUFS1 gene and complex I with MS disease, further ana   lyzes should be done on other exons of this gene and also other genes of complex I subunits .",2008

Besides the well known HLA region, only 2 other loci (5p, 17q) have  been so far linked and associated in at least 2 populations . The 17q  region showed the most significant association with the Protein Kinase  C Alpha ( PRKCA ) gene in Finns; this association was replicated in  Canadian and UK populations, in which specific ârisk haplotypesâ were  identified. Moreover, PRKCA  transcript levels were shown to be higher  in CD4  mononuclear cells of MS patients carrying the risk haplotypes,  suggesting a contribution of PRKCA  regulatory mechanisms in the  pathogenesis of MS . In this study, we analyzed the role of PRKCA  in the predisposition to  MS in a cohort of 294 Italian cases and in an equal number of age  and sex matched controls . An association analysis was performed geno   typing 3 STR and 12 SNP markers covering the whole gene . A weak association (P,0 .032) with the STR located in the  PRKCA  promoter  was found. This region was further analysed by sequencing the first  424 bp of the promoter and the entire exon 1 of the gene in all MS  cases and controls, but no genetic variants specific for MS cases were  identified.

However, the  molecules involved in mediating music perception and performance are so far uncharacterized . Objective and methods: We have applied molecular and statistical  genetic approaches to unravel the biological background of music perception . We recruited 15 Finnish multigenerational families (with a  total of 234 family members) via a nationwide search and defined the  phenotype of all family members using three  tests used in defining mu   sical aptitude: a test for auditory structuring ability (Karma Music test;  KMT) commonly used in Finland, and the Seashore pitch and time  discrimination  subtests (SP and ST respectively) used internationally  .  We calculated heritabilities and performed a genome wide variance  components based linkage scan using genotype data for 1000 micro   satellite markers .   Results: The heritability estimates were 42% for KMT, 57% for SP,  21% for ST and 48% for the combined music test scores . Signifi   cant evidence of linkage was obtained on chromosome 4q22 (LOD 3 .33) and suggestive evidence of linkage at 8q13 21 (LOD 2 .29) with  the combined music  test scores using variance component (VC) link   age analyses . The major contribution for the 4q22 locus was obtained with KMT (LOD 2 .91) . Interestingly, a positive LOD score of 1 .69 was  shown at 18q, a region previously linked to dyslexia (DYX6), using  combined music test scores.  Conclusion: Our results show that there  is a genetic contribution to musical aptitude that is likely to be regu   lated by several predisposing genes/variants .

Using a LightScanner TM (Idaho Technolo   gies) we have developed a single analysis protocol that allows the  efficient screening of all PCR amplimeres by high resolution DNA melt   ing analysis to detect unknown DNA variants . In a blind assessment  of our protocol we screened 14 different amplimeres in 14 individuals  and identified 23/23 sequence variants, distinguishing 100% of those  where an individual was heterozygous for at least one site but only 57% of those individuals who were homozygous for a variant . In a  direct comparison, analysis using the WaveÂ® DHPLC system distin   guished 96% of the heterozygous sequence changes and only 14% of the amplimeres that differed by a homozygous sequence change .

Mutations in the MEF2A  gene, a member of the myocyte en   hancer factor 2 (MEF2) family of MADS box transcription factors, have  been reported in patients with CAD/MI . In particular, a 21 bp deletion  and 3 missense mutations were demonstrated to affect MEF2A activity  either by reducing its transcriptional activity or by impairing its nuclear translocation . However, the association of  MEF2A  with CAD/MI was  not confirmed by other studies. In this work, we analyzed the role of MEF2A  in the pathogenesis of  MI in a large cohort (1785 males, 223 females) of Italian patients with  premature MI (<45 y) and in an equal number of age  and sex matched controls . Firstly, the 21 bp del was searched in the whole study cohort: it was found in 5 cases and was absent in controls (P,0 .027) .

Functional studies evidenced neither  alterations in the transactivating properties (all mutants) nor defects in the nuclear localization (21 bp del) . An association analysis performed  on 3 STRs at the MEF2A  locus showed no significant association with  premature MI.

This study reports the identification of a novel locus for myopia located  on chromosome 2q37 adjacent to, but not overlapping, MYP12 . Three  large multigenerational families with autosomal dominant myopia were recruited into this study  . These families consist of 49 participants (35  affected) each of which has undergone a comprehensive ophthalmic examination . Individuals with other eye diseases that may affect vision  such as glaucoma and keratoconus have been excluded . A genome  wide scan was performed using 400 microsatellite markers spaced an  average of 10 cM apart . Using MERLIN, a multipoint parametric LOD score of 2 .37 was calculated on chromosome 2q37 . This LOD score increased to 3 .43 with nonparametric analysis . The 1 LOD support in   terval initially suggested that this region may overlap with a known  myopia susceptibility locus, MYP12. However, further fine mapping and haplotype analysis narrowed down the critical region to a 0 .8cM region that no longer overlaps MYP12 . Hence, a novel locus for myo   pia was identified on chromosome 2q37 between markers D2S1397 and D2S2968 .

Our  study aimed at developing a highly sensitive, rapid and economical  molecular analysis characterizing the CTG repeat region of DMPK gene based on a two step PCR protocol . Therefore we analyzed 105  patients with the clinical diagnosis of myotonic dystrophy 1 derived  from the DNA bank of the Institute of Human Genetics, University of  Leipzig (Germany) who had already been tested by Southern blot analysis . 60 patients had one normal and one mutated allele of up to  2700 CTG repeats . 12 probands were homozygous for normal CTG  repeat length . In the remainder (33 patients) two different normal al   leles of up to 37 CTG repeats were present . Firstly, for the detection of  alleles of up to 100 repeats quantitative fluorescent (QF) amplification  with primers flanking the repeat region and 2 reference genes for stan   dardization were used . With these methods it was possible to identify both homozygous and heterozygous DM1 alleles . Secondly, long PCR  was just performed if a single wild type allele was detected by giving a QF PCR signal only half as intense . The results of using QF and long  PCR indicate high accuracy in comparison to Southern blot analysis .  We conclude that our new rapid analysis is reliable for genetic testing  of DM1 patients .",2008

Folate genes are con   sidered candidates for association with neural tube defects (NTDs)  such as spina bifida due to the preventative effect of periconceptional maternal supplementation with folic acid . Investigation of an intronic  19bp deletion polymorphism within the DHFR  gene found a significant  protective effect in mothers of NTD cases when present in one (Rela   tive Risk 0 .59 (95%CI: 0 .39 0 .89), p, 0 .01) or two copies (Relative Risk 0 .52 (95%CI: 0 .32 0 .86), p, 0 .01) . Analysis of mRNA levels re   vealed a small increase in expression (~1 .5 fold) associated with the  19bp intronic deletion polymorphism, but this was not significant (Par   le McDermott et al ., Am J Med Genet 143(11): 1174 1180 (2007)) . We sought to further investigate the potential impact of the DHFR  19bp  intronic deletion polymorphism on gene expression by employing a recombinant dual luciferase system in HEK293 cells . The results of  these experiments showed that the 19bp deletion showed a modest in   crease in reporter gene expression in agreement with the mRNA data .  It is proposed that the sequence of the 19bp deletion harbours an Sp2 binding site that acts as a repressor of transcription . Mobility shift as   says are being employed to directly test whether this polymorphism results in loss of an Sp2 binding site .",2008

In contrast to the considerable amount of knowledge on environmental  factors, almost nothing is currently known about the genetic basis of NIHL . In humans, a few studies have been performed aiming at identifying an  association between variants of relevant genes expressed in the inner  ear and NIHL. Significant differences were recently detected between  noise susceptible and noise resistant subjects for some variants of genes CDH23 and KCNE1 . In the pilot study here reported, we have analyzed a population of Portuguese noise exposed workers . KCNE1 and CDH23 genes had  been selected for genotyping of some SNPs, preferentially in coding  regions, in order to be able to detect significant differences between noise susceptible and noise resistant individuals . When individually analysed, significant statistic differences were found  in three SNPs of exon 50 of CDH23 gene: rs4747193 (intronic SNP); rs4747194 and rs4747195 (nonsynonymous SNPs) . However, it was  not possible to identify a clear genetic association, when performing bivariate or multivariate analysis . The lack of strong association between the variants considered in this  study and NIHL can indicate that none of these polymorphisms has  influence in the susceptibility to NIHL in the Portuguese population, or  that their effect could not be detected in our sample due to its small dimension .",2008

BMI is related with immunologic changes  resulting in a decrease of antigen tolerance and in a predominance of  Th2 immunologic system profile. Haptoglobin is an acute phase pro   tein. It has three genotypes 1.1, 2.1 and 2.2 that differ in their affinity  to complex haemoglobin and that are involved in the modulation of immunological response . Genotype 1 .1 is associated with a predomi   nant Th2 response . Serotonin participates in Th1/Th2 balance as it regulates cytokines release . Their intra and extracellular concentra   tions are regulated by its transporter whose efficacy depends on its genetic polymorphisms . Objective: Haptoglobin and 5HTTVNTR polymorphisms as risk factors for obesity  . Methods: 289 women were studied, 248 with overweight or obesity  (BMI,30,19Â±3,74 Kg/m2; 47,31Â±12,63 years old) and 41 controls (56,29Â±11,67 years old). 5HTTVNTR was amplified by PCR and hap   toglobin phenotype by PAGE . Results: Women caring allele 1 of Hp showed a higher risk for obesity  (OR,2,270; IC 95% [1,011 5,098]; p<0,05) and the same was verified for allele 12 of 5HTTVNTR (OR,2,148; IC 95% [1,071 4,311]; p<0,05) .  The risk increases when these two alleles are associated (OR,3,659; IC 95% [1,426 9,390]; p<0,01) . Conclusion: An association between allele 1 of haptoglobin and allele 12 of 5HTTVNTR increases the predisposition for obesity  . The fact that  obese individuals show a higher risk for allergic diseases has been associated with a predominant Th2 response . It is in concordance with  our results as both polymorphisms seem to change Th1/Th2 balance for a predominant humeral immunity  .",2008

In Tunisia, clinical otosclerosis has a prevalence of 0 .4 to 0 .8 . Our aim is to per   form an epidemiological, genetic and linkage analyses of otosclerosis in northern Tunisia . Segregation analysis were performed and showed that the pattern of  the disease is due to a rare dominant major gene with a high polygenic component . Our study showed that in north eastern areas of Tunisia, the sex ratio  in probands with clinical otosclerosis being twice as often in women than in men . This probably suggests that an endocrine mechanism and/or biochemical factor are involved in disease aetiology  . However,  in north western areas, there was no significant difference between the rates of otosclerosis between sexes . Geographical distribution of affected subjects according to the ethnic  origin of their parents showed that the areas with the highest concen   tration of affected individuals were urban or seaside areas . The fre   quency of otosclerosis was lower in rural areas and/or areas far from the seaside . Genetic study was undertaken in some genealogies segregating  autosomal dominant otosclerosis and linkage analysis showed that  three families are linked to the known loci responsible of otosclerosis (OTSC1, OTSC2, and OTSC3) . For the fourth family, the genome wide  linkage analysis was performed and revealed a new otosclerosis locus named OTSC8 . The presence of a genetic factor associated with hormonal, biochemi   cal or environmental factors, probably lead to variable expression of the otosclerosis according to age and sex . Molecular and biochemical basis of disease ",2008

We also used ParkScreen  for screening patients within genetically isolated homogenous popula   tions . It was applied to three groups of apparently sporadic PD pa   tients originating from different Italian Alpine valleys . RESULTS: Panel  functionality was proven by detection of linkage to PARK2 in a family   with known Parkin  mutations . Linkage to several known PD loci in the  examined pedigrees was excluded, and suggestive linkage to PARK8,   PARK3 , and PARK11  was found . For one family, linkage was excluded  for all known loci, thus marking it as a candidate for further studies .  CONCLUSION: ParkScreen is a useful, rapid, and inexpensive tool for assessing the involvement of known loci in familial PD .

Leal","Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States","Association studies are frequently utilized to map variants which are susceptibility loci for common diseases . Critical assumptions of this  approach are that the disease is due to a common functional vari   ant which is in strong linkage disequilibrium with genotyped SNP(s) and there is minimal allelic heterogeneity  . If the rare variant common  disease hypothesis holds, current association based methods will be  underpowered due to allelic heterogeneity, low allele frequencies and  poor correlation (r2) with tagSNPs . For common diseases where the  underlying etiology is believed to involve extreme allelic heterogene   ity, large scale candidate gene sequencing is currently underway to discover multiple causal rare variants . However, which methods are  optimal for analyzing this type of data to detect associations is un   known . In this study, we analytically demonstrate that collapsing gen   otypes and rare variants across multiple loci is more powerful than  multi marker test (Hotellingâs T2) and single marker test (Fisher exact  test) . Although bioinformatics tools are used to classify variants, vari   ants can be misclassified and erroneously included or excluded from the analysis based upon predicted functionality  . Collapsing methods  are robust against misclassification of rare variants, but misclassifica   tion of common variants can lead to a substantial loss of power  . For the situation where it is suspected that both common and rare variants  are involved in disease etiology a powerful and robust novel method was developed which combines collapsing and multilocus tests . It is  also demonstrated empirically that for both collapsing and combined methods type I error is well controlled .",2008

We have also quantified plasma GH, IGF1 and IGFBP 3 . The patients had normal or low levels of GH and  high or normal levels of IGF1 and IGFBP 3 . We have also studied 126  control samples . MATERIAL AND METHODS: Genomic DNA was isolated from periph   eral blood lymphocytes and amplified by PCR using primers that flank  the coding regions of the 21 exons of the IGF1R gene . Direct sequencing of the double stranded PCR fragments was per   formed (Abi Prism 310 Genetic Analyzer, Applied Biosystems) . RESULTS: In one patient with IUGR and short stature, we have found a mutation, in exon 7 in heterozygosis: Y487F  . This mutation leads to a  change in the aminoacid sequence . We have studied the IGF1R gene  in this family and we have found this mutation present in the mother and the grand mother also affected of short stature . This mutation was  not found in the father, the aunt and the grand mother aunt . We have  not found this mutation in any of the 126 control samples studied .  DISCUSSION: The IGF1R gene is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor  . The mutation Y487F changes a Tyrosine by a Phenylalanine,  two aminoacid with a different polarity but with similar structure . This  mutation in exon 7 should affect the extracellular domain, Î± subunit. This region is responsive of the binding IGF1 .

Genetic diagnosis of autosomal dominant and recessive Retinitis Pigmentosa using sNP high throughput genotyping,P06.253,"E. Pomares1,2, G. Marfany1,3, R. GonzÃ lez Duarte1,2","1Dept.de GenÃ¨tica. Universitat de Barcelona, Barcelona, Spain, 2CIBERER.  Instituto de Salud Carlos III, Barcelona, Spain, 3IBUB. Universitat de Barcelona,  Barcelona, Spain. ","Retinitis Pigmentosa (RP), the major cause for blindness in the adults,  is an extremely heterogeneous monogenic disorder which shows all mendelian types of inheritance . Up to now, more than 30 RP genes  have been described, 17 of which are involved in autosomal dominant (adRP) and 20 in autosomal recessive (arRP) forms . However, many  cases remain unassigned . Proper genetic diagnosis of the patients  and potential carriers requires screening of all the candidates, but the  high number of genes, with no major mutation sites, makes conven   tional mutation analysis time consuming and costly for a small/medium  sized laboratory  . In addition, before undertaking the search for new  RP genes, the already known candidates have to be ruled out . Tak   ing into account these data and the fact that there is increasing evi   dence assigning the same candidate genes as responsible for distinct  retinal dystrophies, we have designed an innovative time cost effective  strategy for cosegregation analysis of 39 RP and LCA genes by SNP genotyping on isolated families . This high throughput strategy allows  to discard the genes that do not cosegregate with the disease and highlights the remaining candidates . Subsequent mutational screening  has allowed us to identify the causative mutations for several families .  This type of analysis is very powerful in the arRP forms, particularly  when the family is consanguineous . For adRP families, the analysis of  several affected siblings is usually informative enough to discard most of the candidates . This approach can also be successfully applied to  diseases with high genetic heterogeneity  .",2008

In addition, preliminary analysis based on phase I  HapMap data suggested that recent natural selection have acted on this locus . We further explored the existence of this recent positive se   lection using a test based on extension of linkage disequilibrium (LD) to  large distance at the specific selected haplotype taking data from Hap   Map phase II, and searched for association of the ancestral haplotypes  to schizophrenia in a sample of 532 schizophrenic patients and 597 controls from Spain . Our analysis suggests the existence of a haplotype of MAOB subject to recent selection . In agreement with the ancestral  susceptibility hypothesis, the ancestral haplotypes were significantly over represented in patients (P , 0 .047) . These haplotypes confer an  increased risk to schizophrenia, restricted to males (P , 0 .024, OR ,  1 .41, 95% CI 1 .01 1 .90) . Thus, pending on replication studies, MAOB  seems to fit the ancestral susceptibility model, opening a new strategy  to search for common schizophrenia susceptibility genes by focusing in those functional candidate genes subject to recent positive selection .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease ",2008

As a result of extensive  study, a list of genes has emerged as candidate genes for schizophre   nia . Research into genetics of schizophrenia has found Neurgulin1  (NRG1) among the most promising candidate genes for schizophre   nia. For the first time in 2002, Steafansson et al suggested NRG1 as  a candidate susceptibility gene for schizophrenia in a linkage study carried out in an Icelandic population . Since then, the association  of NRG1 with schizophrenia was further confirmed by several stud   ies in different population . However, analyzing allele and haplotype  frequencies of NRG1 in distinct populations have yielded varying re   sults and also different alleles or haplotypes have been associated with schizophrenia . Meanwhile, some studies have failed to replicate the association . In this work we attempted to study the association of two NRG1 polymorphisms with schizophrenia in Iranian population .  SNP8NRG241930 and SNP8NRG221533 were studied in 100 cases  of schizophrenia matched with 100 healthy individuals. For the first  time in Iranian population, we showed a positive association between NRG1 and Schizophrenia .

Patients with SMA have been classified into three types on the basis of clinical severity  . The survival motor neuron gene is present in two  copies, SMN1 and SMN2, which differ by only five nucleotides. Only  SMN1 gene provides fully functional protein due to exon 7 skipping in  SMN2. On the other hand, the SMA phenotype can be modified by the presence of several copies of SMN2 . SMA is a common and fatal disorder, therefore the carrier detection is essential for prevention and proper genetic counseling . Therefore, es   timation of the SMN1 and SMN2 copy number in patients by real time PCR has been recently introduced in Hungary  . This technique is used  also for the detection of possible compound heterozygotes . Until now, SMN1 copies were determined in 25 affected patients and their 132 family members and twenty controls . Seven patients were  identified as being compound heterozygotes and thus, the diagnosis  of SMA was assumed. The intragenic pointmutations will be identified  later on by sequencing. Additionally, 151 SMA patients with undefined genetic diagnosis still have to be tested for the SMN1 copy number  .  For urgent family planning, 24 relatives of the known carrier parents  were tested and 8 were confirmed as carriers of the common SMN1 mutation . Additionally, SMN2 copy number were estimated in 64 pa   tients and in 33 family members and a good correlation was found between copy number and severity of the disease .",2008

Increasing knowledge about  the splicing process has revealed its great complexity: In addition to  the well known splice site consensus sequences in recent years a mul   titude of regulatory elements have been identified both within introns  as well as within exons. In order to assess / confirm their pathogenic  nature, we have analysed the effect on splicing of several yet func   tionally uncharacterized intronic sequence changes in different genes by analysing their respective RNAâs . Lymphocytes from patients were  immortalized, RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed . The cDNA  was then amplified by PCR and analysed by PAGE or agarose gel elec   trophoresis . Bands with altered electrophoretic mobility were isolated,  purified and sequenced. Two mutations located within the conserved  donor and acceptor splice sites respectively (NF1: c .3496+1G>A and SPG4: c .1688 2A>G) were shown to lead to exon skipping as expect   ed. c.357+2T>A identified in a patientâs DMD gene, however, resulted  in the inclusion of 31 bases of intronic sequence into the mRNA lead   ing to a frameshift, while exon skipping would have left the reading frame intact . This latter case further illustrates that the effect of an  unknown mutation on the splicing process can not easily be predicted .

Recently, an association mapping study in  the chromosome 3 linkage peak for CAD found that the rs9289231  SNP in the Kalirin gene ( KALRN ) was associated with CAD in multiple  datasets . KALRN is involved, among others, in the inhibition of induc   ible nitric oxide synthase, in guanine exchange factor activity, and in the Rho GTPase signaling pathway  . The goal of the present study was  to determine whether SNPs or haplotypes in the KALRN  gene region,  which includes the Ropporin gene ( ROPN1 ), predispose to ischemic  stroke (IS) in a cohort of Portuguese patients and controls . Methods & Materials: We genotyped 27 tagging SNPs in the KALRN   ROPN1  chromosomal region, on 565 IS patients and 518 unrelated  controls, and performed single marker association tests . Results: Intronic SNP rs11712619 in KALRN  was associated with IS  risk in unadjusted (allelic and genotypic p,0 .003) and adjusted (log  additive model p,0 .027, adjusted for age at examination, hyperten   sion, diabetes, ever smoking/drinking) tests . A block of six SNPs (from  rs2280422 to rs12637456), located mostly in the ROPN1  KALRN  in  tergenic region, had a modest (0 .02<p<0 .05) allelic and genotypic as   sociation with IS risk when unadjusted for co variates . The rs9289231  SNP was not associated with IS in any test performed . Conclusions: This study suggests that variants in the ROPN1  KALRN   region may constitute risk factors for stroke in the Portuguese popula   tion .",2008

Evidence from  animal studies and an association between family history of stroke and  stroke outcome suggests the existence of genetic factors influencing stroke recovery  . The PDE4D gene, a regulator of cAMP degradation, Molecular and biochemical basis of disease is a possible candidate because cAMP levels in immunocompetent  cells influence the release of inflammatory mediators and relevant cy   tokines, which are important mediators of stroke recovery. Forty five  SNPs covering genetic variation in the 5â region of the PDE4D gene,  including SNPs previously associated with stroke risk in the Icelan   dic population, were genotyped in 430 ischemic stroke patients and  tested for association with functional recovery  . Stroke recovery was  assessed 3 months after a stroke episode, using the modified Rankin  Scale (mRS). Patients were classified in two groups: good (mRS<,1) or poor recovery (2<,mRS<6) . Binary logistic regression analysis was  carried out to adjust for clinical severity parameters and risk factors  with a significant impact on stroke recovery. Seven SNPs were as   sociated with mRS (0.00098<P<0.048) after adjusting for significant  co variates   history of hypertension, aphasia, paresis, consciousness disturbance and medical complications during hospitalization . Five  haplotypes, including at least one of the associated individual SNPs, were also associated with stroke outcome (0 .0056<P<0 .0367) .

The CD24   A57V polymorphism was genotyped using a PCR system with pre developed TaqMan allelic discrimination assay  . In the Spanish cohort  we found a statistically significant difference in the distribution of the  CD24V allele between SLE patients and controls ( P< 0 .0001, OR, 3 .6,  95%CI 2 .13 6 .16) . In addition, the CD24V/V  genotype was increased in  SLE patients ( P< 0 .00001, OR, 3 .7, 95%CI 2 .16 6 .34) compared with  controls . Additionally, we sought to replicate this association with SLE  in a Swedish and a German SLE population . A similar trend was found  in the German set, where the CD24V/V genotype and the CD24V  al  lele were more frequent in SLE patients than in controls, although this  difference did not reach statistical significance. No differences were  observed in the Swedish set . A meta analysis of the Spanish and Ger   man cohorts demonstrated that the  CD24V allele has a risk effect in  SLE patients (Pooled OR, 1 .25, 95%CI 1 .08 1 .46, P, 0 .003) .

Also, we try to compare the allele frequency of Korean with them of USA and Japanese . Materials and Methods: A total of 40 Systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) patients and 104 healthy controls were studied . SNP located at  position 9520 in the Osteopontin (OPN) gene were genotyped using the restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) . The wild type  sequence contains a C while the polymorphism variant is a T (C >T), which results in the appearance of an Alu I restriction site . Results: The gene frequencies of C/C, C/T, and T/T at position 9250 on the Eta 1/osteopontin gene in SLE patients were 37 .5%, 12 .5%,  and 50 .0%, respectively, compared with 6 .7%, 27 .9%, and 65 .8% in  controls (p<0 .05) . The allele frequencies of C and T at this position in such SLE patients were 43 .75 and 56 .25, whereas those in con   trols were 20 .7 and 79 .3 (p<0 .05), respectively  . The allele frequen   cies found in the present study were compared with those coding SNP described in the USA database; 60 and 39 (USA) vs 20 .7 and 79 .3 (Korea) (p<0 .05) . Conclusions: Those findings suggest Eta 1/osteopontin genetic poly   morphism and allele frequencies were significantly association with SLE patients . Also we observed the difference of allele frequencies in  our controls and in USA controls, these differences may be caused by a difference in incidence of SLE patients between the two countries .",2008

One well established risk factor for car   diovascular disease is the plasma fibrinogen levels. These levels are  influenced largely by genetic factors. But the exact nature of these genetic factors is unknown . Our aim was to localize QTL responsible for the plasma levels of fibrin   ogen . We present the results of a  Genome Wide Scan for fibrinogen  levels that includes a gender specific analysis in 21 Spanish families  from the GAIT ( Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia ) Project .  We used 500 DNA microsatellites scattered throughout the genome . Our results revealed a highly significant LOD score (3.52, nominal p,0 .00003) on Chromosome 17 that was only detected in females, in   dicating that a QTL on this chromosome was responsible for fibrinogen levels only in women . A bioinformatic study in the region of Chromosome 17 revealed the  presence of some hormone related genes (steroid hormone receptors)  that affect fibrinogen levels and that could explain this gender specific  finding. To our knowledge, this is the first report of a gender specific QTL re   lated to cardiovascular disease. It demonstrates that a gender specific genetic analysis can increase our ability to detect phenotypes that are affected by sex . We hope that our results will help to understand the  regulation of fibrinogen plasma levels that determine the susceptibility of cardiovascular disease .

Thus, the MassArray technique was used to geno   type 136 control individuals and 201 thyroid patients . First we have  confirmed our previous results, by genotyping the rs2145418 SNP  along with two SNPs surrounding this marker  . Only the rs2145418  polymorphism showed association with thyroid cancer  . Consequently,  our hypothesis that rs2145418 could reside in a regulatory sequence  of casual genes mapping near or at certain distance of this marker can not discarded . In addition, we have studied nine SNPs that cover  the TBX15 gene sequence, this gene maps 550 kb downstream of rs2145418 . Four of these SNPs lying on the 5â UTR region have shown  significant association with thyroid cancer (p<0.05). Furthermore, the  association of each SNP alone is less significant than that of a vari   ant haplotype (TACT) of the four 5â UTR markers (OR, 2 .18; 95% CI, 1 .23 3 .88; P,0 .0085) .

Other genes  also associated with T1D include INS, CTLA4, PTPN22 and innate im  mune response genes . Differential activation of the complement genes could alter the innate response and contribute to T1D development .  These quantitative changes could be caused by copy number varia   tions, a recently described polymorphism type that has been associ   ated with autoimmune diseases . Our aim was to determine whether gene copy number variants of com   plement genes C2 and C4B are associated with T1D .We analyzed 60 T1D patients and 60 nondiabetic control individuals .  C2 and C4B copy number quantitation was performed by real time  PCR using specific Taqman assays. Experiments were performed in duplicate using 20ng of genomic DNA . Raw data were normalized us   ing the endogenous RNAseP gene and expressed relative to a refer   ence sample, using the  2ÎÎct method. Comparisons between the two groups were performed using a Studentâs T test . T1D patients presented a significantly (p<0.01) increased abundance in C2 (mean relative valuesÂ±SD,1 .17Â±0 .58 in T1D vs . 0 .94Â±0 .31 in  controls) and a decrease in C4B (0 .47Â±0 .43 vs . 0 .91Â±0 .45, respec   tively) . We conclude that these differences in gene copy number of comple   ment genes could affect the risk to develop T1D, and these polymor   phisms seem to be associated with genetic susceptibility to T1D . How   ever, we have to take into account that these associations could be  due to linkage disequilibrium with the HLA class alleles and not to a  primary effect .",2008

","Reduced fatty acid utilization and increased oxidative stress both can contribute to the development of cardiac hypertrophy  . Left ventricular  hypertrophy in endurance oriented athletes is generally understood to be a limiting factor for improving maximal oxygen uptake (VO2max) .  Cardiac uncoupling protein 3 (UCP3) can serve to protect the heart  against lipid induced oxidative stress, and stimulate fatty acid trans   port and oxidation . A variant in the UCP3 gene associated with higher  mRNA levels has been identified (UCP3  55C/T). This variant has been associated with reduced risk of type 2 diabetes and obesity  . Re   cently we have shown that  55T allele was overrepresented in highly elite rowers and was associated with high values of VO2max . If UCP3  is important for muscle and heart metabolism and can protect against  development of LVH, then one might anticipate  55T variant of UCP3  gene to be associated with insignificant cardiac growth (rational adap   tation) in response to endurance training . We have tested this hypoth   esis in the study of elite Russian rowers (n,19, males) . UCP3  55C/T polymorphism was determined by PCR RLFP  . Echocardiography was  performed for two times with one year interval . We found that subjects  of CC genotype exhibited the greatest cardiac growth (when interven   tricular septal wall thickness was measured; CC: 3 (1 .4) mm, CT: 1 (0) mm, TT:  1 mm; P,0 .019), whereas the individuals of TT genotype  exhibited the reduction in septal wall thickness .

","The latest genotyping arrays provide over a million markers across  the genome to interrogate copy number variation (CNV), making it possible to perform whole genome copy number association studies .  However, the various statistical and computational challenges involved  with the analysis of copy number data on such a large scale have pre  vented such association studies from being completed . Instead, whole  genome copy number studies have been limited to paired sample analysis or visual inspection on small numbers of samples . Arguably,  due to small sample sizes and the susceptibility of visual inspection to  human error, such approaches offer only cursory insights and lack in their effectiveness to uncover CNV associations . To address these issues, we developed a series of novel methods em   bodied in a new tool called CNAM. CNAM is capable of efficiently and  accurately preprocessing whole genome copy number data for thou   sands of samples, finding large to single probe CNVs, and performing a range of statistical tests to identify CNV associations . Discussed methods include accurately extracting log ratio signals,  quantile normalization without gender bias to properly normalize  against reference populations, optimal univariate and multivariate seg   menting based on dynamic programming (Hawkins Segmentation) to  determine regions of variation, enhanced Eigenstrat based principal  component analysis to detect and correct for population stratification  and batch effects, and association testing using various copy number measures as covariates .

It is characterized by congenital severe profound sensorineu   ral hearing loss, prepuberal retinitis pigmentosa and vestibular are   flexia. The PCDH15  gene is implicated in this disorder and it encodes  for protocadherin 15, a large transmembrane protein belonging to the  cadherin superfamily  . OBJECTIVE The main of this study is to identify the USH1 causative mutations and  to evaluate the PCDH15  implication in this syndrome . PATIENTS AND METHODS Fifty six USH1 patients from Spain and USA, which had previously  discarded the most prevalent USH1 gene, MYO7A , were studied . The mutation screening was performed by directly sequencing of all 33  exons and intron exon boundaries from the PCDH15 gene . RESULTS In this study, seventeen different pathologic variants and forty five  polymorphisms in the PCDH15  gene have been found in USH1 pa   tients. Mutations identified include twelve missense variants, three premature stop codons and two splice site changes . These variants  have been found in seventeen of fifty six USH1 patients (30.6%). One  patient was compound heterozygous and two patients had a homozy   gous mutation . One unique pathologic variant was detected in the rest of studied patients . CONCLUSIONSOut of a total of 112 alleles, 20 of them (17 .9%) were considered  pathologic in the PCDH15  gene . It can be estimated that the PCDH15  gene is responsible for about  16% of USH1 patients .Most of studied patients were carriers of only one mutation . Large rear   rangements within this gene could explain this fact .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease ",2008

VEGF A2578C polymorphism is associated with muscle fiber  type distribution in athletes,P06.309,"E. V. Lyubaeva1, I. I. Ahmetov2, A. M. Hakimullina2, O. L. Vinogradova1, V. A.  Rogozkin2",1SRC Institute for Biomedical Problems of the Russian Acad," There is strong relationship between muscle fiber type distribution  and human physical performance . For example, elite weightlifters and  sprinters exhibit large percentages of fast twitch fibers (FT, also known  as type II muscle fibers) compared to controls and endurance athletes.  FT fibers have comparatively low capillary density and blood flow ca   pacity and low mitochondria content . Vascular endothelial growth fac   tor (VEGF) is important in the basal maintenance of skeletal muscle  capillarization and may influence the determination of muscle fiber  type distribution. To investigate the question of the influence of VEGF  gene polymorphism on the proportion of fibers types of m. vastus late   ralis, we have analyzed the muscle biopsies obtained from 21 elite Russian athletes (all round speed skaters) . The immunoperoxidase  technique was employed for immunohistochemical identification of myosin isoforms . VEGF gene A2578C polymorphism was determined  by PCR RLFP. Mean percentages of FT fibers were significantly higher  in VEGF CC homozygotes than in VEGF A allele carriers (AA/AC   38 .3 (6 .2) %, CC   47 .8 (12 .4) %; P,0 .03) . Then we determined dis   tribution of VEGF alleles in 60 elite and sub elite weightlifters and in 1,113 controls . We found that the frequency of VEGF 2578C allele was  significantly higher in weightlifters than in controls (58.3% vs. 48.0%; P,0 .035) .

","Autosomal recessive retinitis pigmentosa (ARRP) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder  . ARRP could be associated with extraocular  manifestations that define specific syndromes such as Usher syn   drome characterized by retinal degeneration and congenital hearing loss (HL) . The Usher syndrome typeII (USH2) subtype associates RP  and mild to moderate HL with preserved vestibular function . At least  three genes USH2A , the very large G protein coupled receptor VLGR1   and WHRN  are responsible for USH2 syndrome . Here, we report on the segregation of non syndromic ARRP and USH2  syndrome in a consanguineous Tunisian family, which was previously  used to define USH2B locus. Upon extending this family, the genotyp   ing with additional STR markers excluded linkage to USH2B locus .  In addition, ophthalmologic reexamination showed phenotypic het   erogeneity  . We therefore reanalyzed the extended family with regard  to the co occurrence of two different pathologies i .e non syndromic  ARRP and USH2 syndrome . Surprisingly, linkage analysis disclosed  the cosegregation of the USH2 phenotype with D5S428 and D5S618  markers corresponding to the USH2C locus while the ARRP perfectly  segregates with PDE6B  flanking markers D4S3360 and D4S2930.  Molecular analysis revealed two new missense mutations p .Y6044C and p .W807R occurring in  VLGR1  and PDE6B  genes, respectively  .  Both mutations were absent in 95 genetically unrelated controls .

","Background.   The 46CâT polymorphism in the Coagulation Factor XII  gene consists of a cytosine to thymidine transition at the position 46  from the transcription initiation point in exon 1 of the 5Â´ untranslated region . Previous case control studies have indicated an association  between this polymorphism and variation in plasma levels of FXII . The  46CâT seems to affect the translation efficiency, leading to reduced  plasma levels of the protein . It has been inferred that this mutation ac   counts for 40% of the variance in FXII activity levels in a Spanish Medi   terranean population . As other case control studies in the same region  indicate, genotype T/T is an independent risk factor for venous throm   bosis, ischemic stroke and acute coronary artery disease (CAD) . Aim.   In this study, we try to confirm the importance of the 46CâT  polymorphism in two patient samples from Spain and Tunisia . Methods.   We have implemented two different approaches: a Trans   mission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) based on 101 families (N,302) from  Spain (Barcelona) with one offspring with CAD; and a classical case  control study based on 76 patients with CAD complicated by myocar   dial infarction and on 118 healthy individuals from North and Centre  South Tunisia. All subjects were genotyped for the 46CâT polymor   phism with Real Time PCR using a TaqManÂ® SNP Genotyping Assay  (Applied Biosystems) and the appropriate software was implemented for the data analyses . Results.  No statistically important association was detected in any of  the two samples (TDT: p,0 .16, statistical power , 99%; case control study: p,0 .65) . Conclusion.  The results suggest that 46CâT is not a risk factor for  CAD in any of the two analysed samples . So far as we know, the TDT  analysis for this mutation is the first one carried out in a Spanish popu   lation and suggests that 46CâT might not be the only functional site that would explain the susceptibility to thrombotic disease .",2008

In sup   port to these findings,  ex vivo  Langendorff perfusion of intact hearts  revealed decreased rates of contraction and relaxation in TG mice .  Furthermore, patch clamp analysis of isolated cardiac myocytes un   veiled significantly prolonged cardiac myocyte action potential, de   creased transient outward current (Ito) and increased sodium/calcium  exchanger activity. Significant changes were also detected in key cyto   skeletal and contractile proteins . In conclusion, âhuman PLNâ directly  affects calcium cycling and contractility, which in turn triggers electri   cal and structural remodeling . These compensatory mechanisms ulti   mately enable long term survival of the TG mice .",2008

This gene is unique in having an exceptionally high amount of polymorphic sites both in the coding and in the promoter region . One  of the most thoroughly investigated polymorphisms is the 48 base pair  variable number of tandem repeats in exon III that has been carefully  studied as a possible genetic risk factor for several psychological traits  and psychiatric disorders, such as novelty seeking, drug abuse and  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. Mice or rat possess no analogous repeat sequences, whereas similar  tandem repeat polymorphism of the DRD4 gene was identified in dogs and chimpanzees . Therefore, genotyping method was developed for  exon III length polymorphism of DRD4 gene in dogs; genotype and al   lele frequency values were measured in several dog breeds, in wolves and in human DNA samples . Moreover two other VNTRs were identified and analyzed in dogs in  exon I and intron II of the DRD4 gene and were found to be polymor   phic . Our results show that DRD4 gene is also variable in dogs, which means  that these animals have the potential to become a natural model for  testing relationships between this candidate gene polymorphism and psychiatric disorders (such as hyperactivity) .",2008

Gene transcription and proteomic profiles of the aneurysmal compared to non aneurysmal aortic media layer have been studied . Our pre   liminary oligonucleotide microarray (22000 genes) results evidenced  down regulation of genes such as Decorin (DCN), Thrombospondin 1 (THBS1), Reticulocalbin 2 (RCN2), Reticulon 1 and 4 (RTN1 and 4) .  Paucity of these transcripts delineate a structural lack of resistance to  mechanical stress and an increase of angiogenesis possibly as an at   tempt to remodeling the vessel . Proteomic analysis indicated an hyper  expression of Testican 2 (SPOCK2) and Jagged 1 (JAG1), confirmed by Real Time PCR analysis: mRNAs for these genes are upregulated .  The implication of angiogenesis in the aneurysmal aorta is consistent with upregulated Eph transcripts found in microarray analysis .

A purified DNA sample of a female carrier in a Spanish family suffer   ing from ocular albinism was subject to the p054 probe mix of MLPA,  showing a decreased peak corresponding to exon 2 of the OA1 gene .  In order to determine whether the OA1 gene was altered, we anal   ysed a DNA sample from an affected male (probandâs father), and after MLPA, no peak was observed . Therefore, we focused our sequencing  analysis on exon 2 because it appears to be particularly prone to dele   tions.

The neuregulin 1 gene  (8p12 p21) has been strongly associated with an increased risk to  develop schizophrenia by numerous studies in several human popu   lations since the first association reported in an Icelandic population (Stefansson et al ., 2002) . However this prominent genetic risk factor  has not been analyzed in the German population so far  . Methods: Authors analyzed the genetic variability contained in the Â«Ice   landic core at riskÂ» haplotype as well as in the intron 1 of the NRG1  gene in a sample of German origin based on the GRAS Data Collection  (Goettingen Research Association for Schizophrenia), made up of 883  DSM IV diagnosed schizophrenic patients and 880 healthy controls,  in the context of a case control study  .

"," Population based linkage analysis is a novel method for analysing  genomewide SNP genotype data in case control samples that does not assume a common disease, common variant model . The genome  is scanned for increased identity by descent sharing of extended ge   nomic segments within case case pairs, relative to case control or control control pairs . The method is robust to allelic heterogeneity and  is suited to mapping genes which contain multiple, rare susceptibility variants of relatively high penetrance . The method has been proposed by Purcell et al . (Am J Hum Genet 2007) and implemented in the soft   ware PLINK . We analysed genomewide SNP genotype datasets for two schizo   phrenia case control cohorts, collected in Aberdeen (461 cases, 459 controls) and Munich (429 cases, 428 controls) . This analysis must be  performed within homogeneous samples and it was therefore neces   sary to analyse the cohorts separately. Each cohort was first subjected  to several procedures to improve genetic homogeneity, including iden   tity by state outlier detection and multidimensional scaling analysis .  Using the complete cohorts there was no significant overlap in signals between the Munich and Aberdeen cohorts . However, when testing  only those cases with a positive family history of major psychiatric dis   ease, which would fit better with a model of strongly penetrant sus   ceptibility alleles, we saw a distinct peak on chromosome 19q in both  samples (spanning the gene APOE but many others too), that appears in meta analysis (P,0 .000016) to be around the traditional level for  calling genomewide significance for linkage.P07.

","Auditory neuropathy (AN) encompasses a variety of disorders charac   terized by normal otoacoustic emissions (OAE) and absent or grossly  abnormal auditory brainstem responses (ABR) in the affected sub   jects . AN can result from environmental or genetic causes . It can be  part of a systemic neurodegenerative disorder or it can be an isolated clinical entity  . The primary lesion in AN can be located in the inner hair  cells, in the auditory nerve, or in the synapse in between . In the last  few years, several genes have been shown to be involved in AN . We  have investigated the prevalence of mutations in the genes encoding  otoferlin, pejvakin and TIMM8a ( OTOF , DFNB59  and DDP1 , respec   tively) in subjects with isolated auditory neuropathy  . A cohort of 36 un   related subjects with isolated auditory neuropathy were screened for  mutations in these genes by DNA sequencing of all exons and flanking  intronic sequences . In 25 subjects (69%), we found two mutant alleles  of OTOF , two of the mutations being novel . In one subject (2 .8%), we  found a novel mutation in the DDP1  gene . Mutations in this gene are  responsible for Mohr Tranebjaerg syndrome, an X linked condition as   sociating deafness and muscular dystonia . The affected child did not  present with dystonia at the age at which the study was performed .  No mutations were found in the DFNB59  gene .

The objective of this study was to evaluate geographical endogamy in  the population of the region of Souss Massa Draa in south Morocco, as an indicator of the degree of genetic isolation of the population . A prospective study was carried out between October 2005 and April 2007 on 190 randomly picked families of Souss Massa Draa . The  choice of the mate was evaluated according to the geographical origin Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology of the couple and their parents . The intensity of the endogamic behav   iour is determined by the endogamy ratio . The results indicated clearly a tendency of the couples to geographical  endogamy  . 95% of the couples involved in the study, chose a mate of  the same geographical origin, 98% did so in the generation of their parents . The integenerational comparison of the measured endogamy ra   tio shows the same degree of genetic isolation for both generations (p>0 .05) . Compared to other results obtained in other regions of Morocco, the  Souss Massa Draa region can be qualified as âclosedâ, which reflects the cultural and traditional heritage of this region .",2008

The  ATP Binding Cassette,  Subfamily C, Member 1  (ABCC1 i .e . Multidrug Resistance Protein 1 )  is a membrane pump excreting a variety of xenobiotics from the cell .  We previously showed a lower expression of ABCC1 in bronchial epi   thelium of COPD patients than of healthy controls, and even further decrements in more severe COPD stages . Methods:We tagged ABCC1 using all 51 prevalent (minor allele fre   quency>5%) and non correlated (r2<0 .8) single nucleotide polymor   phisms (SNPs) . Effects of SNPs in relation to the level and longitudinal  course of lung function were assessed in two independent, prospec   tive, population based studies, i .e . the Doetinchem (n,1,152) and  Vlagtwedde Vlaardingen (n,1,390) cohorts . Results:Two SNPs (rs212093 and rs4148382) in the 3â untranslated  region of ABCC1  were significantly associated with a lower Forced Ex   piratory Volume in one second (FEV1) in both cohorts . Four moderately  correlated (0 .5<r2<0 .8) SNPs (rs4148330, rs4781699, rs8045000, and  rs7190484) in the ABCC1 promoter and intron 1 had a significant ef   fect in both cohorts of the same, negative, magnitude, but on different  lung function outcomes, i .e . FEV1 or FEV1/VC (Vital Capacity) ratio .  One SNP in intron 14 (rs35621) was significantly associated with a  highly excessive FEV1 decline in both cohorts . Conclusions:This is the first study showing a significant relation be   tween ABCC1 SNPs and lung function level and decline in two inde   pendent population based cohorts . These SNPs are therefore putative  candidates for studies to prevent COPD development and pharmaco   genetics in established COPD .",2008

Random microdeletions were observed in 95%  of the NBR exposed males with higher frequency in AZFc region but without gr/gr or b2/b4 phenotypes . Scrutiny of the male fertility  associ   ated genes showed copy number polymorphism (CNP) and tandem  duplication in 84%, and exclusive deletion of DBY in 25% of the ex   posed males . Detailed analysis revealed multiple polymorphic copies  of SRY and CDY1  genes in addition to several known and novel muta   tions of the SRY gene . Amongst NBR exposed males with multiples  copies of the DAZ genes, 75% showed varying FISH signals for DAZ  genes with unilocus or bilocus duplications whereas 30% showed  mosaicism in terms of presence/absence of the signals in 6 8% cells and unexpected number of signals in 9 12% interphase nuclei . Inter   estingly, all these alterations were exclusively somatic in nature sub   stantiating normal fertility status of NBR exposed males .

Preliminary analyses re   vealed multiple genes related to the mediation of polyglutamine tracts and the unfolded protein response . To identify  trans  acting upstream  genes influencing CTNS  expression, we performed both genome wide  linkage and association scans. Genome wide linkage results identified a region at 9q21 (p , 0 .0025) . Examination of the genetic correlations  of expression levels of genes within this region with CTNS  expression  identified a novel candidate gene, VPS13A  (vacuolar protein sorting  13A) . VPS13A  and CTNS expression levels were inversely geneti   cally correlated (p , 9 Ã10 6), indicating VPS13A  as a potential inhibitor  of CTNS  expression .

Due to this, dermatoglyphic samples of 55 cases  with Parkinson were evaluated by comparing the samples of the con   trol group including 48 healthy people . Investigating samples from the patient and the control group by âRont   gen Film method, an increase in the number of the knots and a de   crease in the number of the loops at the I. finger of the right hand; a de   crease in the number of triradiuses at the left hand interdigital regions  I and III and the right hand interdigital region I; decrease in the number  of triradiuses located on the right and the left hand tenar region and  on the right hand hipotenar region; a decrease in the number of right  hand a b lines were detected. In our study, significant differences were  found in the finger tip and palm samples of the Parkinson patients (p<0 .05) . Even though data were related to a limited number of cases,  they were found to be interesting due to giving a clue to the genetic predisposition of Parkinson .

We measured the length of the 2nd, 3rd  and 4th fingers of 100 from each locality (Oradea and Vascau). The  Oradea locality has over two thounsands of inhabitants, which means the variability of some phenotipical features must be a large one .

Petersburg Down Syndrome Register were analyzed with a special  attention to the period of high social expectations (1983 87) when the  number of births had been increasing (69,406â73,275) and the pe   riod of a social frustration (1995 99) when the number of births had  declined most dramatically (33,841â29,438). STUDY POPULATION:  During 1980 1999, 1358 liveborn children with DS were identified  among 1 046,932 births; a rate of 1 .3/1000 births . Prenatal diagnosis  had low impact on the birth prevalence . METHOD: The data obtained  were compared with the expected rates and numbers based on the  data from NDSCR, 1989 2002 . RESULTS: Maternal age distribution in  the general population had changed during the study period: propor   tion of mothers aged â¥ 35 yr increased from 6.8% in 1983 87 to 8.4%  in 1995 99, however this has not resulted in corresponding increase in DS rate . In contrary, DS rate in 1995 99 was the lowest over the study  period, being 1.18/1000. However, by the model applied, this figure  does not differ significantly from the expected. The DS infant mortality rate had fallen from 39% in 1983 87 to 17% in 1995 99 . DISCUSSION:  There is no evidence for an effect of economic crisis accompanied with  psychological stresses and with nutritional deficiency on chromosome segregation or on surviving of affected children . A suggestion that low  DS rate might be explained by better welfare standards of reproducing fraction of the population is under the study  .",2008

We demonstrate that  population substructure and even individual ancestry are detectable  at high resolution and support the concept of multiple historical bottle   necks resulting from founder effects . We performed multidimensional scaling (MDS) of pairwise identity by state (IBS) sharing data to delineate population structure . Within  Finland the two primary dimensions of the MDS analysis correspond  remarkably with the east west and north south directions, respectively,  showing a distribution of individuals corresponding closely with the geographical distribution of parentsâ birthplaces . The youngest subiso   lates showed higher IBS similarity compared to other subgroups and  separation using an extremely fine resolution. We analyzed linkage  disequilibrium (LD) and extended regions of homozygosity (ROHs) to further explore the genomic structure of the subpopulations . Highest  LD and the largest number of long (>10Mb) ROHs was identified in the  youngest regional population and showed a gradual decline of these measures in older and more outbred, subpopulations . The study shows the power of GWA data to trace the population his   tory and also exemplifies the power to identify stratification even within  homogeneous populations.

The availability of genome wide association data offers new opportunities to identify the genes involved in normal growth . Recent meta analyses of genome wide association studies (GWAS),  using up to 16,000 individuals, have identified 22 independent loci  associated with height (p<5x10 8) . The GIANT consortium has now  extended these analyses, using imputation methods, to combine as   sociation results from 13 GWAS, with a total sample size of >32,000 individuals . Initial meta analysis identified 111 independent loci with p<1x10 5 and  50 with p<5x10 7. Confirmed loci implicate a wide range of molecular  processes involved in normal growth . These include Hedgehog sig   naling ( PTCH1, HHIP, IHH ), chromatin remodeling ( SCMH1, HMGA2 ),  and basic cell cycling ( CDK6, ANAPC13 ) . Some of the variants and  genes have been connected to other diseases, including cancer, sug   gesting that variants associated with height may also influence disease susceptibility  . Many of the associated loci include genes known to be  involved in growth based on monogenic human studies . Other loci im   plicate genes previously unsuspected to have a role in growth, and  represent excellent candidate genes for, as yet unexplained, growth related single gene disorders . Combining data from many genome wide association studies is likely  to result in the identification of hundreds of loci that influence adult height .

Some of these factors have been  identified, but they have mainly been analyzed independently. Here,  we aimed to determine contribution of different environmental and ge   netic modifiers to total body iron overload.Method: We studied 365 p .C282Y/p .C282Y patients (195 men and 170  women), and we used the iron removed by phlebotomy as quantita   tive trait (log transformed). We tested the influence of age, gender,  alcohol abuse, body mass index, as well as six common variants: the  16189 T>C variant in mtDNA, the  308G>A variant in the TNF alpha  promoter, the well known duplication of the haptoglobin gene (geno   types Hp1 1, Hp1 2 and Hp2 2), and 3 SNPs located in genes involved  in regulation of hepcidin synthesis ( BMP2  rs23756, BMP4  rs4901474  and HJV rs16827043) . Results: Univariate analyses first highlighted the relation between each  potential modifiers and severity of the body iron overload. Factors with  a p value lower than 25% were included in a same multiple linear re   gression model . Then, stepwise elimination procedures were succes   sively performed until a model presenting only significant predictors was found . Predictors of this last model were the male sex (p<0 .0001), the greater age at diagnosis (p<0 .0001), the alcohol abuse (p,0 .0008)  and the Hp2 2 genotype (p,0 .0186) . Conclusion: Our results underline the predominant influence of non  genetic modifiers in expression of the p.C282Y/p.C282Y genotype.  Future investigations should address the influence of other genetic  modifiers, and further look for gene/gene and gene/environment in   teractions .",2008

Nucleotide substitutions were found to make up the  majority of the mutations, rather than indels. We drew significantly  high transition rate (81 .8%) versus lower frequency of transversions  (18.2%). 12 polymorphisms were identified in this study which had not been published in the MitoMap database . PCT changes at position 303 309 were detected in 83% of our samples . Our results suggest  that an increased level of HVS I and HVS II substitutions may be an indicator of mitochondrial DNA instability  . Furthermore, mtDNA mu   tations may play an important role in pathogenesis of cardiac arrest which has remained unexplained for long .",2008

The aim of this  study was to determine the frequency of the C282Y, H63D and S65C  mutations of HFE gene in the group of unrelated HH patients (n,28)  and in the healthy population of Serbia (n,318) . The C282Y, H63D and S65C mutation frequencies in the healthy pop   ulation were 1 .6%, 15 .7% and 1 .6%, respectively and in the popula   tion of HH patients 25%, 19 .6% and 1 .8%, respectively  . The frequency  of C282Y homozygotes was estimated on approximately 1:3900 in   dicating the prevalence of HH type 1 in Serbia . Our results support  previously documented gradient distribution of the C282Y mutation, in  northwest to southeast Europe. They also confirm that the frequency  of C282Y mutation is not related to the origin of particular population but it is more related to the geographical position of the population .  This finding could be considered as yet further evidence in favor of the Viking or Celtic origin of C282Y mutation .The frequency of the C282Y homozygotes (10 .7%) is considerably  lower than the frequency reported for HH patients in other European populations . It is possible that some of the analyzed HH patients carry  other mutations in HFE gene, mutation in some other genes already  related with HH or in some other yet not identified genes. These results have important clinical implications for the detection and management of HH type 1 in Serbia .",2008

The study sample  consisted of 118 members of a single extended family living on the  Adriatic Croatian island of Vis, where no pedigree based inbreeding  was observed, and therefore no homozygosity by descent, HBD, was expected . Individuals were genotyped for 810 microsatellite markers  and a 317k Illumina chip . Five approaches were compared: the propor   tion of heterozygous loci (multilocus heterozygosity, MLH), two meth   ods of moments approaches that use different weighting approaches  (ADC and PLINK), and finally 2 maximum likelihood approaches, one  singlepoint and the other multipoint, using a hidden Markov model for  marker dependencies (FEstim) . The latter is the only existing multi   point method for HBD estimation and gives estimates the closest to the true HBD values, as shown previously in a simulation study  . The  results indicated that the two methods of moments approaches corre   lated highly with MLH and hence did not bring much information about HBD . On the other hand, the two maximum likelihood approaches  exhibited zero value estimates when homozygosity was likely due to  chance. A total of 68 individuals (57.6%) had no HBD as defined by the FEstim, while a total of 4 individuals (3 .9%) had FEstim values over  0.0625 indicating inbreeding closer than first cousins. These methods can be used to differentiate homozygosity by chance vs . HBD, which  may be important in investigation of the genome wide heterozygosity effects on quantitative and health related traits .",2008

Its reproductive behaviour is characterized by the historical and  still present tendency to late maternity  . We hypothesize that areas of  âreproductive longevityâ exist throughout the island, where a higher  incidence of elderly mothers combines with a lower risk of perinatal  death . Data regard all 1980 96 births (n,299,793), occurred in 363  Sardinian municipalities . Through a smoothed isopleth mapping pro   cedure, we explored the spatial distributions of a late maternity indi   cator (proportion of 35+year old mothers), and a perinatal mortality  indicator (proportion of deaths within the 1st week of life) associated  with late maternity  . We drew critical isopleths to highlight âexcessâ ar   eas, where the late maternity indicator exceeds the average Sardinian  value and approaches its upper limit . With respect to the ânon excessâ  area (23% of 35+year old mothers), in the âhighest excessâ area (27%  of 35+year old mothers) the Odds Ratio of perinatal death was lower (1 .38  vs 1 .78), and the proportion of consanguineous marriages and  the inbreeding coefficient were respectively from 3 to 2.4 fold higher.  In conclusion we suggest that such area, located in the central part  of the island and qualified for âreproductive longevityâ, can be target  of further investigations on eventual protective mechanisms against  adverse perinatal outcomes in late maternity, and of studies on the  possible association between reproductive longevity and achievement of an extended life span .",2008

It is primarily secreted by the adipocytes and its concentration in the blood is proportional to the amount of body fat . Many leptin gene poly   morphisms have been found, but their association with obesity is still controversial .

The ancestral G allele which displays as a minor allele in  the Vis population (frequency of 0 .44) was associated with higher  leptin levels. The leptin concentration was significantly higher in the  obese (60 .1 ng/ml, N,244), than in the non obese group (20 .7 ng/ml, N,76) and it was more than three times higher in women (44 .0 ng/ml) compared to men . However, no association of  G 2548A  and A19G   polymorphisms with obesity was found (with leptin concentration, sex and age as covariates) . The results indicate that the studied polymor   phisms are not relevant markers for common obesity in this isolated  population, but were found to influence the leptin concentration which is an obesity related phenotype .",2008

Of these four longevity candidate genes, only PPAR Î³ and APOE ap   peared to have an effect on fertility, indicating their possible influence  on reproductive efficiency. The PPAR Î³ Pro/Ala genotype, which in a previous study (Barbieri et el . 2004) showed a positive association with  longevity only in men, was found associated with a higher number of children (6 .1 Â± 3 .3) than Pro/Pro genotype (3 .3 Â± 1 .9, p,0 .001) only in men . Compared with the other APOE alleles, the APOE*2 allele,  considered as an allele favouring a longer life span, was confirmed to be associated with the lowest fertility (p,0 .03) . The logistic regression  analysis indicated that APOE and PPAR Î³ polymorphisms act as inde   pendent determinants of reproductive efficiency. These data suggest  that the APOE*2 allele may follow the model of antagonist pleiotropy,  whereas the PPAR Î³ Pro/Ala genotype seems to exert beneficial ef   fects both early in life and in advanced age in a gender specific way .",2008

The main reason for the increasing incidence of MM in the general population is greater sun exposure .  Epidemiologic studies confirm that UV radiation is the main factor in   volved in the pathogenesis of the disease . Among phenotypic factors,  fair pigmentation and low tanning ability are the most important risk factors . In recent years there has been a increasing interest in the role of vitamin D and its active metabolites in MM susceptibility  . Sun   light induces production of vitamin D that has been associated with  antiproliferative and pro differentiative effects in both melanocytes and cutaneous melanoma cells mediated through the vitamin D receptor  .  In this study we explore the interaction between sunlight exposure and vitamin D receptor gene polymorphisms in the etiology of MM . This case control study included 131 consecutive Spanish MM pa   tients from the Dermatology Unit of the Gregorio MaraÃ±Ã³n Hospital and 245 control subjects frequency matched for sex and age . Phenotypic  information was collected using a standardized questionnaire . Four SNPs in the vitamin D receptor gene (VDR) were genotyped .

Methods and findings: PubMed, Web of Science, and HuGENet da   tabases were searched for breast cancer case control association  studies. Summary odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals  were calculated for three genetic models (homozygotes, heterozy   gotes, and per allele comparisons), using random effects analyses .  The strength of the epidemiological evidence was evaluated on the basis of recently proposed criteria . We found that meta analyses of  published data and consortium analyses were substantially based on different data . Published data by non consortium teams amounted on average to 26 .9% of all available data (range 3 .0% 50 .0%) . The cor   relation coefficient of the I2 heterogeneity estimates of the two ap   proaches was 0 .47 (p,0 .001), and that of the OR estimates was 0 .44  (p,0 .002) .

The  study of these loci over an evolutionary timescale becomes especially  relevant to understand better the mechanisms behind these human  specific pathogenic expansions. In a previous study of the ATXN3  lo  cus, responsible for Machado Joseph disease, we found evidence for  an alternative, multi step mechanism promoting allelic variation within  the normal range, either by slippage replication of multiple CAGs or gene conversion . To gain insight into the wild type alleles that might  have been involved in the expansion process, we have now com   pared the flanking STR backgrounds of different normal sized alleles  with the ancestral expanded haplotypes from the same SNP based  lineage, in 67 MJD families (42 from the GTGGCA and 25 from the TTACAC haplotypes), analysed as before . Pairwise comparisons did  not show a direct correlation between the size of wild type haplotypes and its genetic distance to expanded alleles . For lineage TTACAC, the  genetic background of expanded alleles was identical to those with 20  and 28 CAGs (RST,0); for GTGGCA, a close relationship was found  between expanded chromosomes and (CAG)23 and (CAG)27 alleles . These results led us to propose the possibility of a multi step mutation   al mechanism, underlying also the process of de novo  expansions in  MJD . Assuming that similar mechanisms may be driving other repeti   tive tracts, we plan to study the evolutionary dynamics at the ATXN1 ,  DRPLA , ATXN7 , KLHL1AS , PPP2R2B , TBP, and FMR1  loci .

The clinical spectrum of  CADASIL varies widely and the disease is probably under diagnosed in stroke patients . Methods Between 1/November/06 and 31/October/07, all patients aged 18 55  years presenting with a first stroke event to any of 12 major neurology  hospital departments in Portugal were offered genetic screening for  CADASIL. Strokes were classified according to usual clinical and brain  imaging criteria. Mutational analysis was limited to PCR amplification  and sequencing of NOTCH3  exons 4, 11, 18/19, as these have been  previously shown to contain ~80% of the mutations identified in Portu   guese patients with CADASIL . ResultsOut of a total of 625 eligible patients, 493 (78 .9%) consented to the ge   netic analysis . Of these, 74% had ischaemic strokes, of which 28 .5% were cryptogenic . Seven different missense mutations in the  NOTCH3   gene were found in 8 patients (prevalence,1 .6%; 95%CI: 0 .8 3 .1%):  p .R163W; p .P167S; p .T577A; p .G595S; p .S978R (n,2); p .H981Y;  p.R1036Q. There was no significant association with any particular  type of stroke . None of these patients had a previous diagnosis or family history of CADASIL . Conclusion The minimal estimate for the prevalence of NOTCH3  mutations among  Portuguese young adults presenting with first stroke is at least 1000 times higher than the estimated population prevalence of CADASIL .

Both intraa   mygdalar injection and overexpression experiments in animals have  demonstrated that increases of NPY in the amygdala reduces alcohol intake and anxiety manifestations in anxious rats . In humans, some  studies have associated the Leu7Pro polymorphism in the NPY with alcohol consumption, but the evidence is scarce . In the Spanish Medi   terranean population, the Leu7Pro variant is not polymorphic . Thus,  our aim was to identify novel exonic variants in the NPY as well as the  study previously described intronic variants, and their association with alcohol consumption in this population . Methods: 911 subjects (321 men and 590 women) from the Spanish Mediterranean population were recruited . Alcohol consumption and  demographic and lifestyle variables were measured . Nucleotide se   quence determination and SNP analyses were carried out . Results: Only one exonic SNP was detected by direct sequencing  (1258G>A or rs9785023; allele frequency 0 .47) . From the intronic  markers chosen (483A>G or rs13235938, 2517A>G or rs4722342 and  7065A>G or rs 4722343), only the last ones were polymorphic (allele frequencies 0 .46 and 0 .40 respectively), and none of them were asso   ciated with alcohol consumption . However, the 1258G>A SNP was as   sociated (recessive pattern) with higher alcohol intake in drinkers . This  association was particularly relevant in men with a moderate intake (40Â±9 g/d in GG, 41Â±8 g/d in GA and 59Â±5 g/day in AA; p<0 .05) . Conclusions: The 1258G>A in the NPY is associated with alcohol con   sumption in the Mediterranean population .",2008

Earlier we proposed a fast automatic  algorithm for splitting large pedigrees for subsequent Lander Green  based analysis (Liu et al, 2008). The algorithm is specifically aimed to  deal with pedigrees obtained in disease oriented studies in genetically  isolated populations, where affected individuals are remotely related to each other through multiple lines of descent . In contrast to pedigrees with rare diseases, in the pedigrees collected  for quantitative trait analysis many close relatives having measured phenotypes and genotypes are considered as individuals of interest .  We present a graph theory based algorithm for automatic splitting such pedigrees on the fragments of restricted size . This algorithm iteratively  selects the clique with maximum weight of its edges from the cliques  of restricted size. Weight of edge is defined as kinship between two individuals corresponding to clique nodes . The algorithm is implement   ed in a software package PedStr (http://mga .bionet .nsc .ru/soft/index .html) . We compared our program PedStr and the Greffa (Falchi et al, 2004)  program and demonstrated that linkage power calculated on the base  of sub pedigrees obtained by PedStr was higher than for sub pedi   grees obtained by Greffa .",2008

Microalbuminuria, defined as urine albumin to creatinine ratio of 0 .03 to 0 .299 mg/mg, is one of the recently recognised factors as   sociated with increased risk of developing cardiovascular disorders in the general population . Multiple genetic epidemiological studies have  shown that there are genetic causes associated with predisposition to the excretion of abnormal amounts of albumin in the urine . One of these is the R229Q functional variant in the podocin gene, NPHS2 .  Pereira and co authors have shown that R229Q is associated with a 2 .77 fold risk for developing microalbuminuric state even after adjust   ment for age, ethnicity, hypertension, obesity, and diabetes (Pereira et al ., 2004) .

INTRODUCTION: Serotonin transporter gene SLC6A4  (17q11 .1 12)  is one of the basic genes, which define an overall performance of se   rotoninergic neuromediators system . Its functional condition can be  reflected on some aspects of intellectual activity of the person. METHODS: The level of intellectual development (IQ) is certain at 250  unrelated individuals in the age of 18 35 years by nonverbal Kettel test . According to parameters IQ examinees are divided into three groups:  with a normal level of intellectual development (IQ within the limits of 90 110 points), high (above 110 points) and low (below 90 points) .  The analysis of genetic polymorphism 5 HTTLPR  is carried out by a  method PCR .

The families were also divided  by genetic classification (138 autosomal recessive cases and 163 sporadic cases) . All of them were analysed by a genotype microarray  specific for arRP (Asper), which tested more than 500 mutations in  16 recessive RP genes: CERKL, CNGA1, CNGB1, MERKT, PDE6A,  PDE6B, PNR, RDH12, RGR, PLBP1, SAG, TULP1, CRB1, RPE65,  USH2A and USH3A.Results . No mutation was found in LCA group . The mutation frequen   cy was slightly higher in non early onset (21,5%) than in early onset  (16,6%) families but these differences werenât significatives. The al   lele frequencies were: CERKL 2,9% (18/602), CNGA1 0,9% (6/602),  PDE6A 0,6% (4/602), PDE6B 0,3% (2/602), RLBP1 0,3% (2/602), SAG 0,5% (3/602), CRB1 0,6% (4/602) and USH2A 7,8% (47/602) .

The Bayash  in Croatia represent one population of largely shared paternal genetic  history characterized by substantial percentage (44%) of common H1 M82 and E3b1 M78 lineages . Relatively ancient expansion signals  and limited diversity of Indian specific H1 M82 lineages imply descent  from closely related paternal ancestors who could have been settled  in the Indian subcontinent between 7th and 9th centuries AD . Minimal  time divergence of the Bayash subpopulations is consistent with their  putative migratory split within Romania towards Wallachia and Trans   ilvania . Substantial percentage of E3b1 lineages and high associated  microsatellite variance in the Bayash men is a reflection of significant  admixture with majority populations from the Vardar Morava Danube  catchment basin   possibly a common paternal signature of Romani populations in Southeastern Europe . Additional traces of admixture are evident in the modest presence of typical European haplogroups .Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology ",2008

","Human Y chromosome short tandem repeat (Y STR) markers show  a high level of polymorphism and a significant degree of discrimina   tion between individuals . Analysis of human Y STR polymorphism has  become a very useful tool both in evolutionary studies and in forensic  casework, due in part to the loci being recombination free during meio   sis and paternally inheritance. In order to define the Y chromosome  genetic structure in Tunisian population, 17 Y STRs were typed in  159 unrelated healthy males in two ethnic groups (ââAndalusiansââ and  Berber) and one cosmopolitan population (Tunis) from Tunisia, using  AmpFLSTRÂ® Yfilerâ¢ PCR Amplification Kit (AB Applied Biosystems). Allele and haplotype frequencies, standard diversity indices, pairwise  genetic distances (RST) and analysis of molecular variance (AMO   VA) were calculated with the software Arlequin version 2 .000 . A total  number of 111 haplotypes were identified by the 17 Y STR loci in our  study sample and 91 haplotypes were unique . All the groups analysed  showed high haplotype diversities, the highest value being observed in the ââAndalusiansââ sample: 0 .9924 +/  0 .0104 for ââCosmopolitanââ;  0 .9765 +/  0 .0132 for Berbers from Sened; 0 .9886 +/  0 .0131 for Ber   bers from Chenini Douiret; 0 .8367 +/  0 .0547 for Berbers from Jeradou  and 0 .9940 +/  0 .0095 for Andalusians . The highest diversity revealed  for Chenini Douiret using this Y STR is not expected, as compared to mtDNA or autosomic markers analysis . The hierarchical analysis of  variance carried out between the Berber and Arabic speaking groups  failed to demonstrate any significant differentiation between them.  These results corroborate the absence of overall genetic differentia   tion between Berbers and Arabs in Tunisia .",2008

The multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification assay (MLPA)  was initially developed for detection of DNA deletions or duplications, but is also suitable for genotyping single point polymorhisms (SNPs) . We designed an allele discrimination assay for simultaneous genotyp   ing of at least 10 20 SNPs in a large number of samples using the MLPA technology  . Based on the MLPA probe design protocol we con   structed 3 probes per SNP: 2 allele specific and 1 locus specific, which  after ligation were PCR amplified and size separated using capillary  electrophoresis. In addition to the template specific sequence each of  the MLPA probes contain a variable length stuffer sequence enabling  both SNPs and alleles to be discriminated by size, and a primer spe   cific sequence common to all probes, thus permitting multiplex PCR using only one primer set . We applied the method on two genes for which the genetic variation was covered by 12 and 19 tagging SNPs, respectively  . Genotyping  results were verified using CEPH controls with known genotypes. Applying the MLPA method will enable most labs to genotype SNPs in  a medium scale without investing in new lab equipment as the method only requires a PCR machine and a capillary electrophoresis system .",2008

Normal repeat tract (in healthy  people) consists of 6 37 triplets with 1 3 CAT interruptions whereas mutant alleles contain pure repeat tracts from 39 70 CAG . CAT inter   ruptions are thought to serve as stabilizing factor  . We have studied frequency of alleles without CAT interruptions among  normal size alleles from different Siberian populations (855 individu   als): Yakuts (the highest level of SCA1 accumulation) and Buryats, Tu   vinians, Russians, Tatars, Kirghiz, Altaians and Khantys (without SCA1  accumulation). It is the first estimation of prevalence of homogeneous  (CAG)n of normal length in SCA1 gene in different ethnic groups of  Siberia with distinct contribution of European and Asian components in the their gene pools .

In DECIPHER, molecularly defined rearrangements (e.g. from array  CGH) are mapped on to the reference sequence for viewing in En   sembl. Genes within the affected region are identified and prioritised according to their relevance to the phenotype . Clusters of rearrange   ments within the same region in patients with comparable phenotypes  enable new syndromes to be defined and published. Other features in DECIPHER which aid in the interpretation of microar   ray data include: Trio analysis tool   A trio of an affected individual and parents are anal   ysed to determine de novo or familial/inherited conditions . Gene prioritisation tool   advanced text mining searches PubMed for associations between highlighted genes and phenotypes . Search tool   a search engine for âconsentedâ data within DECIPHER to  facilitate the identification of rearrangement clusters and links between phenotype and genomic location . DECIPHER enables international collaborative research on develop   mental disorders and provides a powerful knowledge base for clinical diagnosis and management of patients with congenital abnormalities .",2008

Blepharophimosis syndrome (BPES), an  autosomal dominant condition affecting eyelid and ovary development,  is caused by mutations in the FOXL2 gene . Its expression is strictly  regulated, which was illustrated by the recent identification of deletions  upstream and downstream of its transcription unit as underlying cause of BPES . We demonstrated that these rearrangements remove sev   eral conserved non coding sequences (CNCs) harbouring potential  long range cis regulatory elements . Here, we used Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) to identify  long range interactions of cis regulatory elements with the FOXL2  pro  moter in two adult FOXL2  expressing cellular systems . We found that  in adult ovarian granulosa cells and fibroblasts three long range cis  regulatory sequences located 177 kb, 283 kb and 360 kb upstream of  FOXL2  come in close vicinity to the FOXL2  core promoter  . Noteworthy,  3C in human fibroblasts derived from a BPES patient with a heterozy   gous deletion of the region encompassing the regulatory element at  283 kb, revealed decrease of interaction of the deleted element and  the FOXL2  core promoter and the two other regulatory elements . In   terestingly, the element at 283 kb corresponds to a sequence deleted in the Polled Intersex (PIS) goat, which is an animal model for BPES .  In conclusion, we hypothesize that the interaction between the cis  regulatory element located at 283 kb and the FOXL2  core promoter  is essential to establish efficient transcriptional regulation of FOXL2   expression .",2008

","Introduction: BehÃ§etâs disease (BD) is a multisystemic immuno inflam   matory disorder characterized by a generalized vasculitis, particularly at oral and genital mucosa and eye (uveitis) . Although there is evi   dence for environmental risk factors, epidemiological and family stud   ies strongly support the existence of genetic risk factors for BD . The  only established genetic predisposition for BD is the HLA B*51 alelle on chr  . 6p21, which explains only 19% of its overall genetic suscep   tibility  . Furthermore, a recent linkage study on Turkish families found  strong evidence for linkage with BD at 6p22 24 and 12p12 13 . Case  control association studies on biological candidate genes have so far mostly been inconclusive . To identify new susceptibility genes for BD,  we are conducting the âgenomic convergenceâ approach, which com   bines data from whole genome linkage screens with expression stud   ies to determine which genes will be tested in association studies . Methods & Materials: We performed gene expression profiling in  peripheral blood mononuclear cells of carefully matched cases and controls using Affymetrix GeneChip Human Genome U133 Plus 2 .0 microarrays . Results: Preliminary analyses identified 131 genes differentially ex   pressed among 11 cases and 11 controls (1 .2 fold change cutoff and  p value<0 .05), 18 of which map to the linkage peaks in Turkish fami   lies . Conclusions: These 18 genes differentially expressed among BD pa   tients and controls constitute excellent candidates genes for associa   tion studies in this disease.

By the use of multi capillary sequencers, high throughput  routine screening becomes feasible, but requires the availability of reli   able automatic mutation detection software . DATA ANALYSIS is performed directly on the ABI .FSA files. Files are  imported in batches through the use of a BioNumerics Â® plugin, a script  based dynamic extension of the software that uses a file naming strat   egy to automatically import up to 200 traces with up to 20 samples each . BioNumericsÂ® provides an adapted database environment to  store all imported data and takes care of all data management activi   ties . The plugin offers a proper analysis tool for the mutation detection:  Peak matching is done using a proprietary algorithm that uses five  user adjustable curve parameters allowing to compare normalized peak shapes . The result is a fast, sensitive and reliable peak matching  that can be used to discriminate typical âwild type samplesâ from âhet   erozygous mutantsâ . For each target PCR product, one or more target  variants can be defined, allowing the creation of polymorphic variants.

However, a stumbling block  has been the difficult question of how to leverage this information to identify molecular mechanisms that explain quantitative trait loci (QTL) .  We have developed a formal statistical test to quantify the strength of a causal inference pertaining to a measured factor, e .g ., a molecular  species, which potentially mediates the causal association between a locus and a quantitative trait . We applied the test to infer causal  relationships between transcript abundances and obesity traits in mice and also to reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks in yeast . We  treat the causal inference as a âchainâ of mathematical conditions that  must be satisfied to conclude that the potential mediator is causal for  the trait, where the inference is only as good as the weakest link in the chain . This perspective naturally leads to the Intersection Union Test  framework in which a series of statistical tests are combined to form an omnibus test . Using computer simulated mouse crosses, we show that type I error is low under a variety of non causal null models . We  show that power under a simple causal model is comparable to other  model selection techniques as well as Bayesian network reconstruc   tion methods .

Such description is not full . The full description of DNA  hybridization process should be done in the framework of stochas   tic model . For the stochastic description of DNA hybridization, let us  introduce the conditional probability function, that there are a certain  number of DNA duplexes on substrate at moment of time, provided  that at a preceding moment of time on substrate there were another number of DNA duplexes . Let us consider DNA hybridization process as a discrete Markov process . We obtained equation for the change  of conditional probability in time . Using this equation it is possible to  calculate not only an average number of DNA duplexes, but also dis   persion, correlation function and spectral density of DNA duplexes  number on substrate . It is shown, that with raising the concentration  of single stranded DNA in solution the dispersion of DNA duplexes on  substrate increases, and then passing through a maximum decreases,  and at a very high concentration of single stranded DNA the dispersion approaches zero . The results we have obtained can be used in DNA chip technology  . In many cases, the basic source of random variations  of a signal during information read out from DNA chip is fluctuation of  concentration of immobilized DNA, and this is result of chip production  technology. Our calculations indicate that another source of fluctuation  is present, which is connected to the stochastic nature of DNA hybrid   ization process .",2008

Nevertheless, DYRK1A  function at the molecular level remains poorly understood . As DYRK1A  substrates include several transcription factors, we have analyzed the  impact of Dyrk1a dose reduction on the transcriptome of mouse cere   bral cortex at postnatal day 0 (P0) and 7 (P7) . To this end, global gene  expression of Dyrk1a+/  and Dyrk1a+/+ cortices were compared using Affymetrix chips . Microarray results revealed deep changes in gene expression extend   ing into the set of 3169 genes analyzed . Among those, 22% and 5%  showed different expression levels between genotypes at P0 and P7 respectively (adj p<0 .05) . Despite this global perturbation, changes in  the expression of individual genes were subtle: only 1% (at P0) and  3% (at P7) of the differentially expressed genes showed a fold change >2 . Gene Ontology analysis revealed enrichment in transporters within  the down regulated genes and in DNA binding molecules within the up regulated genes both, at P0 and at P7 . Among the genes deregulated between genotypes, 61 were common to both developmental stages .  Interestingly, their regulation showed a similar trend at P0 and P7 but  always opposite to the developmental trend (defined by the expression of such genes in Dyrk1a+/+ mice at P7 vs P0) . These results suggest that DYRK1A plays a pivotal role in cerebral cortex development acting on the regulation of the transcriptome .",2008

Previous studies  have used evolutionary conservation as an indicator of regulatory  potential, but increasing evidence suggests that this criterion system   atically overlooks functional sequences . We thus designed our study without any bias towards a particular sequence feature . We chose a  mouse BAC corresponding to a region of Hsa21 because it contains  the olig1 and olig2 genes that are expressed specifically in the CNS.  In order to screen this fragment systematically for enhancer activity,  we generated a library of 121 overlapping clones (sizes: 2 4kb) in a LacZ reporter lentiviral construct containing a minimal promoter  . We  generated lentivectors individually for each segment and injected them in pools of 10 or 20 in mouse oocytes . LacZ staining was performed  on E11 embryos to identify expression patterns. The first six pools tested yielded 60 of 242 LacZ positive embryos with ~2 .5 transgenes  per embryo. To date, 7 fragments of 52 assessed were identified that  potentially contain gene expression regulators. To confirm regulatory  activity, 4 sequences were re injected individually, 2 (one evolutionary  conserved) of which were confirmed as tissue specific enhancers with  stainings in the spinal chord and trigeminal ganglion compatible with olig expression .

Especially in  combination with archival tissue samples with well documented fol   low up data, it enables the analysis of genomic changes underlying tumour development . Unfortunately, DNA isolated from archival, for   malin fixed, paraffin embedded (FFPE) material, is often degraded  and therefore difficult to label. In theory, labelling techniques that skip the use of enzymes would be the best option . Therefore, we compared  the non enzymatic Universal Linkage System (ULS) and conventional random priming to label DNA isolated from FFPE material . Testing  of FFPE samples that had been stored for up to 17 years showed Genomics, technology, bioinformatics 0that ULS labelling yielded satisfying degrees of labelling (DoL~1 .5%),  while the ones for random priming were ~0 .2% . Reproducibility of the analysis of these samples on BAC arrays was better as well (R2,0 .96 for ULS vs R2,0 .88 for random priming) . In addition, aCGH applications involve substantial amounts of genom   ic DNA, while the amount of DNA available is often limited, requir   ing whole genome amplification (WGA). Recently, Qiagenâs REPLI g has been optimized for degraded samples . Therefore, we compared  BAC aCGH experiments using 100ng of FFPE DNA, labelled using  either direct random priming or a combination of REPLI g and ULS or REPLI g and random priming . Correlation with data obtained using  conventional microgram amounts of input DNA data was best for the REPLI g/ULS combination (R2,0 .84 vs 0 .70 for random priming), as  was reproducibility  .

For a 50x coverage, only half a million nucleotides are needed for CFTR sequence analysis, i .e . 0 .5% of the full capacity of the GS FLX  system . Therefore, 100 200 samples should be pooled in order to use  the full capacity of the GS FLX system . We therefore also developed  an universal sample tagging approach allowing the pooling of more  than 100 samples with one set of 260 primers (60 amplicon specific and 200 tagging primers) . This compares to 6000 primers if amplicon  specific PCR primers are tagged as such. This technique is readily transferable to any gene, allowing sequenc   ing of more than 100 samples for the same gene, or even different genes, in an economically feasible way  .",2008

The transition of embryonic to  adult cardiomyocytes is associated to changes in the expression pat   terns of different proteins . Aim of this study is the identification of nuclear proteins whose expres   sion is modified during cardiac differentiation. A proteomic approach, based on two dimensional electrophoresis was utilized . The experi   mental model is the H9C2, a myoblast cell line derived from embry   onic rat ventricle . These cells proliferate in medium with 10% serum,  instead low serum and stimulation with retinoic acid induce differentia   tion versus cardiomyocytes . We have analyzed the nuclear extracts of H9C2 that are grown in  proliferation medium and in differentiation medium by proteomic ap   proach . Seven different proteins have been identified as differentially expressed after MALDI TOFF, LC ESI MS/MS mass spectrometry  . An interesting  protein is SM22 alpha (transgelin), a 22 KD cytoskeletal protein that is a marker of smooth muscle cells . The level of the SM22 alpha is reduced at 20 th day of differentiation  condition. These data are confirmed by Western Blot analysis and quantitative RT PCR . By immunochemistry, we confirmed the nuclear localization of the pro   tein in H9C2 cell line . Furthermore, in histological section of human  embryonic heart we show that SM22 alpha is located at nuclear level  in heart vessels and in myocytes of the cardiac outflow. Thus, our data indicate that SM22 alpha can be localized in the nucle   us and suggest that this localization is regulated during developmentP08.37methylation sensitive High Resolution melting Analysis as a diagnostic tool for Beckwith Wiedemann and silver Russell  syndromes. M. Alders , J. Bliek, K. vd Lip, R. vd Boogaard, M. Mannens;   Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. The Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) and Silver Russell syn   drome (SRS) are caused by disturbed imprinting at 11p15 . This region  harbors two independently regulated clusters of imprinted genes . The  first cluster is under control of the IC1 upstream of the H19 promoter,  which is methylated only at the paternal allele . The second cluster is  controlled by IC2 upstream of the KCNQ1OT1 promoter and is meth   ylation on the maternal allele only  . BWS is an overgrowth syndrome . The majority of the patients display hypermethylation of IC1, hypomethylation of IC2 or both . SRS is a  growth retardation syndrome and in a subset of patients a hypometh   ylation of IC1 is found, opposite to the aberration found in BWS pa   tients . Molecular confirmation of BWS and SRS is done by methylation analy   sis of IC1 and IC2 . Since the methylation defects in BWS and SRS are  mosaic the test must be quantitative . We set out to validate High Resolution Melting Analysis (HRMA) for  methylation analysis in BWS/SRS diagnostics . Advantages of this  method are that it is fast, cost effective and requires no post PCR handling . We tested a group of 17 BWS/SRS patients with different  levels of hyper  and hypomethylation at IC1 and/or IC2 and 45 normal  controls. All patients showed a melting profile different from the normal  controls and the degree of deviation was consistent with the degree of hypo  or hypermethylation as determined by southern blotting . In  conclusion, HRMA analysis proofs to be a fast, reliable and sensitive diagnostic tool for BWS and SRS .",2008

In high resolution melting, multiple  CpG sites within the same PCR fragment can be detected homoge   neously. Unlike the common real time methylation specific PCR tech   nique (MethylLight Taqman probe detection) hi res melting provides more information with fewer PCRs . As 5 methylcytosines are resistant  to conversion to uracils, there can be substantial sample to sample  melting differences depending on the number of CpG dinucleotide sites and the sequence context within the fragment . However, depend   ing upon fragment and the exact number of 5 methylcytosines actually  converted during the bisulfite treatment, there can be both variation in  replicate conversions of the same sample and very subtle melting dif   ferences between samples . Both of these problems are resolved with calibrated melting . Calibration has especially been helpful to increase  accuracy of genotyping when melting differences are subtle . This tech   niques improves hi res melting reproducibility and genotyping calls via  synthetic oligonucleotide probes . We used melt calibration in conjunc   tion with amplicon methylation analysis to improve our detection in a highly methylated region .

However, it needs  to be shown that the sensitivity and the user friendliness are at least as  good as the current state of the art . We set up an extensive validation in 3 laboratories . The first objective was to design a complete primer set for BRCA1 and BRCA2 . Indeed, the performance of HRM is largely depending on  PCR quality. Critical criteria were specific banding patterns after gel  electrophoresis, sigmoid curves on real time PCR plots and less than 3 melting domains per amplicon . About 300 known variations are being tested in a blinded way  .

This  study was implemented in the EuroGentest evaluation program for new techniques in genome diagnostics . Investigations were carried out  using a panel of >189 variants and 327 wt controls . We optimized and  evaluated 58 primer sets that cover BRCA1 . All heterozygous variants could be detected using the Call IT 1 .5 software resulting in a 100% mutation detection sensitivity  . These variants also include small DNA  deletions and insertions . Out of 327 wts we observed 3,7% false posi   tive curves (FP) resulting in a specificity of 96%. Re evaluation of ten  BRCA1 amplicons in the two other diagnostic laboratories gave rise to identical results . Moreover using unlabeled probes we were able to  identify many frequent occurring polymorphisms, omitting unnecessary sequence analysis . Finally we selected a set of 41 best performing  primers that encompass the entire BRCA1 gene using stringent criteria  and performed 2 blind tests on 27 patient DNA samples that were se   quenced in parallel.

Human neural crest cells (hNCC) form in the embryo at the  end of the first month of pregnancy, although the precise dates have remained elusive . Most NCC differentiate completely into melanocytes,  all components of the peripheral nervous system, certain endocrine  cells and connective and structural tissues in the head, although par  tially competent NCC progenitors continue to reside in many tissues in animal models . Due to their inaccessibility and despite their devel   opmental importance, the original properties and restriction of hNCC potential over time have never been examined . Here, we demonstrate  when and how to isolate self renewing hNCC and report the resul   tant study of their transcriptome by serial analysis of gene expression (SAGE) . In addition to highlighting candidate disease genes, we have  identified novel markers that distinguish hNCC from other human cell  types and distinguished between evolutionarily conserved and spe   cies specific NCC properties.

As re   search interest in small non coding RNAs is rapidly expanding beyond  miRNAs, the capability of the pipeline to design assays for other small  RNAs including small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs), and PIWI interacting RNAs (piRNAs) is extremely valuable .  Assays for over 100 endogenous siRNAs have been designed us   ing the same design pipeline as for miRNAs . Preliminary data shows  similar performance as miRNA assays with minimal background in the presence of tissues and cell lines for these siRNA quantitation assays .  In conclusion, we have developed a robust pipeline to successfully design TaqMan miRNA assays . Recent data demonstrates the ability Genomics, technology, bioinformatics 0of the pipeline to design TaqMan assays for quantitation of siRNAs as  well as the potential for designing assays for other small RNA genes .",2008

Evolutionary data and the lack of introns in mtDNA suggest  that many of these polymorphisms have functional significance, and  there are many reports suggesting that some polymorphisms or con   tinent specific mtDNA lineages (haplogroups) are associated with an increased risk of certain complex diseases or traits . Association data,  haplogroup definitions, sequences, polymorphisms and structural and  functional features of mtDNA encoded genes form an immense body  of knowledge which is currently scattered around different databases and resources . Current mtDNA databases have been designed princi   pally to be viewed by human researchers and do not provide uniform  access to all data and are therefore not optimal for data mining or  other purposes where hypotheses are tested against huge amounts of heterogeneous data . The semantic web is an emerging technology which allows integration  of almost any kind of data in a framework which also makes it possible  for computers to perform inference tasks in an unified and standard   ized manner  . Mitochondrial Information Integration Initiative (MitoI3)  aims at developing an open resource that will collect data on available  human mtDNA sequences, polymorphisms, haplogroup definitions and other aspects of mitochondrial genomics .

The en   zyme 5,10 methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) is involved  in maintaining folate and homocysteine homeostasis and common genetic variations, c .677C>T and c .1298A>C, in the  MTHFR  gene are  associated with decreased enzyme activity and altered folate levels,  which may predispose to increased susceptibility to the anti folate ef   fects of MTX therapy  . Here, we studied the effects of these variations  for MTX response in a total of 298 Finnish patients who had either rheumatoid (218) or psoriatic arthritis (80) . Together with genotyping  we also analyzed folate, homocysteine, ALAT, and B12 vitamin levels  as well as clinical patient data concerning toxicity and efficiency of the MTX treatments . Finally, statistical analyses were done to evaluate  possible associations between the MTHFR  gene variations and MTX  toxicity and efficiency. Our results show that the patients with two nor   mal alleles (677TT/1298AA) are less likely to experience side effects  during MTX therapy although, no statistically significant association between variations and methotrexate toxicity was found . Remarkably,  MTHFR  677TT was recognised to be a risk genotype for elevated  ALAT as well as a serious risk factor for low folate and accordingly elevated homocysteine levels both during and after MTX treatment . In  addition, the state of the disease stayed remarkably more often active  in patients having 677TT genotype and low folate levels suggesting that MTHFR c .677C>T is critical genotype and should be taken into account in patient treatment strategy  .",2008

Clinical  symptoms are characterized by hipotonia, hyporreflexia, lack of move   ments and deglutory alterations . Typical dismorphologic and behav   ioural phenotype include hyperphagia obesity, hypogonadism, hypo   genitalism, mental retardation and bone maturation retardation . Lack of paternal contribution results in PWS either by paternal dele   tion in 15q11 q13 region (70%) or from maternal disomy (25%) . A few  cases (2 5%) are due to imprinting center mutations . Aims: We have performed a mutational screening of large deletions  in 15q11 q13 region and the metilation analysis of SNRPN  gene in 37  patients with PWS clinical features. The aim of this study is to confirm  clinical diagnosis, to evaluate the main genetic alterations in our popu   lation and provide supportive genetic counselling to the families . Material and Methods: Patients DNA was obtained by robotic extraction  (EZ1, Qiagen) . The MLPA technique was performed by the commer   cially available PWS Kit from MRC Holland . This kit allows large dele   tions screening in 15q11 q13 region genes in two PCR reactions and  the methylation study of SNRPN  by HhaI enzyme digestion .

Results and Conclusion: The MLPA genetic analysis has allowed PWS  diagnostic confirmation in 16.2% patients with clinical criteria. Two de   letions in 15q11 q13 region and 4 maternal uniparental disomy were found . We conclude that PWS is well characterized by the MLPA tech   nique .",2008

Genome screening using array CGH has great potential in the char   acterization of numerous unexplained chromosomal aberrations . The  whole genome Sub Megabase Resolution Tiling Array (SMRT array)  is capable of identifying microamplifications and microdeletions at a resolution of 100 Kb . The aim of this study was to show the utility of this SMRT arrays to  provide precise information about the size and breakpoints of DNA copy number gains and losses . Methods: We present a patient with microcephaly, epilepsy and men   tal retardation, with a female normal karyotipe 46, XX . A SMRT array,  (from Wan Lam Laboratory at the BC Cancer Research Centre) analy   sis was performed . Moreover, two MLPA kits (SALSA P096 and SAL   SA, from MRC Holland) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) technique were carried out . Results: The SMRT array analysis showed a 4p subtelomeric deletion  of 1.25 Mb. MLPA study of the specific 4p16.3 subtelomeric region  confirmed this microdeletion. Five of the sixteen specific probes of  MLPA kit, located in the new defined WHSCR 2, were deleted. FISH  assays showed a deleted pattern with the 4p subtelomeric probe but  normal results were obtained when hybridization was performed with  specific WHS probe. Conclusions: The SMRT array study confirms the small deletion WH   SCR 2 previously detected by MLPA and not detected by WHS FISH . SMRT array arises as an effective technique to detect DNA microvari   ations and provides more information about their size and precise breakpoints .",2008

Preliminary sequence comparisons have yielded examples  of diverse types of mechanisms that could account for the observed  differences in mRNA levels, such as multiple gene duplications, inser   tion of transposable elements in 3â UTR or upstream regions, and a single nucleotide mutation in the polyA signal . In addition, as an ex   ample of the proposed strategy, a global analysis of the regulatory se   quences of the thrombospondin 4 ( THBS4 ) gene has been carried out .  This gene is involved in synapse formation and shows a six fold up   regulation in humans that is specific of the forebrain. Interestingly, an  excess of nucleotide changes and an Alu insertion were found in the  THBS4  promoter region in the human lineage . However, in vitro  gene  reporter assays indicated that the human and chimpanzee promoter  fragments have similar transcriptional activity, and computational pre   diction of transcription factor binding sites suggests that THBS4  up  regulation could be due to changes in trans acting regulators .

Sequence polymor   phisms (SNPs) are more sensible than length polymorphisms (STRs) and less prone to ADO (allelic dropout) when WGA is applied . Thus,  we recently validated a panel of TaqMan SNP assays selected to show an high sensibility in LCN templates .

The  absence of a full concordance for 10 pg samples is referred as ADO  occurring when a gDNA heterozygote genotype is scored as homo   zygote but it should not lead to mis typing if only heterozygous geno   types are considered.

Diagnostic and clinical validations in DNA diagnostic laboratories: a BRcA example,P09.01,"D. Bodmer , M. R. Arjen, S. Hans, H. Nicoline, L. J. L. Marjolijn","Department of Human Genetics, Nijmegen, The Netherlands","Clinical validations are used to assess the clinical sensitivity and speci   ficity of genetic testing within DNA diagnostic laboratories and are an  important instrument to monitor and further improve reliability and ef   ficiency of molecular testing. However, for most indications the clini   cal information available to DNA diagnostic laboratories is too scarce to determine the a priori chance of a positive test result . In order to  assess the sensitivity and specificity of genetic testing, we started  with a so called diagnostic validation, in which the robustness of the  method(s) to analyze a single gene or a set of genes for a genetic dis   ease was determined . The parameter used is the mutation detection  ratio (MDR) which is defined as the proportion of mutation positive re   sults . By comparing the MDR of a genetic test at different time intervals (e .g . years), the robustness of this test can be judged . This robustness  depends on changes and variations that occur within a method (with  or without preceding analytical validation) as well as method perfor   mance by different operators . Decrease of the MDR of a genetic test  over time, should lead to critical evaluation of the different laboratory  processes and assessment of putative alterations in the a priori risk of the diagnostic requests . An example: The efficiency of BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation analysis has decreased within years . To determine the cause of this decrease, e .g . whether this is due to technical issues or solely to an altered re   ferral policy, we performed both a diagnostic validation as well as a clinical validation .",2008

Limited attention to pre screening information provision  was justified by the severity and treatability of the conditions screened.  Yet technological advances allow NBS programs to identify disorders  for which the promise of clinical benefit is uncertain as well as an array  of âincidentalâ findings (benign variants, carrier status results). Given  the contested value of such results, commentators argue that limited  attention to pre screening care is no longer justifiable. This paper re   ports survey data on attitudes and practices of a cross sectional strati   fied random sample of five health care professional (HCP) groups in  Ontario that are involved in prenatal care and/or care of newborns in  the first days of life (obstetricians, midwives, nurses, family physicians, pediatricians) . The majority of HCPs surveyed (68%) believe it is their  responsibility to provide information about NBS to parents prior to the heel prick test . However, as many as 48% of these providers report  that they do not consistently or usually do so . This paper explores the  role of provider type, practice barriers (e.g. insufficient time, training,  compensation) as well as knowledge and confidence of NBS in ex   plaining the discrepancy between perceived professional responsibil   ity and actual professional practice . Thus, while most HCPs perceive Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy a responsibility to provide information about NBS to parents prior to  the heelprick, many challenges face the provision of this increasingly  important pre screening care .",2008

As part of our study to examine how midwives provide  a genetic service in Victoria, Australia, we identified the barriers and facilitators of this practice, using a mixed methods approach . Qualita   tive data were collected from nine focus groups with midwives (n,50)  and two focus groups with experts in genetics (n,10), as well as 12 interviews with managers of hospital maternity services .

These  findings were validated with quantitative data collected from midwives  responding to a state wide survey (n,317, response rate 45 .4%) . Our  findings indicate that there is variation in the genetic practice of mid   wives . While each midwifeâs practice is contingent on their individual  competence, the scope of their practice is heavily influenced by the organisation in which they work . For example, each hospital provides  specific guidelines on what information needs to be collected to de   termine genetic risk, and what genetic tests should be discussed with  each pregnant woman. These findings suggest that programs that  only target midwifery competence will not be enough to effect practice change .

Since 50% of congenital deafness  is caused by genetic defect and clinical phenotype and prognosis in  part depend on genetic background, genetic testing for affected infants can provide useful information . In Japan, a newborn hearing screening has started as a government project in 2000 . In Nagano prefecture  of Japan (population 2 .2 million), a screening program has started in  2002 .

Although cascade  testing is known to detect carriers of CF, its effectiveness has been  questioned, in our clinical service and elsewhere, because most ba   bies with CF are born to couples who do not have a family history;  the uptake of cascade testing following a childâs diagnosis of CF by newborn screening has not been previously reported . We investigated CF cascade testing in the families of Victorian children with CF  .

The uptake of carrier testing amongst adult first and second degree relatives was 16% (190/1160) . Parents were the most likely relatives to  have been tested, followed by aunts/uncles, then grandparents . We conclude that cascade testing, as currently offered, is not an ef   fective strategy for detecting carriers for CF  . An alternative is to offer  population based screening and this occurs in some countries but with  quite variable uptake reported. Factors influencing uptake of CF carrier  testing need to be explored .

Methods Three focus groups were convened with health professionals  involved in the care of men with CF/CBAVD (representing genetics,  adult respiratory medicine, paediatrics, assisted reproduction and urol   ogy). The first two groups (5 & 7 participants respectively) explored awareness of genetics, ART and PGD . Concerns and training needs  were identified. Following patient interviews, a final focus group was convened to identify a common care pathway  . Results . Much uncertainty existed amongst non genetics specialisms  regarding the role of genetics services in the CF/CBAVD care path   way.

Patients with an Ashkenazi background have different mutations than  other ethnic groups and therefore, it would be advantageous to know  the ethnic background of patients to improve efficiency of mutation analysis . ï In prenatal screening for Down syndrome, background values for  Beta hCG and PAPP A differ between Afro Caribbean and West Eu   ropean women . ï In neonatal screening 16 diseases are tested in all 180 .000 newborns  in the Netherlands each year, including sickle cell anaemia, while only 40 .000 have an increased risk for that disorder  . ï Consanguineous marriages are common in people originating from North Africa, because of social advantages . The increased risk for au   tosomal recessive diseases in their offspring is mostly not known in the future parents . ï In association studies results can often not be reproduced by addi   tional studies . Ethnicity is an important cause . ï Finally, ethnicity is an issue in pharmacogenetics, for instance in pre   scribing beta blockers for heart failure in African Americans .It is dif   ficult to handle the issue of ethnicity in genetics correctly and little is done to change that attitude .

molecular testing for rare genetic disorders in Europe: hype or  hope?,P09.23,P. J. Willems,"GENDIA (GENetic DIAgnostic network), Antwerp, Belgium","Currently, there are huge differences between various countries in ac   cessibility, price and quality of molecular diagnostic testing . The bottle   necks include the vast number of genetic diseases (> 1000), the low  number of samples per disease, the nature of the disease mutation  often being a private mutation, the high cost of testing and lack of reim   bursement by governments and insurance companies, and the lack of  an international organised network of diagnostic labs combining their portfolio of tests . All these bottlenecks impair a cost effective and re   liable diagnostic service, thereby holding molecular testing in many countries in a preclinical era . However, the quality, accessibility and  cost effectiveness of diagnostic tests for rare genetic disorders could  be substantially improved by the creation of an international network  of diagnostic labs combining their portfolio of tests and exchanging  samples for rare genetic disorders. The first network of diagnostic labs  offering genetic tests internationally was incorporated four years ago, and is called GENDIA (for GENetic DIAgnostic Network) . It consists of  âreferral labsâ sending samples to GENDIA, âtest labsâ testing samples  they receive from GENDIA, and a central GENDIA lab coordinating the network .

Genetic counselling (GC) and prenatal  diagnosis (PND) are performed as medical facilities in a limited num   ber of genetic centres . To evaluate the real impact of GC and PND  on genetic diseases prevention, we surveyed during three years 2862 couples /families who were referred to our center  . We evaluated the  impact of GC on parentsâ attitude by analyzing the occurrence of preg   nancies and the acceptance of prenatal screening and PND . Param   eters were correlated to parentsâ age, socioeconomic situation, and education level; and to the disease . Our results showed that people in  Tunisia ask for GC and follow it in most cases . The response quality  is variable depending on the patientsâ education and their socio eco   nomic class . This is in some ways different from other Arab countries  with similar cultural and religious backgrounds, probably due to social  and legislative differences . At present, GC and PND seems to be the  method of choice for prevention of genetic diseases in Tunisia and  such services should be developed as a priority despite the financial costs of such a programme . .",2008

Clinical geneticists  were the most supportive for context dependent definitions. Human  geneticists uphold that it should be best reserved for DNA/cytogenetic  testing, whereas other groups supported a wider definition. Medical  applications (and scientific research for many) should always be cov   ered, but most believed non medical applications (paternity testing,  criminal identification) should not. Monogenic and susceptibility testing  gathered consensus, but about 50% thought non disease linked poly   morphisms should be excluded . For 3/4, somatic mutations belonged  within the definition. DNA, chromosomes and gene products were al   most unanimously seen within its scope; clinical pathology, imaging/ physiologic tests, physical exams and family history were perceived by  ~50% of clinical geneticists also as covered, but less so by the other groups .

Genetic counselling challenges with a family with HDL2: From  the bedside to the bench and back to the bedside,P09.37,L. J. Greenberg,"University of Cape Town, Observatory, South Africa","Huntington disease (HD) is a late onset genetic disease characterised by involuntary movements and progressive mental deterioration . The  condition was thought to be caused only by a CAG repeat sequence in the huntingtin gene on chromosome 4 . In 2001 however it was found  that an African American family, presenting with similar symptoms to HD  and no expansion in the HD gene, had a mutation in the junctophilin 3 gene on chromosome 16 . This condition has been named Huntington  disease like 2 (HDL2) and until recently, had only ever been reported to be associated with individuals of Black African ethnicity  . In 2007 one family of mixed ancestry from the Western Cape in SA  was identified with HDL2. This finding came about as a result of a pilot  study of 63 persons with clinical symptoms of HD who do not carry the HD causing expansion . Two individuals tested positive for HDL2 ; one that was referred for diagnostic testing in 1995 and the other in 2005 . It was then found that in 2006, a research project had been initiated  in another research laboratory, to study this family in depth and blood  samples had been collected from a number of additional family mem   bers . In addition, the mother of an eleven year old child of one of the  HDL2 patients, described as a âdifficult childâ, had recently requested genetic testing . A clear distinction between clinical practice and research is not always  possible and geneticists often find themselves with discordant respon   sibilities to different members of the same family  .",2008

The couple had surplus embryos cryopreserved, which they subsequently elected to donate to our embryo donation programme .  To comply with Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA)  Code of Practice for UK gamete and embryo donors, both partners  underwent appropriate genetic screening tests, including karyotyping,  which wasnât considered necessary when the couple were first evalu   ated at their local hospital . The man carried a 13;14 balanced Robert   sonian translocation and was referred for genetic counselling . Structural chromosome abnormalities cause infertility in both men and  women, and many fertility centres have experienced similar cases .  Owing to the increased incidence of balanced translocations among  infertile people compared with the general population it is prudent to  routinely offer preconception genetic counselling and karyotype analy   sis to couples with infertility  . Such measures may improve (i) infertility  diagnosis, (ii) follow up treatment, (iii) risk assessment for future chil   dren and (iv) pregnancy management . Furthermore, appropriate ge   netic testing and evaluation may reduce numbers of failed IVF cycles,  saving patients financial, physical and emotional costs. Current UK  regulations require rigorous screening (including karyotyping) for gam   ete and embryo donors . However, routine karyotyping of couples with  infertility is not UK standard practice and, this represents an inequality in patient care . Routine karyotyping should be offered to all couples  presenting with infertility allowing them to make informed choices be   fore undertaking the large investment required for assisted reproduc   tion .",2008

","Machado Joseph disease (MJD) is an autosomal dominant neurode   generative disorder of late onset (mean 40 .5 yrs), whose causative  mutation is a CAG expansion in the ATXN3 gene, at 14q32 .1 . MJD  presents clinical heterogeneity, with differences in onset between se   ries of patients being reported . Since in MJD risk assessment is com   plicated by age dependent penetrance, these differences will have an  impact in risk calculation for at risk individuals who choose not to take the genetic test . In the Azores 32 extended MJD families were identi   fied; in Flores Island the disease reaches the highest worldwide value of prevalence (1:103) . Segregation ratio distortion (SRD) could be one  of the factors behind high values of prevalence . The availability of an  extended genealogical database for the affected Azorean families, as   sociated to the thorough follow up of patients provided the background  to conduct a study aiming: a) to provide age dependent risk data, with  impact on Genetic Counselling (GC); b) to analyse segregation pat   terns of normal and expanded ATXN3 alleles . For risk assessment, the  probability of gene expression, using onset data from 176 Azorean pa   tients, was calculated; a Bayesian method to compute the probability  of heterozygosity if asymptomatic at different ages was applied . Sixty two sibships were selected for segregation analysis (330 meioses) .  This analysis produced mendelian ratios, not supporting the presence of SRD for expanded alleles . Globally, results obtained will allow a  higher accuracy of risk assessment, an essential component of GC,  which is critical for the decision making of at risk individuals, namely for reproductive choices .",2008

Patients with NKH have severe neu   rological symptoms such as seizures . Most patients die within a few  weeks, whereas survivors show severe psychomotor retardation and do not achieve any developmental milestone . NKH is caused by a mu   tation in the genes encoding the components of the glycine cleavage multi enzyme system . More than 80% of the patients have defects in  the gene encoding P protein, whereas the rest of the patients have defects in the gene encoding T protein . In recent years, prevention  programs for the detection of heterozygotes of relatively prevalent  autosomal recessive diseases (with a frequency of about 1:1000), is available in Israel .  Aim: to study the carrier frequency of NKH in a vil   lage in Northern Israel where 20 patients, homozygous for the H42R mutation in the T protein gene, were diagnosed over the last decade .  Methods : 405 healthy individuals in their reproductive period, residing  in this village, were screened for the H42R mutation using PCR RFLP method .  Results and conclusions : A high carrier frequency of 1/16  (25 out of 405) was found . Since no effective treatment is available for  NKH, prenatal diagnosis was requested in four pregnancies, which led to the diagnosis of three unaffected fetuses . One couple decided not to perform prenatal diagnosis . An affected baby was born and died at age  3 months .

","A restropective analysis of clinical counselling records in two clini   cal genetics services in Emilia Romagna Region (Ferrara and Imola)  is presented. A shared specific software (GCS) allows a systematic and homogenous collection of data . Diagnostic data were checked  for correctness by medical geneticists . The study is focused on pre   natal counselling in the period 2000 2006 (more than 9100 consulta   tions) which represents >70% of the activity for both Medical Genetics  Centres . The National Health System offers prenatal counselling for  increased chromosomal anomalies linked to advanced maternal age (,>35 years) . These referals represent 45% of prenatal counselling . In 2 .9% of these prenatal settings, unexpected additional relevant re   productive risks have been discovered (1 .7% mental retardation and 1 .2% mendelian diseases) requiring an urgent and appropriate activa   tion of clinical and laboratory diagnostic pathways . The referrals for the  other prenatal consultations were heterogeneous mendelian diseases (29 .2%) followed by chromosomal conditions (16 .6%) . Different pro   portions were seen in the two medical genetics services, reflecting the  specialised activities as regional hub centres: hemoglobinopathies in Ferrara and cytogenetics in Imola . These specialised centres attract Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy women from other health districts for prenatal referrals, (40 .7% from  outside the provinces and 19 .5% from outside the Emilia Romagna Region) . Data of the primary care and specialists access to genetic services,  accuracy of prenatal diagnosis and time to diagnosis were analized to  provide information for the analysis of the committence, appropriate   ness of referrals and to improve the organization of clinical genetics services of in the Emilia Romagna region .",2008

Uniform informa   tion about prenatal screening and testing was not available in Iceland prior to this study  . The study aim was to assess general knowledge about prenatal  screening and diagnosis among pregnant women attending their first antenatal visit . An information booklet was produced as a part of this study  . We compared the difference in knowledge and understanding  between pregnant women in the intervention group (having access to  the information booklet and normal care) (n,142) and women in the control group (normal care) (n, 237) . Women were recruited from five antenatal clinics in Iceland. The age  distribution, experience and education of participants were in accor   dance with the general population . Overall 63% wanted information  from their midwives and 31 .7% from a doctor  . Most had however, re   ceived information from their gynaecologist (53%) and friends (40%) .  The majority (60%) wanted both verbal and written information . The  intervention group showed better knowledge when asked to explain  the tests in their own words (p<.001), but no significant difference was  detected between groups in description of methods used in prenatal  screening in multiple choice questions. When asked about specific dis   orders (Trisomies 13 and 18) women in the intervention group were more knowledgeable (p, .001) . We conclude that Icelandic women  have a good basic knowledge of prenatal screening but want more  information. There is a need for a better education on specific aspects  of prenatal screening and diagnosis for women attending their first an   tenatal visit .",2008

This condition has a poor prognosis, although novel treatment options allow better quality of life and survival . Recent data indicate that early  diagnosis and treatment should translate into better outcome and sur   vival . PAH can be sporadic, associated with other conditions such as systemic sclerosis, or clustered in families . Familial PAH currently represents at least 10% of so called idiopathic cases . It segregates as an autosomal dominant trait with reduced pen   etrance (10 20%) . Mutations of the gene encoding bone morphogenet   ic protein receptor type II ( BMPR2 ) which belongs to the TGF Ã super  family have been first described in 2000. 20% of so called sporadic  idiopathic cases and more than 70% of familial cases are character   ised by germline BMPR2  mutations, emphasising the relevance of ge   netic counselling in these families, in order to promote early diagnosis and treatment in at risk subjects . We thus set up a genetic counselling clinic in our department . In the last 5 years, we screened 375 PAH pa   tients (310 sporadic, 65 familial), and 125 first degree relatives of pa   tients harbouring a BMPR2  germline mutation . 45 sporadic, 37 familial  and 45 first degree relatives have been showed to harbour a BMPR2 mutation .

However,  despite the growing test volume and the rapidly increasing number  of tests offered, the necessary reference materials are not available for the vast majority of tests . METHOD: The U .S . Centers for Disease  Control and Prevention (CDC), in collaboration with the genetic testing Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy community, has established the Genetic Testing Reference Materials  Coordination Program (GeT RM) to improve public availability of refer   ence materials and facilitate information exchange and communica   tion on reference materials development, contribution, characteriza   tion, distribution, and needs assessment . RESULTS: The GeT RM has  characterized reference materials for Huntington disease, Fragile X,  cystic fibrosis, Bloom syndrome, familial dysautonomia, Canavan dis   ease, Niemann Pick disease, Tay Sachs disease, Gaucher disease,  glycogen storage disease type 1a, Fanconi anemia, and mucolipido   sis type IV  . The GeT RM program also collects information from other  sources about publicly available cell lines/DNA with clinically important  mutations that may be useful as reference materials . This information is posted on the program website . To date, the GeT RM has focused its efforts on DNA based testing for inherited genetic disorders . However,  we hope to expand our efforts into other areas of genetics, including molecular oncology and biochemical genetic testing . CONCLUSIONS:  The increased availability of characterized reference materials for qual   ity assurance, proficiency testing, test development and research, will help to improve the quality and accuracy of genetic testing .

Cornel","VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","For genetic screening, criteria have been developed based on the  WHO Wilson and Jungner criteria (1968), in which the notion of pro   tection of citizens against unwarranted screening was important . In  some countries, such as the Netherlands, âprotectionâ even became cornerstone of legislation concerning population screening . Protection  relates to notions of having a suitable test with good sensitivity and few  false positives, the availability of treatment and follow up after diagno   sis, so that benefits of screening outweigh potential harm, for instance  of stress caused by uncertainty, the knowledge of having a fatal disor   der or unnecessary interventions . In screening policy safeguards are needed because of the shared re   sponsibilities of government and health care taking the initiative to of   fer screening to   in principle   healthy people . We argue that recent developments challenge this protective stance .  Firstly, on the basis of developments in genomics, among other as   sociation studies, labs and companies increasingly offer direct to con   sumer tests on the internet . Secondly, there is increasing awareness  about and demand for testing and screening, sometimes stimulated  by patient organisations . For instance, in the Netherlands, parents of  children with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy argue that people might  want a newborn screening test for DMD to be able to prepare or make reproductive decisions .The emphasis on protection ignores increasing demands for testing .

The first hit could have been triggered by patientâs former diseases of urinary and/or genital system . The number of spontaneous abor   tions recorded in their siblings of second generations creates predis   position that may end with termination of pregnancy  . The second hit  is usually triggered by chronic presence of EBV virus in male or/and  female partner. It has been demonstrated that there is no significant  relation between the age of male or female partners and the number of spontaneous abortions . Both males and females had former uri   nary or/and genital infections and the number of spontaneus abortions  among the siblings of second generation is twice as high in relation to average population . Variations in constitutional karyotypes (per inv  9, 9qh+) are also evident as well as presence of antibodies for EBV, CMV, or HSV2 viruses . Reactivation of latent EBV infection provides  possibility for second hit . Aneuploidy or tetraploidy is found at 23% of  samlpes . Therefore we think that the presumed hypothesis of two hits is clearly established . Partners with spontaneous abortion with and  without chromosomal abnormalities must undergone genetic counsel   ling process for preventing trigger/s or to repeat the proces, because spontaneous abrotion is an multifactorial disease .",2008

PCR amplification and HRM  was performed on the LightCyclerÂ® 480 Real Time PCR System  (Roche). For validation purposes we evaluated specificity, sensitivity,  repeatability, reproducibility and the ability of the method to perform reliable calls . We were able to perform unambiguous calls in 98 .4% (n,381) of the cases for rs1801133: C>T and in 98 .1% (n,104) of the  cases for rs1801131: A>C . For the 6 (1 .6%) and 2 (1 .9%) unknown  samples for rs1801133: C>T and rs1801131: A>C respectively, by re   peating the analysis we reached 100% of calls . Since in the end all  calls were reliably detected by the LightCycler software we reached  100% specificity and sensitivity. Repeatability and reproducibility were  also consistent . In conclusion, after optimization and diagnostic valida   tion HRM of small amplicons is a reliable and precise method that can be broadly applied in DNA diagnostics of other genes .

Congenital disorders of glycosylation (CDG) are a group of genetic diseases resulting from defects in N glycosylation of glycoconjugates .  The most common form of the disease is the CDG Ia caused by a de   ficiency in the cytosolic enzyme phosphomannomutase (PMM). PMM  converts mannose 6 phosphate to mannose 1 phosphate and is a key enzyme in the generation of N linked glycans . The clinical presentation  of PMM deficiency ranges from very severe to milder phenotype. In  this work we report the functional analysis of a nucleotide change iden   tified in the deep intronic region of intron 7 (c.639 15479C>T) of PMM2  gene and the use of antisense morpholino oligonucleotides (AMOs)  to restore normal splicing. First, we have confirmed using splicing as   say that this change provokes the exonization of 123bp between exon  7 and 8 in patientâs cDNA. Using modified morpholinos to block ac   cess of the spliceosoma to 3Â´ and/or 5Â´ cryptic splice site we have demonstrated that this insertion is a disease causing mutation . After  transfection of a fibroblast cell line from the patient, the analysis of the  effect of the AMO was done by conventional RT PCR, determination of PMM activity and western blot using polyclonal antibodies . The results  obtained shown that a correctly spliced mRNA was rescued and effi   ciently translated in a functional protein detected by western blot . PMM activity was rescued close to the value of control cell line . Our results  offer a novel promise mutation specific therapeutic approach in this genetic disease where is not possible other effective treatment .",2008

MTT assay, LDH re   lease, Gelatin zymography, Griess reaction, Cell based ERK 1/2 phos   phorylation assay and quantitative real time RT PCR were employed  to appraise the effect of silibinin on cell proliferation, cytotoxicity, meta   static potential, nitric oxide (NO) production, ERK 1/2 phosphorylation and activation in HepG 2 cells . Silibinin inhibited cell proliferation, ma   trix metalloproteinase 2 enzymatic activity, NO production and ERK  1/2 phosphorylation in a dose dependent manner without exerting any cytotoxicity effect . In addition, an expressive increase in mRNA levels  of Raf kinase inhibitor protein (RKIP), sprouty related protein 1 with  EVH 1 domain (Spred 1), sprouty related protein with EVH 1 domain  2 (Spred 2) and tissue inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinase 2 (TIMP 2)  coupled with a significant reduction in transcriptional levels of highly expressed in cancer (Hec1) and MMP 2 were observed . Altogether,  these issues show for the first time that silibinin treatment could inhibit  cell proliferation and invasive potential of HepG 2 cells through inhibi   tion of ERK 1/2 cascade both directly (through suppression of ERK 1/2  phosphorylation) and indirectly (through up regulation of RKIP, Spred 1 and Spred 2) . In addition, cell growth and proliferation may be inhib   ited by silibinin through down regulation of Hec1 .",2008

The rationale of this treatment is based  on blockage of the toxic effect of the farnesylated forms of prelamin  A which in turn is responsible of cellular morphology alterations and genomic instability  . In order to verify if this treatment is reproducible  also in the mandibuloacral dysplasia (MADA), we studied the cellular  effects of FTIs treatment on primary fibroblasts cell lines after 72 hrs at different concentrations (10   500 nM) of the drug . We observed that  this treatment induces in MADAâs cells, an increase of abnormal nuclei in a dose manner dependent effect . On the basis of these results, we decided to test the effect of two different drugs (bisphosphonates and  statins) known to act on the same biochemical pathway at different  levels. We treated MAD fibroblasts in a two steps model (24 hrs statins treatment and then 12hrs bisphosphonate in a single dose) . This treat   ment, showed an improvement of the cellular phenotype (reduction  of the number of misshapen nuclei and a partial rescue of the hetero   chromatin organization) .

To visualize sample collection and placement, Indicating FTA Elute has  been developed for use with clear biological samples by the incorpora   tion of a colour indicating dye that distinguishes the clear sample once it is applied to the matrix . It is functionally equivalent to traditional FTA  Elute in that it protects DNA samples from degradation and provides a  source of amplifiable DNA which is eluted from its matrix with a simple heat and water elution step .

While much is known on the clini   cal and molecular aspects of SHOX haploinsufficiency, the integration  of SHOX in the signalling pathways regulating bone growth is currently  not defined. Here we identify NPPB  encoding the natriuretic peptide  BNP, a well known approved cardiac and natriuretic peptide hormone (drug), as a transcriptional target of SHOX . The ability of SHOX to  transactivate the NPPB  endogenous promoter was demonstrated in  luciferase reporter assays using serial deletions of the NPPB  promoter  region . Binding of SHOX to the NPPB  promoter was also demon   strated in vivo  by chromatin fixation and immunoprecipitation. We also  demonstrate the lack of promoter activation in two SHOX mutants from patients with LÃ©ri Weill syndrome . In addition, immunohistochemical  analysis of human growth plate sections showed for the first time a  co expression of BNP and SHOX in late proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocytes . Together these data strongly suggest that BNP repre   sents a direct target of SHOX . One may speculate that BNP as a downstream effector of SHOX may also open up new potential avenues for the treatment of short stature .  BNP in the systemic circulation is likely to reach growth plate chondro   cytes.

In order to decrease the side effects of suicide gene  therapy it would be better to express the suicide genes selectively in  cancerous tissues. Using cancer specific promoters is the most ap   plicable strategy to reach this aim . CD (Cytosine Deaminase) and TK  (Thymidine Kinase) are used as suicide genes, but a suitable vector is needed for inserting any promoters upstream of them . Firstly, the new MCS was designed by studying the sequence of our  own pUCLacZ (engineered pUC which can express LacZ in eukary   otic cells because of its BGH polyA downstream of LacZ) . Two partial  complementary 37 base long oligonucleotides were designed . Cytosine deaminase and thymidine kinase genes were amplified by  PCR on saccharomyces cerevisiae and herpes simplex virus DNA,  and then were inserted downstream of MCS instead of lacZ . Insertion of the MCS bidirectionally into pUClacZ was proved by PCR and digestion analysis . In fact we made six constructs which are ca   pable of adopting suitable and specific promoters upstream of these two suicide genes and LacZ reporter gene . pUC RMCS TK pUC RMCS CD pUC FMCS TK pUC FMCS CD pUC LacZ CD pUC LacZ TK These constructs are compatible plasmids for further tumor specific  suicide gene therapy as the availability of suitable restriction sites in  MCS enables us to clone any promoter directionally upstream of repor   ter and suicide genes .

","Background The patientsâ subjective interpretation of genetic counsel   ling may be as important as correct understanding . Methods In study I, 166 cancer patients filled in a questionnaire after  intake for hereditary breast/ovarian cancer  . To date, 31 of them re   ceived an inconclusive (no mutation) DNA test result and filled in a second questionnaire . In study II, 24 cancer patients were interviewed  1 3 years after receiving an Unclassified Variant result (i.e. variant of  uncertain clinical significance). Results In study I, although most counselees correctly recalled  the  communicated medium heredity and intermediate/high cancer risks,  they interpreted  this like pathogenic information . After inconclusive  results, counselees correctly recalled  the counsellor communicating  a non informative DNA result with unchanged cancer risks . However,  heredity  was recalled as low and interpreted as medium . In study II , sixty seven percent recalled  having received a non infor   mative DNA result, but 80% interpreted  this as pathogenic . In both studies, discrepancy between interpretation  and recall  were  explained by previous interpretations, health history, genetic uncer   tainty, denial coping style, autonomy, self acceptance, low need for certainty  . In both studies, interpretation  explained changes in intended and ac   tual cancer screening and surgery; in study I, recall  explained some of  these changes . Discussion Counselees subjectively interpreted intake information and  non informative DNA results as being more pathogenic than how they factually recalled counselling sessions .Interpretation explained more than recall . Previous interpretations,  health, and personality explained recall interpretation discrepancies .  The decrease in recalled/interpreted heredity after inconclusive results  is probably due to correction of pathogenic interpretation at intake,  and need for certainty  . Counsellors and researchers should address  discrepancies between the counseleesâ recall and interpretation of ge   netic information .",2008
is enhanced information at genetic counselling necessary? A  randomised study,EPL1.2,"A. Roshanai1, R. Rosenquist2, K.

Patient and methods: A total of 148 subjects (134 female and 14 male)  who attended genetic counselling at the onco genetic clinic of Uppsala  University Hospital, Sweden (2003 2006) were randomised to informa   tion (n,85) or control (n,78) groups . The intervention group received  the videotaped session, a copy of medical records, pedigree and a pamphlet about basic genetic concepts . Additionally, they had contact with a specialist nurse for more discussion and further questions . The  control group received the standard information and the video in as   sociation with last follow up eight month later  . The knowledge about  hereditary cancer, levels of emotional distress and personal risk esti   mations were measured at the base line, two weeks and eight months later . Results: The majority had a high level of knowledge about hereditary cancer, although a significant improvement was observed in breast cancer group after counselling . The levels of anxiety and depression  indicated a significant reduction at follow ups. At tow weeks follow up,  the correct estimation of personal risk for developing hereditary can   cer, compared to initial estimation pre counselling, had changed from 47% to 90% in the intervention and from 45% to 85% in control group .  The majority (86% in control and 95% in intervention group) intended to communicate the genetic information to their relatives . Conclusion: Enhanced information did not improve the participants risk perception . However the intention of informing relatives was elevated .",2008

Aims: This study aimed to document the types of issues practitioners  define as ethically contentious in their practice, with what frequency they occur, or how they attempt to resolve them . Method: We under   took semi structured telephone interviews with 21 genetic counsel   lors and 13 clinicians . All interviews were tape recorded, transcribed verbatim and a thematic analysis was undertaken . Results: BRCA1/2  mutation testing to tailor the management of newly diagnosed high risk  women was identified as a future ethical challenge for cancer genet   ics services. Themes identified included balancing the ethical concept  of âdo no harmâ with the rights of women to be fully informed prior  to making treatment decisions; questioning the ability of a woman to  fully comprehend the implications of a positive mutation test on herself  and other family members and managing the increasing client load on limited clinic resources . The importance of involving genetic counsel   lors in the multi disciplinary team was emphasised . Clinicians identi   fied fewer barriers to fast tracking BRCA1/2 testing than did genetic counsellors . Conclusion: Further understanding of the barriers to the  management of BRCA1/2 testing in newly diagnosed breast cancer  patients is needed to guide future cancer genetics practice as clinical  testing is likely to transform the direction, priorities and processes of cancer genetic services .",2008

This study aimed to qualitatively evaluate at   titudes and beliefs regarding the psychosocial implications of genetic risk for major depression in an urbanised population . Method: Participants (N,36) of focus groups discussed their under   standing of the role of genes in psychiatric disorders and their beliefs and attitudes towards genetic testing for risk for major depression . Results: More than half the participants reported personal or family history of psychiatric disorders . The majority (67%) of participants in   dicated interest in having a genetic test for susceptibility to major de   pression, if it was available . After discussion of perceived psychosocial implications, only 42% still favoured having the test . All participants still  interested in genetic risk testing for major depression reported they would only do so through trusted medical professionals . Participants  were unanimously against independent genetic testing via the inter   net . Discussion: Having a family history of psychiatric disorders was a ma   jor reason for interest in having a genetic test to determine risk for  depression, which participants reported would enable them to be bet   ter prepared. Psychosocial implications influencing change of attitude  included privacy issues and fear of genetic discrimination by insurance companies and employers . Conclusion: The study highlights the importance of public education  about psychiatric genetics, potential risks and benefits of genetic test   ing and availability of appropriate support services in association with future genetic risk testing in psychiatry  .",2008

Professional ambivalence: accounts of ethical practice in  childhood genetic testing,EPL2.4,"M. A. Arribas Ayllon , S. Sarangi, A. Clarke","Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom","Childhood genetic testing raises complex ethical and moral dilemmas for both families and professionals . In the family sphere, the role of  communication is a key aspect in the transmission of `genetic respon   sibilityâ between adults and children . In the professional sphere, ge   netic responsibility is an interactional accomplishment emerging from competing views over what constitutes the `best interestsâ of the child .  In the present paper we extend our previous research into parental  accounts of childhood genetic testing and explore the ethical explana   tions/descriptions of professionals in research interviews . Interviews  (n,20) were conducted with professional practitioners involved in the genetic diagnosis and management of children and their families . We  first identify four inter related themes   juxtaposition of parental rights  vis Ã  vis childâs autonomy, elicitation of the childâs autonomy, avoid   ance of parental responsibility and acknowledgement of uncertainty    and then, using Rhetorical Discourse Analysis, examine the range of  devices through which ethical explanations are situationally illustrated:  contrast, reported speech, constructed dialogue, character and event work . An important device for facilitating ethical explanations is the use  of extreme case scenarios  which reconstructs dilemmas as justifica   tions of professional conduct . Our analysis of professional accounts  suggests that ethical practice is not a simple matter of implementing  principles but managing the practical consequences of interactions with parents and children . We conclude that more attention is needed  to understand the way professional practitioners construct and share cases as useful illustrations of evidence based ethical practice .",2008

Semi structured telephone  interviews were used to explore the views of 6 FAP and 8 HNPCC  mutation carriers (6 men and 8 women) regarding the use of PGD for their condition and other scenarios . The general acceptability of the  use of PGD depended on the perceived severity of the condition in  question and views about the moral status of the embryo/foetus during development . While both patient groups perceived FAP or HNPCC to  have a low impact on quality of life, approximately half of the partici   pants accepted the use of PGD for their condition in principle . Fewer  participants however, from both the FAP and HNPCC groups, would consider personally using PGD for their condition . The importance of  individual choice around reproductive decision making was a central  theme although there were concerns about the expansion of PGD into non medical trait selection . The main advantage of PGD was seen to  be avoiding termination of pregnancy. Disadvantages identified includ   ed the emotional and financial costs of undergoing the procedure, and the relatively low chance of a successful pregnancy  .",2008

This study investigated the po   tential relationships between attitudinal ambivalence towards Downâs syndrome and testing and termination decisions . Data was collected from women attending an antenatal clinic in the UK .  Using a questionnaire distributed at the booking appointment, attitudes  towards using testing and termination for Downâs syndrome were col   lected along with attitudes and attitudinal ambivalence towards Downâs  syndrome itself . Screening uptake was obtained from patient records . Overall, attitudes and attitudinal ambivalence towards Downâs syn   drome were not good predictors of screening behaviour and women  with high levels of ambivalence were not less likely to use prenatal screening . However, women who were unsure about amniocentesis  and termination were more likely to hold ambivalent attitudes towards  Downâs syndrome than were women who gave a definite yes/no re   sponse .

Hewison","University of Leeds, LEEDS, United Kingdom","Objectives: AnSWeR (Antenatal Screening Web Resource), designed  to support informed choices in prenatal testing, aims to provide bal   anced information about disability from the perspective of disabled people and their families . Following our independent evaluation of  AnSWeR, this paper presents participantsâ evaluation of AnSWeR in terms of providing balanced information . Setting: U .K . Method: Eight  focus groups with health professionals, participants from the general population, and parents with personal experience of the conditions .  Questionnaires were completed by parents of newborns, people with  spina bifida or cystic fibrosis, and fifteen professionals with special ex   pertise in this area . Findings: Information about experiences of living  with the tested for conditions and terminating affected pregnancies was considered important to support informed decisions . However, partici   pants differed in their perceptions of whether the information about the tested for conditions was balanced . For example, participants believed  that photographs of people with the tested for conditions introduced biases   both positive and negative . Within the context of supporting  informed choice, participants also talked about the significance of  providing information about womenâs experiences of terminating af   fected pregnancies. Conclusion: This study highlights the difficulty of  designing âbalancedâ information about tested for conditions and a lack of methodology for doing so . We conclude that AnSWeR provides a  counterbalance to other websites that focus on more medical aspects of disability  . Its aim to provide âbalancedâ information would be aided  by increasing the number and range of case studies available on the  website, for both family members and individuals living with the tested for conditions, and women terminating affected pregnancies .",2008

Methods: Self reporting questionnaires were sent by post to 4,257  scientists regarding molecular biology and human genetics/ genom   ics via two academic societies in Japan . They were asked about their  value and risk cognition towards genome sciences, social norms for accountability and responsibility  . We compared these results with the  data we obtained from 2,171 citizens in 2005 . Results: A total of 1,494 completed our questionnaire (586 men and 157 women) . The total response rate was 35 .1% . Both groups support  genome sciences very positively  . The main difference was observed  on willingness of blood donation for genomic research . 74 .8 % of the  scientist group responded that they were willing to donate for genomic  research regarding healthcare, while 39 .3% of the citizen group did .  Regarding the conditions for donation, the scientist group responded  that they would donate their blood when they could agree the research  purpose and significance (87.3%).

The marketing of genetic testing as capable of shaping life   styles through the forecasting of future health may promise consum   ers more than the science can deliver, emphasising the supposed  âbenefits of knowingâ while downplaying the potential hazards. From  the professionalsâ point of view, the marketing of commercial genetic  services may misrepresent the complexity and uncertainty of genetic risk, obscuring reality with the fog of marketing . To illustrate our point,  we consider a recent reality based TV programme, broadcast in the  UK, that documented the experiences of four âcelebritiesâ who con   sented to testing in a private London based practice . Our analysis of  the programmeâs transcript will show how interactions with the clients  departed from established protocols of professional practice in several  ways: overestimating clinical validity, underestimating the clinical un   certainty and the possibility of problems from test results, and practic   ing inappropriately directive (`promotionalâ) counselling . How should  the genetics services community in Europe respond to such develop   ments? Our findings emphasise the already well recognised need for  the development of regulatory and legislative approaches to monitor and/or prevent such practices .

ALD is an X linked  metabolic disorder with extreme variability in phenotype, including the risk of symptoms in female heterozygotes . Carrier testing based on  biochemical assay is unreliable, but accurate mutation based testing has been available in the UK since 1999 . Eighteen women with a confirmed ALD gene mutation were inter   viewed, and the transcripts analysed using the constant comparison method . The impact of the test result often correlated with the timing of  the test, with less impact described by those who had requested testing  in the mid teens, before reproduction, and more traumatic responses  recalled by women who had testing at the same time as other emo   tional events, such as pregnancy  . For the majority of women, carrier  status had an ongoing impact, including feeling different and frequent intrusive thoughts . Women who had female relatives with symptoms,  but were asymptomatic themselves, expressed anxiety about the risk  of symptoms developing, against a perceived lack of medical under   standing and treatment options . These findings add to the broader literature on psychosocial impact of  X linked carrier status, and contribute new evidence that the implica   tions for female carriers extend beyond reproduction .

Other organs are involved as well,  including the brain, implying, among others, mental slowness and lack  of initiative, and causing problems in daily life both for patients and their spouses . Some couples seem to deal with these problems satis   factorily while others experience great trouble . Objectives: to describe the relationship of severity of MD, marital sat   isfaction and psychological well being in MD patients and their part   ners . Methods: 69 MD couples were interviewed regarding the influence of  MD on their marital relationship, and they filled out questionnaires on  severity of MD, anxiety and depression (HADS), hopelessness (BHS), and general psychological health (GHQ 12) . Results: For patients, the need for help was associated with a worse  view on the future, a worse general well being, more anxiety and more depression . For their partners, a lack of initiative was associated with  a worse general well being and more anxiety  . Marital satisfaction was  associated with a better view on the future for patients, and a better  general well being, less anxiety and less depression in partners . It is  remarkable that no less than 40 % of the patients and, particularly,  female partners had BHS scores suggestive of clinically relevant de   pression . Conclusion: Severity of MD places a heavy burden on patients and, especially, on female partners . Marital satisfaction is a strong predictor  of a better well being, both for patients and partners, but more so for the latter  .",2008

Tamura,"Ochanomizu University, Tokyo, Japan","Abortion in Japan is primarily illegal with the exception of special rea   sons, such as maternal health threats, financial difficulties, etc. Fetal problems are not included in these exceptions . If women want abortion, they have to ask permission from doctors and partners . When prenatal  diagnosis revealed fetal problems, doctors use a financial reason as an excuse to allow abortion . In this way, prenatal diagnosis and selec   tive abortion is available . About one percent of all pregnant women undergo amniocentesis . Professional societies established guidelines  for prenatal diagnosis, and state that it can be conducted only to test childhood onset severe conditions . If women want prenatal diagnosis,  doctors, often clinical geneticists, have to make ethically sound judg   ment, and will tell women whether or not they can undergo testing . Although genetics societies have certified some non MD genetic coun   selors recently, genetic counseling in Japan is supposed to be pro   vided by clinical geneticists, as they have done for over thirty years .  And, clinical geneticists are regarded as authorities who make ethical judgment on prenatal diagnosis and selective abortion . Thus, genetic  counseling in Japan seems to be a place where clients need to make  an inquiry to ask permission to undergo prenatal diagnosis, and ge   neticists sometimes try to convince women not to undergo testing, or sometimes give clients permission to do it . Appropriate prenatal genetic counseling approach in Japan should  be considered, but, it is difficult because those who are regarded as  genetic counseling providers believe that their current practice is an appropriate way of genetic counseling in Japan .",2008

This raises medical, psychological and ethical dilemmas . Our cancer genetic  counseling team started recently to discuss this option with young car   riers . Six women, 4 of them carrying a mutation in BRCA1 and 2 in  BRCA2, applied for further genetic and reproductive counseling in our PGD clinic . Four of these carriers were healthy but had at least one  1st degree relative with breast cancer (BC), and 2 were 4 years post  BC diagnosis . All women needed IVF because of coexisting infertil   ity . After counseling, 4 women declined the option (including the two  BC survivors who eventually conceived naturally) and 2 underwent the  PGD procedure. One of them conceived in her first treatment attempt. In this case, 8 embryos with 7 or more cells were biopsied . The blas   tomeres were analysed, using PCR for the BRCA2 6174delT mutation together with linked polymorphic microsatellites . Four embryos were  conclusively diagnosed as BRCA2 wt, 2 of these were transferred, leading to a twin pregnancy  . Because the woman would not have ter   minated a pregnancy in case of misdiagnosis, amniocentesis was not  performed. Her request to confirm the PGD in her newborns after birth  raises additional legal and ethical dilemma of testing minors for adult onset disease .",2008

With the recent (2006) decision by the HFEA to grant  licences for pre implantation genetic diagnosis for late onset cancer  predisposition, this ongoing study exploring reproductive behaviour and attitudes to prenatal testing and PGD is timely  . Method: A qualitative approach using semi structured, in depth in   terviews, analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis .  We aim to recruit up to 40 women and men who have had a posi   tive BRCA1/2  predictive genetic test during the preceding 5 years,  between the ages of 18 and 45, who did not have children at the time they were tested . Results: Data will be presented from analysis of interviews completed to date . Preliminary analysis indicates that  BRCA  status does affect  reproductive decision making in a variety of ways, including timing of having children and number of children planned .  BRCA  status is also  taken into account in partner relationship building .

Attitudes of young women with cystic fibrosis to pregnancy and  motherhood,EP01.04,"S. J. Kenwrick1, E.

Conse   quently, more affected individuals are becoming parents . Pregnancy is  not considered dangerous for women with mild disease and good lung  function, but health and survival may be compromised by pancreatic  insufficiency and poor lung function. Clearly, careful counselling is re   quired to discuss the risks of having an affected child, health risks of pregnancy as well as how to cope with illness while raising a family  . The purpose of this pilot study was to explore psychosocial issues con   cerning pregnancy and motherhood among young women with cystic  fibrosis, in order to inform reproductive counselling. Semi structured  interviews were conducted for five women with CF, aged between 20 and 25, and transcripts subjected to qualitative, thematic analysis .  Emergent themes highlight a wide variety of issues for these women  centred around; desire for a family, health risks, relationships and com   munication with others, difficulties in motherhood and the prospect of a child with CF  . The results show that young women with CF may have  varying attitudes towards pregnancy and motherhood, depending in  part on their current health, their upbringing, professional opinion and social support available . Participants with a strong desire to have chil   dren viewed this as a natural progression and described strategies to cope with potential health problems . The study also highlights a num   ber of measures that may help in counselling these women, including access to the experience of mothers with CF  .",2008

It emerged from the analysis that different approaches were taken by  participating parents before they reached a reproductive decision, and  while several factors influenced this, the first diagnosis of CF in the  family had a particularly significant influence. Parents in this study ap   peared to have undergone an adaptation process during which they  overcame the initial shock of a CF diagnosis in their child, developed  a more positive outlook based largely on their own experiences of CF,  and then felt able to address further reproductive decisions . However,  following adaptation, some differences between the sexes emerged .  Women frequently acknowledged that the decisions remained fluid  and dynamic, whereas men tended to portray a more rigid standpoint  once a particular decision had been reached . Furthermore, men and  women often felt that they had inherently different roles in reproductive decision making, with the ultimate decision resting with the woman .

Data analysis revealed that while couples may consider different sce   narios, the decision making process remains largely unstructured . Per   sonal experiences of CF were an important factor: Individuals had to  weigh up their perception of the physical difficulties of CF, the fact that  CF is not an intellectually disabling condition, and their attachment to someone with CF  . Individuals may not fully engage with their risk of  having a child with CF during the decision making process, which may lead them to be unprepared for bad news .

Methods: 9,453 individuals were offered carrier testing, which was conditional on survey participation . Eligible for test participation were  invitees who were planning a pregnancy with their partner  . Both part   nersâ ancestry determined eligibility for the CF and/or HbP test(s) . Data  were gathered with structured questionnaires, one of which was based  on the Theory of Planned Behaviour, among 418 invitees of whom 247  refrained from testing and 171 intended to participate in the testing,  but of whom 143 actually did . Non Western participants (n, 46) were under represented . Results: All survey participants, Western and non Western, had a positive attitude towards test participation . Among those who refrained  from test participation, 68% would participate in this kind of screening in the future if it became possible . Time and effort needed for par   ticipation were important declining factors . The majority reported no predominant feelings of stigmatization . More non Western (23%) than  Western participants (10%) thought that there would be discrimination against carriers . In general, the test participants reported low levels  of anxiety, intended to draw reproductive decisions from test results,  were satisfied and none of them regretted participation. Conclusion: Ancestry based preconceptional CF and HbPs carrier  screening was evaluated as positive and desirable among Western and non Western participants . No major adverse psychological out   comes were reported .

Recruiting for reproductive choices,EP01.09,"S. Karner1, B. Wieser1, W. Berger2","1IFZ, Graz, Austria, 2IFF, Klagenfurt, Austria","Prenatal testing has become a routine practice of antenatal care .  According to international standards informed consent is a require   ment prior to testing . However, due to the introduction of non invasive  screening (nuchal translucency measurement and the combined ma   ternal blood test), this arrangement is undermined in some important  ways. There is a tendency that counselling starts not before the first screening, but only if the results are conspicuous . In Austria antenatal care is organised in a comprehensive programme that is mandatory for all pregnant women . The aim of this programme is to secure the wellbeing of both the mother and her child . We argue  that because of the contextualisation of non invasive screening into  the routine antenatal care it is difficult for pregnant women to distin   guish between mandatory and elective examinations of antenatal care .  This is especially relevant for the quality of informed consent that can  be achieved in prenatal screening and subsequent diagnostic testing of the foetus . The presented case addresses recruiting processes for prenatal test   ing and subsequent reproductive choices . We will present data which  show how non invasive screening has significantly changed prenatal testing in Austria .

the public understanding of newborn screening,EP06.2,B. Wieser,"IFZ, Graz, Austria","Neonatal screening for genetic disorders is a routine practice for many decades . In particular, screening for PKU has become a standard pro   cedure . However, internationally the way by which neonatal screening is carried out varies notably  . Especially for disorders where treatment  options are not as straightforward as they are for PKU, screening may be offered, but only on voluntary basis . Austria has decided to expand  its programme significantly in 2002. The introduction of tandem mass spectrometry plays a crucial role in this regard . With this technology it became possible to screen for 30 inherited disorders . All together  the Austrian neonatal screening programme comprises as many as 23 conditions . In this paper I will especially address the issue of the public under   standing of newborn screening . I will do so by drawing on the Wilson  and Jungner guidelines as developed for the WHO. Specifically I will  address the 6th principle: âThe test should be acceptable to the popula   tionâ (cf . Dhondt 2007) . Taking this requirement seriously this raises  important issues of lay understanding of genetic disorders and the way in which an expansion of newborn screening can be perceived . The  issue will be contextualised into the historical context in which the Aus   trian newborn screening programme has been initiated . I will also con   trast the Austrian case from other European countries in order to point  out differences of the way in which a public understanding of newborn screening can be facilitated .",2008

All 66 couples were called up and asked whether they were willing to  answer a few questions directly or some time later at their home about their non participation in the test . All phone calls and face to face inter   views were recorded and analyzed using the IPA method .41 couples were contactable . 13 couples no longer belonged to the  research target group of couples that were planning a pregnancy in the future, and were excluded . 20 couples agreed to a telephone in   terview and 5 others were interviewed at their home . The reason most frequently mentioned for not taking part in the test after all was âlack of  timeâ. But, in asking about social influence it appeared that sometimes  parents, other family members, friends or GPs had expressed their doubts about the coupleâs intention to take part in such a test . Even though lack of time was the most frequently mentioned reason  for not taking part in a preconception carrier screening test after clearly  having expressed the intention to do so, the negative input of the social  environment might have played a major role in not carrying out oneâs intentions .

Attitudes towards thalassaemia carrier testing in saudi arabis,EP06.4,H. Y. Alabdulwahed,"Dhahran Health Center, Saudi Aramco, Dammam, Saudi Arabia","Thalassaemia is a life limiting condition, characterised by severe anae   mia which requires frequent blood transfusions . It is a global health  problem, and is prevalent in countries with a history of malaria out   break . Thalassaemia is a recessively inherited condition, i .e . both par   ents have to carry the thalassaemia gene in order to have affected children . Carriers do not show any symptoms of thalassaemia, and a blood test is necessary to identify carrier status . There are many  mass public screening programmes throughout the world which aim to control and prevent this condition . In 2004, Saudi Arabia started a  compulsory premarital screening programme to identify thalassaemia  carriers, along with carriers of another haemoglobinopathy (sickle cell anaemia) . To date no attempt has been made to investigate the Saudi peopleâs thoughts and feelings towards the screening . This qualita   tive study used a semi structured interview guide and was designed to  explore the attitude of Saudis who have undergone mandatory screen   ing for thalassaemia . Sixteen individuals participated in the study  . The  primary findings were that: participants accepted and supported the  premarital screening programme; their motivations to undergo testing  included: having healthy children, reducing the incidence of hereditary  diseases in the country, and removing any risk in entering an arranged  (usually consanguineous) marriage; the majority of participants lacked  knowledge about screening; and many misconceptions and negative feelings towards screening emerged . The main conclusion is that there  is a pressing need to increase public awareness about screening ad   vantages and, more importantly, to educate individuals undergoing carrier testing . EP07.

Method:  Cross sectional, qualitative exploratory study  . Interviews with  13 relatives, including informers and recipients of the information, were analysed using interpretative phenomenological analysis . Results:  Dissemination was hampered when communication channels  between relatives were limited, because of family rifts or socially dis   tant or problematic relationships . When informing other branches of EMPAG Posters the family, relatives approached individuals in the generation of the  deceased man, regardless of their risk status, who were then respon   sible for informing younger relatives . Most people informed by a rela   tive did not seek genetic counselling . The informing relative may not  have sufficient authority for the information either to be taken seriously,  or to challenge individual constructions about the aetiology of cancer  .  This impeded information transmission to further at risk relatives . Most  participants knew of relatives who had not been told about their cancer risk .

Should this not also  be applied to young adults? Not all adults by the nature of their age are âmatureâ in their decision making ability  . Cognitive but also psychosocial  factors influence decision making whether in adolescence or adulthood.

This method produced EMPAG Posters 0a figure of 35% from this stateâs service, much higher than observation  of the local pedigrees indicated. Reworking uptake as an annual figure  partly corrects for the length of time a program has been operating .  Other identified errors include the use of the cumulative total of those  who have tested, with a static denominator of those at 50% risk; and  the failure to exclude from the at risk group those who are too young (ineligible) to test . Most studies have used population prevalence of Huntington disease to calculate the total of those at 50% risk . We report new data for this  state, Victoria, estimating the prevalence to be 8 per 100,000 in 1999 .  Additional information collated from the Huntington Disease Register  of Victoria indicated that for every diagnosed person, there were 4 .2 individuals at 50% risk (1:4 .2), a lower ratio than the1:5 hypothesized in the literature .

The disease usually presents in adult life; no effective treatment is available . When we encountered the questions and the needs of an at risk family  member, we dealt with a disease characterised by: i) variable involve   ment of multiple systems; ii) age dependent, yet unpredictable, pen   etrance of each of the cardinal signs; iii) possible occurrence of pro   gressive cognitive decline . The co presence of these features makes  IBMPFD a compelling model for genetic counselling, as it resembles a  complex disorder despite the Mendelian mode of inheritance . The recommendations for predictive testing published for familial  dementias state that the protocol developed for Huntingtonâs dis   ease (HD) should be followed . However, the deterministic scenario  prompted by the HD mutation may appear simplistic when we face a  number of additional uncertainties, including: i) the inability to predict the clinical presentation, i .e . the involvement of either muscles, bones,  brain, or all; ii) the low predictive value of a negative test result, due to the high prevalence of cognitive decline among aged individuals .

The aim of the study was to explore womenâs attitudes  towards population genetic susceptibility screening to target breast cancer prevention . Four focus groups were conducted with 26 women aged 40 73 years .  Women were selected irrespective of personal or family history of  breast cancer  . The results show that in general women are positive towards genetic  risk profiling for breast cancer, provided that in the lower risk group,  though maybe less frequent, women are still offered mammography screening . Women reported that they would expect that some women  would find it difficult to cope with knowing to be at higher risk. Others  believed that in this way women would be able to change their lifestyle or start screening at earlier age . Bottlenecks mentioned by the women  were potential problems with insurance, expected high costs of testing, putting too much emphasis on genetics . Women recognized that this  risk profiling was just for one disease, but were ambiguous whether or not it should be extended to other diseases .

It is unknown how much information  these individuals get by their reference physicians before counselling . Materials and Methods: Spanish individuals at risk of HBOCS referred  to genetic counselling were asked to participate in a multicenter study  by fulfilling a self completed questionnaire before BRCA1/2  testing .  Variables were analysed using descriptive statistics and Fisher Exact  test with SPSS . Results: Overall, 243 individuals were enrolled . Median age was 44  years (range 19 88), 88% were women and 67% had a previous diag   nosis of cancer  . Most participants (65%) were referred by a physician,  30% by a relative and 5% were self referred . The reference physician  did not inform 48% of individuals about their risk of developing cancer,  of those informed 70% were told to have a higher cancer risk than the  average population . Physician informed 46% of total individuals about the possibility of genetic testing recommending it to 37% . Seventy  five individuals (31%) did not received any information about genetic  counselling/testing before their risk assessment visit, while the main information source for 74 (30%) was the media . A similar proportion of  cancer patients and healthy individuals at risk of HBOS received previ   ous information by the reference physician (53% vs . 49%, p,0 .58) . Conclusions: A low percentage of individuals at risk of HBOS are in   formed by their reference physician about their cancer risk and ge   netic predisposition before genetic counselling .

"Cancer Knowledge, Risk Perception, and Cancer Worry after Genetic counselling for Hereditary Breast cancer in spain.",EP10.04,"E. Cabrera1, A. Zabalegui1, M. Peris2, I. Blanco2","1Universitat Internacional de Catalunya, Barcelona, Spain, 2Genetic Counseling  Unit","Prevention and Cancer Control Department. Catalan Institute of Oncology,  LâHospitalet, Spain. Identification of a genetic basis underlying breast cancer has led to an  increase in demand for genetic counselling about individual risks of the disease . Genetic Counselling Units are becoming an integral part of  cancer services . It is, therefore, important to assess how attendance at  these clinics impacts on cancer knowledge, cancer related concerns,  and risk perceptions . Previously, we have reported a validation of a  Spanish Translation of the Cancer Worry Scale, Escala de Preocu   paciÃ³n por CÃ¡ncer , which can be used to asses cancer worry in the  setting of genetic counselling . A total of 212 Spanish patients were  consecutively recruited, and 152 completed all questionnaires before and one and 6 months after genetic counselling . Cancer knowledge,  including breast cancer prevention measures, significantly increases after genetic counselling . Patientsâ risk perception did not correlate with the actual breast cancer risk calculated by the counsellors . Pa   tientsâ perceived risk did not modify after genetic counselling . Patients  were significantly less worried after counselling. Higher levels of worry  were predicted by high degree of perceived risk of developing cancer, higher levels of anxiety and low level of education . In conclusion, coun   sellors met the patientsâ psychological needs to a satisfactory degree during counselling . However, patients did not fully understand their risk  of developing cancer  .",2008

mutations of self other relations in genetic counseling discourse,EP10.16,"S. Sarangi , A. Clarke","Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom","Drawing upon the seminal work of George Herbert Mead which under   scores how the âselfâ is conceptualised as a socially situated reflexive  process made possible through the perception of alterity, we propose  that the notions of self and other can be understood at a relational level  along three possible configurations   âself as otherâ, âself and otherâ and âself vs otherâ . The counselling and therapeutic settings, with their  narrative and reflection orientation, give primacy to the `presentationâ  and `performanceâ of the âselfâ, as can be argued from a Goffmanian dramaturgical perspective . Based on a theme oriented discourse analysis of over 50 audio record   ings of genetic counselling sessions covering a range of conditions,  we suggest that different familial lines are mutated along self other  categorisations, reflecting not only the genetic status of the individual  concerned but also the trajectories of past and present familial rela   tions . This means that decisions to test and decisions to disclose test procedures/results have to be other oriented . As far as an individualâs  genetic status is concerned, the âcarrierâ status of a family member  may necessitate a different self other orientation when compared with someoneâs âaffectedâ and âat riskâ status . In conclusion, we argue that in genetic counselling, both counsellors  and clients have to be other oriented by âdecentering the selfâ while  balancing self other relations by warranting, explicitly, situated differ   ences and contingencies . The counsellor by seeking `otherâ perspec   tives becomes other oriented, which simultaneously makes the client  other oriented.

Even if not perceived  as a severe disease in their relatives, for many individuals the possibil   ity of a predictive diagnosis caused significant stress. A protocol for genetic counselling and psychological assessment are fundamental in  this disease . Reasons for the low proportion of secondary cases may be multiple and should be further investigated in the future .",2008

This construction of meaning is a process  that is reinforced with stressful events that may be inconsistent with our beliefs about when and why things happen . The aim of this study  was to evaluate, from a narrative perspective, how biographical factors  may contribute to the formation of different meanings of the genetic diagnosis  . Methods: Three pairs of siblings (n , 6) identified as carriers of a ge   netic defect were evaluated using semi structured interview designed  to identify vital changes associated with the process of genetic coun   seling . Three independent researchers conducted content analysis  and identified significant differences between each pair of interviews by consensus . Results:  In pair of siblings A, the presence of other stressful events  minimize the potential harmful of the genetic diagnosis experienced by  one of the brothers; in pair B, the relationship with a very affected close  relative encourages active coping problem with one of the members;  and in C, the concept of brotherhood and sacrifice allow one of the  sisters assume their genetic alteration as an opportunity to increase their family privacy  . Conclusions: Despite sharing diagnosis, family history of cancer and  genetic counseling process, the narratives of the siblings presented  significant differences between them. The use of different frameworks  of interpretation according to the biography of each subject provides the genetic diagnosis of sense and different consequences .",2008

the impact of a  BRCA  support information group on the choice  for a preventive mastectomy is limited,EP11.1,K. M. Landsbergen,Department of Human Genetics,"From the Hereditary Cancer Clinic, Nijmegen,  The Netherlands. Introduction: Important aims of a BRCA group are assimilation of being  BRCA 1/2 carrier, and professional guidance in choosing prophylactic  mastectomy or breast cancer surveillance . Aim: To determine whether attending a BRCA group influences the choice for surveillance or prophylactic mastectomy  . Patients and methods: 196 BRCA 1/2 mutation carriers were included  of who 89 participated in a BRCA group . Preference for prophylactic  mastectomy was registered after mutation carriership was revealed,  thus before first attendance of the group. Results: Characteristics of patients, who did or did not participate in a  BRCA group, did not show any difference in demographic variables,  age at breast cancer diagnosis, menopausal status or family cancer history  . Preference for preventive mastectomy or surveillance was not  significantly different in participators and non participators, being 31/89 (35%) and 27/107 (25%) respectively (p,0 .13) . After a median observation period of 2 years (range 1 9 years) the  percentage of women actually performing preventive mastectomy was  significantly higher in participators than in non participators of a BRCA group, 45% and 29% respectively (p,0 .02) . However, in the group  with prior preference for mastectomy who did and did not participate  in a BRCA group, prophylactic mastectomy was performed in 90% and 55%, respectively (p,0 .003), in the group with prior preference  for surveillance these percentages were 19% and 20% respectively (p,0 .09) .

The information that needs to be conveyed  is complex, and men often have difficulty accurately weighing up the  costs and benefits of screening tests such as prostate specific antigen (PSA) screening . METHODS: This study has two stages: (i) to develop and pilot test an  online, tailored decision aid for unaffected men with a family history of  prostate cancer to inform them about their risk management options;  and (ii) to compare in a randomised trial the efficacy of the decision  aid to that of a comparison website amongst men at increased risk of developing prostate cancer on the basis of family history  . RESULTS: The early prototypes of the online decision aid were devel   oped using an iterative process involving a working party comprised of experts and a consumer representative . It provides information on the  genetics of hereditary prostate cancer, personal and family risk of de   veloping prostate cancer; putative protective factors; screening tests  and efficacy and side effects of treatment options.

It also assesses  whether experiencing a negative impact on relationships is associated  with psychological distress and whether a positive impact is protective against distress . Methods: A total of 636 French Canadian women from 236 families,  who underwent BRCA1/2 testing in the context of the INHERIT BRCAs program between August 1998 and July 2004, were enrolled . Among  them, 44% had already had cancer; 131 women were found to be mu   tation carriers, 172 non carriers, and 333 had an inconclusive result .  Questionnaires completed at pre test and then at 1, 12, and 36 months  post disclosure were used to assess the perceived impact of testing on family relationships and psychological distress . Results: Three years post disclosure, 11% of women perceived that  testing has a positive impact on their familial relationship compared to only 3% who perceived that the impact was negative . Among mutation carriers, these proportions reach 16% and 7%, respectively  . After con   trolling for a range of socio demographic, medical, and psychosocial  factors, experiencing a negative impact on relationships with a first  degree relative was significantly associated with long term distress (p,0 .04) .

It appears in most families talking about diabetes is not taboo . Most  respondents indicate that âsometimesâ diabetes is discussed; mostly initiated by the patients themselves . Subjects include mainly diabetes related problems; less developing or preventing diabetes onset .

All family relationships are under pressure in these circumstances . At  the same time, people discover capabilities and strengths that would  rarely be known about or used, under more normal situations . Often, the sick childâs primary care giver (usually their mother) has to make choices from several competing needs at the one time . How  are these choices made? On what basis are they prioritised? A great  number of relationships fail in these circumstances, however others are awe inspiring .

mental representations of pregnant women with advanced maternal age (AmA) who undergo amniocentesis: a unique  dynamic process,EP14.01,"A. S. Leonardo1, J. Justo2, I. Cordeiro1","1Hospital Santa Maria, Lisboa, Portugal, 2Faculdade Psicologia e CiÃªncias de  EducaÃ§Ã£o, Universidade de Lisboa, Lisboa, Portugal","Non routine medical procedures, such as amniocentesis, have been suggested to have an emotional impact on pregnant women . Anxiety  is an obvious consequence, the psychological âsuspensionâ of the pregnancy might be another one . We propose that the process of ac   cepting the reality of gestation and the reality of the foetus, expected  to occur respectively in the first and second trimester, is postponed in  AMA women who undergo amniocentesis until after the result comes through . Building mental representations about the foetus is an important part of the psychological process that takes place during pregnancy  . In fact,  some studies have questioned the importance of these representa   tions for the quality of the mother baby relationship/ interaction . Am   niocentesis is thus performed during a crucial period of intense and dynamic internal activity  . The purpose of this study was to understand  how does this procedure influence the dynamic process by which AMA women build representations of the foetus as their âchild to beâ . We applied an adaptation of Interview R to a group of 35 pregnant  AMA women (A) and a control group (NA), before and after amnio   centesis . Before amniocentesis, group A gave âless richâ and âless  positiveâ descriptions of their future babies, and characterised them as âless activeâ and âquieterâ . After the results were known, the only  difference between the two groups was that NA women continued to describe their future children in a more positive way  . These findings suggest that the dynamic process of maternal mental  representations is unique in AMA women who undergo amniocente   sis .",2008

Dying with a family history of cancer: A phenomenological study,EP14.04,A. K. Lillie,"University of Birmingham, Birmingham, United Kingdom","There has been widespread media coverage about the potential for an inherited predisposition to cancer in Britain . This study aimed to describe how this was affecting care needs of palliative care patients . Data was collected through recorded, semi structured interviews with twelve patients with advanced cancer  . Purposive sampling ensured  that participants had been predeceased by at least one first degree relative with cancer  . Data was coded using an iterative approach into  themes that arose from the participants experiences . Van Manenâs  (1990) schema of existential analysis was then used to identify the relationship between the themes under investigation . This study showed that patients were dying with concerns about the implications of their disease for their families . Concerns for children  were widespread and existed in patients who did not think that their  own cancer was associated with an inherited susceptibility, patients  who had been informed that they were not at high risk of familial dis   ease and in patients who had not discussed their anxieties before . The participantsâ experience of dying was affected by previous death  within the family: especially by the deaths of relatives who had died at a younger age than normal . It changed the way the participants com  municated about cancer and affected family cohesion and hence the support available to participants . It also increased their awareness of their dying trajectory, altering the way they coped with the disease . This study show that there are complex challenges for health care pro   fessionals when supporting dying patients worried about their family history of cancer  .",2008

The  prevalence has been estimated to be 1:650, yet up to 70% of males  remain undiagnosed. Early identification has been advocated for many  years, but population based genetic screening for KS has never been explored . Aim: To identify the potential risks and benefits that could arise from  implementing population based genetic screening for KS at different ages and stages of development . Method: A framework was developed to assess the medical (hormone,  therapeutic interventions), psychological (self esteem, relationships)  and ethical (autonomy, associated stigma) implications of genetic  screening for KS in four hypothetical age dependent scenarios   new   born, infancy, primary school entry and high school entry   chosen as  providing opportunistic circumstances in which an individual might be evaluated . The outcomes have been considered in relation to diag   nosis in adulthood and the most common scenario of lifelong non di   agnosis.

However, the ways in which training and supervision differ  for students and supervisors when these activities occur in a second language have not yet been explored . Method: A questionnaire was distributed to members of the CAGC and NSGC using the online survey provider, www  .surveymonkey  .comÂ® .  Data were analyzed using a consensual qualitative method modified from Hill et al . (1997) . Results: Supervisors find it difficult to assess studentsâ psychosocial  counselling skills in the second language, and feel personal discomfort in having an incomplete understanding of session content . Students, in  turn, describe decreased competence when counselling in their second  language, and a greater focus on the medical aspects than on the psy   chosocial dimensions . Interestingly, students whose second language  is French (mainly Canadian) describe more negative experiences and  more difficulties in certain areas, such as building rapport with patients, than do students who counsel in Spanish (mainly American) . This may  reflect differences in patient expectations for receiving service in their native tongue in Canada compared to the US . The language of train   ing, whether it is the studentâs first or second, was described as having  a major impact on counselling abilities and comfort level in the second language . Overall, however, the use of second languages in training  seems to have a positive impact for both students and supervisors,  leading to increased satisfaction in providing linguistically and cultural   ly centered patient care.

However, highly distressed women were  significantly younger than those reporting moderate or low distress  (p<.001) and there was a significant association between distress and  past ovarian cancer screening recall ( p< .05) . Conclusion: The results suggest that although most women reported  low levels of distress prior to UK FOCSS screening, younger women  and those recalled for repeat testing may experience greater distress .",2008
Mental and psychomotor development of 2 year old PGD/PGS twins compared to icsi twins,EP14.19,"J. Nekkebroeck1, M. Bonduelle2, S. Desmyttere2, I. Ponjaert Kristoffersen1","1Vrije Universiteit Brussel, Brussels, Belgium, 2UZ Brussel, Brussels, Belgium","Introduction: Embryo biopsy is a invasive procedure applied in ART  for diagnostic reasons in Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD)  or to increase pregnancy rate in Preimplantation Genetic screening (PGS) . The objective of this ongoing study is to investigate mental and  psychomotor developmental outcomes in 2 year old twins born after PGD/PGS and Intracytoplasmic Sperm Injection (ICSI) . Materials and Method: PGD/ PGS (n , 32) and ICSI (n , 32) children  were recruited from the registry of the Centre for Medical Genetics (UZ Brussel) . The obtained response rates were 97% and 94% respec   tively  . All twins were assessed around age 2 and were matched for  gender, educational level of the mother, birthorder and mothertongue .  There were no significant differences between the 2 conception for these demographics . Mental and Psychomotor development of the 2 groups of study partici   pants was assessed using the Bayley Scales of Infant Development (BSID II NL) . Data on interval level were analysed using ANOVAâs and  a significance level of 0.05 was accepted throughout. Results: Scores on the Mental Scale revealed no differences between the 2 groups (F (2, 62) , 0 .09, p , 0 .764) . Scores on the Motor Scale  neither showed any differences between the PGD/PGS, ICSI and NC twins (F (2, 54) , 1 .16, p , 0 .286) . Conclusion: PGD/PGS twins show similar mental and psychomotor  developmental outcomes at age 2, as measured with the BSID II NL, in comparison to twins conceived after ICSI . In order to provide more  solid reassurance twin children should also be compared to their natu   rally conceived counterparts .",2008
should skin color matter in the Decision to Offer Preconception Genetic screening?,EP14.20,"V. L. Bonham1, S. Knerr1, A. O. Odunlami2","1National Human Genome Research Institute, NIH, Bethesda, MD, United  States, 2Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States","Objective: To investigate the influence of U.S. physiciansâ perceptions  of patient race and ethnicity on their decisions to offer preconception genetic screening . Methods: Primary care physicians (N,1,035) were surveyed to study,  among other aims, their decisions to offer preconception screening  for genetic conditions and the influence of patient skin color and other characteristics on these decisions . Physicians were randomly assigned  to view a vignette with a picture of either a âBlackâ or âWhite patient . Results: 978 physicians answered questions on the vignette of a pa   tient considering pregnancy; her race, ethnicity and ancestry were not  described . Respondents who viewed the âBlackâ patient were more  likely to offer any genetic screening than those who viewed the âWhiteâ EMPAG Posters patient (35% vs . 26%, p< .001) . Screening for sickle cell disease was  offered more often by physicians presented with the âBlackâ patient  (78% vs. 7%, p<.0001) and screening for cystic fibrosis was offered  more often by physicians presented with the âWhite â patient (49% vs .  26%, p< .0001) . Physicians who viewed the âBlackâ patient rated race  as more important to their decision to offer screening than those who  viewed the âWhiteâ patient (76% vs . 49%, p< .0001) . Conclusion: As we move beyond screening for single gene disorders  to screening for multiple gene variants that predict risk for common  complex diseases, a greater understanding of the appropriate use  of phenotypic characteristics including skin color and the social con   structs of race and ethnicity in decisions to offer genetic services, in   cluding preconception genetic carrier screening is needed .",2008
the emotional experience of termination of pregnancy (t OP):  differences between women and men,EP14.21,"A. S. Leonardo , F. Sousa, I. Cordeiro","Hospital Santa Maria, Lisboa, Portugal","Looking at our experience of seven years supporting couples who go  through TOP, we propose there is a difference in the way women and  men go through the emotional process underlying this experience, from beginning to end . Once the couple has made the decision to terminate the pregnancy,  the medical procedure should take place within a short period, because the interval between the decision and TOP is of intense discomfort . We draw from these women and men own words . Some women said they could no longer stand at the mirror and see their growing belly  . Men  recalled no longer touching their spouseâs belly  . Other women said it  was shocking to feel the foetusâ movements while waiting for TOP  . At the time of TOP, women are confronted with a question: should I see  the foetus? Men, on the other hand, know for sure they would choose  not to see the foetus because, otherwise, its image would be recorded and they want to forget this experience as soon as possible . After TOP, women and men usually have different timings when con   sidering another pregnancy  . Women take longer to mourn the foetus  and men are faster to overcome the fear of another loss . Understanding the emotional process of TOP makes professionals  more able to demystify this painful experience at the eyes of the cou   ples . Studying and accepting differences between women and men  going through TOP, helps psychologists minimise the impact of these  couplesâ loss and work with them to find a future project.",2008
can a family history questionnaire for children with an  undiagnosed genetic syndrome replace a face to face  appointment with a genetic counsellor?,EP14.22,"B. J. Dell1, G. Westwood2, C. Phelps3","1School of Medicine, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 2Wessex Clinical Genetics Ser   vice, Southampton, United Kingdom, 3Institute of Medical Genetics, Cardiff,  United Kingdom","Increasing service demands mean that genetics services need to  identify alternative ways of collecting family history information other than through face to face clinics . This study explored whether a family history questionnaire developed by the author for parents of children  with an undiagnosed genetic syndrome (Wessex Family History Ques   tionnaire, WFHQ) can replace a family history gathering appointment  with a Genetic Counsellor and reduce the number of appointments provided . Previous family history questionnaires were evaluated and  the following criteria were utilised to evaluate the WFHQ: response rate, degree of omitted data and reliability  . The WFHQ was piloted in a multiphase approach . Seven parents com   pleted the WFHQ and an evaluation questionnaire and the data as   sessed and compared to the data collected through the face to face clinic . Telephone interviews revealed that the WFHQ was seen as a useful preparatory tool . However parents valued the personal interaction of  the clinic appointment, during which Genetic Counsellors were able to clarify family history details and provide reassurance . The WFHQ clearly enhanced the obtainment of a family history in clinic . However, the use of the WFHQ alone may fail to reduce service  demands, as Genetic Counsellors are likely to have to clarify family history details or seek additional details . Further research is required  to explore alternative methods of service delivery such as collecting  family history data via telephone in order to accommodate rising refer   ral rates .",2008

Most families have  income inferior to two brazilian minimum wages; there are situations  where the family is solely sustained by the governmental benefit re   ceived by the disabled child (50%) . The social isolation of the families,  the absence of the public power, the social impact of the drug traffic  and the recurrent basic human rights violation are aggravating factors  to the violence risk of those who already have vulnerability due to the disability condition .EMPAG Posters ",2008

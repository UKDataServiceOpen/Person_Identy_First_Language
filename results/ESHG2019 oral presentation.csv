 Targeted therapy in patients with PIK3CA related overgrowth syndrome,PL1.3,G. Canaud,"Necker Enfants Malades hospital, Paris, France","CLOVES syndrome (congenital lipomatous overgrowth, vascular malformations, epidermal naevi, scoliosis/skeletal and spinal syndrome) is a genetic disorder that results fromsomatic, mosaic gain of function mutations of the PIK3CA gene, and belongs to the spectrum of PIK3CA related overgrowth syndromes (PROS). This rare condition has nospeciﬁc treatment and a poor survival rate. Here, we describe a postnatal mouse model of PROS/CLOVES that partially recapitulates the human disease, and demonstratethe ef ﬁcacy of BYL719, an inhibitor of PIK3CA, in preventing and improving organ dysfunction. On the basisof these results, we used BYL719 to treat nineteen patients with PROS. The drug improved the disease symptoms in allpatients. Previously intractable vascular tumours became smaller, congestive heart failure was improved, hemihyper  trophy was reduced, and scoliosis was attenuated. Thetreatment was not associated with any substantial side effects. In conclusion, this study provides the ﬁrst direct evidence supporting PIK3CA inhibition as a promisingtherapeutic strategy in patients with PROS. G. Canaud: None. PL2 What ’s New?",2019

The key regulators of developmental defects can be studied during this critical window, but conventional approaches lack the throughputand resolution to obtain a global view of the molecular states and trajectories of a rapidly diversifying and expanding number of cell types. We have developed a three step combinatorial barcoding method to pro ﬁle single cell transcriptomes ( ‘sci RNA  seq3 ′) without requiring physical isolation of each cell. We have used this new method to pro ﬁle whole mouse embryos staged between 9.5 and 13.5 days of gestation with sci  RNA seq3, and created a transcriptional atlas of mouseorganogenesis at single cell resolution ( http://atlas.gs.wa shington.edu/mouse rna/ ). We identify hundreds of expanding, contracting and transient cell types and de ﬁne the corresponding sets of cell type speci ﬁc marker genes, several of which we validate by whole mount in situ hybridization. With Monocle 3, we delineate and annotate56 single cell developmental trajectories of mouse organo  genesis. We explore the dynamics of proliferation and gene expression within cell types over time, including focusedanalyses of the apical ectodermal ridge, limb mesenchyme and skeletal muscle. These data comprise a foundational resource for mammalian developmental biology. This single cell atlas of the development of wild type mice also represent a ﬁrst step towards understanding pleiotropic developmental disorders at the organismal scaleand provides rich opportunities for detailed investigations of subtle roles for genes and regulatory sequences involved in developmental defects.

However, it remains unclear how structure relatesto function and here we aim at studying this by assembling a dataset combining the activity of regulatory elements (ChIP seq for H3K4me1, H3K4me3 and H3K27ac),expression of genes (RNA seq) and genetic variations of 317 European individuals across two cell types (Lympho  blastoid Cell Lines and Fibroblasts). First, we show that the regulatory activity is structured in 12,583 Cis Regulatory Domains (CRDs) that are re ﬂective of Topologically Associating Domains. In addition, we alsoﬁnd 25,315 signi ﬁcant associations between CRDs located on distinct chromosomes that form 30 Trans Regulatory Hubs (TRHs) and re ﬂect the global chromatin organization into A/B nuclear compartments. Second, we show that CRDs and TRHs delimit the sets of active regulatory elements controlling the expression ofmost genes and are key contributors of cis and trans gene co expression. Finally, we show that CRDs are under strong genetic control. We discovered 58,968 chromatin peaks affected by nearby genetic variants (cQTLs). At the CRD level, this converts into genetic control of the activity of 6,157 CRDsand the structure of 110 CRDs. In practice, we estimated that 75% of these are eQTLs and showed that CRDs and TRHs capture complex regulatory networks into which theeffects of eQTLs are propagated and combined to affect gene expression.

Miscarriage is associated with excessive bleeding, infection, depression, infertility and an increased lifetime risk ofcardiovascular disease. A variety of predisposing factors have been associated with increased miscarriage risk, and it has a genetic component that thus far has remained poorlycharacterized. Our aim was to discover and map the maternal genetic susceptibility and underlying biology of sporadic and recurrent miscarriage. Materials and Methods: We performed a genome wide association study including up to 69,118 sporadic mis  carriage cases from seven different ancestries, 750 recurrentmiscarriage cases of European ancestry, and up to 359,469 female controls. We investigated the genetic architecture of miscarriage with biobank scale Mendelian randomization,heritability, genetic correlation and functional annotation analyses. Results: We identi ﬁed one and four loci signi ﬁcantly (p <5×1 0 −8) associated with sporadic and recurrent mis  carriage, respectively. Following functional annotation linked these associations with genes related to gonadotropinregulation, placental biology and progesterone production. We found a heritability of 29% (95%CI 20 –38%) for mis  carriage. Consistent with observational associations, wefound signi ﬁcant genetic correlations between sporadic miscarriage and number of children (p ,7.2 × 10 −9). Conclusion: Our results con ﬁrm miscarriage as a com  plex partly heritable phenotype and implicate novel biology through regulation of genes involved in gonadotropin reg  ulation, placental biology and progesterone production.

Following clear consent practices, and only using aggregate, deidenti ﬁed data, we pooled parent child trio exome data from GeneDx, the Deciphering Developmental disorders study and Radboud University Medical Center to form a dataset of 31,058 DDtrios. We identi ﬁed 45,242 de novo mutations (DNMs), which were called with similar sensitivity and speci ﬁcity across the three cohorts. We devised a novel simulation based method to test for an enrichment of damaging DNMs in individual genes. This method scores all classes of variants on a uni ﬁed severity scale based on the empirically  estimated positive predictive value of being pathogenic, and incorporates a gene based weighting derived from the deﬁcit of protein truncating variants (PTVs) in the general population. Applying this method, we identi ﬁed 307 sig  niﬁcantly enriched genes exome wide of which 49 arenovel. The novel genes have a signi ﬁcantly larger ratio of missense to PTV DNMs compared to the known genes, suggesting they are less likely to act via haploinsuf ﬁciency. We also investigated phenotypic similarity in patients harbouring mutations in the novel genes and compared the phenotypic distribution between the known and novelgenes. Overall, we explained ~51% of the exome wide DNM burden within our dataset. We compared the likelihood of our observed DNMs under different under lying genetic models to estimate how many genes underpin the remaining 49% and the sample size needed to identify these. J.

Inthis study, we report three unrelated children, all from consanguineous parents, with a so far undescribed complex limb malformation consistent with a dorsal dimeliaphenotype (syndactyly, mesomelic shortening, triangular tibia, absent patella, vertically positioned feet and nails on the palmar side of digits). Array CGH identi ﬁed over  lapping homozygous deletions located 200 kb upstream of Engrailed 1 (EN1), a homeobox containing gene involved in brain and limb development. CRISPR/Cas9 induced deletions of the homologous region in mice resulted in a double dorsal limb phenotype recapitulating the human malformation due to a complete loss of En1 expression speciﬁcally in the limb. Using genome wide epigenetic studies in the developing mouse and human limbs, we characterized a new lncRNA ( Maenli – Master regulator of engrailed in the limb) in the deleted region consisting of an approximately 1kb 4 exon transcript. Detailed characteriza  tion in vivo including promoter deletion, promoter inver sion, and insertion of a stop cassette showed that Maenli speciﬁcally regulates En1 expression in the limb but not at other sites such as the brain. We also show that theinactivation of Maenli is the cause of the double dorsal limb phenotype and as such the ﬁrst description of an lncRNA in a human developmental disorder. Our study highlights theinvolvement of lncRNAs as a new disease mechanism in congenital malformations. L. Allou: None. S. Balzano: None. A. Magg: None. M. Quinodoz: None. B. Royer Bertrand: None. R.

" Whole genome sequencing of rare disease patients in anational healthcare systemL. Raymond, on behalf of The NIHR BioResource and the 100,000Genomes Project Rare Diseases Pilot Cambridge Institute for Medical Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom To study genetic variants underlying unresolved Mendelian disorders and to improve interpretation of pathogenic variants, we sequenced the genomes of 13,000 individualswith rare diseases and relatives to an average 30x coverage. Participants were recruited in the UK using approved eligibility criteria for 15 different rare disease domains. Weidentify over 172 million unique short variants (91.5% SNVs, 3% insertions, 6% deletions) in the 10,259 genetically independent samples. Pertinent ﬁndings in over 2,000 diagnostic grade genes with 1,106 unique causal variants (733 SNVs, 263 indels, 104 large deletions, 6 other structural variants) affecting 304 genes were reported.Diagnostic yields varied across disease domains from 1.6–54%. Using a Bayesian genetic association method, BeviMed, we identi ﬁed evidence (posterior probability >0.75) for 99 genetic associations between rare variants and groupings of patients with similar phenotypes. Of these 61 hadﬁ rmly established evidence for causality. We identi ﬁed novel variants in regulatory elements of ARPC1B ,GATA1 , LRBA andMPL . We used Telomerecat software to estimate telomere lengths (TL). We identi ﬁed rare variants in TERT and DKC1 in patients with extremely short TLs.

A 25 Year Genomic Odyssey,PL3.1,C. Venter,"J. Craig Venter Institute, San Diego, CA, United States","In 1995 J. Craig Venter, Ph.D. and team at the Venter Institute sequenced the ﬁrst genome in history followed ﬁve years later when Celera Genomics published the ﬁrst draft human genome which was a composite of ﬁve individual ’s genomes. In 2007 he and his team at the J. Craig Venter Institute published the ﬁrst complete diploid humanAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1047genome, which was his genome. While these genomes were an important starting point for research, they were not enough to change health care. Hundreds of thousands of people need to have their own genome sequenced and done so at a complete and accurate level to have suf ﬁcient data to interpret the genome. Cost was prohibitive and thetechnology was not yet robust enough in 2007 to make this a reality. Three years ago, this changed with the advent of new sequencing technology and improved bioinformaticsand machine learning tools. Dr. Venter and his team continue their work today which was begun decades ago in comparing genotype to phenotype to better understandhuman biology, health and disease. He will discuss ongoing research which the primary objective is to realize the full impact of genomics prediction, to have a thorough under standing of the DNA software and how it codes for the wide range of human phenotypes and abilities. He and his team have a 25 year track record of continually increasing theinformation content that can be derived from the human genome. More recently, we have merged this expertise with an extensive phenotyping platform and machine learningtechniques to demonstrate its predictive power to improve health outcomes. Dr. Venter will also discuss his pioneering work in synthetic biology. In 2010, he and his team at theVenter Institute became the ﬁrst to successfully construct ‘synthetic life ’—putting humankind at the threshold of the most important and exciting phase of biological research,one that is enabling us to actually write the genetic code for designing new species that can be used in many ways for the betterment of mankind. The science of syntheticgenomics is and will continue to have a profound impact on human existence, including new chemical and energy generation, human health and medical advances, cleanwater and food production, positive environmental impact, and possibly even our evolution.

 We and our second genome: two key players in common complex diseases,PL4.1,C. Wijmenga,"Lodewijk Sandkuijl Professor of Human Genetics, UMCG","Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands The manifestation of common complex diseases is the outcome of interaction of many different genetic factors in conjunction with non genetic environmental factors. Inrecent years, the knowledge on our genome has been greatly expanded, as thousands of genetic variants have been associated to hundreds of complex traits and diseases. In addition, we have seen increasing awareness of the important role of another set of genomes in our body, also known as human microbiome or our second genome. Ourgut microbiome encodes some 150 times more genes that the host genome. While the human genome is set at birth, the gut microbiome can undergo dynamic changes over thecourse of an individual ’s life. By making use of the population based LifeLines DEEP cohort, we have shown that the inter individual variation of the gut microbiomecaptures quite some of the variation contributed by genetic and non genetic environmental factors, thereby contributing to the susceptibility to complex diseases. Since the gutmicrobiome can be modi ﬁed, this offers opportunities for future therapeutic interventions. However we ﬁrst need to understand if changes in the microbiome cause disease, orwhether the microbial changes are the consequence of disease. To move towards causality we applied, as a proof  of concept, Mendelian Randomization and were able toshow that microbial changes are causal for type 2 diabetes and metabolic traits. Furthermore, we are developing a gut  on a chip, a sophisticated micro ﬂuidic device to study the interplay between the human host, the gut epithelial barrier, the immune system and the gut microbiome.

Structural Variants (SVs), including deletions and duplica  tions of chromosomal regions, exhibit signi ﬁcant clustering in the genome, re ﬂecting regional differences in mutation rate and the action of natural selection. Our work develops a multi scale regression model to predict SV mutation ratesbased on DNA sequence motif features. By applying our random mutation model to population data, we identify1048categories of functional elements that are under signi ﬁcant SV constraint, including enhancers and promoters and UTRs. We then apply SV constraint to estimate the deleteriousness of SVs in genome sequencing studies, and we demonstrate that a proportion of the inherited risk for autism is attributable cis regulatory structural variants(CRE SVs).

 Updates in clinical applications of psychiatric genetics,S01.3,J. Austin,"1,2","1University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2BC Mental Health and Addictions Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, Canada Background: We now have a substantial and growing list of genetic variations   including both single nucleotide polymorphisms and copy number variations that we canconﬁdently identify as contributing to the etiology of conditions like schizophrenia, bipolar disorder and depres  sion. This progress is accompanied by a need for urgentattention to the question of how to apply this knowledge clinically in such a way as to promote the best possible outcomes for those who live with psychiatric disorders andtheir families. Methods: In this presentation, the outcomes of applying our developing knowledge of the etiology of psychiatricdisorders in the clinical setting will be reviewed. For example, we will explore the psychological importance for people with psychiatric illness and their families of under standing cause of illness, and in particular, the psycholo  gical and behavioural rami ﬁcations of understanding that there is a genetic contribution to these conditions. Theimpact of counseling environment, timing of family history documentation, and risk communication on patient out  comes of psychiatric genetic counseling will be discussed. Results: Through presentation of both quantitative and qualitative, narrative based data, some of the key rami ﬁca  tions of applying psychiatric genetics data in clinical prac tice will be highlighted. Conclusion: These data suggest factors that may be important to consider when implementing genetic data inclinical practice in order to promote the best possible out  comes for patients with psychiatric disorders and their families.

Silva Santos1,2 1Instituto de Medicina Molecular| JLA, Lisbon, Portugal, 2Lymphact   Lymphocyte Technologies S.A., Lisbon, Portugal Immunotherapy is a game changer in the treatment against cancers. In particular, the immune checkpoint blockers that unleash host anti tumour lymphocytes, or the adoptivetransfer of anti tumour T cells have provided remarkable results. Regrettably, although these treatments yield extra  ordinary hope, only a small fraction of patients fullyrespond. Resistance to treatment can be intrinsic to tumour cells, but it is also conferred by the tumour microenviron  ment. We will discuss the principles of immunotherapyexempli ﬁed with current options and results in various types of cancers and envisage the future avenues. Then, I will present two ongoing research lines in our laboratory. First, I will present a cellular immunotherapy product composed of gamma delta T cells that selectively target malignant (but not normal) leukocytes. This subsetexpresses the Vdelta1 TCR and a broad repertoire of natural cytotoxicity receptors (NCRs), such as NKp30 and NKp44, which recognize transformation induced ligands like B7 H6. We will discuss the research behind these lymphocytes, termed Delta One T (DOT ) cells, that leads to their pro  posed testing in leukaemia clinical trials by the end ofthe year. Second, I will provide evidence that we can induce tumour regression in mouse model of breast cancer, in amanner that depends strictly on macrophages. Macro  phages, which can represent over 50% of the tumour immune in ﬁltrate, are usually associated with poor prog  nosis. Although these myeloid cells can also act as powerful anti tumour effectors, the effective induction of anti tumour functions in macrophages remains a major scienti ﬁc and clinical challenge. Thus, our data will shed new light on the remarkable potential that shaping macrophages may offer to design novel avenues for immunotherapy. K. Serre: None. S. Mensurado: None. A. Simões: None. D.

" Minor spliceosome and diseaseAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1049M. J. Frilander University of Helsinki, Helsinki, FinlandThe minor spliceosome, which is also known as the U12 dependent spliceosome, excises rare U12 type intronsduring the nuclear mRNA processing step. U12 type introns are characterized by highly conserved 5 ′splice site and branch point sequences. Human genome contains approxi mately 700 genes carrying U12 type introns, typically one intron in each gene (1). Unlike the normal U2 type introns, the U12 type introns are not typically alternatively splicedto produce multiple protein coding mRNA isoforms. Instead, they show elevated level of intron retention in RNAseq data that has been interpreted as less ef ﬁcient splicing of this type of introns, and a possibility for rate limiting regulation of the genes containing U12 type introns (2,3). Several human diseases have been associated with the minor spliceosome. While only two diseases have been reported to result from mutations in the U12 type intronsplice sites, six diseases feature mutations in the speci ﬁc components of the minor spliceosome (4). Of these, con genital mutations in the U4atac snRNA lead to Micro cephalic osteodysplastic primordial dwar ﬁsm/Taybi Linder Syndrome (MOPD1/TALS) ,Roifman syndrome (RFMN) , and Lowry Wood Syndrome (LWS) . In U12 snRNP, mutations in U12 snRNA lead to Early Onset Cerebellar Ataxia (EOCA) and mutations in RNPC3 toIsolated growth hormone de ﬁciency type I (IGHD) . Additionally, somatic mutations in ZRSR2 have been associated with Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) . Additionally, several neuronal diseases such as SMA and certain forms of ALSshow defects in the splicing of U12 type introns (5). I will give a brief overview of the mechanism and sig niﬁcance of the system with an emphasis to diseases linked to this mRNA processing machinery. I will also discuss the consequences of different mutations in generating diverse defects at the level of individual transcripts, and theirassociation with different disease phenotypes.

Among the latter repetitive class, micro  satellites or short tandem repeats (STRs, ≤10 bp) are particularly dynamic sequences and are prone to expansion mutations that cause >30 neurological and neuromuscular diseases. While STR expansions may occur in both thecoding and noncoding regions of genes, pathomechanistic studies of noncoding expansions led to the discovery of STR induced RNA mediated and protein mediated toxicitymechansims, due to either RNA binding protein (RBP) sequestration or repeat associated non AUG (RAN) transla  tion (RAN), respectively.

 Restoring splicing defects by antisense oligonucleotide therapy,S03.3,R. W. Collin,"Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, Netherlands1050Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are small DNA/RNA","molecules able to modulate pre mRNA splicing, including the correction of aberrant splicing processes due to genetic mutations. AONs are employed for a variety of inherited diseases, including Duchenne muscular dystrophy, spinal muscular atrophy and various metabolic disorders. In thispresentation, I will mainly focus on the use of AONs for inherited retinal diseases (IRD), a group of disorders that is highly heterogeneous, both at the genetic and clinical level.Our proof of concept work on the correction of a recurrent splicing defect underlying CEP290  associated Leber con  genital amaurosis (LCA), one of the most severe subtypesof IRD, has led to the initiation of a clinical trial, with recently announced promising results, demonstrating safety and in some subjects ef ﬁcacy upon intra ocular AON delivery. We expanded the use of AONs for the treatment of other subtypes of IRD, including Stargardt disease (STGD1) which is caused by ABCA4 mutations. Employing midigene splice assays, as well as using patient derived ﬁbroblast cells, we have identi ﬁed the splice defects that are associated with a large group of recently identi ﬁed deep  intronic ABCA4 mutations. In some cases, induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) technology   differentiation of iPSC cells towards a retinal fate   was needed todemonstrate retina speci ﬁc splicing defects. In all cases, AONs were designed that were able to rescue the aberrant splicing events. Another, recurrent, ABCA4 variant (c.768G>T) leads to an exon extension of 35 nucleotides (nt), thereby disrupting the reading frame. Intriguingly, also the 35 nt extension caused by the common c.768G>Tvariant could be rescued by blocking the alternative splice donor site in intron 6, forcing the spliceosome to use the original splice donor site of exon 6. Taken together, AONsappear to be an effective and versatile tool to correct different types of splice defects associated with STGD1. Given the promising data obtained so far in a clinical trialusing AONs for the treatment of CEP290  associated LCA, AONs may serve as a more broadly applicable therapeutic strategy for various subtypes of IRD.

 Polycystic kidney disease and ciliopathies,S04.1,"C.

Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) and autosomal reces sive polycystic kidney disease (ARPKD) are cilia related disorders and the two main forms of monogenic cystic kidney diseases. ADPKD is a common disease that mostlypresents in adults, whereas ARPKD is a rarer and often more severe form of polycystic kidney disease (PKD) that prenatally may result in Potter ’s oligohydramnios sequence. Early and severe forms of PKD are quite common. About the same number of children do carry mutations in the major genes for ARPKD and ADPKD. The latter often arisede novo or may affect both disease alleles in a recessive mode. In addition, mutations in several other cystogenes can phenocopy early and severe PKD. A comprehensiveknowledge of disease causing genes is essential for the correct diagnosis, recurrence risk and parental counselling. Cell biological and clinical research approaches haveexpanded our knowledge of its pathogenesis and revealed some mechanistic overlap between the different forms of PKD. A reduced ‘dosage ’of PKD proteins is thought to disturb cell homeostasis and converging signalling path  ways, such as Ca2 +, cAMP, mTOR, WNT, VEGF and Hippo signalling, and could explain the more severe clinicalcourse in some patients with PKD. Genetic diagnosis might beneﬁt families and improve the clinical management of patients, which might be enhanced even further withemerging therapeutic options.

Indeed, most of the 50 genes identi ﬁed to date in SRNS encode proteins that are expressed in the podocyteand that are structural podocyte proteins or are involved in key biological pathways such as regulation of actin or microtubule dynamics and organization, vesicular traf ﬁck  ing and cellular recycling processes... More recently, important progresses have been made in deciphering the genetic bases of Galloway Mowat syndrome (GAMOS)associating SRNS with neurological defects and micro  cephaly. This syndrome raises the fascinating question of the molecular pathways that could be common to brain andkidney, in line with the growing evidence that podocytes and neurons share a large set of molecular processes essential to development of the glomerulus and the nervoussystem. Disease causing mutations have been identi ﬁed in 8 genes to date: WDR73 encoding a WD40 repeat containing protein required for regulation of cell survival andmicrotubule cytoskeleton dynamics, NUP133 and NUP107 encoding nucleoporins, and very interestingly 5 genes encoding proteins involved in tRNA post transcriptional modi ﬁcations (4 proteins of the KEOPS complex and WDR4, responsible for N 6  threonylcarbamoylation (t 6A) at position 37 in ANN decoding tRNAs and 7 methylguanosine modi ﬁcation respectively.

 CRISPR Gene Editing in Human Organoids for Inherited Renal Diseases,S04.3,B. Freedman,"University of Washington, Seattle, WA, United States","Kidneys cannot naturally regenerate lost tissue, and few preventive medications exist, limiting treatment options to temporary salves of dialysis or transplant with substantial side effects. We have developed a simple method todifferentiate human pluripotent stem cells into intricately patterned, multi segment organoids that resemble kidney tissues. These organoids form via a developmental pathwaythat induces the nephron progenitor cell, which gives rise to podocytes, proximal tubules, and distal tubules along a proximal to distal axis. While beautiful, how to translate organoids into innova  tive therapies for organs as complex as human kidneysremains a critical question. To address this challenge, we have applied CRISPR gene editing to reveal disease mechanisms in organoids and test therapeutic interventions. Mutations associated with polycystic kidney disease or cilia cause organoid tubules to swell thousands of times in size, producing large, ﬂuid ﬁlled cysts of centimeter diameters. In contrast, mutations associated with podocytes, the ﬁl  tering cells of the kidney, do not affect tubules but cause junctional deformities that explain urinary defects in vivo.Harnessing the power of automation, scRNA seq analysis of organoids reveals sixteen different cell types, and iden  tiﬁes a novel three gene signature of glomerular disease that appears in human patients. To improve organoid function and seek therapies, thou  sands of organoids can be manufactured simultaneously inhigh throughput screening formats, and analyzed for multi  dimensional phenotypes of differentiation, toxicity, and disease. Screening reveals treatments that dramaticallyincrease the vascular endothelium, and a surprising role for non muscle myosin in cystogenesis, which can be targeted pharmacologically targeted to modulate cystogenesis.Organoids with live ﬂuorescence reporters and in micro  ﬂuidic kidney on a chip formats provide next generation platforms for phenotypic screening and illumination ofintracellular mechanisms at the tissue scale. Collectively, our ﬁndings delineate key strategies and focus areas for advancement of kidney therapeutics usinghuman organoids as surrogates for drug discovery, gene therapy, and regeneration. B.

These maps are being re ﬁned by1052ongoing single cell sequencing projects (HCA, HuBMAP, etc.), which will eventually give rise to a comprehensive catalog of all cells in the human body. However, we are lagging behind with our ability to assign biological functions to the observed gene regulatory patterns. CRISPR based genetic screens have the potential to accelerate functional and gene regulatory studies, but cur  rent methods have inherent limitations. Widely used pooled screens are restricted to simple readouts including cellproliferation and sortable marker proteins. Arrayed screens allow for comprehensive molecular readouts such as tran  scriptome pro ﬁling, but operate at much lower throughput. To overcome these limitations, we combined pooled CRISPR screening with single cell RNA sequencing into a broadly applicable work ﬂow, directly linking guide RNA expression to transcriptome responses in thousands of individual cells (Datlinger et al. 2017 Nature Methods). Our CROP seq method enables pooled CRISPR screens withsingle cell transcriptome resolution in a way that scales well in the number of cells (up to millions using combinatorial indexing) and target genes (up to genome wide). We and many other labs have found CROP seq broadly useful for studying biological mechanisms that are dif ﬁcult to reduce to a simple readout needed for classical pooledscreens. Applied to heterogeneous cell populations and ex vivo tissue (e.g., in combination with Cas9 expressing mice), CROP seq can identify cell type speci ﬁc regulation in entire organs and uncover cellular differentiation hierarchies. Given the increasing throughput of single cell tran  scriptomics and the advent of single cell multi omics tech  nology (reviewed in: Bock et al. 2016 Trends in Biotechnology), CROP seq enables deep pro ﬁling of large CRISPR libraries and constitutes a powerful method for functional biology at scale.

 Advances in therapeutic CRISPR/Cas9 genome editing,S05.3,G. Schwank,"IMHS, Zurich, Switzerland","The CRISPR Cas genome editing tool holds great promise for treatment of genetic disorders. Clinical translation of these targeted nucleases, however, is hampered by the lowfrequency of precise repair of Cas9 induced DNA double  stranded breaks via homologous recombination from template DNA. This problem is in particular eminent in non dividing tissues such as the adult liver. In my presentation I will provide insights into our efforts of developing in vivo gene editing approaches for mono genetic liver diseases. I will present a study where we circumvented the problem of low rates of homologous recombination in hepatocytes by applying CRISPR associated base editors. Base editors enable direct conver  sion of C ∙Gt oT ∙A base pairs and vice versa by base deamination and independent of DNA break formation andhomologous recombination from template DNA. When targeting a mouse model for the metabolic liver disease Phenylketonuria, systemic delivery of base editors via AAVresulted in gene correction rates that fully restored physiological blood phenylalanine levels. We observed correction rates above 60%, and restoration of thephenylalanine hydroxylase enzyme activity.

 Genetic pro ﬁling in primary care: triggers and impact on risk reducing behaviour,S06.2,N. Qureshi,"NIHR School of Primary Care Research, University of","Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom Currently access to genomic pro ﬁling in Britain is most commonly through direct to consumer testing, such as available at high street retailers. Our studies indicate that family history is an important trigger for many people to engage with testing but discordance between an individual ’s genomic pro ﬁle results and their family history can cause confusion and adversely impact upon their risk reducing lifestyle behaviours, such as weight loss and smoking cessation. Often those individuals taking up direct to consumer testing have already optimised lifestyle risk  reducing health behaviours. Of concern is that positive genomic results may precipitate a fatalistic attitude andnegative health beliefs about improving health. Similarly, negative results may trigger apathy towards risk reducing behaviours, even though these individuals may still be athigh risk of disease as a result of avoidable risk factors. However, non modi ﬁable risk factors, such as genomicAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1053proﬁling and family history, can in ﬂuence (modi ﬁable) lifestyle risk reducing behaviours. One possible driver for lifestyle behaviour change is the anxiety associated with positive genomic test results.

A larger number and broader range of conditions are added to tests such as preconception carrier screening panels andnon invasive prenatal testing (NIPT), which may bene ﬁt couples ’reproductive autonomy. In newborn bloodspot screening (NBS), expansion is facilitated by increasedclinical understanding of disorders and the availability of new treatments, which can improve early diagnosis to prevent irreversible health damage in children. While the expansion of screening tests could be seen as beneﬁcial, it also raises new ethical, psychological and societal issues. Many of the screening developments aretechnology driven, and it is important to attune to parents ’ demand. With the increasing number and type of conditions for which testing can be offered, the number of false posi tive and additional (unclear) ﬁndings increases, thereby complicating information provision and counseling for informed decision making. Abnormal (positive) geneticscreening test results understandably have great impact on parents, but especially uncertain ﬁndings can result in high parental anxiety. In an expansion of the scope of screening the bene ﬁts should outweigh the harms (proportionality). The widening scope of these technologies should therefore be consideredacceptable and meaningful, including the perspectives of its users.

 Polygenic risk scores in prostate cancer,S07.3,R. EelesThe Institute Of Cancer Research & Royal Marsden NHS,"Trust, London, United Kingdom","There are over 1 million cases of prostate cancer (PrCa) worldwide per year and it is becoming the commonest solidcancer in men in the Western world. There is evidence for genetic predisposition to PrCa from case control1054epidemiological studies, and twin studies. The higher risks found with monozygotic versus dizygotic twins support the hypothesis that familial aggregation results from shared genetic rather than just environmental factors. Men of African ancestry have nearly twice the incidence rates of Caucasians. Genetic predisposition to common cancers is mainly due to a mixture of contribution from both common variants with slightly increased risks (generally a relative risk of 2 fold or less) and rarer, higher risk variants which confer higher risks (usually 3 –8 fold). In PrCa predisposition, we now have molecular evidence that both models exist; fur thermore, it is the common cancer with the highest pro  portion of a common genetic variation component. Most of the rarer variants predisposing to PrCa are in the DNA repair pathway. Consistent evidence is now emerging that BRCA mutation carriers who develop PrCa also develop worse disease with a higher proportion of nodal andmetastatic spread, and have a poorer survival. More recently, evidence has also emerged that other genes in this pathway also predispose to PrCa and that the resultant PrCadisease is more aggressive. However, the largest component of genetic predisposition to PrCa is due to commoner genetic variants (occurring in>5% of individuals). Each confers a small relative risk, but because they are numerous and their risks are multiplicative, they can combine to contribute quite substantial relativerisks. In a study of 140 000 individuals using a chip, the OncoArray, with over 500 000 SNPs, in Caucasians, we discovered 65 new SNPs and when combined with previousﬁndings, a total of 170 SNPs explain 38.5% of the familial relative risk of PrCa. In risk strati ﬁcation, men in the top 1% of the genetic risk score group have a relative risk of 5.7fold for developing PrCa compared with the median risk group. These results currently apply to Caucasian popula  tions and a multiethnic analysis is on going. In the talk, I will discuss how common SNP pro ﬁling is being studied to stratify populations for targeted PrCa screening programmes and how such SNP pro ﬁles can modify the relative PrCa risks from the rarer variants.

 Alu elements and cellular RNA metabolism,S08.2,"L. E.

The transposable nature of SINEs, their presence in long noncoding RNAs, their interactions withStaufen (STAU), and their rapid divergence in different evolutionary lineages suggest they could have generated substantial modi ﬁcation of post transcriptional gene control networks during mammalian evolution. Some of the variation in SMD regulation produced by SINE insertion might have been similarly adaptive in separate mammalianlineages, leading to parallel evolution of the STAU network by independent exaptation of SINEs. To explore this, we searched for orthologous gene pairs, each carrying aspecies speci ﬁc3 ′UTR SINE and each regulated by SMD, by measuring changes in mRNA abundance after individual depletion of two SMD factors, STAU1 and UPF1, in bothhuman and mouse myoblasts. We identi ﬁed and con ﬁ rmed orthologous gene pairs with 3 ′UTR SINEs that have been independently exapted in mouse and humans for SMDcontrol of myoblast metabolism.

BurnsJohns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD, United States Interspersed repeat sequences derived from mobile genetic elements make up much of our DNA. In this presentation, I will introduce the concept that transposable element insertions deliver repressed functions to genomic locations trans  activating functions bound by repressive silencers, and splicing functions masked by RNA binding proteins. These antithetical properties are the result of complexrelationships pitting the intrinsic activities of these retro  elements against the host factors that evolve to mitigate their effects. Insertions provide a unique substrate forevolutionary innovation since either of the opposing functions can be made permanent. Our lab studies how the contours of this con ﬂict impact human disease. First, I will describe how speci ﬁc transposable element loci ‘escape ’silencing in diseased tissues. For example, long interspersed element 1 (LINE 1) sequences are commonlyderepressed in human cancers, resulting in somatic retro  transposition events and potentially creating unique mole  cular requirements for cancer cell growth. Second, I willdescribe how rare and commonly occurring inherited insertion alleles can affect mRNA expression and splicing and lead to genetic disease. Examples include highlypenetrant disease alleles, as well as variants with lesser effects that are detectable by genome wide association study (GWAS). We have cataloged 809 polymorphic Alu elements mapping to 1,159 loci implicated in disease risk by genome wide association study (GWAS) (P < 10 −8). We found that Aluinsertion variants occur disproportio  nately at GWAS loci (P ,0.013). Moreover, we have identi ﬁed many of these Aluelements in linkage disequili  brium (LD) with the trait associated SNP. We are nowworking to understand their molecular mechanisms. One variant of interest is an Aluinsertion at the CD58 locus on a haplotype that affects multiple sclerosis (MS) susceptibility(OR,1.3 p,3x10 –10). We found perfect LD between the trait associated SNP (rs2300747) and the intronic Alu insertion. We went on to show that the Alualters splicing of the CD58 mRNA, promoting exon 3 skipping in splice reporter assays, and creating a splice quantitative trait locus (sQTL) in lymphoblastoid cell lines. The aberrant CD58 isoform is frame shifted, and presumed to be non  functional. This work provides a broader perspective on how structural variants of repetitive DNAs may contributeto human disease.

 3D genome organisation in disease: patient speci ﬁc chromatin interactions from primary tissue,S09.3,J. M. Vaquerizas,"Max Planck Institute for Molecular Biomedicine, Muenster,","Germany The three dimensional organisation of the genome plays a fundamental role in the regulation of gene expression. Recent examinations of chromatin conformation have revealed the presence of hundreds of self associatingdomains and thousands of regulatory loops between enhancers and target genes that ensure a correct deployment of developmental programmes. Mutations affecting thesehighly conserved and relatively tissue unspeci ﬁc regulatory features often result in striking developmental defects and disease. Despite the characterisation of such regulatoryfeatures, it is currently unknown when chromatin con  formation is established, the cellular mechanisms that drive this process and how they are affected in disease.

We present the FINEMAP software that couples Bayesian variable selection for ﬁne mapping causal variants with an ultrafast high resolution stochastic search. We show that FINEMAP is as accurate as gold standard exhaustive search implemented in existing ﬁne mapping approaches when the latter can be completed and achieves even higher accuracy when the latter must be constrained due to computational reasons. We further demonstrate that FINEMAP opens up completely new opportunities by ﬁne mapping genomic regions with tens of thousands of variants in few minutes while exhaustive search would require thousands of years. Statistical ﬁne mapping methods that use GWAS results also require Linkage Disequilibrium (LD) information. We report important practical consequences of misspeci ﬁcation of LD that could happen when publicly available reference genomes are used. We demonstrated both empirically and theoretically that the size of the reference panel needs toscale with the GWAS sample size to produce accurate results. This ﬁnding has major implications for the appli  cation of all ﬁne mapping methods using GWAS results from GWAS consortia in which accurate LD information from each participating study is typically not available. GWAS sample sizes soon counted in millions provide unprecedented opportunities to use ﬁne mapping results for downstream analysis. Therefore, we investigate how much of the regional heritability can be explained by a ﬁne  mapping model compared to the variance component model BOLT. Although results from FINEMAP and BOLT showAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1057good concordance in regions with negligible contribution to the genome wide heritability, BOLT yields larger estimates than FINEMAP in regions with moderate to high herit  ability levels. Scaling the analysis to biobank data, we further illustrate how violations of model assumptions on polygenicity induces inaccuracy to heritability estimatesthat become more accentuated as statistical power to iden  tify causal variants increases.

 Leveraging genome wide association studies in diversepopulations to ﬁne map complex human trait loci,S10.2,"A. P. MorrisUniversity of Manchester, Manchester, United Kingdom",Genome wide association studies (GWAS) of complex,"human traits are increasingly undertaken in diverse popula  tions. One approach that shows great promise for thelocalisation of causal variants underlying association signals is the aggregation of GWAS across diverse populations through trans ethnic meta analysis. Trans ethnic ﬁne map  ping is enabled by the observation that many lead SNPs for complex traits are shared across diverse populations, which is consistent with a model for which the underlying causalvariants are the same across ancestry groups and were derived from mutations that occurred before human population migration out of Africa. Under this model,trans ethnic ﬁne mapping then takes advantage of the observation that patterns of linkage disequilibrium (LD) amongst common variants vary between populations. As aresult, across ancestry groups, we would expect to see strong association signals only at the causal variant and those SNPs in strong LD with the causal variant in allpopulations studied: the greater the diversity of GWAS, the more re ﬁned the localisation will be. We will review methods for trans ethnic GWAS meta analysis, presentsimulations demonstrating the improved ﬁne mapping resolution achieved with this approach, and highlight applications of these techniques to localising potentialcausal variants at complex human trait loci.

 Large scale integration of genetic and ‘omics ’data to ﬁnd susceptibility genes for obesity and fat distribution,S10.3,S. L. Pulit,"1, J. Fernandez2, T. Karaderi3, S. Laber3,","T. Brown3, A. P.

Lindgren31University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2Wellcome Trust Center for Human Genetics, Oxford, United Kingdom,3Big Data Institute, Oxford, United Kingdom,4University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom,5Broad Institute, Boston, MA, United States Body fat distribution is a heritable trait and a well  established predictor of adverse metabolic outcomes, independent of overall obesity. Recently, we performed agenome wide association study (GWAS) meta analysis of 694,649 individuals from the Genetic Investigation of ANthropometric Traits (GIANT) Consortium and UKBiobank (UKBB) and identi ﬁed 346 genome wide sig  niﬁcant (p < 5 × 10 –9) loci associated to WHR adjusted for BMI (WHRadjBMI). Additionally, we recapitulated theknown sexual dimorphism observed in WHRadjBM: ~30% of all loci are sex dimorphic, with most signals showing a larger effect in women. Notably, this sexual dimorphism isvirtually absent in GWAS of BMI, prompting a host of questions around the underlying biology of fat distribution and how elucidating (potentially sex speci ﬁc) mechanisms could yield insights into the etiology of fat distribution. We thus set out to perform comprehensive ﬁne mapping and enrichment testing in the 346 loci associated withWHRadjBMI, as well as the 266 and 91 loci discovered in the women only and men only meta analyses, respectively. We used up to 484,563 samples from the UK Biobank to:(i) examine enrichment of WHRadjBMI associated loci in hundreds of cell and tissue types, (ii) perform Bayesian ﬁne  mapping to generate so called ‘credible sets ’of likely  causal SNPs, (iii) test for global and local patterns of enrichment of the credible sets in various genomic anno  tations, and (iv) perform functional work on likely causalvariants and genes. Global pathway analyses across the full GWAS results replicated the previously described enrichment ofWHRadjBMI signals in subcutaneous (p ,1.12 × 10 –8) and visceral (p ,1.23 × 10 –6) adipose tissue. We addi  tionally observed novel enrichments in reproductive tissues,including cervix and uterus (pectocervix ,5.84 × 10 –5 and puterus ,8.65 × 10 7), a notable ﬁnding given the link between obesity, fat distribution, and fertility complications. We next used a Bayesian ﬁne mapping approach (FINEMAP) to generate credible sets at each locus that capture 99% of the posterior probability that the causal SNP(s) are in that SNP set (i.e., the ‘99% credible set ’). We found that for 215 of the 346 (~62%) in the combined sample, FINEMAP identi ﬁed only 1 likely causal SNP. A similar proportion of the women only and men only loci were most likely to contain only 1 causal SNP. Finally, we tested to see if our credible sets were enriched in genomic annotations via ENCODE and the Roadmap Consortium. We found that SNPs in credible sets derived1058from the GWAS of WHRadjBMI in men were enriched in ChIP seq binding tracks for EZH2, a component of the polycomb repressor complex 2 implicated in the adipo  genesis pathway. We are currently characterizing the functional effect of SNPs that overlap EZH2 binding motifs. Our work demonstrates how large scale GWAS data, in combination with ﬁne mapping approaches and integration of omics data, can be leveraged to begin revealing pertur  bations in biological pathways that drive alterations in fatdistribution. These efforts may additionally provide insights into sex speci ﬁc mechanisms potentially relevant to the treatment of obesity and its sequelae. S.L. Pulit: None. J. Fernandez: None. T.

Investiga tion of exome wide de novo variants (DNV) in 6,753 NDD parent offspring trios revealed unexpected ﬁndings when comparing the genetic spectrum of 1,942 individuals withversus 4,811 individuals without epilepsy. Despite marked phenotypic differences, “epileptic encephalopathy ”shares a similar genetic spectrum with “NDD with unspeci ﬁed epilepsy ”, which is not re ﬂected by current clinical classi ﬁcations. In general, individuals with missense DNV were more likely to have epilepsy than individuals withtruncating DNV. 33 genes displayed a signi ﬁcant excess of DNV in epilepsy cases, of which SNAP25 and GABRB2 had previously only limited evidence of disease association.Joint analysis of the overall cohort also implicated CACNA1E as a novel NDD gene. Furthermore, comparing the designs of 24 diagnostic epilepsy panels of differentproviders revealed extensive inconsistencies. All panel designs lacked various genes with high diagnostic value and by contrast showed vast excess of genes with low or nodiagnostic value. Among genetically solved epilepsy cases, the individual DNV gave rise to personalized treatmentapproaches in more than 25%, emphasizing the importance and the bene ﬁt of accurate genetic diagnostics in NDD, especially when accompanied by epilepsy.

 Parental Mosaicism in “De Novo ”Epileptic Encephalopathies,S11.2,H. C.

Genetic counseling for recurrence risk when a family has a child with a de novo pathogenicvariant, estimated at around 1 –3%, is largely based on empirical data and accounts for the possibility of germline mosaicism in one parent. In families where parentalgermline mosaicism is present, however, the true recurrence risk may be as high as 50%. Low level mosaicism is easily missed by Sanger sequencing technology, but massivelyparallel sequencing technology permits deep sequencing and allows the detection of mosaic alleles. In this talk, I will discuss work from our group and others to investigate the frequency of parental germline mosaicism for apparently de novo pathogenic variants, which may be higher than previously appreciated. The clinical implications and impacton segregation testing will also be discussed. H.C. Mefford: None.",2019

 Genetic heterogeneity in CDG: where are the patients?,S12.1,G. Matthijs,"Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven,","Belgium Theﬁeld of Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) has expanded enormously in 20 years. It has become practically impossible to keep track of their number; a review from last year listed 105 different types (Péanneet al. Eur J Med Genet. 61(11):643 –663, 2018). PMM2  CDG remains by far the most frequent type 1 CDG (two  thirds of the cases collected by the EUROGLYCANETconsortium). MAN1B1 CDG and several COG de ﬁciencies are among the more frequent type 2 CDG. Almost all CDG are recessive disorders, either autosomal or X linked.However, the collection of CDG harbours a number of genetically interesting observations. Thus far, ALG1 deﬁciencies were rarely identi ﬁed because a large number of pseudogenes complicates diagnostics; this has now been solved by using an NGS approach. COG4 CDG was known as a typical CDG. Recently, it was shown that a recurrent de novo COG4 mutation causes Saul Wilson syndrome. Interestingly, a 5 ′upstream GGC expansion of the XYLT1 gene is present either in a homozygous or in a compoundheterozygous state in a large majority of patients with Baratela Scott syndrome. Defects in the X linked SLC35A2 gene are dominant, with severe, early onset presentations ingirls. De novo mosaics were described in male patients, also severely affected, while somatic mutations in the brain have been shown to cause severe intractable epilepsy.

 Link between Golgi ion homeostasis defects and Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation,S12.3,F. Foulquier,"CNRS UMR 8576, University of Lille, Villeneuve D ’Ascq,","France Within the secretory pathway, ionic homeostasis of each organelle is unique in terms of H +,C a2+and Mn2+1060concentrations. Many transporters and pumps ﬁnely reg  ulate these homeostasis in the Golgi compartment, known to be crucial for many cellular processes such as the vesicular fusion event, the secretion of proteins but also the activities of Golgi glycosyltransferases and glycosidases. For exam  ple, in eukaryotic cells, the Ca2+concentration along the secretory pathway (ER/ Golgi) decreases progressively. Many pumps and transporters are involved in this tight regulation such as SERCA and SPCA1 pumps. Mutationsof the secretory pathway Ca 2+ ATPase isoform 1 (SPCA1) cause a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder called Hailey  Hailey disease. Similarly, mutations of ER SERCACa 2+ ATPase cause also a rare autosomal dominant skin disorder called Darier Disease. Alterations of Golgi pH can also cause diseases such as autosomal Cutis laxa (type II) where N  and O glycosylation are altered as well as the trafﬁcking of speci ﬁc proteins. To add an extra layer of complexity, defects in TMEM165, SLC39A8 and recentlyin SLC10A7, were discovered to be associated to strong Golgi glycosylation abnormalities leading to Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG). In these de ﬁciencies, disruptions in the Golgi Ca 2+/M n2+homeostasis are thought to be the molecular cause leading to glycosylation defects. This talk will ﬁrst summarize the molecular machineries involved in the ER/ Golgi ion homeostasis regulation and then the associated diseases resulting from defects in Golgi ion homeostasis. F.

 Understanding mutational processes and tumor biology,S13.1,"A. Gonzalez Perez1,2","1Institute for Research in Biomedicine, The Barcelona","Institute of Science and Technology, Barcelona, Spain, 2Department of Experimental and Health Sciences, University Pompeu Fabra, Barcelona, Spain In our lab, we use data on genomic mutations in tumors in two broad areas of research. On the one hand, we study thedistribution of mutations across different regions in the genome to understand basic questions about molecular biology, such as the interplay between DNA damage andrepair, and other cellular processes. With these studies we have discovered different small scale genomic features  i.e., spanning between a dozen and a few hundred base pairs that interfere with the deposition of different types of DNA damage and the mechanisms of DNA repair. For example,we recently showed that the periodicity in the orientation of the DNA minor groove with respect to nucleosomes determine a periodic pattern in the generation of somatic mutations across human tumors, germline variants across populations, and genetic divergence across closely related species. We demonstrated that the known widespread WWperiodicity across eukaryotic genomes −10 bp A/T dinu  cleotides periodicity  could have arisen as a result of the periodic de novo mutation rate. On the other hand, we study the genetic basis of tumors and their basic biology. Combining an ensemble of bioin  formatics tools developed in our group and others with theaim of detecting signals of positive selection in the pattern of mutations of genes across tumors, we have produced a catalog of the genes that drive tumorigenesis in 60 cancertypes. We go one further step to identify which amongst all the mutations of these genes drive each individual tumor. I will present IntOGen, a cancer genomics platform thatmakes available to all researchers the catalog of driver genes and driver mutations across more than 50,000 tumors. Different types of somatic alterations affect both oncogenesand tumor suppressors. Recently, we have carried out the ﬁrst systematic analysis of the role of abnormal protein degradation in tumorigenesis. We found that more than 10%of all driver mutations across well known cancer genes cause tumorigenesis through the abnormal stabilization of oncoproteins. A. Gonzalez Perez: None.",2019

Genotyping cancer tissues has inherent limitations and tissue biopsies cannot beperformed repeatedly. Liquid biopsy tumor genotyping using circulating cell free tumor DNA (ctDNA) in the blood  has been recently applied to molecularly pro ﬁle cancer patients, to monitor tumor burden during therapy and to uncover novel mechanisms of resistance to targeted therapies. We used metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC) asa model to assess whether liquid biopsies could in principle uncover molecular mechanisms responsible for the emer  gence of resistance and track clonal evolution duringtargeted therapies. Emerging evidence indicates that escape from EGFR and HER2 targeted therapy are molecularly heterogeneous and involve several genes. We exploitedplasma ctDNA analysis by Next Generation Sequencing and Digital PCR to de ﬁne gene alterations responsible for primary or acquired resistance to anti EGFR and anti HER2therapies. While most mCRC patients who receive anti  EGFR antibodies develop KRAS mutations during treat  ment, we found that additional mutations affecting keynodes of the EGFR signaling pathway can also confer resistance. Mutated KRAS clones, which emerge in blood during EGFR blockade, decline upon withdrawal of EGFR speciﬁc antibodies, indicating that clonal evolution con  tinues beyond clinical progression. ctDNA pro ﬁles of individuals who bene ﬁt from multiple challenges with anti EGFR antibodies exhibit pulsatile levels of mutant KRAS . These results indicate that the CRC dynamicallyadapts to intermittent drug schedules and provide a molecular explanation for the ef ﬁcacy of rechallenge therapies based on EGFR blockade. In parallel, we focused on HER2 ampli ﬁed CRC. Targeting HER2 is effective in 30% of ERBB2  ampli ﬁed mCRC, and most sensitive cases eventually relapse. We studied the molecular evolution ofindividual metastases during HER2 targeted treatment to discover spatially resolved determinants of resistance in mCRC. ctDNA analysis identi ﬁed alterations associated with lack of response in the majority of refractory patients. CtDNA pro ﬁles and lesion speci ﬁc radiographic reports revealed organ  and metastasis private evolutionary patternsin patients who had initially responded. Of clinical relevance, we found that a simple blood assay would have identi ﬁed the HER2 sensitive patients. Finally, exploiting whole exome data from individual lesions we designed metastases speci ﬁc SNV panels. When the latter were coupled with T Cell Receptors pro ﬁles (corresponding to metastases speci ﬁc T Cells in ﬁltrates) we were able to concomitantly track in the blood the evolution of neoplastic and T Cells during several rounds of therapy. Blood basedanalyses also revealed a direct correlation between lesions ’ size and contribution to plasma ctDNA pool, an information which was previously not available in metastatic colorectalcancers.

This is because public perception is based not only on scienti ﬁc data and medical knowledge, but on narratives shared on socialmedia platforms and opinions expressed by outspoken critics and celebrities, many of whom have no medical training, experience, or knowledge.

All of molecular life science is feeling this effect. Molecular techniques   from genomics through tran  scriptomics and metabolomics   continue to drop in price and turnaround time. This creates a wealth of opportunity for clinical research and, in some cases, active changes inclinical practice even at this early stage. The development of this work requires inter disciplinary teams spanning basic research, bioinformatics and clinical expertise. This shift in modality is creating a wealth of new opportunities and has some accompanying challenges. In particular there is a continued need for a robust informationinfrastructure for molecular biology and clinical research. This ranges from the physical aspects of dealing with data volume through to the more statistically challenging aspectsof interpreting it. A particular opportunity is the switch from research commissioning genomic measurement to healthcare centricgenomic measurement. This is occurring in a number of countries worldwide, including Australia, Denmark, Fin  land, France, United Kingdom and United States. TheGlobal Alliance for Genomics and Health is providing a standards setting organisation to allow for both a deepening of the technical aspects of healthcare and for appropriatesecondary use for research of healthcare commissioned genomics data. I will outline the overall challenge present in this new, interdisciplinary ﬁeld, the global coordination needed to achieve its goals, and the role that the EMBL European Bioinformatics Institute is seeking to play.

" Pulling the Strands Together: MEGA Steps to Drive European Genomics and Personalised MedicineD. D. Horgan European Alliance for Personalised Medicine, Bruxelles, Belgium The increasing understanding of the genome is recognised as being one of the main determinants of future improve ment in healthcare. The availability of genetic data from a large number of individuals increases the ability toinvestigate questions across many rare and common diseases and in different populations, and also provides more information for understanding clinical care outcomesfor an individual. A number of large scale genome sequencing initiatives have been launched in the last few years to try and capitalise on this potential. Within Europe,the UK has led the way with the 100,000 Genomes Project. This project looks at the genome sequences of patients with rare diseases or cancer. More recently France announcedplans to invest EUR 670 million in a genomics and personalised medicine programme. In the US, the Precision Medicine Initiative aims at large scale research by gatheringone million or more volunteers to extend precision medicine to all diseases. Meanwhile, China has announced plans to invest nearly USD 10 billion in its own precision medicineinitiative. These projects demonstrate the commitment at a national level and raise the question “What bene ﬁts would be realised by undertaking a million genome initiative in acoordinated effort across European countries? ”A coordi nated, pan European MEGA project would garner crucial genetic information that could have an immeasurablebeneﬁt when it comes to the health of current and future EU citizens.",S17.4,D.D.

Using traditional and new population genomics analysis approaches, we estimate the deepest human population divergence time to between 350,000 and 260,000 years ago. This estimateincreases the deepest divergence among modern humans, coinciding with anatomical developments of archaic humans into modern humans as represented in the localfossil record, and suggest that modern humans emerged around 300,000 years ago.

Here I present a new approach(called fastGLOBETROTTER) to identify and date admixture using dense genom e wide Single Nucleotide  Polymorphism (SNP) data that is more accurate and 4 –20 fold faster than the GLOBETROTTER software that similarly exploits haplotype information to increase precision over existing approaches. I demonstrate theupper limit of time depths on historic intermixing that these techniques can detect reliably when using increas  ingly larger cohorts of genetically similar individuals.

Furthermore, I illustrate the phenotypic effects that recent migration has had on a geographic region, such as height in the United Kingdom. I describe new statistical approaches that can model admixture processes when identifyinggenetic regions affected by selection. These techniques can (1) identify the loci and populations involved in selection, (2) enable the joint testing of SNP sets (e.g. in pathways),and (3) account for variation in data quality when incor  porating DNA from ancient human remains.

They encompass common muscular dystrophies suchas Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD); motorneuron diseases such as spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), and less common limb girdle muscular dystrophies, peripheralneuropathies and congenital myopathies. Each of these conditions presents its own therapeutic challenges. In muscular dystrophies one major obstacle is the abundanceof the target organ (skeletal muscle is ~40% of the body weight), the need to target the heart and, as far as DMD is concerned, the size of its cDNA that, at 14 Kb, precludesthe use of commonly used viral vectors. For SMA, one of the challenges is the need to target all motorneurons, and the short window for therapeutic intervention in this rapidlyprogressive condition affecting infants. For congenital myopathies such as myotubular myopathy, the profound severity of affected children and their fragility complicatethe design and execution of clinical trials. The landscape for these conditions is however very changing rapidly, thank to early success in landmark studies, of which the mostadvanced are those in SMA and DMD. An AAV9 vector originally developed at Columbus University, has demon  strated to be able to ef ﬁciently correct motorneurons after intravenous administration, with acquisition of unprece  dented functional achievements in SMA1 patients. The same group in Columbus also initiated in 2018 the ﬁrst AAV9 clinical trial for DMD, in which a highly internally deleted “minidystrophin ”is packaged. Early data appear encouraging. Shortly after 2 additional industry sponsoredstudies initiated their AAV9 DMD clinical trials.

 Gene therapy for hemoglobinopathies,S19.3,G. Ferrari,San Raffaele Telethon Institute for Gene Therapy (SR,"TIGET), Milan, Italy Sickle cell disease (SCD) and ß thalassemia major are congenital anemias caused by mutations in the ß globin gene, resulting in either abnormal hemoglobin structure orreduced/absent production of ß globin chains. They are the most common monogenic disorders associated to morbidity and mortality. Treatment of these diseases is essentiallysupportive, requiring transfusions, iron chelation and use of hydroxycarbamide in SCD. At present, the only curative approach is represented by allogeneic hematopoietic stemcell transplantation, with a probability to ﬁnd a well  matched donor of <25%. Ex vivo gene therapy, using autologous genetically modiﬁed hematopoietic stem cells, potentially represents a cure applicable to all patients regardless of donor avail  ability and free from transplant related immunologicalcomplications such as graft rejection and graft versus host  disease. The development and large scale production of clinical grade HIV derived lentiviral vectors expressinghuman ß globin, and the optimization of gene transfer protocols in HSCs have progressed this ﬁeld to the pio  neering clinical trials in France and in U.S.A., and morerecently in Italy. The ﬁrst results of clinical bene ﬁt, including early engraftment, hemoglobin expression and transfusion independence were reported for some patientsand are proving the potential ef ﬁcacy of this therapeutic approach.

It is common use the consensus of multiple algorithms to detect SV with minimal false discovery,1068however the extent of missing variation is unknown. To address this, we applied a suite of approaches: long read, short read, strand speci ﬁc sequencing technologies, optical mapping, and variant discovery algorithms to comprehen  sively analyze three human parent child trios to de ﬁne the full spectrum of human genetic variation in a haplotype resolved manner. We identify 818,054 indel variants (<50 bp) and 27,622 SVs ( ≥50 bp) per human genome. We also discover 156 inversions per genome —most of which previously escaped detection. Fifty eight of the inversions we discovered intersect with the critical regions of recurrent microdeletion and microduplication syndromes. Takentogether, our SV callsets represent a sevenfold increase in SV detection compared to most standard HTS studies, including those from the 1000 Genomes Project. We usethese SV callsets to assess the performance of HTS studies including the types of variation that are missed by many current studies, SV detected in functional noncoding DNA,and the combinations of algorithms that most effectively detect SV in HTS reads.

Indeed, cells can chemically modify DNA to dynamically modulategene transcription and this phenomenon, together with histone protein modi ﬁcation, is known as epigenetic regulation of gene expression. It is regulated by a varietyof factors, including developmental cues and environmental stimuli, and alterations in epigenetic control play essential roles in several genetic diseases. We will address the following key issues in the ﬁeld of epigenetics and epigenomics: 1. Since DNA methylation is a reversible process, there is potentially a huge bene ﬁt in modulating DNA methylation for the treatment of human diseases, notably cancer. To achieve such anti cancer therapy, it is essential to decipherthe underlying molecular mechanisms. An overview of the most recent mechanisms will be presented. 2. We will also describe recent epigenomic efforts to better understand and map epigenetic alterations in cancers, including DNA methylation and hydroxymethylation.3. Although the multiple layers of epigenetic regulation that result from modi ﬁcations of DNA and histones have been intensely explored, a new ﬁeld is emerging, termed « RNA epigenetics », the study of RNA modi ﬁcations. We will discuss about the exciting potential of these modi ﬁca  tions to ﬁne tune mRNA functions, which is changing our perception of epigenetic regulation. F. Fuks: None.

Indeed, previous work from our laboratory and others have demonstrated that, within a single tissue, species speci ﬁc regulatory elements are extremely common and thatenhancers evolve more rapidly than promoters. To understand the evolution of tissue speci ﬁc gene reg  ulation, we have generated genome wide maps of enhancersand promoters as well as matched gene expression data in four tissues —liver, muscle, brain and testes —for 10 diverse mammalian species. For all species, the three somatic tis sues show a consistent regulatory pro ﬁle with the majority of promoters active across multiple tissues, while enhancer activity is mostly tissue speci ﬁc. Testes are consistently different and display a regulatory pro ﬁle associated with increased transcriptional activity. We are able to classify enhancers into different types, as evidenced by distincthistone enrichment pro ﬁles, and show that they evolve at different rates.

LindstrandKarolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden","In recent years, technological advances have improved the","turnaround time and cost effectiveness of human genetic investigations in both diagnostics and research. However,most focus has been on single nucleotide variation (SNV). In contrast, the calling and interpretation of structural variants (SV) is still challenging and causal mutations oftengo unnoticed in genome studies. Further, the methods applied currently in genetic diagnostics have limitations in detection and resolution and in consequence causal variantsmay be missed or misinterpreted, resulting in sub optimal clinical management. Both balanced chromosomalrearrangements and copy number variants (CNVs) as detected by karyotyping or chromosomal microarray might beneﬁt from further investigation by whole genome sequencing (WGS) to accurately resolve the structural rearrangement. We and others have shown that unexpected complexities are common ﬁndings in the breakpoints of karyotypically balanced chromosomal rearrangements. Such ﬁndings are of clinical importance, as they may be the cause of mendelian phenotypes in the rearrangementcarrier. Short read WGS allows for high resolution characterization of SVs, but problems remain for mapping breakpoints located in repetitive regions of the genome,which are known to be prone to rearrangements. In our study, we use multiple complementary WGS experiments to phase and solve the structures of chromosomal rearrange ments. In many cases, by delineating the derivative chromosomes we provide a molecular genetic explanation for the clinical symptoms observed in the carrier. Further more, we compare the performance, sensitivity and resolution of different WGS techniques in a clinical diagnostic laboratory set. A. Lindstrand: None.

 Pharmacogenomics based personalized drug treatment across world populations,E06.2,A.

Each exhibits a wide range of activity among individuals within a population and among world popula  tions. Extreme phenotypes can explain adverse drug eventsor treatment failure. In addition, HLA loci with distinct ethnic and geographical distributions, can cause severe, if not life threatening adverse drug reactions. Rich resources for the implementation of pharmacoge  netics include the Clinical Pharmacogenetics Implementa  tion Consortium which publishes clinical practiceguidelines, the Pharmacogene Variation Consortium, which serves as a centralized repository for allelic variation and the Pharmacogenomics Knowledge Base, which curatesknowledge about the impact of genetic variation on drug response for clinicians and researchers. Brief overviews will be provided. Implementation of pharmacogenetics into clinical practice still faces a number of challenges including testing and test interpretation. As exempli ﬁed on CYP2D6, genotype ana  lysis is not trivial due to SNPs, indels, copy number var  iation and rearrangements with the CYP2D7 pseudogene. Other challenges are the translation of genotype into phe notype and the assignment of function to allelic variants. Furthermore, a distant SNP has been shown to impact CYP2D6 activity in vitro, but there is little known regardingits impact on activity in vivo. Ongoing studies addressing the question whether this SNP needs to be taken into account for phenotype prediction from genotype data willbe presented. Pharmacogenetics is increasingly utilized to individualize drug therapy.

However, it remains unclear in which cell types these variants may be active, which is essential for understanding disease etiology and for disease model ling. Recently we integrated GWAS results with single cell transcriptomic data from the brain and the entire nervous system to systematically identify cell types underlyingpsychiatric disorders as well as neurological conditions and other brain complex traits. We show that psychiatric disorders are predominantly associated with excitatoryneurons from the cortex/hippocampus, medium spiny neurons from the striatum, diverse sets of midbrain neurons, and inhibitory neurons from the cortex/hippocampus.Cognitive traits were generally associated with similar cell types but their associations were driven by different genes. Neurological disorders were associated with different celltypes, consistent with other lines of evidence. Notably, we found that Parkinson ’s disease is not only genetically associated with dopaminergic neurons but also withserotonergic neurons and cells from the oligodendrocyte lineage. Using post mortem brain transcriptomic data, we conﬁrmed alterations in these cells, even at the earliest stages of disease progression.

 Mosaic loss of chromosome Y (LOY) in leukocytes: from discovery to impact,E08.1,L. A. Forsberg,"Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden","A growing number of epidemiological investigations show that LOY is linked with morbidity and mortality in men. LOY in blood cells is the most common acquired human mutation and is associated with increased risk for all causemortality and disorders such as various forms of cancer, Alzheimer ’s disease, cardiovascular disease, autoimmune conditions, age related macular degeneration and type 2diabetes. As a male speci ﬁc genetic risk factor, LOY could help explain why men in the entire world live shorter lives than women. It is not established whether the associations between LOY in leukocytes and risks for disease in other organs represent causal relationships, and if so, what the underlyingmechanisms could be. For example, LOY is associated with factors such as age, smoking as well as genetic background, and part of the LOY associated increased risk for variousoutcomes might be explained by these confounders. How  ever, we have also proposed a hypothesis involving dis  turbed functions of blood leukocytes without a Ychromosome and reduced protection against disease in men with LOY. Hence, LOY in immune cells might be responsible for impairment of normal immune systemfunctions such as in ﬂammation and immune surveillance, responsible for elimination of abnormal cells and structures throughout the soma. To investigate if LOY changes the normal properties of immune cells we have studied LOY at the levels of DNA , RNA  and plasma proteome; in bulk, sorted  and single cells in vivo and in vitro. For example, we have (i) mapped the level of LOY in six major immune cell types in patients diagnosed with Alzheimer ’s disease and prostate cancer, (ii) studied changes in gene expression in cells with LOY and identi ﬁed numerous genes showing LOY associated tran  scriptional effect (LATE) and (iv) found that LOY leaves afootprint in the plasma proteome. These ﬁndings support the hypothesis that functions of immune cells is compromized as an effect from LOY, and thus, provide clues towardmechanistic explanations for the associations between LOY in blood cells and increased risk for disease in other organs.

" Genetic diversity and its unexpected impacts onrecombination, genome evolution, speciation and sterility in mammals",E10.1,R. Li,"1, E. Bitoun1, N. Altemose2, R. W. Davies3,","B. Davies1, S. Myers1 1University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom,2Univer  sity of California, Berkeley, CA, United States,3The Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, CanadaDuring meiotic recombination in most mammals, hundreds of programmed DNA Double Strand Breaks (DSBs) occur across all chromosomes in each cell at sites bound by the protein PRDM9, and resolve into recombination events, which generate new genetic diversity. Conversely mutations in PRDM9 itself, and at binding sites of PRDM9, driveprofound differences in the recombination landscapes both among individuals, and between all species possessing this gene so far examined, so diversity impacts recombination.PRDM9 is also the only known mammalian speciation gene, causing meiotic failure and male limited sterility in certain mouse hybrids. Our work has revealed that this isdriven by PRDM9 mainly binding “non shared ”sites that differ between the two homologous genomic copies present in hybrids, due to evolutionary mutations. This leads tounrepaired DSBs, failure to pair chromosomes, and sterility, indicating strong impacts of local sequence divergence on recombinational repair, via still unknown mechanisms.Fertility is fully restored by engineering mice with different, shared, PRDM9 binding sites. We will discuss new work that characterizes the impact of local sequence divergenceon mammalian recombination, using thousands of directly detected crossover and non crossover recombination events from a mouse hybrid cross, resolved with unprecedentedpower and resolution. Recombination events, but not DSBs, are strongly depleted at the “non shared ”sites. Therefore, mutations within PRDM9 binding sites disrupt and/orinhibit the homologous repair of DSBs. Previous work has found that in humans, GC biased gene conversion occurs in non crossovers, driving genome evolution.Unexpectedly, we found that in both mice and humans, this bias occurs exclusively in non crossovers containing just a single mismatch   with no GC bias whatsoever innon crossovers with multiple mismatches. These results demonstrate that alongside altering where recombination initiates, local genetic diversity also profoundly altersmeiotic repair pathway decisions via at least two distinct mechanisms, impacting genome evolution and Prdm9   related hybrid infertility.

" Meiotic recombination, gene conversion and mutation",E10.2,I. Tiemann Boege,"1, A. Heissl1, A. J. Betancourt2,","B. Arbeithuber3 1Johannes Kepler University, Linz, Austria,2University of Liverpool, Liverpool, United Kingdom,3Penn State Uni  versity, State College, PA, United StatesAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1073During meiosis the maternal and paternal genetic material is exchanged in a highly regulated process known as meiotic recombination. Recombination is initiated by the formation of double strand breaks (DSBs), and in most organisms it is clustered in narrow regions, called recombination hotspots. The repair of DSBs reshapes the nucleotide landscape atrecombination hotspots and a high number of polymorph  isms accumulate at hotspots over time. In humans and mice, these polymorphisms lead to changes in af ﬁnity of PRDM9, a meiosis speci ﬁc, trans acting protein that recognizes DNA target motifs and activates recombination hotspots. We still do not fully understand the exact molecular mechanismdriving the sequence erosion at hotspots, but it has important consequences in the outcome of recombination. We have characterized the processes re shaping thenucleotide sequences at recombination hotspots by screen  ing a large number of single recombination molecules. We particularly focused on de novo mutations and geneconversion events, as well as the effect of poly A repeats of different lengths. The repair of DSBs can lead to a biased nucleotide composition at recombination hotspots by geneconversion, which is the non reciprocal exchange of DNA stretches of one chromosome to the other and is often associated with a higher probability of transmitting oneallele over the other. At recombination hotspots, the transmission of GC over AT variants are favoured resulting over time to a higher GC content at hotspots. Similarly, weobserved that longer poly A repeats are transmitted more often than shorter repeats resulting in an insertion biased gene conversion, albeit this depends on the nature of therepeat heterology. We also found that hotspots are enriched with de novo mutations, especially at CpGs sites that are prone to a high spontaneous deamination rate in the contextof single stranded DNA formed during DSB repair. Meiotic recombination leads to the sequence erosion at hotspots that in turn affects the binding of the recombination machineryand eliminates hotspots over time. In other words, hotspots have a tendency to self destruct through the systematic over transmission of alleles and accumulation of mutations,which poses the question if trans acting factors evolve as a response to these effects.

Furthermore, children who survive cancer often suffer from the long term side effects oftherapy. A crucial step in developing more speci ﬁc and less damaging therapies is to map the complete (epi )genetic repertoire of pediatric malignancies, which is highlyrelevant for the design of future clinical trials and for improving translational impact. Through the advent of genome wide molecular pro ﬁling, speciﬁcally next generation sequencing, it became evident how heterogeneous and distinct childhood cancers are in comparison to the often environmentally associated adultcancers. The recent large scale pan cancer analyses of pediatric malignancies have demonstrated differences in tumor mutational burden and mutational signatures, as wellas unique driving events. The role of pathogenic germline variants predisposing to cancer is particularly important in this patient population, likely being involved in at least 10%of cases of childhood tumors. Central nervous system (CNS) tumors are the most common type of solid tumor in children and the leadingcause of cancer related death in this age group. Many of the discoveries which de ﬁne the landscape of genomic altera  tion across childhood cancers were made in this highlyrelevant entity, since pediatric CNS tumors have been extensively sequenced in large consortia and independent groups alike. Major genetic discoveries range from highlyrecurrent histone H3 mutations, and hijacking of distal enhancer elements, to new oncogenic gene fusions (of the NTRK family of kinases, among others). Further, chromatinmodiﬁers were found to be recurrently altered in childhood brain tumors. This presentation focuses on key ﬁndings that have been transforming the landscape of pediatric cancer research in the past decade and how these results are opening new avenues towards therapeutic approaches.

RaymondUniversity of Cambridge, Cambridge, United KingdomWith growing evidence that rare single gene disorders present in the neonatal period, there is a need for rapid,systematic, and comprehensive genomic diagnoses in ICUs to assist acute and long term clinical decisions. We performed trio whole genome sequence analysis (WGS)on a prospective cohort of families recruited in NICU and PICU at a single site in the UK. We developed a research pipeline in collaboration with the National Health Service(NHS) to deliver validated pertinent pathogenic ﬁndings within 2 –3 weeks of recruitment. The analysis includes single nucleotide variants (SNV), copy number variants(CNV), structural variants (SV), uniparental disomy, mitochondrial genome analysis and speci ﬁc analysis of trinucleotide repeat diseases including myotonic dystrophyand Spinomuscular atrophy (SMA). >330 families had whole genome analysis performed and 20 –25% received a molecular diagnosis for the underlying genetic condition inthe child. The phenotypic description of the child was a poor predictor of the gene identi ﬁed in 90% of cases, arguing for gene agnostic testing in NICU/PICU. Thediagnosis affected clinical management in >65% of cases including modi ﬁcation of treatments and care pathways and/ or informing palliative care decisions. A 2 –3 week turn  around was suf ﬁcient to impact most clinical decision making. The use of WGS in intensively ill children is acceptable and trio analysis facilitates diagnoses. A “gene agnostic ”approach was effective in identifying an under  lying genetic condition, with phenotypes and symptomatol  ogy being primarily used for data interpretation rather thangene selection. Whole Genome Sequence analysis has the potential to be a ﬁrst line diagnostic tool for a subset of intensively ill children. F. Raymond: None. E12 Oligogenic inheritance",2019
 Systematic analysis of genetic interactions: from yeast to human,E12.1,J. Van Leeuwen,"University of Lausanne, Lausanne, SwitzerlandThe functional consequence of a mutation is frequently","dependent on the genetic background in which it occurs, which complicates the identi ﬁcation of complete sets of causal variants associated with phenotypes, including many diseases. These differences can be the result of modifying mutations in other genes, that can either increase theseverity of a disease phenotype, or that can have a protective effect and compensate for the deleterious effects of the disease mutation. Although identi ﬁcation of modi ﬁer loci can highlight potential avenues for therapeutic inter  vention, it requires data from large cohorts of patients carrying the same disease allele. Given the challengesassociated with identifying modi ﬁer mutations in humans, genetic interactions have mainly been studied using model organisms. The budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has often been the model organism of choice for systematic studies of genetic interactions due to its highly annotated genome and tractable genetics. Mapping genetic interac tions in model organisms provides a powerful approach for dissecting gene function and pathway connectivity, and for deﬁning conserved properties of genetic interactions that can elucidate genotype to phenotype relationships. In addi  tion, with the development of CRISPR Cas9 technology, we can now screen for genetic interactions directly incultured human cells. I will discuss how we can use systematic genetic interaction screens in yeast and cultured human cells to de ﬁne conserved properties of genetic interactions, and how we are starting to use these to identify genetic interactions between variants in human genome sequences.

The number of genes linked to human pathologies has grown exponentially these last yearsand the domain of human infertility did not escape this global trend. Our laboratory, in collaboration with severalAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1075fertility clinics located in Europe, Africa and Asia, has gathered a large cohort of infertile males and females presenting with different marked phenotypes, such as acrosome less sperm showing a round shape (globozoos  permia), sperm with ﬂagellum defects (teratozoospermia with Multiple Morphological Anomalies of the Flagella,known as MMAF), absence of sperm in the ejaculate (azoospermia), or oocytes blocked during meiotic matura  tion. Exomic sequencing of these patients enable us toidentify 13 genes related to male infertility and 1 gene to female infertility, so far. In the MMAF cohort, a genetic cause has been identi ﬁed in half of the patients but have shown a high genetic heterogeneity, highlighting the abundance of genes involving in ﬂagellum biogenesis. The function and the localization of the correspondingproteins were studied using the most suitable de ﬁcient animal models, including mouse and Trypanosoma brucei, a protozoan ﬂagellate parasite for genes related to MMAF.

 Population genetic carrier screening programs forreproductive purposes,E13.2,"J. ZlotogoraHadassah medical center, Hebrew University, Jerusalem,",Israel,"The aim of population genetic carrier screening programs for reproductive purposes is to allow couples at risk tochoose between all the available options before a preg  nancy. Population genetic carrier screening programs may be voluntary or required either by law or by the religiousauthorities before marriage being targeted to founder populations or offered to the whole population. The Israeli population genetic carrier screening program for reproduc tive purposes is voluntary, available to all the population and free of charge. The program is used by most of the population at reproductive age and the tests are done eitherbefore marriage, before conception or during pregnancy. The program includes screening for all the severe diseases that are known to be relatively frequent in the populationand in which a test allows the detection of more than 90% of the carriers. Carrier screening for cystic ﬁbrosis, SMA and FraX is recommended to all the population while forother diseases the recommendation is limited to the communities at risk: among Jews according to thecommunity of origin and among Arabs and Druze according to the religion and locality of origin. The extraordinary scienti ﬁc changes that occurred in the last decade revolutionized the offers of private carrier screening programs and pilots for population programs are ongoing in several countries. The best option may be a universalscreening panel with a preference for couple screening giving results only when the couple is at risk for a severe disease in a future child. J. Zlotogora: None.

Methods : We developed a rapid genomic diagnosis program involving 10 Australian hospitals and two labora tories with the aim of providing test results in <5 days for acutely unwell paediatric patients with suspected mono  genic disorders. Rapid exome sequencing (rES) was per formed as trios when possible, and analysis utilised multidisciplinary expertise. Experience was shared between clinical sites, laboratories, and professional groups to enablecollective learning. Results : The program considered 123 patients for rES over 10 months, and approved 114 (93%). Five familiesdeclined testing (4.4%), and nine (7.9%) were withdrawn due to change in clinical circumstances. Of 100 patients tested, 51 received a diagnosis. Eleven of the diagnoses(21%) were made using approaches augmenting standard ES analysis: mitochondrial genome sequencing, ES based copy number analysis, matchmaking of emerging genes,reverse phenotyping and RNA analysis. Median time from hospital admission to consent was 6 days (range 0–64 days); median time from sample receipt to clinical ES report was 3 days (range 2 –7 days). The total cost of testing was AU$1,123,000/ €701,638 (AU$11,230/ €7,016 per case). Changes in management following a result occurredin 77% of diagnosed patients and 10% of undiagnosed patients. Conclusion : We demonstrate the feasibility of a national, highly integrated clinical laboratory approach to rapid genomic diagnosis, which delivers results within a time  frame relevant to acute paediatrics, while optimising clinicalutility and resource allocation.

 Effectiveness of integrated interpretation of exome andcorresponding transcriptome data in detecting splicing variants of recessive disorders,C01.2,M. Yamada,"1, Y. Shiraishi2, H. Suzuki1, K. Kosaki1","1Keio University School of Medicine, Shinjuku, Japan, 2National Cancer Center Research Institute, Tokyo, Japan Background: Incorporation of RNA seq data into exome analyses could help detection of abnormal splicing efﬁciently. Recently, Shiraishi developed a novel algorithm, “SAVNet: Splicing Associated Variants NET ”, allowing the integrated analysis of RNA seq and exome data from cancer tissues. Methods: We applied the SAVNet algorithm to decipher abnormal splicing events and examined the correlation between these events and rare germline variants (MAF <0.03) among 179 phenotypically normal subjects whoseRNA seq data (lymphoblastoid cell lines) and correspond  ing exome data were publicly available. Only the 1913 causative genes of known autosomal recessive disorderswere evaluated under the premise that the subjects could be carriers. Results: Among 1913 genes, 1272 had expression levels that were suf ﬁcient to be analyzed by SAVNet. Forty aberrant splicing events associated rare germline variants were detected in 31 of the 179 subjects; creation of alter native 5 ′splice site (13/40 events), creation of alternative 3 ′ SS (14) and exon skipping (13). The predicted effects on protein were as follows: mutation out of frame (30), and in frame (10). Intriguingly, seven variants annotated as “mis  sense ”(5) or “silent ”(2) per exome analyses had triggered abnormal splicing that disrupted the reading frame. Con ventional exome analysis the 1272 genes detected a total of 144 putatively pathogenic variants including nonsense, frameshift, and canonical splice site (gt/ag) mutations. Discussion: Coupling interpretation of personal genomes with their corresponding transcriptomes successfully uncovered pathogenic splicing variants. Using this method,the detection rate of provisionally truncating pathogenic variants increased by twenty percent (28 / 144) in com  parison with conventional exome analysis. M. Yamada: None. Y.

However, the identi ﬁcation interpretation of SVs often remains difﬁcult, in particular in complex chromosomal rearrange  ments and when SVs do not disrupt protein coding sequence. Here, we address these issues by using chromo some conformation capture (HiC) in patient cell lines in combination with whole genome sequencing. Rearrange  ments of the patient ’s genome with respect to a reference genome emerge as distinct patterns in the HiC contact map. Additionally, HiC informs about the wiring of so called Topologically Associating Domains (TADs), which havebeen shown to largely de ﬁne the genomic range in which genes interact with enhancer elements. HiC was generated from ﬁbroblasts or lymphoblasts from 3 individuals with complex rearrangements at the SOX9 locus and another 5 with interchromosomal translocations. HiC was instructive in revealing the complexity of rearrangements that involvedpreviously unrecognized deletions and insertions. The formation of novel TADs promoting ectopic enhancer  promoter interaction was observed. HiC identi ﬁed complex nested chromosomal translocations and revealed new enhancer promoter interactions upon chromosome fusion. HiC performed in LCLs from one patient with chromo thripsis showed a complex pattern of interchromosomal translocations, which were further validated by orthogonal methods (e.g M FISH). In summary, HiC can help to detectand to resolve SVs. The interpretation of SVs is supported by showing the emergence of new or altered TADs making HiC to a powerful tool to investigate the pathomechanismunderlying developmental disorder.U.S. Melo: None.

Here, we use data from 388,714 UK Biobank participants to assess putatively clinically relevantrare variants in a population based setting. Materials and Methods: Although rare variants are harder to genotype accurately than common variants, wewere able to classify 1,244 of 4,585 putatively clinically  relevant variants genotyped on the UK Biobank SNP array as high quality. We de ﬁned‘clinically relevant ’as variants that were either classi ﬁed as pathogenic/likely pathogenic in ClinVar or are in genes known to cause two speci ﬁc monogenic diseases: maturity onset diabetes of the youngand severe developmental disorders. We also called and visually inspected 96 copy number variants overlapping regions known to cause developmental delay, as well aslarge chromosomal events across the genome. We tested the association of these variants with 401 clinically relevant traits in UK Biobank. Results: We identi ﬁed 27 putatively clinically relevant rare sequence variants and 12 rare copy number variants associated with traits in UK Biobank, exhibitingreduced penetrance or variable expressivity compared with their associated monogenic disease. Within our two diseasesubsets, we found 15 rare CNVs intersecting known disease genes, and were able to re ﬁne the penetrance estimate for a pathogenic HNF4A variant in diabetes (only ~10% by age 40yrs in UK Biobank versus ~75% in a large monogenic diabetes cohort) and refute the pre  vious disease association of RNF135 in developmental disorders.

We report development of an automated variant prioritisation frame  work, whose performance equals state of the art clinicalgenomic diagnosis using human experts. Methods: Genome.One operates a clinically accredited (ISO15189) whole genome diagnostic service in Sydney,Australia. A reference set of ~500 clinical referrals under  went bioinformatics using a precisionFDA Award winning pipeline (Kinghorn Centre for Clinical Genomics). Tertiarybioinformatics used published tools (Seave), with every case analysed by Doctoral genetics professionals. Addi  tionally, a team of genetics experts performed variantreview of selected non trivial cases. We evaluated two automated pipelines: Moon (diploid. com), Eclipse (derived from Seave), and a combination ofthe two. Reference set concordance was required for ACMG Class 4 and 5 variants, and desirable (but notAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1079required) for Class 3 variants. Discordant results were adjudicated by the variant review expert team. Results: Both automated pipelines performed nearly as well as human experts, identifying at least 88 –98% of Class 4/5 and 60 –75% of Class 3 variants. Applying both in combination equalled human experts, with 100% con cordance for all Class 4/5 reportable variants and 75 –81% concordance for Class 3 variants. The new approach resulted in order of magnitude reduction (median reducedfrom 225 to 6 variants) in interpretation time and need for manual curation and review. Conclusion: An automated variant prioritisation protocol has been developed, whose performance equals that of credentialed clinical genetic diagnostic expert professionals.

However, it remains dif ﬁcult to predict if and when aberrant gene activation takes place in the context of BCRs. We have addressed the effect of BCRs on geneexpression in vivo by generating a series of genomic inversions that place an active limb enhancer cluster from theEpha4 regulatory domain at different positions within a neighboring gene dense region. Expression studies in embryonic limb buds show that the inverted enhancer cluster was able to activate several genes downstream of itsnew position, resulting in gene misexpression and limb phenotypes. Capture Hi C from mutant limb buds showed that the activated genes were located within a region with anasymmetric three dimensional pattern, so called architec  tural stripes. Deletion of the CTCF binding site at the anchor of the stripe resulted in its disappearance, dimin ished ectopic gene expression, and a rescue of the skeletal phenotype. Moreover, unlike in the developing limb, inversion derived stripes do not form in mouse embryonicstem cells (mESC) where the enhancers are inactive, indicating that its formation is likely to be dependent on enhancer activity. Based on Hi C from limb buds we showthat architectural stripes are a frequent feature of the chromatin structure in vivo and often associate with developmentally active enhancers. Thus, BCRs can induceectopic gene expression and the formation of asymmetric chromatin contact pattern that are dependent on CTCF anchors and enhancer activity. K. Kraft: None. A. Magg: None. V.

TADs bring distant cis regulatory elements into proximity, a process dependent on the cooperative action of cohesin and the DNA binding factor CTCF. Surprisingly, genome widedepletion of CTCF has little effect on transcription, yet structural variations affecting TADs have been shown to cause gene misexpression and congenital disease. Here, weinvestigate the importance of TADs for gene regulation in vivo in mice by systematically editing CTCF sites, TAD boundary position, and TAD substructure orientation at theSox9 /Kcnj locus. Weﬁnd that TADs are formed by a redundant system of CTCF sites and fusion of two neighboring TADS requiresthe removal of all major sites within the TAD and at the boundary. However, this TAD fusion only results in leakage of regulatory activity from the Sox9 to the Kcnj TAD, but no major changes in gene expression. In contrast, inversions and/or the re positioning of boundaries actively re organize the 3D chromatin structure and thereby re direct regulatoryactivity, resulting in drastic gene misexpression and disease phenotypes. Our results suggest that TAD structures provide robust  ness and precision, but are not essential for developmental gene regulation. In structural variations, ef ﬁcient re wiring of enhancer promoter interaction and aberrant diseasecausing gene activation is not induced by a mere loss of insulation, but requires the re direction of chromatin con  tacts. Thereby, our results provide a basis to predict theregulatory effects of structural variations. A. Despang: None. R. Schöp ﬂin:None. M. Franke: None. S. Ali: None. I. Jerkovic: None. C. Paliou: None.

Although catalogs of regulatory elements are steadily improving, we have a limited understanding of the functional effects ofmutations within them. Here, we performed saturation mutagenesis in conjunction with massively parallel reporter assays (MPRAs) on 20 disease associated gene promoters(e.g. HBG1 ,LDLR ,TERT ) and enhancers (e.g. IRF6 , SORT1 ,TCF7L2 ), generating functional measurements for over 30,000 single nucleotide substitutions (SNVs) anddeletions. Across elements, we ﬁnd that a majority of mutations leads to a reduction in activity (transversions more so thantransitions, deletions more so than SNVs), suggesting that transcription factor (TF) binding is more easily lost than gained. Further, the density of putative TF binding sitesvaries widely between regulatory elements. In the Telo  merase reverse transcriptase ( TERT ) promoter, we identify additional and potentially clinically relevant activatingmutations, as well as regions that could be targeted to reduce promoter activity. By combining MPRA with GABPA knockdown, 63 TERT promoter variants show a signiﬁcant change in promoter activity, highlighting GAB  PA’s role in TERT activation and oncogenesis. Our data provides a rich compendium for studying these 20 disease associated elements and characterizes effect sizes of regulatory mutations at an unprecedented scale. Although myriad annotations and integrative scores areavailable, no score consistently performs well in predicting the measured regulatory effects.

Alteration of chromatin architecture and/ orcis acting elements can lead to cis ruption disorder. Numerous unelucidated nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness 1 ( DFNB1) cases carrying out only one hetero  zygous pathogenic mutation on Gap Junction Beta 2 ( GJB2 ) gene, led to strongly suggest the presence of distant cis  regulation. To analyze chromatin conformation of a large DFNB1 locus, we performed the 5C technology and showed several chromatin contacts with GJB2 promoter. Then, to identify potential regulatory elements of the GJB2 gene, we analysed these chromatin interacting regions with the GJB2 promoter by reporter test activity and identifying cis  regulatory elements which have enhancer action and silencer effect on GJB2 expression. Moreover, to explore DFNB1 locus architecture we analysed CTCF (CCCTC  binding factor) binding along DFNB1 locus by ChIP qPCR and de ﬁned an active domain in which cis acting elements were closer brought to the GJB2 promoter through chromatin looping. This ﬁrst study of DFNB1 three  dimensional chromatin organization allows identi ﬁcation ofGJB2 cis  acting elements. Finally, better understand of the molecular mechanisms of DFNB1 deafness could be important to improve genetic diagnosis of hearing loss, to adapt patients care and to develop small therapeuticmolecules.

 Novel insights into molecular mechanisms in X linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP),C02.5,J. Pozojevic,"1, A. Westenberger2, C. J. Reyes2, K. Grütz2,","H. Kirchner3, C. Klein2, F. J. Kaiser1 1Section for Functional Genetics, Institute of Human Genetics, Lübeck, Germany,2Institute for Neurogenetics, Lübeck, Germany,3Department of Internal Medicine I, Lübeck, Germany X linked dystonia parkinsonism (XDP) is a neurodegenera  tive movement disorder caused by an intronic SINE VNTR  Alu (SVA) retrotransposon insertion in the TAF1 gene. Moreover, the number of hexanucleotide repeats within the SVA varies between patients and was recently found to inversely correlate with age at disease onset. TAF1 expression is decreased in XDP patients, and it was recently shown that by excising the SVA from XDP model cells TAF1 expression levels restore to levels found in wild type cells.To investigate molecular mechanisms by which the SVA affects TAF1 expression, we used chromatin immunopre  cipitation (ChIP) analyzing a set of epigenetic markers within the TAF1 gene region, followed by quantitative PCR (qPCR) in induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC) from XDP patients and sex matched controls. Thereby, we identi ﬁed decreased H3K4me1 signal within a set of de ﬁned enhancer regions in XDP patients compared to controls, indicating reduced activity of these regulatory regions. Moreover,general acetylation levels of histone 3, a marker of active chromatin, was shown to be decreased within exonic TAF1 regions in patient derived cell lines. Additionalenhancer –promoter reporter assays revealed SVA mediated alterations of TAF1 promoter activity, even modulated by the number of hexanucleotide repeats within the SVA. In summary, we used patient derived cellular models and in vitro reporter gene assays to show SVA mediated alterations of epigenetic markers within the coding as wellas regulatory regions of TAF1 . Our results provide new insights into disease relevant mechanisms of SVA mediated alterations in TAF1 expression.

Familial Adult Myoclonic Epilepsy (FAME) is characterised by cortical myoclonic tremor usually beginning in the second decade of life with lateronset of myoclonic and generalised tonic clonic seizures. There have been at least four different FAME loci identi ﬁed through linkage analysis of large autosomal dominantfamilies that are located on chr2, 3, 5 and 8. Expansion of an endogenous ATTTT pentamer coupled with insertion and expansion of a novel ATTTC pentamer within theSAMD12 gene are the cause of chr8 FAME (FAME1). Using both long (Oxford Nanopore and PacBio) and short (Illumina and Complete Genomics) read whole genomesequencing, repeat primed PCR and Southern blotting we show that chr2 FAME is caused by a similar dynamic mutation of the same pentanucleotide repeats that arise intheﬁrst intron of the STARD7 gene. The ATTTC repeat expansion segregates with FAME in over 250 individuals from all 22 families tested so far. RNA Seq from patientderived ﬁbroblast cell lines showed no accumulation of the AUUUU or AUUUC repeat sequences, however a sig  niﬁcant enrichment of differentially expressed genes implicated in lysosomal storage disorders and progressive myoclonic epilepsy suggested that molecular pathways involved in cellular waste collection were active. Our datademonstrate the role of ATTTC repeat expansion in FAME2 and strongly support, regardless of the genomic locus, ATTTC pentamer expansions as a general cause ofFAME, which affect thousands of individuals worldwide.

Most of the mutations in these genes are disruptive, leading to haploinsuf ﬁciency. Thus, any mole  cular manipulation eliciting an increase in CHD2/CHD8proteins, could prove bene ﬁcial for therapeutic develop  ment. Here, we intended to provide a Proof of Principle of how SINEUP   recently described class of non codingRNAs able to augment, in a speci ﬁc and controlled way, the expression of target proteins   can rise the translation of CHD2/CHD8 proteins and possibly rescuehaploinsuf ﬁciency associated phenotypes. Methods: We designed and cloned SINEUP targeting human CHD2/CHD8 isoforms and tested their ef ﬁcacy to increase CHD2/CHD8 protein translation in human iPS  derived neuronal progenitors (iPS NPC) expressing normal and reduced levels of the target proteins and in patients ’ ﬁbroblasts bearing CHD2/CHD8 heterozygous loss of  function mutations. Results: While different CHD2 /CHD8  SINEUP mole  cules were not able to signi ﬁcantly increase protein level in parental iPS NPC, expressing physiologic levels of CHD2/ CHD8, SINEUP revealed to be effective in upregulatingCHD2/CHD8 protein translation when reduced levels of the target proteins were expressed. The ef ﬁcacy of CHD2/ CHD8 SINEUP is currently tested on patient derived cell lines harbouring CHD2/CHD8 truncating mutations. Conclusion: Our data represent an initial Proof of  Concept that SINEUP, RNA based approach could reveal functional to rescue CHD2/CHD8 haploinsuf ﬁciency with1084important implications for therapeutic development in Epi  lepsy and ASD.

Studies, however, have yet to shed light on the signi ﬁcance and pathogenic roles of brain somatic mutations in Alzheimer ’s disease (AD). Here, we performed deep whole exome sequencing (average read depth 584X) in 111 postmortem hippocampal formation andmatched blood tissues from 52 AD patients and 11 non  demented individuals. We found an average of 11.96 and 12.55 somatic single nucleotide variations (SNVs) in braintissue from AD patients and controls, respectively, and 59.31 and 59.17 SNVs from blood. The number of somatic mutations in brain specimens increased signi ﬁcantly with aging, and the rate of mutation accumulation in the brain was 4.8 fold slower than that in blood. The pathogenicsomatic mutations identi ﬁed in 26.9% (14 of 52) of AD individuals were enriched in PI3K AKT, MAPK, and AMPK pathway genes known to contribute to hyperpho  sphorylation of Tau. Further, we discovered that a pathogenic brain somatic mutation in PIN1 was more abundant in AT8 positive neurons in the entorhinal cortexand leads to a loss of function mutation. In vitro mimicking of haploinsuf ﬁciency of PIN1 aberrantly increased the phosphorylation and aggregated form of Tau. Altogether,this study provides new insights into the genetic architecture underlying the pathogenesis of AD, demonstrating that brain somatic mutations associated with aging contribute tothe initial appearance of Tau pathology in the hippocampal formation of the AD brain.

Sphingomyeli  nases generate ceramide from sphingomyelin as a second messenger in intracellular signaling pathways involved incell proliferation, differentiation, or apoptosis. While the role of acid sphingomyelinase is well established, the role of neutral sphingomyelinases in human neurodevelopment hasremained elusive. Methods: Twenty  ﬁve children from ten unrelated families presented with microcephaly with simpli ﬁed gyral pattern, cerebellar hypoplasia, severe developmental ence  phalopathy, congenital arthrogryposis, diabetes mellitus and early demise. All index cases have bi allelic loss offunction variants in the SMPD4 gene, coding for neutral sphingomyelinase 3.We performed additional studies to elucidate the mechanisms contributing to diseasepathogenesis. Results: Fibroblasts from affected individuals showed morphologic endoplasmic reticulum (ER) cisternaeabnormalities, consistent with a previously suggested function of SMPD4 in the ER. Overexpression of human Myc tagged SMPD4 in HEK392T cells showed localization of the protein to both the nuclear envelope and the ER. Previous studies localized SMPD4 to the outer nuclear membrane. Mass spectrometry of SMPD4 associated pro teins detected peptides belonging to nuclear pore complex proteins. We also observed delayed cell cycle progression after downregulation of SMPD4 by siRNA. These data are similar to former studies in HeLa cells showing mitotic abnormalities after si SMPD4 treatment. Conclusion: Our study describes a novel microcephaly syndrome characterized by severe neurologic abnormalities. Our results suggest a major function of neutral sphingomyelinase 3 in regulation of mitosis through mod ulation of nuclear membrane lipids, pointing to a novel mechanism and pathway in the pathogenesis of microcephaly.

 Exploring the impact of CHD2 mutations on DNA double strand break (DSB) repair via non homologousend joining (NHEJ) using Cas9 and Nanopore sequencing in human induced pluripotent stem cells (hIPSC),C03.5,"I. Tully, M. Alsaqati, A. Baldwin, W. Plumbly,",A. Harwood,"Neuroscience and Mental Health Research Institute, Cardiff, United Kingdom Introduction: Heterozygous CHD2 mutations cause early onset epileptic. The mechanism by which this occurs is notunderstood, however previous evidence suggests a role for CHD2 mediated chromatin remodelling during NHEJ. Methods: hIPSCs with doxycycline inducible Cas9 expression were used to create a heterozygous CHD2 mutant with an 11bp frameshift mutation (CHD2 +/ ). To study DSB repair, ﬁve genomic targets were chosen, and three gRNAs lipofected for each, in wild type (WT) and CHD2+/−cell cultures. In order to capture a wide range of indels, a 1kb region was ampli ﬁed around each target using PCR   with a second used to apply DNA barcodes to each sample. Ultra deep whole molecule sequencing was per  formed using the oxford nanopore minion. A comparisonwas made between the indels seen in the CHD2 +/−and WT cell lines. Results: A total of 4x10 6reads were obtained. In all tar  gets, CHD2 mutations resulted in statistically signi ﬁcant increase in the number of larger (40bp 500bp) deletions, related to simultaneous cutting with more than one gRNA.Depending on the target, the increase ranged between 2 fold (p,1.48x10 −22) and 27.1 fold (p ,x10−260). At 3 of 5 targets, there was also a discernible shift in the pattern ofsmaller indels (<50bp length) at each individual cut site.1086Conclusion: The increase in mutations caused by multi  ple cuts suggests that heterozygous mutations alter the dynamics of DNA repair, causing cuts to persist longer. In the developing brain, this could increase the risk of trans  locations occurring, leading to a potential increase in pathological mosaicism in the mature brain. I. Tully: None. M. Alsaqati: None.

How  ever, only about 50% of the cases can be genetically explained. Methods: We identi ﬁed de novo variants in the TAOK1 (thousand and one amino acid kinase 1) gene in NDD patients. To validate this potential novel disease gene we (1)used GeneMatcher to identify additional patients, (2) established a primary ﬁbroblast line of one of the patients and collected RNA from patient ’sﬁbroblasts and blood (PAXTube), and (3) established an RNAi mediated knockdown Drosophila model. Results: We compared the frequency of de novo variants in patient parent trios with (n ,2,030) vs. without (n , 2,755) NDD. We identi ﬁed de novo variants in TAOK1 in four NDD patients but not in non NDD patients. Twoadditional patients were found through GeneMatcher. All variants were absent from gnomAD. The patients shared a common phenotype of developmental delay. Additionally,four patients had muscular hypotonia and three autism. In theﬁbroblast culture, we demonstrated highly reduced TAOK1 mRNA levels compatible with nonsense mediated mRNA decay. No detectable phosphorylated TAOK1 pro  tein was found in these cells. Knockdown of TAO (CG14217) in Drosophila resulted in developmental delay and reduced survival compared to control ﬂies. Immunos  taining of the neuromuscular junctions (NMJs), theirendings (boutons), and the ventral nerve cord (VNC) revealed changed NMJ and VNC morphology and sig  niﬁcantly decreased amount of boutons compared to control ﬂies.

Nelson1","1Duncan Neurological Research Institute, Houston, TX, United States,2Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States,3Emory University School of Medicine, Atlanta, GA, United States Carriers of expanded CGG repeats in the 5 ′UTR of FMR1 are at risk for Fragile X associated Primary Ovarian Insufﬁciency (FXPOI). Two mouse lines expressing either CGG RNA only (RNA only) or CGG RNA and itstranslated polyglycine product FMRpolyG (FMRpolyG +RNA) were used to assess fertility using breeding and superovulation studies in order to model FXPOI. Pheno typic data were collected longitudinally, and ovarian histology was examined. CGG RNA and FMRpolyG +RNA both contribute to ovarian dysfunction, albeit differently. Immunostaining shows FMRpolyG is present in oocytes and granulosa in early postnatal life and gonadotropin stimulation reveals that young RNA onlyand FMRpolyG +RNA mice ovulate fewer oocytes/female. Ovaries during ovulation (8 h post hCG administration) show impaired cumulus expansion in the preovulatoryfollicles of RNA only and FMRpolyG +RNA ovaries. With age, FMRpolyG +RNA mice exhibit declining fertility, but this reduction was not seen in RNA only mice. Cessation ofbreeding in FMRpolyG +RNA females is preceded by signiﬁcant weight gain compared to control mice, andAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1087histology shows a lack of ovulation as well as hyperplastic stroma and disorganized theca in aged ovaries. An increased incidence of cysts present in both groups of CGG  expressing ovaries suggest altered steroidogenesis and is conﬁrmed by qRT PCR from whole ovary tissue collected from aged mice. Globally expressed FMRpolyG +CGG RNA leads to anovulation, altered steroidogenic pro ﬁle, and fertility decline with age, while CGG RNA only mice do not exhibit a decline in fertility or increased weight butdiminished response to superovulation and cumulus expan  sion defects similar to the FMRpolyG +RNA females suggest that CGG RNA alone can affect ovarian function.

AKAP4 has been described to be required for structural and functionalintegrity of the ﬁbrous sheath. We generated Akap4   knockout mice line using CRISPR Cas9 system. Cytomor  phology and motility of sperms and testes were studied,conﬁrming loss of Akap4 led to abnormal sperm morphol  ogy, motility and infertility.

Of interest are a few highly recurrent DNM associated withcongenital disorders and/or rasopathies, that have been described as sel ﬁsh mutations expanding in the male germline. We have adapted an ultra sensitive sequencing(USS) technology based on duplex barcoding to distinguish both DNA strands, thus increasing the sensitivity to one mutation in 10 7sequenced bases. This technology was applied to study the expansion of sel ﬁsh mutations in the FGFR3 gene in the male germline. Materials and Methods: A ~3000bp coding region of theFGFR3 gene including the transmembrane and the tyrosine kinase domains was sequenced with USS in two DNA sperm pools from an old and young donor group. Results: DNM with frequencies of 10−3–10−5were identi ﬁed in 41 exonic positions, several of which have been described in congenital disorders and/or cancer. Theachondroplasia associated mutation c.1138G>A was detected at similar frequencies as the reported occurrence.1088Also, various substitutions are viable and have been reported in population data (gnomAD), albeit at lower fre  quencies. Mutations found in both pools show higher fre  quencies in older donors. Conclusion: Our USS method has proven to be suc  cessful in detecting low frequency DNM. Also, it is animportant strategy to identify driver mutations in the male germline expanding with paternal age with potentially important health consequences.

Although thousands of genes are known to be involved in spermatogenesis, thegenetic causes behind severe spermatogenic failure remain largely unknown. De novo mutations (DNMs), that arise spontaneously in the germline or postzygotically, are knownto play a prominent role in early onset disorders with reduced ﬁtness. Here we report on the ﬁrst exome sequencing study to investigate the role of DNMs in maleinfertility. We examined and sequenced 108 patients suffering from azoospermia or severe oligozoospermia (<5million sperm/ml) and their fertile parents. In total, we identi ﬁed and validated 92 protein altering DNMs, which show an enrichment in protein network edges. Also, we found an enrichment of loss of function (LoF) variants in extremely LoF intolerant genes. Of all DNMs, 22 are likely to disrupt normal gene function and lie in genes involved insperm production such as TOPAZ1 and ODF1 . Comple  mentarily, we detected de novo copy number variants in 2 patients affecting multiple genes involved in cell replicationand gamete production. Currently, we are performing replication studies in additional cohorts to identify recur  rently mutated genes. Additionally, detailed phenotypic re evaluation of patient phenotype, immuno ﬂuorescence stainings of patient material and genetic screens using Drosophila Melanogaster are being performed to more conﬁdently link genes affected by a DNM to male infertility.

The etiology in large proportion of infertile men still remains unknown. Therefore, to identify novel genetic factors we selected CETN1 based on our exome sequencing studies, sequenced it in large cohort of case controls and performed various functional studies. Materials and Methods: We performed exome sequen  cing of 44 idiopathic infertile men. CETN1 was one of the seven potential candidates identi ﬁed ; hence, we further sequenced CETN1 in 1200 infertile men and 900 fertile men. Functional characterization of two variants from CETN1 was performed using various biophysical (CD, 2D  HSQC etc.,), cell biology (using different cell lines andiPSC) approaches and luciferase assays. Quantitative esti  mation of Centrin 1 in oligospermic men with IVF failure history was done by ELISA. Results: Two variants; rs61734344 (p.Met72Thr) and rs367716858 (5 ′UTR) showed signi ﬁcant association with infertility (p values: 8.46e 06 and 0.001, respectively).Biophysical studies showed that mutation p.Met72Thr alters calcium binding af ﬁnity and calcium induced structural changes in Centrin 1. Somatic cells and differentiated iPSCover expressing p.Met72Thr showed higher multipolar cells, fragmented nuclei and cell death. Studies using RPE cell lines showed that p.Met72Thr affects ciliary assemblydynamics and cell proliferation. Whereas, the 5 ′UTR mutation leads to over expression of Centrin 1 due to loss of potential methylation site. Further, the reproductiveoutcome was markedly affected in patients with higher levels of Centrin 1 protein in their sperm centrosomes. This is the ﬁrst study to demonstrate the role of CETN1 in human spermatogenesis and male fertility. D.V.S. Sudhakar: None. S. Jaishankar: None. R. Phanindranath: None. A. Pawar: None. V.

 Duplication and deletion of key SOX9 enhancers cause sex reversal in humans,C04.6,"B. M. Croft, T. Ohnesorg, A. H. Sinclair","Murdoch Children ’s Research Institute, Melbourne,","AustraliaIntroduction: Disorders of sex development (DSDs) are conditions affecting development of the gonads or genitalia. Variants in two key genes, SRY and its target SOX9 , are an established cause of 46,XY DSD, but the genetic basis of many DSDs remains unknown. SRY mediated SOX9 upregulation in the early gonad is crucial for testisdevelopment, yet the regulatory elements underlying this have not been identi ﬁed in humans. Methods: We analysed copy number variations (CNVs) in the upstream regulatory region of SOX9 in DNA from patients with DSD, allowing us to de ﬁne several minimal critical regions for sex reversal. Results: We rede ﬁned the upstream regulatory landscape of human SOX9. Using new patient data, we re ﬁned the 32.5 kb XYSR and 24 kb RevSex intervals and analysedthese genomic regions using bioinformatic and luciferase tiling approaches, to identify three putative enhancers 5 ′of SOX9. In cell based reporter assays these enhancersresponded to different combinations of testis speci ﬁc reg  ulators including SRY, SF1 and SOX9 itself. When com  bined, all three enhancers show synergistic activity,signiﬁcantly increasing their individual enhancer activity. In vivo , deletion of these three enhancers in mice resulted in different outcomes ranging from: no apparent effect toreduced Sox9 transcription and complete sex reversal. Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst study to identify SOX9 enhancers that, when duplicated or deleted, result in 46,XXor 46,XY sex reversal, respectively. These enhancers pro  vide a hitherto missing link by which SRY activates SOX9 initiation, upregulation and maintenance in humans, andestablish SOX9 enhancer mutations as a signi ﬁcant cause of DSD.

 Human and mouse gene essentiality screens allow to identify candidate genes for developmental disorders,C05.1,V. Munoz Fuentes,"1, P. Cacheiro2, T. H. Meehan1,","D. Smedley2 1EMBL EBI, Cambridge, United Kingdom,2Queen Mary University of London, London, United Kingdom The identi ﬁcation of the causal variants of rare genetic diseases from voluminous patient sequencing data is anongoing challenge. Here we combine cellular essentiality screen data with in vivo organismal gene essentiality from1090the International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium to aid in the prioritization of candidate disease genes. We categor  ized genes within a spectrum of phenotypic effects, and identi ﬁed a Developmental Lethal (DL) category, which we deﬁne as genes not essential for cell survival but required for organismal development. With mouse viability dataavailable for ~4,900 genes, 764 genes fall into the DL category. We found that this category presents a signi ﬁcant overrepresentation of Mendelian disease genes (OMIM andOrphanet associations, 2.5 fold increase odds), and an even higher enrichment (3.2 fold increase) for human genes associated with developmental disorders (from the Deci phering Developmental Disorders Study, DDD). We further investigated DL genes that were: (i) not described as associated with human disease by OMIM, Orphanet orDDD; and (ii) highly intolerant to LoF mutations, comprising 164 genes. Of these, 24 genes overlap with those containing heterozygous functional de novo variantsin undiagnosed cases from the DDD study (DDD Research Variants). Further investigation of this set of genes is ongoing by comparing the clinical features of develop mental disorders with homozygous and heterozygous knockout mouse models, to identify potential disease variants in cases with undiagnosed developmentaldisorders.

We have previously reported that knock inmice ( Braf Q241R /+) expressing the CFC syndrome associated mutation, Braf Q241R, showed growth retardation because of gastrointestinal dysfunction. However, other factorsassociated with growth retardation, including chondrogen  esis and endocrinological pro ﬁle, have not been examined.Here, we show that 3  and 4 week old Braf Q241R /+mice have decreased body weight and length, as well as reduced growth plate width in the proximal tibiae. Furthermore, proliferative and hypertrophic chondrocyte zones of the growth plate were reduced in BrafQ241R /+mice compared with control mice. Immunohistological analysis revealedthat ERK activation was enhanced in hypertrophic chon  drocytes in Braf Q241R /+mice. In accordance with growth retardation and reduced growth plate width, decreasedserum levels of insulin like growth factor 1 (IGF 1) and IGF binding protein 3 (IGFBP 3) were observed in Braf Q241R /+ mice at 3 and 4 weeks of age. In contrast, serum growth hormone levels were comparable in control and BrafQ241R /+ mice. Treatment with C type natriuretic peptide (CNP), a stimulator of endochondral bone growth and a potentinhibitor of the FGFR3 RAF1 MEK/ERK signaling, increased body and tail lengths in control and Braf Q241R /+ mice. In conclusion, ERK activation in chondrocytes and low serum IGF 1/IGFBP 3 levels could be associated with the growth retardation observed in BrafQ241R /+mice.

CS patients present with hypertrichosis and facial anomalies alongside a varying range of cardiovascularabnormalities. To generate a critical mass patients to ﬁnd further clinical characteristics of the disease as well as to ensure a rapid progression towards future interventionalstudies we developed a standardized registry. Clinical data is obtained during annual Cantú research clinics. CS is debilitating with no targeted therapy available. Clinicalmanagement currently involves symptomatic treatments to address second order complications such as heart failure. The off patent KATP inhibitor glibenclamide which isalready widely applied in clinic to block GOF KATP channels involved in Type 2 diabetes holds promise as a potential treatment for CS. In order to perform therapeuticdrug screening, we have developed novel CS animal models in which disease causing mutations were knocked in to the endogenous ABCC9 loci in zebra ﬁsh and mice using CRISPR/Cas9 genome engineering. Both models recapitu  late key cardiovascular features of CS which signi ﬁcantly reverse after glibenclamide administration. Hypercontracti lity and abnormally high output were reversed in zebra ﬁsh larvae whilst cardiac hypertrophy in mice was similarly attenuated. No sustained hypoglycemia was observed afterchronic exposure to glibenclamide in mice. These results provide key pre clinical evidence for the in vivo ef ﬁcacy of glibenclamide for the treatment of CS. Hence, we intend toperform a clinical trial to test glibenclamide in CS patients.

Loss of function KMT2D variants cause Kabuki syndrome (KS), characterised by intellectual disability, typical facial dysmorphism andmultiple malformations of heart, kidneys and palate. Results: Through targeted whole exome and genome sequencing we ascertained 10 individuals with de novo orinherited missense KMT2D variants restricted to highly conserved residues within a central region predicted to form a coiled coil dimer. All individuals presented with clinicalfeatures, strikingly distinct from KS, consisting of (a) varying combinations of branchial cysts, external ear mal  formations, ear pits, semi circular canal anomalies, hearingloss, microphthalmia, lacrimal duct problems, choanal atresia, absent/hypoplastic nipples and hypothyroidism; (b) absence of typical facial features of KS; and (c) normaldevelopment in most individuals. KMT2D expression levels inﬁbroblast cells from two affected individuals were not1092altered compared to controls. However, mutant ﬁbroblast had slightly decreased proliferation and migration compared to controls. The DNA methylation pattern in peripheral blood samples derived from affected individuals showed a speciﬁc signature distinct from that of KS. Circular dichroism performed on the puri ﬁed KMT2D coiled coil domain showed that alpha helical secondary structure in the wild type protein was perturbed by the missense variants. Conclusion: We show that a restricted spectrum of pathogenic KMT2D missense variants results in a novel malformation disorder distinct from KS. This adds to the growing list of allelic disorders caused by mutations inchromatin remodelling genes and provides insights into function of previously unstudied region of this important protein. S.

We identi ﬁed a cluster of de novo truncating mutations in MN1 in a cohort of 21 individuals with strikingly similar dysmorphic facial features, especially midface hypoplasia, and intellectual disability with severe expressive language delay. MN1 is comprised of two exons. All mutations, including the recurrent variant p.Arg1295* observed in 8/19 probands, fall in the terminal exon or the extreme 3 ′region of exon 1, and are therefore predicted to result in escapefrom nonsense mediated mRNA decay. This was con ﬁrmed inﬁbroblasts from three individuals. The C terminal 20 amino acids of MN1, which are lacking in all patients, arevery highly conserved amongst vertebrate species, suggest  ing an important role for the C terminal tail in MN1 function. Previous studies have described large deletions ofa region encompassing MN1 and other genes in individuals with variable neurodevelopmental anomalies and non  speciﬁc facial features (dissimilar to the facial gestalt of the patients reported here). We propose that the condition described here for the ﬁrst time, MEningioma 1 C terminal Truncation (MECT) syndrome, is not due to MN1 haploinsuf ﬁciency but rather is the result of dominantly acting C terminally truncated MN1 protein. In summary, our data show that MN1 plays a critical role in human craniofacial and brain development. C.T. Gordon: None. C. Mak: None. D. Doherty: None. A. Lin: None. N. Vegas: None. M. Cho: None. G.

Molecular etiologies are stillpoorly elucidated. Together with new insights on the role for lysosomal signaling in embryonic stem cell differentia  tion, mutations in the X linked transcription factor TFE3 have recently been reported in ﬁve patients with PM. Functional analysis suggested these mutations to result in ectopic nuclear gain of function Tfe3 alleles. Material and Methods: Subsequent datasharing allowed the clustering of de novo TFE3 variants identi ﬁed by exome sequencing or TFE3 targeted sequencing on DNA extracted from leucocytes in patients referred for syndromic intel  lectual disability with or without PM. Results: We describe the clinical and molecular data of theﬁve previously published patients and six additional individuals harboring a de novo missense TFE3 mutation. The seven females and four males presented with pigmen tation anomalies on Blaschko ’s lines, severe intellectual disability, epilepsy, metabolic anomalies (hepatomegaly, obesity, hypoglycemia), growth retardation and recogniz able facial dysmorphism with progressive coarsening. The mutation was at a mosaic state in two male patients. Two of the eight identi ﬁed mutations were localized in exon 3, six in exon 4; three were recurrent mutations. Conclusion: This series of 11 individuals further delineates the speci ﬁc storage disorder like phenotype with pigmentary mosaicism ascribed to de novo TFE3 missense mutation in exons 3 and 4. It con ﬁrms the identi ﬁcation of a novel X linked condition associated with mosaicism anddysregulation within the mTOR pathway, as well as a link between lysosomal signaling and human development.

Here, we describe DTYMK deﬁciency as the cause of a novel vanishing brain disease in two unrelated patients. DTYMK encodes TMPK (thymidylate monophosphate kinase), a key enzyme in dTTP biosynthesis. The clinicalphenotype is characterized by microcephaly, no growth in length and severe developmental delay. MRI revealed extreme loss of white matter in the cerebral cortex andabsence of basal ganglia. Two compound heterozygous variants in DTYMK were detected in the ﬁrst patient whereas a second patient carried a (third) homozygousvariant in DTYMK . TMPK activity was undetectable in patient ﬁbroblasts and a proliferation defect that was absent in control cells was observed. Homozygous dtymk mutant zebra ﬁsh show microcephaly, developmental delay and massive brain edema. TMPK activity in mutant zebra ﬁsh conﬁrmed that the allele represents a loss of function. Furthermore, a striking reduction of cell proliferation was detected in the brain of mutant zebra ﬁsh larvae, as well as an impairment of the DNA damage repair mechanism.These similarities between the human and zebra ﬁsh phenotype strongly suggest a causal link between TMPK deﬁciency and neurodegeneration. Current research is focused on the identi ﬁcation of the compensatory mechan  ism and the pathogenic mechanism underlying the vanish  ing white matter but reduced proliferation and a de ﬁcient DNA repair mechanism are suspected to play major roles. In summary, by combining genetic and biochemicalapproaches in a cellular and a zebra ﬁsh model we identi ﬁed loss of function in DTYMK as the cause of a novel vanishing brain disease. J.M.

Materials and Methods: linkage analysis, whole exome sequencing, lipidomics analysis. Results: We describe an autosomal recessive neurologi  cal disorder affecting consanguineous kindred. All fouraffected individuals, born at term following normal preg  nancies, had mild to severe intellectual disability, spastic quadriplegia, scoliosis and epilepsy in most, with no dys morphic features. Brain MRI demonstrated leukodystrophy with abnormal hyperintense signal in the periventricular perioccipital region and thinning of corpus callosum.Notably, affected individuals were asymptomatic at early infancy and developed normally until the age of 8–18 months, when deterioration ensued. Homozygosity mapping identi ﬁed a single 8.7 Mb disease associated locus on chromosome 1q41 –1q42.13 between rs1511695 and rs537250 (two point LOD score 2.1). Whole exomesequencing identi ﬁed within this locus a single disease  associated homozygous mutation in DEGS1 , encoding C4  dihydroceramide desaturase, an enzyme of the ceramidesynthesis pathway. The missense mutation, segregating within the family as expected for recessive heredity, affects an evolutionary conserved amino acid of both isoforms ofDEGS1 and was not found in a homozygous state in ExAC and gnomAD databases or in 300 ethnically matchedAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1095individuals. Analysis of whole blood of affected individuals demonstrated augmented levels of dihydroceramides, dihydrosphingosine, dihydrosphingosine 1 phosphate and dihydrosphingomyelins with reduced levels of ceramide, sphingosine, sphingosine 1 phosphate and mono  hexosylceramides, as expected in malfunction of C4 dihydroceramide desaturase. Conclusion: We demonstrate that a mutation in DEGS1 causes a sphingolipidosis presenting at age 8 –18 months with severe leukodystrophy, implying future treatment modalities for this severe neurologic disease.

Lille, Lille, France Introduction: Congenital Disorders of Glycosylation (CDG) are a group of rare, genetic diseases. Here, weidenti ﬁed a novel CDG caused by hemizygous mutations in the X linked MAGT1 . Patient 1 and 2, both boys, present with intellectual and developmental disability. Furthermore,a third MAGT1 de ﬁcient patient (P3) with an immunode  ﬁciency characterised by Epstein Barr virus (EBV) infec  tions was identi ﬁed. MAGT1 is a subunit of the oligosaccharyltransferase (OST) complex, with an impor  tant role in N glycosylation. However, mutations in MAGT1 have been described to cause an immunode ﬁciency (XMEN), characterised by EBV infections. These studies claim that MAGT1 is a Mg 2+transporter. Methods: Protein expression levels of OST subunits were evaluated in patient and CRISPR K.O. cell lines. Radi  olabelling of glycoproteins was performed to detect N  glycosylation defects. Results: Protein levels of MAGT1 were unaffected for P1 (missense mutation) and absent for P2 and P3 (nonsensemutations). Expression of TUSC3, the homologue protein of MAGT1, was increased in all patient derived ﬁbroblasts. By radiolabelling we observed that the patient ﬁbroblasts have a mild glycosylation defect. This is in line with reports showing that enhanced expression of TUSC3 mitigates the MAGT1 defect. Interestingly, glycoproteins were stronglyhypoglycosylated in P3 lymphocytes, as they don ’t express TUSC3. Lastly, complementation experiments with mutated MAGT1 did not rescue the defective glycosylation inMAGT1  / TUSC3 / HEK293 cells, indicating that all three mutations are pathogenic. Conclusion: We showed that glycosylation is impaired in all patients. Hence, we delineate MAGT1 CDG as a novel glycosylation disorder associated with two different clinical phenotypes.

It is caused by mutations in ﬁve genes: LDLR , APOB ,PCSK9 ,APOE, LDLRAP1 . Other FH causing genes remain to be characterized. The aim of this study conducted in a large French family and in unrelated French hypercholesterolemic probands is to identify newFH causing genes which can explain the mutation negative cases.1096Materials: The studied FH family (20 members including 6 affected over 3 generations) and probands were recruited through the French FH Research Network and mutations in LDLR ,APOB ,PCSK9, APOE were excluded. A whole exome sequencing (WES) was realized in 3 affected members of the family and Sanger sequencing in the 84probands. Analysis of variant effects was assessed in silico. Then we investigated the activity of the candidate gene and its variants in vitro. Wildtype and mutant plasmids wereconstructed and transfected into HEK293T cells. We determined protein expression and LDL uptake by FACS analysis. Results: WES identi ﬁed a heterozygous variant segre  gating in the family in LRP6 (p.(Val1382Phe)). Four other rare and disease causing variants in this gene were found in4 unrelated probands (p.(Tyr972Cys), p.(Thr1479Ile), p. (Tyr1584Asn), p.(Ser1612Phe)). Functional studies showed that two variants decrease signi ﬁcantly the expression of LRP6 at the cell surface and increase slightly but not sig  niﬁcantly LDL uptake. However, the expression of LDL receptor was not affected by any variant. Conclusion: This study brings new data concerning the role of LRP6 in LDL uptake. However, several points remain to be elucidated. Y. Ghaleb: None. S. ElBitar: None. A. Loste: None. P. El khoury: None. Y. Abou khalil: None. G. Nicolas: None. M. Le Borgne: None. P. Moulin: None. M.

Reymond1 1Center for Integrative Genomics, Lausanne, Switzerland, 2Cardiovascular Assessment Facility, University of Lau  sanne, Lausanne, Switzerland,3Metabolic Diseases Branch/NIDDK, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD, United States,4Experimental Cardiology Unit, Department of Cardiovascular Medicine, University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland Inactivating mutations in the guanine nucleotide binding protein subunit  β 5 (GNB5 ) gene cause IDDCA syndrome, an autosomal recessive neurodevelopmental disorder asso ciated with cognitive disability and cardiac arrhythmia. Knock out of Gnb5 in mice results in structural andfunctional abnormalities of the brain. However, little is known about the role of Gnb5 in heart sinus conduction. Notably, all IDDCA individuals present heart bradycardia. Here we show that Gnb5  inhibitory signaling is essential for parasympathetic control of heart rate. We monitored i) heart electrophysiology in homozygous (KO, n ,8), heterozy  gous (HET, n ,8) and wild type (WT, n ,7) mice using in vivo ECG telemetry, and ii) cardiac function by echocardiography. KO mice were smaller than WT andHET mice, and had a smaller heart, but exhibited better cardiac function, as judged by increased fractional short  ening and ejection fraction. Whereas baseline ECG was notdifferent between groups, KO mice treated with carbachol (CCh), a parasympathomimetic, presented signi ﬁcant CCh  induced bradycardia. In contrast, the anti parasympatheticdrug atropine had the same effect in KO, HET and WT mice. KO and WT showed similar responses to atenolol and isoprotenerol, respectively, agonist and antagonist of theβ adrenergic activity, suggesting that sympathetic modula  tion of the cardiac stimulation is not altered. Altogether, our data demonstrate that loss of negative regulation on theinhibitory G protein signaling causes heart rate perturba  tions in Gnb5  KO mice. This effect is mainly driven by impaired parasympathetic activity. We anticipate thatunravelling the mechanistic of Gnb5  signaling in the autonomic control of the heart will pave the way for future drug screening. P. De Nittis: None. A. Sarre: None. J.

PE is the most abundant membrane lipid that is enriched in the CNS. Results: We identi ﬁedﬁve individuals from four families with biallelic PCYT2 variants via exome sequencing. One patient had compound heterozygous missense variantswhile all others possessed an identical homozygous last  exon nonsense variant. All patients had mild to severe global developmental delay, progressive spastic tetraparesis,seizures, regression and cerebral and cerebellar atrophy. Nystagmus and poor visual acuity were reported in four individuals. In patient ﬁbroblasts, mRNA levels were nor  mal whilst ET protein levels and enzyme activity were signiﬁcantly decreased (but not absent). In silico analysis of missense variants showed that the substitutions probablyaffected binding, catalysis and protein stability. Hypo  morphic G0 PCYT2 zebra ﬁsh generated using the CRISPR  Cas9 system had abnormal tail  ﬁn morphology, whereas zebra ﬁsh with complete knockout of the gene were incompatible with life. Lipidomic analysis of patient ﬁbro  blasts demonstrated profound abnormalities in neutraletherlipid and etherphospholipids and revealed that in ET de ﬁciency, the phosphatidyl serine decarboxylase route is used to synthesize plasmalogens. Patient plasmalipidomics showed signi ﬁcant accumulation of phosphati  dylcholine[O]. Conclusion: Hypomorphic biallelic PCYT2 variants cause a novel syndromic progressive neurological disorder and the complete loss of ET function is likely incompatible with life. Lipidomic abnormalities in patient tissues couldbe used as a biomarker facilitating diagnosis and inter  pretation of variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance. Finally, this study highlights the importance of etherlipid homeostasis inthe development and function of the CNS. J.H. McDermott: None. F. Vaz: None. M. Alders: None. S.B. Wortmann: None. S.

C07 Gene editing and reproductionC07.1 Experts ’opinions on genome editing in humans: a collective construction of a disruptive technology V. Romano, H. C. Howard Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden Germ line genome editing (GLGE) is a highly controversial matter, tending to divide the expert community revolving around it. To date, very few studies have explored in depth the views of expert stakeholders. To help ﬁll this gap, we interviewed 20 expert stakeholders in genome editing (academic laboratory and clinical researchers, bioethicists, lawyers, patient advocates) from Europe, North America,China and Japan. In our semi guided interviews, we posed, among others, questions addressing legitimacy, roles and responsibilities, engagement of the public about differentuses, and future scenarios in so doing constructing a collective idea of what GLGE is and could be. About legitimate uses, we found that many stakeholders areskeptical about the need to use GLGE because of ethical implications, environmental risks and the existence of more safer alternatives. Roles and responsibilities are called to behorizontal and diffused as much as possible to everybody (through adequate representation). The participation of the wider public is considered essential for transgenerationalethical dilemmas. Future scenarios are depicted as negative for, above all, women and women ’s bodies, the meaning and actual impact of parenting, and the creation of widerinequalities between social classes. In general, we under  stood that certain views are common among experts, such as the extreme caution which should guide the path from thelab to clinical trials. However, there are also many differences in perceived priorities, based on the anticipation of different cost bene ﬁt balances and on the diverse predictions of GLGE ’s development and its potential impact on human kind.

In the future, non invasive prenatal diagnosis (NIPD), germline gene modi ﬁcation (GGM) and somatic gene modi ﬁcation (SGM) might become available. This study explores if, and how, availability of possible future reproductive options would in ﬂuence couples ’ decision making. Interviews (n ,25) were conducted with couples with a known increased risk of having a child with a geneticcondition who received genetic counselling at one Dutch Clinical Genetics Centre between 2013 –2018. For couples, factors currently in ﬂuencing decision  making for or against PND or PGD (e.g. attitude towards pregnancy termination, the impact of procedure) also played a role when discussing the new reproductive technologies.Couples were generally positive about NIPD as this would be more safe and enables earlier testing compared to PND. However, some who were against pregnancy terminationwould still prefer PGD. The perceived burden of PGD, embryo disposal, and increasing opportunities of having a ‘healthy ’embryo were considerations in favour of GGM. However, some considered GGM as unsafe, feared misuse and ‘slippery slope ’scenarios. SGM was generally not considered an option to anticipate on, since the affectedchild would still be born and subjected to treatment. Genetically at risk couples have mixed feelings: NIPD and GGM were more positively evaluated than SGM. Theresults suggest that shifts in use towards new technologies can be expected. Users ’perspectives should be addressed for responsible implementation. Grant: Amsterdam Repro duction and Development Research Institute I. van Dijke: None. P. Lakeman: None. I.B.

ESHG recommended that basic and pre clinical germline research could be justi ﬁed while acknowledging that therapeutic or preventive GLGE is notwarranted at this time and merits more debate. Internationally, policymakers, scientists and media have called for a global conversation including the voices of thepublic and relevant stakeholders. Our study contributes to this need by investigating the GLGE views of the sickle cell disease (SCD) community and genetic professionals. Methods: In 2017, we utilized a mixed methods approach, involving an original educational video on CRISPR genome editing, surveys, and 15 focus groups ofUnited States based SCD community members: six patient, six parent, and three physician groups. The ﬁndings were compared to an international survey of genetic professionalsconducted from 2016 –2017. Results: Compared to genetics professionals, where 48.2% found GLGE to be morally acceptable, fewer in theSCD community supported GLGE (24.0%, p < 0.0001). The SCD disease community saw the promise of GLGE as a potential cure for the disease; however, many expressedconcerns about misuse of the technology. Conclusion: As discourse surrounding GLGE advances, it is crucial that we engage disease communities whose livescould be altered by these interventions in the policy con  versations with researchers, bioethicists, and policymakers.

Since April 2017, all pregnant women can choose between NIPT, First trimester Combined Testing(FCT) (both ~ €175) and no test, within the TRIDENT 2 study. Due to the favorable characteristics of NIPT there has been a strong demand for implementation. However,concerns have been raised regarding the impact on informed decision making. This study evaluates women ’s perspec  tives on the offer of NIPT. A nationwide questionnaire was completed by n ,752 pregnant women, after receiving counseling for prenatal screening by a certi ﬁed counselor but before testing, assessing: test preferences, attitudes, perceived pressure to test, knowledge and deliberation. Of the respondents, 79% expressed a preference for NIPT, 2% for FCT, 17% no test and 2% were unsure. Main reason for preferring NIPT was: ‘high accuracy compared to FCT’(29%). Primary reason to refrain from testing was: ‘every child is welcome ’(27%). Few women (<5%) experienced societal or provider pressure (not) to test. Half (53%) thought that children with Down syndrome were lessaccepted in society. Nearly all women (97%) reported that they made a well informed decision. Most women (94%) had adequate prenatal screening knowledge ( ≥4/7 correct questions). Additional measures of informed choice will be presented. Theﬁndings indicate that pregnant women experience little pressure to test, have adequate knowledge and a high level of perceived informed decision making with NIPT offered within a governmentally supported screeningprogram.

NIPT using whole genome sequencing allows for an expansion ofthe scope of FTS and the introduction of NIPT gives rise to ethical and societal concerns about deliberated decision  making, pressure to engage in screening and possible lackof equal access due to the ﬁnancial contribution ( €175) to NIPT. We explored the opinions and experiences of pregnant women, who were offered FTS, about theseconcerns and about the possibility of a broadened scope. Nineteen pregnant women representing a diversity of backgrounds were interviewed using a semi structuredinterview guide. Eight women (42.1%) did not opt for prenatal screening and eleven (57.9%) did (NIPT ,4, combined test ,7). Women experienced a free choice to accept or decline prenatal screening, despite sometimes receiving advice from others. Prior to pre test counselling, some women had already deliberated about what anabnormal test result would mean to them. Others accepted or declined FTS without deliberation. The current Dutch policy of requiring a co payment was acceptable to some,who believed it functioned as a threshold to think carefully about FTS. Others were concerned that a ﬁnancial threshold would lead to unequal access to screening. Finally, pregnantwomen found it dif ﬁcult to formulate opinions on the scope of FTS, because of lacking knowledge. Life expectancy, severity and treatability were considered important criteriafor the inclusion of a condition in NIPT. I.M. Bakkeren: None. A. Kater Kuipers: None. E.M. Bunnik: None. A.T.J.I.

" The notion of “serious ”for genetic disease: To qualify or not, that is the question",C07.6,E. Kleiderman,"1, V. Ravitsky2, B. Knoppers1","1Centre of Genomics and Policy, McGill University, Montreal, QC, Canada,2Université de Montréal, Montreal, QC, Canada Current advances and innovation in assisted reproductive technologies aim to promote the health and well being of future children. They offer the possibility to select embryoswith the greatest potential of being born healthy (e.g. preimplantation genetic testing) and may someday correct1100faulty genes responsible for heritable diseases in the embryo (e.g. human germline genome modi ﬁcation   HGGM). Most laws and policy statements surrounding HGGM refer to the notion of “serious ”as a core parameter in determining what genetic conditions should be targeted by these technologies. The literature suggests that it is unrealistic to expect todeﬁne the concept universally, but that when employed it must be quali ﬁed and consider patient and physician perspectives. Yet, this notion remains unde ﬁned, rendering its application vague and decision making subjective and arbitrary. We begin by presenting two general conceptions of‘disease ’and ‘health ’: the objectivist (i.e. based on biological facts) and constructivist (i.e. based on human values) frameworks. We then consider the rationale for a rights based approach (e.g. right to science and right to thehighest attainable health). The basic challenge is sorting out whether and to what extent social conditions have a role in helping to de ﬁne what quali ﬁes as a “serious ”disease   and whether the classi ﬁcation of “serious ”isﬂexible, depending on shifting social conditions and landscapes. Ultimately, decisions about what constitutes a “serious ”condition would be contextualized to the individual but should also give appropriate weight and consideration to the broader implications for the notion of ‘health ’and ‘disease ’in society.

" Increased risk at ﬁrst trimester screening: trisomies are not everything, but the risk for an atypical chromosome aberration is low. Experiences from the Swedish Pregnancy Register",C08.1,E. Iwarsson,"1, P. Conner2","1Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery, Clinical Genetics Unit, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska Uni  versity Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden,2Center for Fetal Medicine, Karolinska Institutet and Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden Introduction: This study aimed to investigate the detection rates of all types of chromosome aberrations if either NIPT or karyotype/array CGH was used for further investigationin pregnancies with an increased risk ( ≥1:200) following combined ﬁrst trimester screening (cFTS). Materials and Methods: Retrospective review of 129 493 pregnancies examined during 2010 –2017 in Stockholmcounty, including children born with a postnatally detected chromosome aberration. Results: There were 872 (0.7%) chromosome aberrations in the cohort. Common trisomies (21,18 and 13) or sex chromosome aberrations (SCA) constituted 86% of these and 14% were atypical chromosome aberrations (AChrA).If an invasive test were offered to the 5779 (4.5%) women with an increased risk for a trisomy, 84% of all clinically signiﬁcant chromosome aberrations and 55% of all AChrAs would be detected. In total 93% of the chromosome aber  rations were detectable with NIPT (trisomies/SCAs). Investigating the 2323 (1.8%) women with the highest risk(≥1:50) after cFTS, 27% had a chromosome aberration, 2.0% had an AChrA requiring an invasive test for diagnosis. Conclusion: If only analysis for common trisomies and SCA is offered after cFTS, the residual risk for an AChrA in women with a risk ≥1:200 is 1.0% (55/5779). Taking into account the cases resulting in a miscarriage/IUFD and thosedetected due to malformation on ultrasound, the residual risk for a postnatal diagnosis of an AChrA is 0.7% (41/ 5779). That might be seen as a low residual risk, butlooking from another angle 74% (41/55) of the AChrAs will remain undetected using such an approach. E. Iwarsson: None. P. Conner: None.",2019

However, this population wide average does not re ﬂect a family ’s individual risk: while most couples have a negligible risk, for a minority, the DNM is present in multiple parental gonadal cells (mosaicism) and the risk of a future offspring being affected is up to 50%. The PREGCARE ( Precision Genetic Counselling and Reproduction) study aims to develop a systematic strategy to identify high risk mosaic cases and provide families witha personalised assessment of transmission risk. Individual risk strati ﬁcation is achieved through analysis of 14 tissue samples of various embryonic origin from the family trio(including a father ’s semen sample) using ultra deep Illu  mina sequencing (~30,000x) and DNM haplotype phasing via Nanopore long read sequencing, to determine the par ental origin. We present data from the 20 ﬁrst families to illustrate the power of this approach. While we detected instances ofmosaicism, such as a maternally originating KIF11 muta  tion (VAF ,0.1–0.5%), for most families, the DNM was undetectable by deep sequencing of parental samples(including sperm). Next, long read haplotyping permitted to single out DNMs of paternal origin, con ﬁrming that these families have an extremely low risk ( ≤0.1%) of having another affected child. Given our current understanding of mosaicism, this strategy should reassure up to ~75% of couples that theirrecurrence risk is negligible. The ability to provide perso  nalised transmission risk prior to conception is likely to impact upon clinical practice and family planning decisions. U.B. Abdullah: None. M. Bernkopf: None. N.

Yicong,"1,2, S. Zhang1, L. Yang1, D. Chen1, Y. Gao1,","Y. Zhang1, F. Chen1 1BGI Shenzhen, Shenzhen, China,2School of Bioscience and Bioengineering, South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China Introduction: Next generation sequencing (NGS) ‐based cell‐free DNA (cfDNA) analysis has been widely adopted for non ‐invasive prenatal screening (NIPS) for fetal chromosome aneuploidy and monogenic diseases through different experiment strategies. We developed a newsequencing method embracing both advantages of targeted and genome ‐wide sequencing, so that it can simultaneously screen for fetal chromosomal aneuploidy and monogenic diseases in a noninvasive manner. Methods: The novel method, called TAGs ‐seq, integrates a multiplex PCR step into the genome ‐wide NIPS library construction to simultaneously amplify whole genome and target region in one tube. After NGS, the genome ‐wide region displays a low sequencing depth (0.1 ‐0.5Χ) and the target regions an ultra ‐high depth (>1000 Χ), which were sufﬁcient for detecting chromosome aneuploidy and singe base mutations, respectively. Results: We validated in ‐blind in 517 plasma samples with previously con ﬁrmed outcomes of fetal. The TAGs ‐seq NIPS identi ﬁed 23 cases of common aneuploidy, 9 cases of fetal de novo mutations, 27 cases of maternal monogenic diseases carrier and 458 cases of normal controls. Fetal results were concordant to the invasive diagnostic results,while maternal carrier results were concordant to sanger sequencing results. Conclusion: We developed a novel TAGs ‐seq NIPS, which exploited whole ‐genome sequencing data and tar  geted sequencing data, providing a convenient, low ‐cost, and expandable solution to detect fetal chromosome aneu ploidy and de novo mutations, as well as maternal carrier of monogenic diseases in a single experiment.

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) has the potential to transform diagnostic testing by capturing all classes variation with a single technology. Here, wecompared diagnostic yields from WGS to those from karyotype, CMA, and whole exome sequencing (WES) in a pediatric cohort of 2,100 quartet families with a probanddiagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD; n ,8,400) and a prenatal cohort of 218 cases with a structural defect detected on ultrasound. We ﬁrst benchmarked our bioinfor  matic pipelines on 519 ASD quartets, discovering 3.4M SNVs, 0.3M indels, and 5,863 structural variants (SVs) per genome. WGS recapitulated 99.6% of all CMA predictedCNVs and >97% of all de novo coding variants from WES. Molecular validation of 171 de novo SVs revealed a 97% conﬁrmation rate. The yield from WGS exceeded all other technologies, but provided only ~0.3% increased diagnostic yield over the combination of all conventional methods. We next evaluated WGS in the fetal structural anomaly samplesand discovered a diagnostic variant in 9.8% of cases that had negative karyotype and CMA results. This study suggests a modest overall increased diagnostic yield ofWGS compared to the combination of all conventional methods, and should temper enthusiasm regarding sub  stantial increases in interpretable pathogenic variants fromWGS. Nonetheless, WGS was superior to any individual method thus warranting evaluation as a ﬁrst tier screen in prenatal and pediatric diagnostic testing. C. Lowther: None. H. Brand: None. B.B.

However, robustNIPD of autosomal recessive conditions has proven more challenging as this requires detection of fetal inheritance of a maternal allele from a mixed maternal fetal pool of cellfree DNA. The autosomal recessive disorder sickle cell disease is the most common referral indication for molecular genetic invasive prenatal diagnosis in the UK,however, NIPD is not yet available. Methods: We use targeted next generation sequencing of cell free DNA from maternal plasma to diagnose fetal sicklecell disease based on a relative mutation dosage approach. No paternal or proband samples are required. Unique molecular identi ﬁers (UMIs) were incorporated into library preparation to enable accurate quanti ﬁcation of mutant and wildtype allele reads. Results: 24 plasma samples from pregnant sickle cell disease carriers were analysed, of which 20 were con  cordant with the established genotype; two with low fetal fraction were inconclusive and two were discordant. Insilico size selection of cfDNA fragments was found to enhance the fetal fraction for all samples, and modi ﬁcations to UMI capture improved diagnostic accuracy. Samplesfrom as early as eight weeks gestation were successfully genotyped. Conclusion: We demonstrate that NIPD for sickle cell disease is approaching clinical utility. Other autosomal recessive disorders may bene ﬁt from a similar approach. This work was funded by the Guy ’s and St. Thomas ’ Hospital Charity. J.C. van Campen: None. L. Silcock: A.

Follow up analysis was performed in 62 cases. True fetal mosaicism (TFM) was con ﬁrmed in 7/38, 18.4%, when mosaicism involved whole chromosome aneuploidy and in 6/24 cases, 25.0%, when involving a CNV ( p,0.59). Mean birth weight z score was higher in cases of con ﬁned placental mosaicism for a CNV (0.21) than cases involving whole chromosomes ( −0.74) ( p,0.02). Conclusion : Prevalence of mosaicism in CVS is sig  niﬁcantly higher after CMA on uncultured cells than after conventional karyotyping. The risk of TFM is equally high in cases of mosaicism for CNVs and whole chromosomes. I. Lund: None. N. Becher: None. E. Vestergaard: None. R. Christensen: None. O. Petersen: None. E.

 Germline genetic variation drives the somatic landscapeof tumors,C09.1,N. Zaitlen,"1, S. Mangul1, A. Gusev211041UCLA, LA, CA, United States,2DFCI, Boston, MA, United","States Hundreds of thousands of cancer patients have had their tumors sequenced to identify clinically actionable muta  tions. This activity has produced valuable research dataleading to signi ﬁcant discoveries in basic and translational domains. Unfortunately, the targeted nature of tumor sequencing precludes powerful interrogation of germline somatic interactions. To address this shortcoming we developed a computational approach to infer genome wide germline variation, including HLA, TCR/BCR, and micro bial sequences, from off target sequencing reads. We applied our method to the DFCI PROFILE cohort (n>20,000), producing the world ’s largest germline  somatic data set by over an order of magnitude. Levering this resource, we test for associations between germline and somatic variation. Speci ﬁcally, for the mutational burden in each PROFILE target gene as well for total mutational burden (TMB), we conduct association, heritability, popu  lation prevalence, and polygenic risk score association tests.Our completed analysis of the lung adenocarcinoma (LUAD) sub cohort has already produced strongly sig  niﬁcant associations between germline and somatic events. We identify over forty signi ﬁcant germline associations (p  value < 5e 8) to mutations in oncogenes including BRCA1, ALK, DNMT3A, EPHA3/5, GLI2, as well total mutationalburden. We estimate heritability over 60% for multiple genes including BRCA1, EPHA3/5. We show that asian genetic ancestry is associated with EGFR and KRASmutations. Finally, we show that polygenic risk for lung cancer subtypes is associated to mutations in speci ﬁc genes and total mutational burden. These results demonstrate thatgermline variation is a major contributor to the dynamics of somatic mutations and cancer outcomes. N. Zaitlen: None. S. Mangul: None. A. Gusev: None.",2019

The aim of this study was to establish the frequency of germline TP53 alterations in ACC from a large series of 147 Frenchpatients (98 children, 49 adults). Sanger sequencing and QMPSF screening for genomic rearrangements revealed a deleterious germline TP53 alteration in 53 cases (36%), among which only 32 (60%) had a familial history suggestive of LFS. Re analysis of 55 negative cases, using NGS performed at high depth, subsequently identi ﬁed 2 additional cases of mosaic mutations. The mutation detection rate was 49% in children and 14% in adults, and reached 72% in female patients presenting with an ACCbefore 2 years of age. Among 16 ACC patients treated for a secondary tumour, 12 carried a germline TP53 alteration. p. (Arg158His) and p.(Arg337His) mutations were recurrentand the majority of the alterations were missense mutations without dominant negative effect. This contrasts with the general distribution of germline TP53 alterations character  ized by the predominance of dominant negative missense mutations with higher penetrance and con ﬁrms that most of the germline TP53 alterations detected in ACC patients are associated with a lower penetrance. This study shows that germline TP53 alterations are the main cause of ACC, in particular in childhood, which is probably explained by acritical role of p53 in the development of the adrenal cortex. These data justify ensuring an exhaustive analysis of TP53 in all ACC cases, independently of the familial history. M. Renaux Petel: None. F. Charbonnier: None. I. Tournier: None. G. Lienard: None.

In a cohort of 39patients, next generation sequencing of 52 cancer driver genes on cell free DNA was able to pick up clones responsible for disease progression in 60% of cases. Eachtumor had a mean of 1,3 mutated genes with 1 –3 range. Disease progression was associated with an increased levels of cfDNA. Point mutations in TP53, PIK3CA, and CNV inFGFR3 were among the most responsible, with a rate of 41, 16, and 13%, respectively. Increased CNV of FGF receptors were identi ﬁed in addition to non small cell adenocarcinoma of lung also in pancreatic, gastric and cholangiocarcinoma. Other clones had mutation in ESR1 (breast), CTNNB1 (uterus), KRAS and CCND2 (pancreas), EGFR and BRAF(lung). Retinoblastoma cases not responsible to repeated cycles of intraocular Melphalan showed expanding mutated clones in PTEN or SMAD4. These results show thatirrespective to tumor mutational burden at origin and subsequent complex clonal evolution, a simpli ﬁed muta  tional load is present at disease progression. One or few“sniper ”clones drive progression and the molecular pro ﬁle has a weak correlation with the primary tumor. Single driver mutations in TP53 remain the main target of a not yetdeveloped speci ﬁc therapy in most tumors such as breast, ovarian, uterine, lung, gastric cancers and glioblastoma. Among the actionable mutations, PIK3CA were found notonly in breast cancers but also in uterine carcinoma, Sezary syndrome and glioblastoma, pinpointing the needs of speciﬁc trials in these tumors.

Many of these alterations are strongly associated with speci ﬁc gene expression and DNA methylation patterns that can be used for ALL subtype classi ﬁcation. Amongst the Nordic BCP  ALL cases diagnosed between 1996 and 2012, subtype  deﬁning aberrations were not detected at diagnosis in approximately 25% of cases, representing a large group ofuncharacterized cases collectively referred to as B other. Materials and Methods: We designed and applied DNA methylation classi ﬁers as a tool for subtype discovery in 1142 Nordic ALL patients including 284 patients with B  other phenotype. Classi ﬁers were designed for 10 recurrent ALL subtypes including the recently described DUX4   and ZNF384  rearranged BCP ALL subtypes. The classi ﬁcation results were validated by RNA sequencing for fusion gene detection and copy number analysis. Results: DNA methylation classi ﬁcation successfully assigned an unambiguous new subtype to >50% of the 284 patients in the B other group. With RNA sequencing, weveriﬁed the DNA methylation result by identifying fusion genes involving DUX4 ,ZNF384, or MEF2D genes, fusions common in the BCR ABL1  like and ETV6  RUNX1  like groups, and fusion genes/mutations affecting PAX5 . Fur  thermore, we show the clinical relevance of these new groups in Nordic ALL patients by differing event free andoverall survival rates. Conclusion: DNA methylation classi ﬁcation is a power  ful tool for subtype discovery that in combination withRNA sequencing and copy number analysis enables improved delineation of the genetic alterations of previously uncharacterized BCP ALL patients.

It is suggested that additional genetic factors, such as BC associated SNPs identi ﬁed by GWAS, modify individual BC risks. For BRCA1/2 mutation carriers, the combined effects of BC  associated SNPs (polygenic risk score, PRS) have been shown to be informative for individual risk strati ﬁcation. The question arises whether PRS based risk strati ﬁcation is applicable for CHEK2 mutation carriers. We analyzed 685 female CHEK2 germline mutation carriers (464 c.1100delC and 143 carriers of other protein truncating variants, 78 individuals with pathogenic missense variants). A total of573 mutation carriers were affected by BC (474 unilateral BC, 99 bilateral BC), with a mean age at ﬁrst/secondary diagnosis of 45.7 (23 –84)/49.2 (31 –79) years, respectively. 112 mutation carriers were not affected by BC (mean age at last follow up: 53.1 years). Study design: A cohort approach including retrospective and prospective eventswas applied. Recruitment was through genetic counselling centers including index patients and relatives. Genotyping of 77 BC associated SNPs (Mavaddat et al., 2015) wasperformed by Fluidigm ®Access Array and NGS. PRS  calculation was performed according to Kuchenbaecker et al., 2017. Kaplan Meier analysis revealed that mutationcarriers within the highest PRS decile reported a signi ﬁ  cantly earlier age at ﬁrst onset compared with patients within the lowest decile (P ,5e 06). Patients within the highest decile show a mean age at ﬁrst diagnosis of 43.6 (23–69) years vs. 48.7 (27 –65) years in the lowest decile (p,0.007). Thus, combined genotyping of BC associated SNPs may improve personal risk prediction for CHEK2 mutation carriers. J. Borde: None. C. Ernst: None. K. Weber Lassalle: None. D. Niederacher: None. J.

New technologies arenecessary in order to overcome these challenges. This study tested the robustness and feasibility of such technology, called IBM Watson for Genomics (WFG), which usesnatural language processing to obtain evidence based targeted therapy and clinical trial options in an automated manner. Material and Methods: 39 different types of cancer in different stages (colon, lung, gastric, myeloid leukemia, angiosarcoma, bone, thyroid and renal sarcoma)were sequenced using different options of NGS panels (Trusight 170, LMA NEOPLASMepro ﬁle, Oncomine  fusion assay and Archer FusionPlex) on the HiSeq/MiSeq and S5 XL platforms of IonTorrent. The resulting data was interpreted by WFG. Results: WFG detected actionable alterations in 28 tumors. In 17%of cases WFGagreed with the treatment applied by the oncologists or detected resistance to drugs in patients who did not respond to treatment. 64% of patients whose ﬁrst line treatment failed, WFG detected alternative therapies and classi ﬁed patients as candidates for clinical trials and/or for those pending approval. In oncohaematologicaltumors, it was possible to evaluate the genomic pro ﬁle throughout the disease (diagnosis, relapse and recurrence) as well as its clonal evolution. This approach allowed theselection of drugs that led to the maximum bene ﬁcial effect. Conclusion: Genetic characterization of tumors through NGS, complemented by evidence based therapeutic intervention options, provides accurate molecular diagnosis, tumor sub classi ﬁcation and treatment options. Additionally, this strategy offers new information to eval  uate patients. I. Sánchez Guiu: None. D. Cantalapiedra: None. V. Felipe Ponce: None. S. Santillán: None. J. García: None. S. Lois: None. J.

We performed a genome wide association study of 14,756 rHTN cases using 24,006 controlled hypertensivesas controls (cHTN), both de ﬁned based on drug prescription and blood pressure data from Iceland, the UK Biobank and eMERGE. We found four genome wide signi ﬁcant rHTN loci, all known blood pressure loci, and identi ﬁed eight more rHTN loci using reported blood pressure associations as a prior. Several of the strongest hypertension variants donot show association with rHTN while others increase the risk of rHTN more than that of hypertension. Parent of  origin analysis shows increased risk of rHTN associatedwith transmission by the father for three variants (rs880315 near CASZ1 , rs569550 near LSP1 and rs1006096 near1108RXFP2 ). Nine of the twelve rHTN variants associate with blood potassium levels, with the risk allele associating with lower potassium levels, and the potassium effect of blood pressure variants predicts their association with rHTN beyond their blood pressure effect. Furthermore, a genetic risk score of the rHTN variants associates with hyper aldosteronism. We also observed that, before therapy, individuals with rHTN have lower potassium levels than both normotensives and those with controlled hypertension.The most signi ﬁcant rHTN variant is in KCNK3 ,a potassium channel gene that has been associated with pulmonary arterial hypertension in men and hyperaldoster onism in mice. In conclusion, we show genetic differences between hypertension and rHTN and a prominent role of mechanisms affecting potassium homeostasis for develop ment of rHTN, implicating mineralocorticoid related path  ways, aldosterone in particular.

Loeys1 1Center for Medical Genetics, Edegem, Belgium, 2McKusick Nathans Institute of Genetic Medicine, Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, Baltimore, MD,United States Bicuspid aortic valve (BAV) is the most common congenital heart defect (CHD), affecting 1 –2% of the population. Although the associated development of thoracic aortic aneurysms (TAAs) was historically attrib uted to altered blood ﬂow, high heritability (89%) suggests a strong genetic contribution. Incomplete penetrance and variable clinical expression hampered gene identi ﬁcation. The only established BAV/TAA gene is NOTCH1 , accoun  table for less than 1%. Combined approach of copy number variation (CNV) analysis, resequencing of candidate genes and exome sequencing of families identi ﬁed three novel candidate genes which were further validated in a large BAV/TAA cohort (n ,637). CNV analysis revealed a 89kb duplication upstream of the T box transcription factor TBX20 . Fine mapping of the duplication con ﬁrmed involvement of a TAD boundary and two of nine region overlapping Decipher patients, carrying a bigger deletion, presented with syndromic CHD. Afterresequencing, variant burden analysis strengthened the genetic evidence for TBX20 involvement in BAV/TAA (1.1%;p ,0.03). Targeted resequencing of 22 candidate genes unveiled SMAD6 as the most common BAV/TAA gene (2.5%;p , 0.002). Investigation of an additional cohort of 473 TAA patients, demonstrated that although only 14% also pre  sented BAV, all novel likely pathogenic SMAD6 variants (n,7) were identi ﬁed in BAV/TAA individuals, further consolidating the role of SMAD6 variants to the BAV/TAA  aetiology. Finally, exome sequencing discovered a ROBO4 splice  site mutation segregating in a BAV/TAA family. Rese  quencing revealed enrichment for rare ROBO4 variants (1.8%;p ,0.04). ROBO4 silencing or mutant ROBO4 expression in endothelial cells results in impaired barrier function and a synthetic repertoire suggestive of endothelial to mesenchymal transition; concordant ﬁndings are observed in patient aortic walls and Robo4  deﬁcient animal models.Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1109I.

The pathogenesis of theplaque is a dynamic process and its cellular composition is a major determinant factor in disease development. In this study, we propose a single cell RNA seq approach tocharacterize the immune cell type composition of the plaque at different disease stages from CD45 +sorted immune cells from carotid tissue. We aim to reveal the degree ofheterogeneity and variability of cell composition in plaques among individuals, its in ﬂuence in plaque development, and transcriptional differences between individuals with plaqueﬁssuring (symptomatic) vs. asymptomatic individuals. We have sequenced 16225 single cells from 3 symptomatic and 7 asymptomatic patients (median 1152 genes; 360k readsper cell). The top highly expressed genes including MALAT1, CD74, B2M andTMSB4X were associated with atherosclerotic lesions, in ﬂammation and adverse cardio  vascular outcome. We identi ﬁed 15 clusters of co expressed genes differentiating between immune cell subtypes at the plaque level composition with a major proportion of T cellsand macrophages, suggesting that the plaque exhibits the characteristics of a classically chronic in ﬂamed site. We identi ﬁed 4976 differentially expressed genes among clusters suggesting the presence of a high degree of cell heterogeneity in the plaque. Moreover, Gene Ontology revealed enrichment of pathways involved in pathogenesisof inﬂammatory diseases, apoptosis, immune response, such as NF kB and TNF.

 Metabolomic pro ﬁling of ANGPTL3 de ﬁciency,C10.4,"E. Tikkanen, P. Würtz","Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland","Introduction: Loss of function variants in the angiopoietin like 3 gene ( ANGPTL3 ) have been associated with low levels of plasma lipoproteins and decreased coronary artery disease risk. We aimed to determinedetailed metabolic effects of genetically induced ANGPTL3 deﬁciency in fasting and postprandial state. Materials and Methods: We studied individuals carry  ing S17X loss of function mutation in ANGPTL3 (6 homo  zygous and 32 heterozygous carriers) and 38 noncarriers. Nuclear magnetic resonance metabolomics was used toquantify 225 circulating metabolic measures. We compared metabolic differences between loss of function carriers and noncarriers in fasting state and after a high fat meal. Results: In fasting, ANGPTL3 de ﬁciency was char  acterized by similar extent of reductions in low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.74 SD units lower concentrationper loss of function allele [95%CI 0.42 –1.06]) as observed for many triglyceride rich lipoprotein measures, including very low density lipoprotein cholesterol (0.75 [0.45 –1.05]). Within most lipoprotein subclasses, absolute levels of cholesterol were decreased more than triglycerides, result ing in the relative proportion of cholesterol being reducedwithin triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, beta hydroxybutyrate was elevated (0.55 [0.21 –0.89]). Homozygous ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers showed essentially no postprandial increase in triglyceride rich lipoproteins and fatty acids, without evi  dence for adverse compensatory metabolic effects. Conclusion: In addition to overall triglyceride and low  density lipoprotein cholesterol lowering effects, ANGPTL3 deﬁciency results in reduction of cholesterol proportion within triglyceride rich lipoproteins and their remnants. Further, ANGPTL3 loss of function carriers had elevated ketone body production, suggesting enhanced hepatic fattyacid beta oxidation. The detailed metabolic pro ﬁle in human knockouts of ANGPTL3 reinforces inactivation of ANGPTL3 as a promising therapeutic target for decreasingcardiovascular risk. E. Tikkanen: A.

Although these discoveries rely on genetic variation present across individuals, association studies have overwhelminglybeen performed in populations of European descent. In light of differential genetic architecture between populations, biased representation in research can exacer bate existing disease and health care disparities. Critical variants may be missed if they are at a low frequency or completely absent in European populations, especially astheﬁeld shifts its attention towards rare variants, which are more likely to be population speci ﬁc. More concerning, the effect sizes and their derived risk prediction scores derivedin one population will not accurately extrapolate to other populations. Herein, we describe our recent work of the Population Architecture using Genomics and Epidemiology (PAGE) study, where we have conducted a GWAS of 26 cardio  metabolic phenotypes in 49,839 non European individuals.We identify 27 novel loci and 38 secondary signals at known cardiometabolic loci, as well as replicate 1,444 GWAS catalog associations across these traits. Our datashows strong evidence of effect size heterogeneity across ancestries for published GWAS associations, substantialbeneﬁts for ﬁne mapping using diverse cohorts, and insights into clinical implications. We fear that the lack of repre  sentation of diverse populations in genetic research will result in inequitable access to precision medicine for those with the highest burden of disease. Thus, we strongly advocate for continued, large genome wide efforts indiverse populations to maximize genetic discovery and reduce health disparities. G.L. Wojcik: None. M. Graff: None. K.

Methods: We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of 141 lipid species in 2,181 individuals, followed by phenome wide scans (PheWAS) with 23 CVDend points in >500,000 individuals from the Finnish and UK Biobanks. We also determined (1) how heritable are lipid species and do they share genetic components and (2)could we gain mechanistic insights into lipid metabolism. Results: SNP based heritabilities for lipid species ranged from 10 –54%. Long polyunsaturated lipids showed highest heritability and genetic sharing, suggesting considerable genetic regulation at fatty acids levels. The observed low genetic sharing between traditional lipids and lipid speciessuggested that routine lipid screens may fail to capture potential disease risk factors. GWAS identi ﬁed 35 lipid  species associated loci (P < 5x10 −8), with 15 new lipid loci and 37 new SNP lipid species pair associations e.g. asso  ciation between ABCG5/8 and CE(20:2;0). We show that LPL (lipoprotein lipase) may have more ef ﬁcient hydrolysis of medium length TAGs (triacylglycerides) than other TAGs. The association patterns of SYNGR1, MIR100HG , andPTPRN2 suggested their probable roles in desaturation and/or elongation of fatty acids. PheWAS revealed that 7 of 35 lipid species associated loci also associate with CVD related outcomes, including ABCG5/8 ,APOA1 ,BLK, FADS2 ,LPL, and two new loci  COL5A1 and GALNT16 (false discovery rate <0.05). Conclusion: We demonstrate that lipidomics enable deeper insights to the genetic regulation of lipid metabolismthan clinically used lipid measures, which in turn might help guide future disease biomarker discovery.

Materials and Methods: Here we propose a maximum likelihood method to estimate the contribution of GxE tocomplex traits taking into account all interacting environ  mental variables at the same time, without the need to measure any. This is possible because GxE induces ﬂuc  tuations in the conditional trait variability, the extent of which depends on the strength of GxE. The approach can be1112applied to continuous outcomes and for single SNPs or genetic risk scores (GRS). Results: Extensive simulations covering a wide range of scenarios demonstrated that our method yields unbiased interaction estimates. We also offer a strategy to distinguish speciﬁc GxE from general heteroscedasticity (scale effects). Applying our method to 32 obesity related traits in the UK Biobank reveals that for body mass index (BMI) the GRSxE explains an additional 1.9% variance on top of the 5.2%GRS contribution. However, this interaction is not speci ﬁc to the BMI GRS and holds for any variable equally corre  lated with BMI. On the contrary, the GRSxE interactioneffect for leg impedance (0.07) is signi ﬁcantly (P < 10 −56) larger than it would be expected for a similarly correlated variable ( −0.16). Conclusion: We showed that our method could robustly detect the global contribution of GxE to complex traits, which turned out to be substantial for some obesitymeasures. J. Sulc: None. N.

 Leveraging correlated risks to increase power in Genome Wide Association Studies,C11.2,N. Mounier,"1,2, P. R. H. J. Timmers3, J. F. Wilson3,4,","P. K. Joshi3, Z.

Improved discovery, by further increasing study sizes is not the only strategy. Leveraging published studies of related traits can improveinference. To this end, we developed a Bayesian GWAS approach that builds informative priors from GWASs of related risk factors. Mendelian Randomisation is used toderive multivariate causal effects of a set of iteratively selected risk factors on the target outcome. These causal effects of the risk factors on the outcome are then combinedwith the SNP ’s effect on the identi ﬁed risk factors to build a Bayesian prior for the SNP ’s effects on the outcome. We found a set of universally optimal parameters (instrumentstrength, clumping stringency and shrinkage intensity) that maximizes the out of sample squared correlation betweenprior and observed effects (up to ~40%). We use Bayes Factors (BFs) to quantify the evidence in favour of the prior and derived an analytical formula for the null BFs distribution, which led to a 6 fold reduced runtime and a more accurate estimation of P values, compared to permutation based approaches. We are able to gaugegenetic risk score (GRS) performance using only summary statistics from training and test samples. Its application revealed that GRSs based on posterior effects outperformstandard GRS. Applying this technique to human lifespan, we identi ﬁed 7 new loci ( P< 5e 8), which were missed by standard GWAS.

Adams1 1Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2University of Greifswald, Greifswald, Germany,3Radboudumc, Nijme  gen, Netherlands,4University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, United States Objective: The human brain has an intricate structure that is partly determined by genetics. While neuroimaging can discern millions of morphometric features, genome wideassociation studies have been limited to only a number of aggregate measures due to technical reasons. Methods: We studied 18.000 individuals from 12 cohorts within the CHARGE consortium and UK Biobank partici  pants. The structure of the cortical and subcortical grey matter was characterized using voxel based morphometry, atechnique that generates a volume for each of the 1.5 mil  lion voxels. Subsequently, genome wide association studies were performed for all these voxels using a newly devel oped software algorithm. The genome wide brain wide signiﬁcance threshold was determined at p ,5×1 0 −13. Results: The association analyses between 9 million genetic variants and 1.5 million brain voxels took 17 h to compute, which would require over 2 years using conven  tional software. We found 1.270.907 genome wide brain wide signi ﬁcant associations between genetic variants and grey matter voxels, distributed between 55 brain regions with minimum p value ,2×1 0 −87. These associations came from 930 variants that mapped to 29 independent loci.Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1113We found 62.920 unique voxels signi ﬁcantly associated at least with one variant. Conclusion: The genome wide interrogation of high  resolution neuroimaging data is a powerful approach to identify genetic determinants of brain structure, even at sample sizes considerably smaller than studies of aggregatemeasures. This successful ﬁrst attempt at high throughput GWAS could be extended to various ﬁne grained (endo) phenotypes, which might prove useful for understanding thegenetic architecture of other complex traits.

 Genome wide copy number variant association study reveals several novel disease associated loci,C11.4,M. Lepamets,"1,2, K. Lepik3,1, Z. Kutalik4, R. Mägi1","1Estonian Genome Center, Institute of Genomics, Univer  sity of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,2Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,3Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia, 4Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine, Lausanne University Hospital, Lausanne, Switzerland Genome wide association study (GWAS) is a successful tool for identifying common single nucleotide polymorph isms (SNPs) contributing to complex human traits and diseases. However, relatively little of heritability of those traits has been explained by SNPs due to their small effectsizes. Therefore, it is necessary to analyze other types of genetic variations including DNA copy number variations (CNVs). Even though large (>100kbp) rare CNVs are studied for a wide range of complex traits and diseases, detecting shorter CNVs from SNP genotyping array data remains challengingdue to large number of false positives. To address this issue, we have developed a statistical model to predict the quality of possible CNV regions detected by PennCNV software.Our model outperforms the best currently published CNV quality score. Using our CNV quality measure, we conducted genome  wide CNV analysis on ten complex diseases (incl. type 2 diabetes, in ﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD) and rheumatoid arthritis (RA), etc.) in up to 398,662 unrelated white Britishindividuals from UK Biobank cohort. In total, we found 18 genome wide signi ﬁcant (P < 1.7*10e 6) CNV disease associations, out of which 15 are novel. Noteworthyexamples are association between RA and a 6p21.3 deletion (P,8.5*10e 7) overlapping a known strong GWAS signal(P,10e 250) and a 10p11.21 deletion associated with IBD (P,9.1*10e 7) that overlaps the tight junction related gene PARD3, which has been associated with IBD in candidate gene studies. Genome wide CNV association studies help us to better understand/ ﬁne map the underlying genetic mechanisms for complex diseases. Our analyses are a ﬁrst step in compiling a large CNV trait database.

Methods: We combined genome wide SNP and geo  graphic origin data (N ,1422) to explore the interplay between genetics and geography in the Netherlands. Using ChromoPainter/ ﬁneSTRUCTURE we partitioned our data based on patterns of haplotype sharing to identify ﬁne scale population structure. We analysed patterns of identity by  descent (IBD) sharing for segments of different lengths toestimate the time depth of the structure. We investigated whether the structure re ﬂects barriers to gene ﬂow using the Estimated Effective Migration Surfaces (EEMS) method.We also analysed spatial clines in haplotype sharing from neighbouring countries using a European reference (N , 4514). Finally, we estimated recent changes in effectivepopulation size using the IBDNe method. Results: We identi ﬁed 16 genetic clusters which correlate closely with regional geography. At its ﬁnest level, clus  tering distinguishes subtly different eastern and western genetic groups in the North Brabant province, while deeper clustering delineates a north south split bisecting thecountry. We estimate that this north south genetic structure is at least 2700 years old, while east west structure is more recent. EEMs revealed a strong migrational cold spotsplitting the country north to south, overlapping the Rhine. Overlaying this deep structure we observe strong opposing northeast southwest spatial clines in German and Belgianhaplotype sharing.

 The landscape of pervasive horizontal pleiotropy in human genetic variation is driven by extremepolygenicity of human traits and diseases,C11.6,"M. Verbanck, D. M. Jordan, R. DoThe Charles Bronfman Institute for Personalized Medicine,","Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, New York, NY,United States","Understanding the nature of horizontal pleiotropy, where one genetic variant has independent effects on multiple observable traits, is vitally important for our understanding of the genetic architecture of human phenotypes. Manyrecent studies have pointed to the existence of horizontal pleiotropy, but its extent remains unknown, largely due to difﬁculty in disentangling the inherently correlated nature of observable traits. We have developed a statistical frame  work to quantify horizontal pleiotropy in human genetic variation, using a two component score computed fromsummary statistics. This score uses a whitening procedure to remove correlations between observable traits and normalize effect sizes across all traits. When applied tosimulated association summary statistics, our score success  fully detects horizontal pleiotropy under a range of different models. When applied to 372 heritable phenotypes from theUK Biobank, our pleiotropy score detects a signi ﬁcant excess of horizontal pleiotropy which is pervasive through  out the human genome and especially prominent amonghighly polygenic phenotypes. We identify 24,968 variants in 7,831 loci with extreme horizontal pleiotropy, a majority of which have never been reported in any published GWAS.Examining functional annotations, the pleiotropy score is signiﬁcantly higher in active regions and lower in inactive regions. In addition, the pleiotropy score correlates withtranscriptional measures of pleiotropy, it is signi ﬁcantly higher for variants which are eQTLs i) for many genes across many tissues; ii) for genes whose orthologs areassociated with multiple phenotypes in mice or yeast. Our results highlight the central role horizontal pleiotropy plays in the genetic architecture of human phenotypes. M. Verbanck: None. D.M. Jordan: None. R. Do: B.

Here we describe the neurodevelopmental phenotype that resultsfrom disruption of KMT2E in 38 affected individuals from 36 families. From the Genome Aggregation Database (gnomAD), KMT2E is a candidate haploinsuf ﬁcient gene with a LOEUF score of 0.06. This case series includes 28 protein truncating variants (PTVs), four missense variants, and four large deletions encompassing KMT2E , most of which were con ﬁrmed to be de novo. Most affected individuals with protein truncating variants presented with mild intellectual disability, autism and/or epilepsy. Epilepsymore common in females and autism more common in males; many had relative macrocephaly and hypotonia. There appears to be a subtle facial gestalt characterized bydolichocephaly, deep set eyes with down slanting palpebral ﬁssures, and infraorbital creases. Individuals with micro  deletions encompassing KMT2E showed a greater degree of developmental delay. Individuals with missense variants in KMT2E presented with the most severe developmental delays and treatment resistant infantile epileptic encephalo pathy; microcephaly was common in this group. Haploin  sufﬁciency versus gain of function or dominant negative effects speci ﬁc to these missense variants in KMT2E may explain this divergence in phenotype but requires indepen  dent validation.

Variable other fea  tures included microcephaly (38%), short stature (21%), and cardiac defects (29%). RNA Seq in ﬁve individuals identi  ﬁed 3,828 deregulated genes enriched for known NDD genes and biological processes such as transcriptional reg  ulation. Ctcf knockdown and overexpression in Drosophila showed unaltered morphology of neuromuscular synapses and multiple dendrite neurons but resulted in impaired gross neurological functioning in the climbing assay and learningand memory de ﬁcits in the courtship conditioning paradigm. Conclusion: We broaden the mutational and clinical spectrum of CTCF associated NDDs and gain insights into the functional role of CTCF by identifying deregulated genes and showing that Ctcf dosage alterations result in nervous system defects in Drosophila , modeling important aspects of the human condition.

Here, wereport the identi ﬁcation and phenotypic characterization of nineteen individuals with heterozygous disruptions ofPOU3F3 , most of which are de novo variants. All individuals had developmental delays and/or intellectual disability. Impairments in speech and language skills were common, along with characteristic prominent and cupped ears. POU3F3 is an intronless gene, insensitive to nonsense mediated decay, and thirteen individuals carriedvariants that were predicted to yield a truncated protein. All truncating variants that we tested in cellular models led to aberrant subcellular localization of the encoded protein.Luciferase assays demonstrated negative effects of these alleles on transcriptional activation of a reporter with a FOXP2  derived binding motif, also bound by POU3F2. In addition to the loss of function variants, ﬁve individuals had missense variants that clustered at speci ﬁc positions within the functional domains, and one small in frame deletion was identi ﬁed. Some missense variants showed reduced transactivation capacity in our assays, and one variant displayed gain of function effects, suggesting adistinct pathophysiological mechanism. In Bioluminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (BRET) interaction assays, all the truncated versions of POU3F3 that we tested hadsigniﬁcantly impaired dimerization capacities, while all missense variants showed unaffected dimerization with wild type POU3F3. Taken together, our identi ﬁcation and functional cell based analyses of pathogenic variants in POU3F3 , coupled with in depth clinical characterization, implicate disruptions of this gene in a potentially recogniz able neurodevelopmental disorder.

Therefore, MAPK8IP3 was an appealing candidate gene for further investigation after theinitial identi ﬁcation of a de novo missense variant in an individual with a neurodevelopmental disorder. Through international collaboration and exome sequencing in acohort that sums up to 27232 affected individuals, we identi ﬁed heterozygous de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 inthirteen unrelated individuals with an overlapping pheno  type of mild to severe intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies such as perisylvian polymicrogyria, cerebral or cerebellar atrophy and hypoplasia of the corpus callosum. De novo variants comprise six missense variants, three of which are recurrent, and three truncating variants.Brain anomalies were consistent among individuals harbor  ing recurrent de novo missense variants, indicating possible variant speci ﬁc phenotypic effects. We provide several lines of evidence for causation through (1) the signi ﬁcant enrichment of de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 within our cohort, (2) structural modelling of variants that lie in known(template) structures and (3) through using the CRISPR  Cas9 system to target six conserved amino acid positions in Caenorhabditis elegans to demonstrate increased axonallysosomal density for two and an adverse locomotion phenotype for ﬁve of the six investigated human variants in this model. Taken together, we ﬁrmly establish hetero  zygous de novo variants in MAPK8IP3 as a novel cause of a neurodevelopmental disorder with intellectual disability and variable brain anomalies. K.

At the core of the complex machinery that achieves this task are three members of theB family of DNA polymerases; DNA polymerase α,δand ε. Collectively these multimeric polymerases ensure DNA replication proceeds at optimal rates approaching 2x10 3 nucleotides/min, and with an error rate of less than one per million nucleotides polymerised. The majority of DNA replication of undamaged DNA is conducted by DNApolymerases δandε. DNA polymerase α primase complex performs limited synthesis to initiate the replication process, along with Okazaki fragment synthesis on the discontinuouslagging strand. An increasing number of human disorders caused by defects in different components of the DNA replication apparatus have been described to date. These areclinically diverse, involving a wide range of features including variable combinations of growth delay, immuno  deﬁciency, endocrine insuf ﬁciencies, lipodystrophy and cancer predisposition. Here, using various complementary approaches including classical linkage analysis, targeted next generating sequencing and whole exome sequencing,we describe distinct missense and splice impacting muta  tions in POLA1 inﬁve unrelated families presenting with an X linked syndrome involving intellectual disability, propor tionate short stature, microcephaly and hypogonadism. POLA1 encodes the p180 catalytic subunit of DNA polymerase α primase. A range of replicative impairments could be demonstrated in patient derived lymphoblastoid cell lines.

 Non penetrance of a frameshifting SHANK3 deletion is associated with compensatory mechanisms in both alleles,C12.6,"B. Haukanes, T. Nordtveit, G. HougeDepartment of Medical Genetics, Bergen, Norway","In three brothers with severe learning problems, mild ID,","and variable degrees of autism, we found an early frameshifting and maternally derived SHANK3 deletion, (NM_033517.1):c.1030 + 2929_1688 +71delinsG p. (Val344AlafsTer71), removing 10 –13 of the 22 exons. The non mosaic SHANK3 deletion carrier mother is in regular work without learning dif ﬁculties or other problems. To explore how the mother can be non penetrant, we collected blood and ﬁbroblast cells from all family members for epigenetic , RNA  and protein studies. In ﬁbroblasts, deep sequencing based mRNA quanti ﬁcation indicated that the mother had a 3.5 fold higher SHANK3 mRNA expres  sion from the normal allele than her sons, possibly related to an enhancer triplication 17.5 kb upstream only detected in the mother. This enhancer triplication has a populationprevalence of 20% (561/2771). A more pronounced dif  ference was found for the terminal SHANK3 exons 17 –22 also included in two terminal isoforms (isoE/Promoter5 andisoF/Promoter6) located downstream of the deletion. To investigate the epigenetic status of the CpG islands related to the SHANK3 promoters P1 P6, we performed methylation sensitive amplicon based deep sequencing of DNA puri ﬁed from blood and ﬁbroblasts after bisulphite treatment. The putative isoF promoter (core Promoter6 w/nine CpGs) was hypomethylated ( x ̅,1.5 ± 0.94%) in ﬁbroblast DNA from all deletion carriers compared to control subjects ( x ̅,15.5 ± 0.74%). In conclusion, non penetrance of an early SHANK3 deletion in a carrier mother is associated with i)higher SHANK3 expression from her normal allele, possibly rela  ted to a common enhancer triplication only in the mother, and ii)increased expression of C terminal SHANK3 iso  forms from both alleles.

 Metabolomic consequences of PCSK9 inhibition compared with statin therapy,C13.1,"P. Würtz, S. RuosaariAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1119Nightingale Health Ltd., Helsinki, Finland",Introduction: Both statins and PCSK9 inhibitors lower,"blood low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL C) levels to reduce risk of cardiovascular events. We performed detailed metabolic pro ﬁling of a large randomised statin trial and compared the results with the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9, acting as a naturally occurring trial. Materials and Methods: Altogether 228 circulating metabolic measures were quanti ﬁed by nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, including lipoprotein subclass concentrations and their lipid composition, fatty acids, andamino acids, for 5,359 individuals in the PROSPER trial. The corresponding metabolic measures were analysed in eight cohorts (N ,72,185) using PCSK9 rs11591147 to mimic the therapeutic effects of PCSK9 inhibitors. Results: Scaled to an equivalent lowering of LDL C, the effects of genetic inhibition of PCSK9 on 228 metabolicmarkers were generally consistent with those of statin therapy ( R 2,0.88). However, discrepancies were observed for very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) lipid measures.For instance, genetic inhibition of PCSK9 had weaker effects on lowering of VLDL cholesterol compared with statin therapy (54 vs. 77% reduction, relative to the low ering effect on LDL C). Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 showed no signi ﬁcant effects on amino acids, ketones, or a marker of in ﬂammation, whereas statin treat  ment weakly lowered GlycA levels. Conclusion: Genetic inhibition of PCSK9 had similar metabolic effects as statin therapy on detailed lipid andmetabolite pro ﬁles. However, PCSK9 inhibitors are pre  dicted to have weaker effects on VLDL lipids compared with statins for an equivalent lowering of LDL C, whichpotentially translate into smaller reductions in cardiovas  cular disease risk.

While the human genome is set at birth, the gut microbiome can undergo dynamic changesover the course of an individual ’s life. However, we still know little about temporal shifts in the human gut microbiome, nor about the causes and consequences oftemporal shifts. We performed a longitudinal analysis on the gut microbiome of 341 participants in the Dutch population based cohort Lifelines DEEP, each individualhaving metagenomics and deep phenotypic data at two time points (~5 years apart). Signi ﬁcant temporal changes in the gut microbiome were detected at the levels of microbialcomposition, function and antibiotic resistance. Abundance difference was observed for 40% of taxonomies, 60% of functional pathways and 40% of antibiotic resistance genes.Furthermore, genetic stability analysis at strain level has revealed several species are under high evolution rate, including gastrointestinal disease associated Ruminococcus torques . Notable, temporal changes were associated to individual phenotypic variation and lifestyle factors. For instance, the genetic variation in Coprococcus sp ART55/ 1strains was higher in individuals with larger changes in BMI, while Streptococcus thermophilus and Biﬁdobacter  ium longum showed higher mutation rates in proton pump inhibitor and non steroidal anti in ﬂammatory users, as compared to non users. Our data show that the gut microbiome sees dynamic changes not only in microbialcomposition and functional pro ﬁles but also in microbial genetic variation and antibiotic resistance.

However, phase IIIrandomised controlled trials (RCTs) of romosozumab, a sclerostin inhibitor, suggest an imbalance of serious cardiovascular events. Methods: We used two independent variants in SOST (encoding sclerostin) associated with bone mineral density (BMD) as proxies for therapeutic inhibition of sclerostin.We estimated the effects on risk of osteoporosis, fracture, coronary heart disease (CHD) and a further 22 cardiome  tabolic traits, by combining data from 478,967 participantsfrom three cohorts and up to 1,030,836 participants from nine GWAS consortia. In addition, we performed meta  analysis of cardiovascular outcomes from RCTs ofromosozumab. Results: RCT meta analysis identi ﬁed a higher risk of cardiac ischaemic events in patients randomised to romo sozumab (25 events among 4,298 individuals; odds ratio [OR] 2.98; 95% con ﬁdence interval [CI], 1.18 –7.55; P , 0.017). Scaled to the equivalent dose of romosozumab(210mg/month; 0.09 g/cm 2higher BMD), the SOST var  iants associated with lower risk of fracture (OR, 0.59; 95% CI, 0.54 –0.66; P ,1.4 × 10−24), and osteoporosis (OR, 0.43; 95% CI, 0.36 –0.52; P ,2.4 × 10−18). The SOST var  iants associated with higher risk of myocardial infarction and/or coronary revascularisation (69,649 cases; OR, 1.18;95% CI, 1.06 –1.32; P ,0.003) and type 2 diabetes (OR 1.15; 95% CI, 1.05 –1.27; P ,0.003), higher systolic blood pressure (1.3mmHg; 95% CI 0.8 –1.9; P,5.9 × 10 −6) and waist to hip ratio adjusted for BMI (0.05 SDs; 95% CI, 0.02–0.08; P ,8.5 × 10−4).Conclusion: Genetically and therapeutically lowered sclerostin leads to higher risk of cardiovascular events. Rigorous evaluation of the cardiovascular safety of romo  sozumab and other sclerostin inhibitors is warranted. J. Bovijn: None. K. Krebs: None. C. Chen: None. R. Boxall: None. J.C. Censin: None. T.

However, responses are very heterogeneous and we lack predictive biomarkers. Anti angiogenic therapies are key ﬁrst line drugs in mRCC. Our objective was to identify mutations associated with angiogenesis inhibitors response that could help personalizing mRCC treatment. Material and Methods: Samples were collected through an observational study from the Spanish Oncology Geni  tourinary Group and Leuven Hospital. Whole exomesequencing (WES) was performed on tumor and blood from 28 mRCC patients with extreme response to ﬁrst line sunitinib. 45 genes were sequenced on 156 additional tumorcases. Patients were classi ﬁed as anti angiogenic drug responders (PFS>18 months), non responders (PFS < 6 months) or intermediate responders (remaining patients).AKDM5C knockout (KO) model in 786 O cells was gen  erated using CRISPR/Cas9 and characterized by proteomics (iTRAQ technology). Results: WES revealed that mutations in KDM5C , encoding a chromatin remodeling protein, were over  represented among responder patients, and full series ana lysis con ﬁrmed the association (OR ,0.23; 95%CI , 0.07–0.77; P ,0.017). Proteomic analysis in the KDM5CAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1121cellular model revealed 414 proteins differentially expres  sed (FC ,0.3/3.3; P ,0.01). The proangiogenic proteins SPHK2, SRC and RHOC were overexpressed (P < 0.01) in the KO cells suggesting that mutated tumors are more dependent on angiogenesis. Conclusion: Mutations in KDM5C are associated with improved response to anti angiogenic treatment in mRCC, potentially due to an overexpression of proangiogenic pro  teins.

In Na vs and Ca vs, altered channel activity is frequently grouped into gain or loss of ion channel function (GOF orLOF, respectively). This can lead to speci ﬁc diseases, e.g. SCN5A LOF variants to Brugada syndrome and SCN5A GOF variants to Long QT syndrome. Based on 19 knowngene disease mechanisms, we infer LOF (521 variants) and GOF (304 variants) of likely pathogenic variants from disease phenotypes of variant carriers. We show regional clustering of inferred GOF and LOF variants, respectively, across the alignment of the entiregene family, suggesting shared pathomechanisms in SCNxA/CACNA1x genes. We then use sequence  and structure based features (not including gene names or positions) to develop a machine learning method that can predict whether a missense variant results in a LOF or GOF associated disease phenotype (ROC ,0.85). We validate the GOF and LOF effect prediction on functionally tested variants in SCN1A, SCN2A andSCN8A (ROC,0.83) and in large exome wide datasets of individuals with diseaseslike autism and epilepsy. Our work also has implications for disease modeling and mechanisms of ion channels. Ulti  mately, functional prediction of missense variants in theseclinically relevant genes may enhance precision medicine in clinical practice.

The two affected children exhibited very low blood taurine levels (6 and 7µmol/l),heterozygous parents had intermediate levels (24 and 34µmol/l), and an unaffected non carrier sibling had normal levels (71µmol/l) (normal values:37 –127µmol/l). In vitro experiments showed a reduced K Mand V MAX for taurine uptake by HEK 293 cells expressing the mutant (Gly399  Val) SLC6A6 providing only 11 –18% of transport compared to wild type SLC6A6. Similar results were obtained with ﬁbroblasts derived from affected individuals. Clinical evaluation showed that the affected boy hascomplete visual loss, while the affected girl retained some visual acuity. In addition, both affected siblings have mild hypokinetic cardiomyopathy with systolic dysfunction.Slc6a6 knockout in a previously reported mouse model causes progressive retinal degeneration, cardiomyopathy and very low taurine levels in blood and other tissues.Following ethics approval from the Swiss authorities we have initiated a taurine supplementation to both affected individuals. Clinical examinations performed after one yearof taurine supplementation (100mg/kg/day, in 3 doses) showed normal taurine levels in blood and no progression of retinal degeneration in the affected girl. We conclude that the supplementation of taurine could stop the progressive visual loss caused by hypomorphic functional defect in the SLC6A6 transporter in humans. E. Ranza: None. M. Ansar: None. M.

 Effect of genetic counseling on adherence to psychotropic medication in people with serious mentalillness,C14.1,J. Austin,"1, E. Morris1, R. Batallones1, P. Carrion1,","C. Slomp1, J. Ryan1, A. Albert2 1University of British Columbia, Vancouver, BC, Canada, 2Women ’s Health Research Institute, Vancouver, BC, CanadaIntroduction: In the context of serious mental illness (SMIs, i.e. schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, and schizoaf  fective disorder) medication non adherence is an important and complex problem, for which no effective gold standard solution exists. Beliefs about illness etiology in ﬂuence behaviours like medication adherence, thus genetic coun  seling (GC), which helps people understand illness etiology and how it relates to recommended treatments couldplausibly in ﬂuence medication adherence. Materials and Methods: We recruited 110 people with SMI to a study designed to test the hypothesis that GCwould increase adherence to psychotropic medications. Participants completed the Brief Adherence Rating Scale (BARS) twice (1month apart) before receiving GC (T1:baseline and T2: immediately pre GC) and twice after GC (T3 and T4, 1 and 2 months post GC respectively). We used mixed effects logistic regression and validated criteria tomodel BARS scores as a binary variable (adherent ,Y/N) over the 4 time points, and accounted for repeated measures. Results: Using 392 observations from 108 participants (schizophrenia n ,23, schizoaffective n ,14, bipolar n , 71), there was a signi ﬁcant relationship between the prob  ability of adherence and timepoint (p ,0.031). Post hoc pairwise comparisons with holm corrected p values indi  cated the probability of adherence was higher at T4 (86%)compared to T2 (78%) (p ,0.04, OR ,7.08 (95% CI 1.73 to 28.99)). Conclusion: Our data suggest that GC can improve adherence to psychotropic medications in individuals with SMI and that the effect size is large. Further work on the impact of GC on medication adherence, as well as mentalhealth and economic outcomes is warranted. Supported by Pﬁzer Canada. J. Austin: B.

Psychiatric genetic counselling (PGC) is not routinely offered, with a few exceptions. In order to address patients and profes sionals interests and needs, we designed and implemented a training course aimed at equipping them with theoretical knowledge and practical skills. The impact of the coursewas assessed. Method: Data was collected from ﬁve free training courses involving 125 professionals from 18 countries,between 2015 and 2019. Responses were anonymised. Questionnaires assessing participants knowledge and self efﬁcacy were ﬁlled out before and after the training. Results: There was a signi ﬁcant increase in both knowledge [t(124) ,2.05, p < .004)] and self ef ﬁcacy [t (124),27.1, p < 001] following the course, suggesting participants not only gained knowledge and skills during the course but also felt more empowered to offer PGC after the course. Conclusion: Adapting existing services or designing new ones will take time, requiring further empirical evidence to show the impact and implications of PGC training. Estab lishing practice recommendation and standardised training guidelines that include a good understanding of psychiatric disorders and genomics, a pro ﬁcient mastery of counselling skills and ethical standards is clearly timely and essential in order to ensure quality of future PGC services.

To improve access and decrease wait times, we are trialing large scale group genetic counselling in a publicly funded population basedhealth care setting. Methods: This initiative compares pre test group genetic counselling sessions (up to 50 patients per group) to tradi tional one on one genetic counselling. A secondary objec  tive is to trial genetic testing in unaffected individuals. Patients are provided the option of either the large grouparm or the traditional arm with the aim to enroll 400 patients in total. All patients receive a post test one on one results session. Eligibility includes unaffected adult individualswith a family history meeting clinical testing criteria. Patients are invited to complete the Genetic Counselling Outcome Scale, a satisfaction survey and the Multi dimensional Impact of Cancer Risk Assessment. Results: To date, 344 patients (176 group; 168 one on  one) have been enrolled in the trial. Of the 174 patients whohave completed testing, 15 (8.6%) have had a pathogenic/ likely pathogenic variant identi ﬁed, most commonly in BRCA1 /BRCA2 . Both the large group arm and traditional one on one arm have shown high patient satisfaction. Conclusion: Emerging data shows that a large scale group genetic counselling model is feasible, effective andacceptable to patients; this model may be included in a multi pronged approach to deliver quality hereditary cancer care while balancing the needs of the patient, the provider,and the public medical system.

As the capacity to meet the increased demand for personalized counselling is limited, we need new information andcommunication tools for this purpose. Aim: Design and implement chatbot technology as an easy, reliable and safe communication tool to supportindividuals undergoing genetic testing for hereditary breast cancer. Materials and methods: We are developing and imple  menting a new app that can perform chat conversations about genetic testing with patients, using so called Chatbot technology, based on arti ﬁcial intelligence. User experi  ences related to trust and usefulness of the Chatbot is central to the study, and will be evaluated through usability testing and focus group interviews. Results from the ﬁrst pilot test will be presented. Discussion: The use of Chatbots in health care is emer  ging, thus the project is expected to be timely. We expectthat this BRCA Chatbot will serve as an important proof of  principle concept and public innovation process, to sup  plement and improve traditional genetic counselling. TheBRCA Chatbot may personalize counselling and put the patients in a proactive role in their search for information. We anticipate that the patients using the BRCA Chatbotwill be better prepared for face to face consultations in the hospital, and that the tool will be a useful and trusted aid in mastering their lives after these consultations.

 myKinMatters intervention: developing an onlineintervention to support patients in communicating relevant health information to at risk relatives,C14.6,"L. M. Ballard, A. Fenwick, A. M. LucassenAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1125University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom",Introduction: Genetic testing can reveal implications for,"individuals as well as their relatives. Though patients understand the importance of sharing information, espe  cially for those with risks of preventable and treatablediseases, many relatives do not receive this in a timely fashion. Interventions which make it clear for patients whom to inform, how to inform, and what information toconvey, are urgently needed. Methods: We employed a Person Based Approach to ensure the intervention was grounded in the experiences andneeds of patients attending a genomic medicine service. This involved: a meta synthesis of previous interventions; synthesizing communication barriers/facilitators; inter viewing 27 participants from the UK ’s 100,000 Genomes Project; and Systems Thinking to map in ﬂuences on the target behaviour. Results: We identi ﬁed several interventions to aid family communication of genetic results, though most were of poor quality, ineffective, and lacked theoretical underpinning.Interview data showed that (a) many participants had not told many or any relatives they were undergoing genomic testing, and (b) that they would like help to communicatetheir results to relatives. These results, along with barriers, facilitators, and in ﬂuences, were used to create the inter  vention content. Conclusion: myKinMatters could provide a useful addi  tional tool for clinicians to direct patients towards. As genomic medicine becomes ever more widely available, wehope such online interventions will facilitate at least some communication with relatives that otherwise might not happen. Relatives can then make informed decisions abouttheir own testing, surveillance, or preventative options. Future research involves piloting the intervention.

WestersUniversity Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands Introduction: In cancer genome diagnostics analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) gene panel data is focused on the subset of genes with a proven associationto the phenotype that prompted referral. In this study we investigated which pathogenic variants are detected as secondary ﬁndings when genes proven to be associated with other familial cancer types were analyzed as well. Materials and Methods: We have analyzed NGS panel data of 2,090 patients referred for genome diagnostics forfamilial cancer. We analyzed SNVs, Indels and CNVs in all 73 or 85 genes from the targeted panel for all patients, regardless of the cancer type prompting referral. Also wescreened 1,326 people from the general Dutch population for pathogenic variants in the 85 cancer genes of our targeted panel. Results: In 10.2% of patients we detected a variant matching their families ’cancer phenotype. We detected secondary ﬁndings in 3.9% of patients. In the general population 3.2% of individuals carried a pathogenic variant in one of the panel genes. Limiting secondary ﬁndings to the genes listed by the EGAPP, ACMG and SFMPPsocieties as targets for screening and reporting 0.3, 0.7 and 1.4% actionable secondary ﬁndings would have been reported, respectively in patients. For the general populationthese numbers are 0.1, 0.4 and 1.5%. Conclusion: Over 1 in 30 persons in the Dutch popula  tion carries a pathogenic variant in a cancer predisposinggene.

Herein, we explored the pheno  typic landscape of a European cohort of CDH1  mutation  carriers to demonstrate the value of genetic testing driven by phenotype and clinical criteria. We collected and curated variant classi ﬁcation, clinical  criteria and phenotypes from 700 European CDH1  muta  tion carriers of 10 European Countries belonging to ERN  GENTURIS. We excluded those presenting 3 ′ UTR, 5 ′  UTR, intronic variants outside splicing regions and unclassi ﬁable to date. We focused on 389 probands bearing 214 different CDH1 variants. In our cohort, 137 families ful ﬁlled HDGC, 31 had bor  derline HDGC criteria, 221 lacked clinical criteria. While 85% of HDGC/borderline HDGC cases carried large rearrangements or truncating variants, 90% of those lack  ing criteria carried missense mutations. Based on ACMG classi ﬁcation, 155 families carried P/LP actionable variants: 76% HDGC; 15% borderline HDGC, and 10% lacking criteria. Large rearrangements occurred in 20% of HDGC/ borderline HDGC families. Families bearing rearrange ments either presented DGC only or LBC only, while families bearing point mutations more often displayed DGC only. The most common CDH1 germline mutation in Eur ope is Del_Ex1 2 found in 18 families from 6 different countries. Twenty P/LP variants are recurrent in 90 families across Europe.

We explored whether a genetic test that incorporates a 313 SNP basedPolygenic Risk Score (PRS) is clinically meaningful in non  BRCA1/2 Dutch breast cancer families. Materials and Methods : We included 2186 breast cancer cases from 1907 Dutch non  BRCA1/2 breast cancer famil  ies. The 313 SNP PRS was calculated and standardised to 3479 Dutch population controls (sPRS). The association ofthe sPRS with breast cancer was estimated using a logistic regression model, adjusted for family history. Standard errors were corrected to account for relatedness of indivi duals. Using the recently extended BOADICEA model, with and without individual PRS, lifetime risks wereretrospectively calculated by simulating an individual to be at an age of one year and unaffected (for cases), i.e., lifetime risk at birth, given the family history. Results : The mean sPRS for breast cancer cases was 0.65 (SD,0.88, 95%CI ,[0.62 –0.69]). We found a signi ﬁcant association between sPRS and breast cancer, OR ,1.70, 95%CI[1.67 –1.72], p value < 2e 16.

Leveraging up to 23 years of prospective data from the population based FINRISK study (n ,21,951), we built genome wide PRSs with >6 million variants forcoronary heart disease (CHD), atrial ﬁbrillation (AF), type 2 diabetes (T2D), breast cancer, and prostate cancer and tested their 1) associations with incident cases, 2) impact onage at disease onset, and 3) impact in prediction alongside established clinical risk factors.1128A high PRS (>97.5thpercentile) was strongly associated with higher disease incidence (hazard ratios 3.73 –38.29 for top vs bottom 2.5%, p values 0.0003 –6.65x10−22). This risk increase translated into earlier disease onset by 9 to 29 years in the high risk group. For example, for T2D the age at onset in the high risk group was 29.0 years earlier than inthe low risk group. Of 297 early onset CHD (age <55) cases, the clinical ASCVD risk calculator for cardiovascular diseases identi ﬁed only 13.1% as high risk ( ≥7.5%); high (>80 thpercen  tile) CHD PRS was the only risk factor in 31.0% and a familial hypercholesterolemia mutation was present in0.3%. Excluding age as a risk factor, the PRS had a higher effect for CHD risk than did the routinely measured clinical risk factors combined, with similar ﬁndings for AF and T2D. In summary, high polygenic risk predicts future disease and is strongly associated with premature disease onset. N.J. Mars: None. J. Koskela: None. P. Ripatti: None. T. Kiiskinen: None. A.S.

Velsher1,2 1Medcan, Toronto, ON, Canada,2North York General Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Integrating genomic screening into primary care may help individualize medical management, ideally leading to early disease detection and reduced mortality.Data are limited regarding prevalence and penetrance of “rare”actionable genetic conditions in the unselected (“healthy ”) population. We aim to quantify the prevalence of clinically actionable variants in a healthy Canadian population. Methods: Since September 2017, patients of Medcan, a preventive wellness clinic in Toronto, may opt in (self pay) to Invitae ’s proactive screening panel of 130 +genes, with pre  and post test genetic counselling. Gene list is derivedfrom ACMG59 recommendations with additional clinically actionable genes, primarily hereditary cancer and cardiac predispositions. Those positive for pathogenic or likelypathogenic variants are referred for additional screening and management per existing clinical guidelines. Results: Data collection is ongoing, anticipating 1700 + patients by June 2019. Data from our ﬁrst 1300 patients reveal a positive rate of 14.2%, excluding carriers ofrecessive conditions. Removing biallelic hemochromatosis variants, the positive rate is 9.8%. Limiting to those reportable per ACMG59 criteria (i.e. excluding MUTYH heterozygotes, APC I1307K carriers, and variants in non  ACMG59 genes, like CHEK2 andPALB2 ), positive rate is 3.7%. Of all positives, only 5.5% would have quali ﬁed for publicly funded genetic testing. Conclusion: A substantial rate of clinically actionable genetic ﬁndings is seen in a “healthy ”Canadian population who would not otherwise access genetic testing. Long  itudinal data are needed to determine whether proactive genomic screening leads to improved health outcomes, andwhether the cost bene ﬁt balance warrants consideration of population screening within the public healthcare system.

Some single  payer or state funded healthcare systems are already considering offering population genomic testing to allAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1129members. Yet the necessary cost effectiveness analysis of population screening for multiple genetic conditions con  currently has been lacking. Aim: To forecast the combined impact and cost  effectiveness of offering population genomic screening to all young adults in a single payer healthcare system. Methods: We modelled screening of 2,688,192 indivi  duals, all adults aged 18 –25yo in Australia, for pathogenic variants in BRCA1/BRCA2/MLH1/MSH2 genes, and con  current preconception carrier screening for cystic ﬁbrosis (CF), spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) and fragile X syn  drome (FXS), at 71% testing uptake, using per test costsranging AUD$200 $1,200 (~ €125 $760). Investment costs included genetic counseling, surveillance and interventions (reimbursed only) for at risk individuals/couples. Cost effectiveness was de ﬁned below AUD$50,000/DALY (Disability Adjusted Life Year) prevented, using an incre  mental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER), compared with tar geted testing. Outcomes were cancer incidence/mortality, disease cases, and treatment costs reduced. Results: Population screening would reduce mutation  attributable cancers by 28·8%, cancer deaths by 31·2%, and CF/SMA/FXS cases by 24·8%, compared with targeted testing. Assuming AUD$400 per test (~ €250), investment would be between 4 –5 times higher than current expendi  ture. However, screening would lead to substantial savings in medical costs and DALYs prevented, at a highly cost effective ICER (AUD$4,038/DALY). At AUD$200 per  test, screening would approach cost saving for the health system (ICER ,AUD$22/DALY). Conclusion : Preventive genomic screening in early adulthood would be highly cost effective, potentially cost  saving, in a single payer healthcare system.

It is thus important tobetter understand its molecular pathogenesis to identify actionable targets. Long non coding RNAs (LncRNAs) have recently been shown to be de regulated in variouscancers, including HCC. We hypothesize that lncRNAs can serve as master regulators to de regulate gene expression in cancer pathways to modulate the prognosis of HCCpatients. Materials and Methods: The pro ﬁle of lncRNAs and mRNAs were determined in the tumor and adjacent non tumorous tissues of HCC patients. Pearson Correlation analysis was employed to identify mRNAs that are strongly correlated with lncRNAs. These lncRNAs and their corre lated mRNAs were then evaluated for association with clinical phenotypes (e.g. tumor grade). lncRNA mRNA co  expression network analyses was then performed to identifyoncogenic or tumor suppressive Potential Master lncRNA regulator(s) (PMR) which is signi ﬁcantly correlated with the most mRNAs which share similar clinical phenotype asthe PMR. Results: We identi ﬁed a total of 37 co expression net  works with 453 clinically associated lncRNA mRNA pairs.A notable network comprises 5 upregulated PMR lncRNAs with 91 correlated genes which are signi ﬁcantly associated with tumor grade. Genes in this network are enriched incell cycle function. Another signi ﬁcant network comprises 2 downregulated lncRNAs signi ﬁcantly correlated with 8 mainly metallothionein protein family genes and are sig niﬁcantly associated with tumor invasion. Conclusion: These PMR lncRNAs thus have potential to serve as actionable targets for therapeutic intervention. C.G. Lee: None. L.J. Lim: None. J. Yu: None. H.C. Toh: None. P.K.H. Chow: None. A.Y.F.

DICER1 is the only known miRNAbiogenesis component associated with an inherited tumor syndrome, which features multinodular goiter (MNG) and rare pediatric onset lesions, including Wilms tumor (WT).Whole exome sequencing in six affected and three non  affected individuals from a kindred with early onset MNG identi ﬁed a germline missense variant in DGCR8 , c.1552G>A;p.E518K, perfectly segregating with the dis  ease. Five of the six affected individuals also have schwannomatosis and one developed a choroid plexuspapilloma (CPP). The variant has never been described in the germline, it is a recurrent somatic mutation in WT and has been reported in differentiated thyroid cancer (DTC).We performed a genome wide screen for copy number alterations in the schwannomas, MNG, DTC, Wilms tumor and CPP tumors heterozygous for p.E518K, and found acopy number loss of Chrom22q, leading to loss of heterozygosity at the p.E518K locus in all samples.

E Cadherin loss of  func  tion (LoF) correlates with metastatic spread in most epithelial cancers (somatic), early onset gastric and breast cancer (germline EOGC/EOBC) and cleft lip/palate, how ever the underlying mechanisms are vastly unknown. CDH1 70Kb intron 2 full deletion was shown to induce E cadherin LoF, therefore we hypothesized that structuralvariation at CDH1 intronic CREs could further explain CDH1  associated disease phenotypes. Materials and Methods: Bioinformatics analysis of genomic/epigenomic regulatory features revealed several CDH1 CREs, which were sequenced in the germline of EOGC/EOBC patients ( n,250). Using CRISPR/Cas9, selected CREs were edited, genotyped and characterized for CDH1 /E cadherin expression in GC cell lines using qRT  PCR, allele speci ﬁc expression assay, western blotting and immunocytochemistry. CREs enhancer activity was asses  sed in zebra ﬁsh embryos. Results : All CREs harbored novel SNVs and/or CNVs in EOGC/EOBC patients. Homozygous editing of two CREs led to CDH1 RNA and protein expression loss in GC cells. CDH1 LoF was caused by inversions and/or deletions affecting CRE sequences. In vivo, both CREs displayed tissue speci ﬁc enhancer activity, particularly in the mouth and/or midline of Zebra ﬁsh embryos, areas where CDH1 plays a crucial role during development. Conclusion: With our combined dry/wet lab approaches, we narrowed down regions within CDH1 intronic regions able to control CDH1 /E Cadherin expression and function. We further unveiled that both deletions and inversions ofAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1131CREs may lead to E cadherin LoF, suggesting novel mechanisms worth screening in CDH1  associated disease phenotypes.

However, a fraction of such variants could maintain function through their impact on RNA splicing. To test this hypothesis, we used the alternatively spliced BRCA2 exon 12 (E12) as a model, since its in frame skipping leads to a potentially functional protein. All BRCA2 E12 variants corresponding to putative null variants or predicted to alter splicing (n ,39) were selected from databases and characterized for their impact on splicing in minigeneassays and in patient lymphoblastoid cell lines, when available. Moreover, a selection of variants was analyzed in mouse embryonic stem cell based functional assays. Usingthese complementary approaches, we demonstrate that a subset of variants, including nonsense variants, (i) induces in frame E12 skipping through the modi ﬁcation of splice sites or regulatory elements and, as a consequence, (ii) leads to the production of an internally deleted but partially functional protein. These data provide evidence for the ﬁrst time in a cancer predisposition gene that variant induced perturbation of splicing can, at least partially, rescue the loss of function of certain presumed null variants. Additionalstudies are required to estimate cancer risk associated with these hypomorphic variants. The existence of such rescue mechanism may question the pathogenic classi ﬁcation of certain null variants identi ﬁed in disease causing genes. Our ﬁndings emphasize the importance of RNA based analyses and assessment of protein function to ensure accuratevariant classi ﬁcation, a paramount step in genomic medicine. L. Meulemans: None. R.

Genetic factors and pathways underlying cervical cancer are largely unknown. We performed a genome wide association study to unravellow risk cervical cancer susceptibility variants in the German population. A series of 375 patients with invasive cervical cancer and 866 healthy controls were directlygenotyped for ~570,000 variants on the Illumina OncoArray BeadChip. After genotype calling, QC, PCA, and imputa  tion, we used PLINK to analyze 21,326,396 variants fortheir association with cervical cancer. We did not identify single variants at the level of genome wide signi ﬁcance. However, a gene based analysis using MAGMA throughmapping SNPs to 19,213 protein coding genes indicated a signiﬁcant role for OSGIN1 (p,1.12x10E 8) encoding a p53 regulated tumor suppressor. Pathway analyses usingMAGMA detected an enrichment for the GO term “Protein kinases ”(p,0.02). To look deeper into possible pathways involved, the SNPs were ﬁltered more stringently using ANNOVAR positional mapping, eQTL, 3D chromatin interaction mapping and common features of chromatin regulation, and 180 prioritized genes were testedusing GENE2FUNC. We found signi ﬁcant enrichment for genes residing in a breast cancer 12q amplicon (p , 1.9x10E 14) and for genes that had emerged from aprevious GWAS for “Response to platinum based neoadju  vant chemotherapy in cervical cancer ”(p,3.6x10E 18).

 Mitochondrial damage due to a genetic origin explains the autoimmune response that leads to gastric neuroendocrine tumors,C17.6,O. Calvete,"1, R. Marra1, J. Reyes2, J. Benitez1","1Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Oncologicas (CNIO), Madrid, Spain,2Centro Nacional de Hospital Comarcal deInca. Balearic Islands Health Investigation Institute (IDISBA) Oncologicas (CNIO), Inca, Spain Type I gastric neuroendocrine tumors (gNETs) arise from hypergastrinemia in patients with autoimmune chronic atrophic gastritis. According to the classical model, thegastric H +/K+ATPase was the causative autoantigen recognized by CD4 +T cells in chronic autoimmune scenario that produces the parietal cell atrophy, whichcorrelates with gastric achlorhydria and increases the risk for gNETs and gastric neoplasms. However, the mechanism by which the in ﬂammatory response correlates with IL 17 secretion and PC atrophy is not clearly de ﬁned. Recently, we found that the ATP4A p.R703Cmutation impaired PC function and normal gastric acidi ﬁcation, which drove familial gNET. Our group constructed a knock in mouse model for the ATP4A mutation, which at one year recapitulated human premalignant conditions and achlorhydria. We have mon itored the mouse model for one more year and have served us to better understand the relation between impaired capability to export protons across the plasma membraneof PCs and tumor progression. The ATP4A p.R703Cmutation drives gastric achlorhydria, but also deregulates the acid  base balance within PCs, affecting mitochondrial biogenesis.Mitochondrial malfunction activates ROS signaling, which triggers caspase 3 mediated apoptosis. Therefore, mitochon  dria alteration would initiate the chronic in ﬂammation and does not involve an IL 17 secretion mediated mechanism rather than the classical explanation. In addition, by restoring gastric euchlorhydria, mitochondrial function is recovered.Finally, infection by H. pylori promotes destabilization of the mitochondria of the PCs by a mechanism similar to that described for APT4A p.R703Ccarriers, which suggests that restoring gastric euchlorhydria might be indicated for the treatment of these patients.

Seymour Homology Medicines Inc, Bedford, MA, United StatesAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1133Phenylketonuria (PKU) is a rare hepatic metabolic disease caused by mutations in the phenylalanine hydroxylase (PAH ) gene causing elevated levels of phenylalanine that lead to neurocognitive defects. Current treatments do not address the underlying genetic defect. A suite of Clade F adeno associated viruses was isolated from human periph eral blood CD34 +hematopoietic stem cells (AAVHSCs) and show high hepatic af ﬁnity and potential for gene therapy. Here we describe the ability of AAVHSC mediatedgene therapy to durably correct the disease phenotype in the Pah enu2mouse model of severe PKU. Gene therapy vectors containing a human PAH transgene driven by ubiquitous or liver speci ﬁc promoters packaged in AAVHSC15 were tested in Pahenu2mice. Vectors were administered in a single intravenous dose followed byperiodic assessment of serum phenylalanine and tyrosine (byproduct of phenylalanine metabolism). At study termi  nation, livers were processed to measure vector genomes,mRNA and PAH enzyme activity. One week post dose of an initial research vector using an ubiquitous promoter, phenylalanine levels decreased from2000 μM to <150 μM (p < 0.0001) and were sustained out to >28 weeks (p < 0.0001). To enhance long term durability with decreased doses, vector sequences in AAVHSC15 PAH were optimized using different liver speci ﬁc pro  moters. We selected a vector, HMI 102, that decreased serum phenylalanine and increased serum tyrosine at ten fold lower doses compared to the initial research vector. A durable response was seen out to 48 weeks, consistent with the model ’s lifespan. These data demonstrate that a single dose of HMI 102 resulted in long term correction of PKU inPah enu2mice on protein containing chow. S.S. Ahmed: A.

 Viral vector therapy as a therapeutic option for peripheral nerve disease associated with metachromatic leukodystrophy,C18.2,"S. K. Newman, T. RuparUniversity of Western Ontario, London, ON, Canada",Metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) is an autosomal,"recessive neurodegenerative disease caused by the de ﬁ  ciency of the lysosomal enzyme arylsulfatase A (ARSA)leading to accumulation of sulfatide, causing degeneration of myelin in the CNS and PNS. Currently, no treatment exists. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (HSCT)provides modest bene ﬁt in pre symptomatic patients but this well short of a realistic treatment. Gene transfer experiments using lenti viral vectors have shown success in decreasingsulfatide accumulation in the CNS of ARSA −/−mouse models; however, this treatment has shown no success in targeting the peripheral nervous system. In the presentstudy, we compared single stranded (ss) AAV serotypes  AAV 9 and AAVrh10, packaged with a codon optimized ARSA gene or eGFP. The vectors were delivered via tailvein injection for PNS distribution to ARSA −/−mice at 6 months of age at a dose of 2x1010vector grams per mouse. The gene transfer facilitated both GFP biodistribution (measured via PCR and histopathology) and ARSA bio distribution (measured via HPLC and PCR) along with detectable enzymatic activity throughout the sciaticnerve, spinal cord and liver. Histopathological analysis of the spinal cord and sciatic nerve show presence of GFP indicating positive vector transfection, with AAV 9 show ing the most evident GFP presence. In summary, we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that tail vein injection of AAV 9 and AAVrh10 to an ARSA  / mouse as a treatment strategy for MLD is successfully able to target the PNS and signiﬁcantly decrease sulfatide accumulation in PNS associated tissue which has a direct therapeutic bene ﬁt.

This study demonstrates that correction of the common HBBIVSI 110(G>A)β thalassemia splice muta  tion may be achieved by ef ﬁcient non homologous end joining mediated disruption of the aberrant regulatory elements (DARE) created by the mutation. Material and Methods: DARE correction was evaluated in patient derived CD34+cells by nucleofection of in vitro synthesized TALEN mRNAs and of CRISPR/Cas9 RNA guided nuclease (RGN) ribonucleoprotein complexes. Correction ef ﬁciency was assessed as restoration of correct splicing at RNA (RT qPCR), protein (HPLC) and cell morphology (differential counts) levels, and off target activity by targeted deep sequencing. Results: Proof of  principle was achieved in patient derived CD34 +cells for both nucleases, reaching high bulk disruption ef ﬁciencies of up to 90%. Restoration of correct splicing established up to 63 and 77% of normal β globin synthesis for TALENs and RGN, respectively. RGN  off target activity for the RNF219_AS1 gene was abolished at high on target correc  tion, by evaluating strategic mismatches and employing thehigh  ﬁdelity AltR_HiFi_Cas9. Across primary samples, DARE achieved signi ﬁcant correction of the two hallmarks ofβ thalassaemia pathology, β globin synthesis and late  stage erythroid differentiation. Conclusion: Our study shows that mutation speci ﬁc gene therapy by DARE is highly ef ﬁcient and holds great potential for many human diseases caused by aberrant regulatory motifs. High level of correction achieved without enrichment, low level of off targeting and use of virus  andDNA free delivery in patient derived CD34 +cells in this study indicate biosafety and ef ﬁciency suitable for direct clinical translation.

 Therapeutic gene editing for Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome,C18.4,"D. Whisenant1, K. Lim2, G. Revêchon1, M. Eriksson1,",J. S. Kim2,"1Karolinska Institutet, Huddinge, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Institute for Basic Science, Seoul, Korea, Republic of Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS) is a rare premature ageing disorder with clinical manifestationsincluding severe growth retardation, skeletal dysplasia, alopecia, scleroderma like skin changes, loss of subcuta  neous adipose tissue and loss of vascular smooth musclecells. More than 90% of the cases are caused by a de novo point mutation in exon 11 of the LMNA gene ( LMNA c.1824 C>T, p.G608G). This mutation activates a cryptic splice sitewithin the LMNA gene and results in a production of a truncated unprocessed lamin A protein called progerin. In this study, we use a conditional humanized mouse modelwith tissue speci ﬁc expression of the common HGPS mutation in keratinocytes of the skin, as well as patient  derived cell cultures. For precise single base editing, we areusing a CRISPR Cas9 adenine editor (ABE) in order to reverse the c.1824C>T point mutation by adeno associated virus (AAV) delivery. Cell culture experiments with B cell derived lymphoblastoid cells from a HGPS patient show a signiﬁcant reduction of the c.1824 C>T mutation with a correction ef ﬁciency up to 76% and a reduction of the c.1824 C>T mutant allele frequency down to 12% by ABE treatment. In ongoing experiments we are assessing the AAV delivery system as well as the ABE ef ﬁciency in vivo in order to improve the HGPS phenotype. Using this method we have the possibility to target the disease on a genetic level before complex downstream mechanisms aretaking place, with the future aim of a highly precise and efﬁcient gene editing approach for clinical use in HGPS patients.

Effective therapies are not yet available. We report here the successful gene editing of one of the most common hot spotmutations, c.473C>T p.T158M, using CRISPR/Cas9 in patient derived cells. A two plasmid system was developed suitable for AAV delivery. The Reporter plasmid expressesthe mutation speci ﬁc sgRNA and the Donor DNA, which contains the template for the correction. The Cas9 plasmid encodes for the Cas9 ﬂanked by two targets for self  cleavage of the Cas9 coding sequence, in order to avoid long term expression. We then selected 4 unrelated patients with the same de novo hot spot mutation. Starting frompatient derived ﬁbroblasts, we obtained induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (iPSCs) and iPSC derived neuronal precursors and neurons. NGS analysis of FACS isolated cells fromthree independent patients demonstrated an exceptionally high editing ef ﬁciency, ranging from 60 to 80% of HDR with a very low rate (1%) of insertions/deletions. Further more, a good AAV9 co infection was demonstrated in neurons differentiated from iPSCs. To further validate efﬁcacy and safety, in vivo experiments on the Mecp2  T158M mouse are ongoing.

ARQ 092is an oral, allosteric, selective pan AKT inhibitor that potently inhibits both active and inactive forms of AKT. It is currently being evaluated in oncology and overgrowthsyndromes clinical trials. Materials and Methods: Safety, tolerability and pre  liminary ef ﬁcacy of ARQ 092 have been tested in 15 pts (8 F and 7 M; age range 2.6 –41.1), 14 with PIK3CA and 1 with AKT1 mutations. Assessments include physical examination, vital signs, Karnofsky/Lansky performancescale (K/LPS), laboratory tests imaging, pain and patient  reported outcomes. All pts receive ARQ 092 at a dose of 15 mg/m 2QD with an option to increase to 25 mg/m2. All 15 pts are ongoing and have been on treatment between 3 and 22 months. Results: Treatment emergent adverse events (AE) were observed in 15 pts (100%), all were grade ≤2. Drug related AEs were reported in 2 pts: hyperinsulinemia (1 pt); sto  matitis and neutropenia (1 pt). The most common AEs werepyrexia (60%); cough (47%); abdominal pain (33%); diar  rhea, vomiting (each, 27%); upper respiratory infection and rhinitis (each, 20%). No pts were discontinued or dosereduced due toxicity. Radiologically con ﬁrmed stability of lesions and signi ﬁcant improvement in K/LPS, movement ﬂuidity, fatigability and pain relief were noted by parents and clinicians in most pts.

 Phasing of complex genomic rearrangements reveal involvement of both homologous chromosomes in pre and post zigotic events,C19.1,"C. M. Carvalho, C. Beck, Z. Akdemir, F. Sedlazeck,","Q. Meng, J. Hu, H. Doddapaneni, E. Chen, S. Jhangiani,A. English, D. Muzni, R. Gibbs, C. Shaw, P. Hastings,","J. R. Lupski Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States Introduction: Complex genomic rearrangements (CGRs) are de ﬁned as structural variants consisting of two or more breakpoint junctions and can contribute to as much as 30% of pathogenic copy number variants (CNVs) in genomicdisorders. CGRs are hypothesized to result of an error prone mechanism during repair of a single ended, double stranded DNA that utilizes a poorly processive DNA polymeraseresulting in multiple fork collapses and template switching (TS). Majority of CGRs studied show TS within the same chromosome. Objectives: to gain mechanistic insights into the forma  tion of CGRs. Material and Methods: we studied six trios on which probands were referred with congenital malformations car  rying de novo autosomal CGRs. Trios were studied by combined array comparative genomic hybridization(aCGH), SNP array, targeted 7Mb Illumina short read, PacBio or Nanopore long read sequencing. Results: This combined approach enabled to resolve breakpoint junctions in 6/8 cases. Phasing was obtained by B allele frequency analysis within the CNV provided by the trio joint calling. Surprisingly, in each of the cases here, theampli ﬁed segments are constituted by a mix of copies from both homologues rather than originated from only one ancestral chromosome. Two informative cases indicatedthat the CGRs were formed pre zygotically, whereas one case was formed post zygotic. Conclusion: CNV segments originated from two distinct chromosomes contributing to formation of the same rear  rangement strongly support a TS model of generating CGRs. The results shown here predict that CGR are formedby replication based mechanisms, and can have further implications for sporadic disease, cancer and human gene evolution. C.M. Carvalho: None. C.

 Cytogenetically detected chromosomal inversions are rarely formed by ectopic recombination betweeninverted repeats,C19.2,M. Pettersson,"1, C. M. Grochowski2, J. Eisfeldt1,3,","J. Wincent1, J. R.

Early cytogenetic studies of inversionssuggested that non allelic homologous recombination (NAHR) between inverted repeats could be the underlying mechanism of formation, and the prevalence of NAHR mediated inversions has been estimated to 67%. Here we used short read whole genome sequencing (WGS) on 16 unique, cytogenetically detected chromoso mal inversions and were able to characterize 10/16 (62.5%) on the nucleotide level. We found that two seemingly recurrent inversions were identical by descent and follow up analysis con ﬁrmed that the unrelated carriers shared both common and more rare haplotypes on these chromosomes. Out of the 10 inversions that we characterized in detail, nineshowed little to no microhomology in the breakpoint junctions, similar to what is commonly seen in reciprocal translocations. Only one inversion was mediated by repeats(Alu Alu ), and had duplications that had been formed con  comitantly to the inversion, also through Alu Alu interac  tions. Finally, the gene disruption frequency was similar tothe frequency obtained for balanced translocations (6/25 breakpoints, 24%). In summary, the study indicates that short read WGS can detect a substantial fraction of chro mosomal inversions and resolves the breakpoints on the nucleotide level. Finally, NAHR is likely not the major mechanism underlying the formation of non recurrent largechromosomal inversions.

Despite the newest sequencing technologies, the human reference genome hg38 still comprises three unresolved sequence gaps inLCR22 A. The recurrent deletion/duplication breakpoints of 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2DS) are embedded within these repeats, but the exact location remainsunclari ﬁed. Materials and Methods: We performed an LCR22 de novo assembly using ﬁber FISH. Long DNA molecules were extracted from cells, stretched onto coverslips, and hybridized with LCR22 speci ﬁc probes. Following manualsignal screening, alleles were de novo assembled by tiling ﬁbers based on matching colors and distances between the probes. Results: LCR22 haplotyping in 24 individuals uncovered the presence of 26 different alleles for LCR22 A. These alleles range in size between 200kb and 2Mb. Subunitscluster in larger substructures, which vary in orientation, copy number, and presence. In addition, the rearranged alleles of 22q11.2DS patients were mapped in nine families.Differences in the location of the deletion breakpoints were identi ﬁed. Findings were validated by Bionano optical mapping. Conclusion: For the ﬁrst time, the overall architecture of the 22q11.2 locus was successfully unraveled. The LCR22 hypervariability implicates interindividual gene dosagedifferences. As a consequence, copy number variations could in ﬂuence gene expression pro ﬁles. Additionally, mapped rearrangement breakpoints vary among patients.We hypothesize this variability could provide a genetic explanation for some of the phenotypic variability char  acterizing the 22q11.2DS.

GPR180 and TGDS were consis  tently altered, but the loss of either one individually doesnot cause MCOR. The genomic architecture of the 13q32.1 region is consistent with the existence of adjacent TADs,1138the boundary of which could be altered by MCOR deletions. Methods: We generated mouse models carrying the minimal MCOR deletion (35KB) or three smaller deletions within this region encompassing binding sites for the insulator CTCF, respectively and analyzed their morpho logical, histological and molecular phenotypes. Results: Heterozygous animals carrying the 35 KB deletion display moderate reduction in pupil diameter andectopic expression of a neighboring gene in the iris starting during embryonic life, before the formation of the dilator muscle, through to adulthood. Smaller deletions encom passing putative insulator sites do not cause ectopic expression of the neighboring gene. This suggests that the 35KB MCOR deletion may lead to the adoption of a nor mally distant enhancer by the deregulated gene, due to reduced distance between the two, instead of a TAD  boundary disruption. 4C sequencing to characterize thechromosomal interactions generated by the 35KB deletion and the generation of mice lacking an excellent candidate enhancer are ongoing, to assess this hypothesis. Conclusion: Here, we show that MCOR deletions alter the genomic architecture of 13q32.1 and gene expression in the developing iris, changing the fate of the progenitors thatshould give rise to the dilator muscle.

Herein, combining data derived from a meta analysis of 45 informative disease causing 5 ′SS GT>GC mutations (from 42 genes) and a cell culture  based full length gene splicing assay of 103 5 ′SS GT>GC mutations (from 30 genes), we estimate that ~15 –18% of the canonical GT 5 ′SSs are capable of generating between 1 and 84% normal transcripts as a consequence of thesubstitution of GT by GC. We further demonstrate that the canonical 5 ′SSs whose substitutions of GT by GC generated normal transcripts show stronger complementar ity to the 5 ′end of U1 snRNA than those sites whose substitutions of GT by GC did not lead to the generation of normal transcripts. We also observed a correlation betweenthe generation of wild type transcripts and a milder than expected clinical phenotype but found that none of the available splicing prediction tools were able to accuratelypredict the functional impact of 5 ′SS GT>GC mutations. Ourﬁndings imply that 5 ′SS GT>GC mutations may not invariably cause human disease but should also help toimprove our understanding of the evolutionary processes that accompanied GT>GC subtype switching of U2 type introns in mammals.

 Novel regulatory elements control translation of key stress response factors linked to disease,C19.6,J. Rendleman,"1, V. Hronová2, D. Sultanov1, S. Maity1,","A. Lei1, M. Hatzoglou3, L. Valá šek2, C. Vogel1 1New York University, New York, NY, United States, 2Institute of Microbiology ASCR, Prague, Czech Republic, 3Case Western Reserve University, Cleveland, OH, United States Introduction: The accumulation of misfolded proteins in the endoplasmic reticulum, known as ER stress, is a hallmark of many diseases including cancer. To combat ER stress, cells employ the Unfolded Protein Response, whichincludes translation induction of stress response factors. For a subset this induction is achieved through upstream open reading frames in the 5 ′UTR, however mechanisms are not well understood for many others.Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1139Material and Methods: We performed ribosome pro ﬁl  ing in human cells undergoing ER stress and searched 5 ′ UTRs for ribosome enriched motifs. Using reporters, we tested signi ﬁcant motifs for their impact on protein synth  esis under stress. To further characterize their function, we used the CRISPR/Cas9 system to engineer mutations incell lines. Results: We identi ﬁed a short motif in the 5 ′UTR with signiﬁcant enrichment in ribosomal occupancy; reporter assays con ﬁrmed the functionality of this sequence. This new element is common among transcriptional regulators, including a key factor of the Unfolded Protein Response,and correlates with reduced translation of downstream coding regions, suggesting a translation inhibitory element. Importantly, cross referencing with The Cancer GenomeAtlas revealed overlap with cancer risk variants. Conclusion: The 5 ′UTR is a critical component of a gene; however, much is unknown regarding its role inexpression, particularly through translation. Traditional cancer exome studies miss mutations in undescribed reg  ulatory regions in the UTR. The element we have dis covered not only has the potential to revise a long standing model in the ﬁeld of translation regulation, but also high  lights novel mutations that may contribute to oncogenesis.

Aradhya1 1Invitae, San Francisco, CA, United States,2Center for Genomic Medicine, Northwestern University, Chicago, IL, United States Molecular genetic testing for hereditary neuromuscular disorders has been increasingly used to con ﬁrm clinical diagnoses, identify subtype, and inform management andprognosis. These important uses of genetic testing have been corroborated in several small studies, but large data sets are needed to fully illuminate the utility and complexityof genetic analysis. Moreover, universal high resolution analysis of intragenic copy number variation (CNV) is nowpossible, enabling us to evaluate its contribution to neuromuscular disorders. We investigated a cohort of 10,782 unrelated individuals with a range of neuromuscular disorders using high  coverage next generation sequencing (NGS) with simulta  neous sequence and exon level CNV detection for subsetsof 232 genes related to these disorders to better understand diagnostic yield, mutation spectrum, and complexities of variant interpretation. Deﬁnitive diagnosis was obtained in 2,484 individuals (23%). Diagnostic yields ranged from 10% for dystonia to 53% for spinal muscular atrophy or dystrophinopathy. Asexpected, 94.8% of pathogenic CNVs were found in SMN1, PMP22, and DMD, however, the remaining pathogenic CNVs were found across 31 other genes and intragenicCNVs accounted for as much as 20% of all clinically sig  niﬁcant results. Separately, we evaluated the rate of reclassi ﬁcation of variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance and observed that up to 15% of such variants in some genes were reclassi ﬁed to likely pathogenic or pathogenic. Our data represent one of the largest studies demon  strating the utility of NGS based genetic testing in neuro  muscular disorders and the important contribution of exon  level CNV analysis to inform clinical management ofindividuals with these disorders.

For 50% of individuals with dHMN, the disease causing gene is unknown. Materials and Methods: WES and WGS were used to identify the monogenic causes of dHMN. Patient derived ﬁbroblasts were used to assess the functional consequence of candidate variants on splicing, protein abundance, and subcellular localization. Results: We identi ﬁed putative pathogenic variants in GBF1 (Golgi Brefeldin A Resistant Guanine Nucleotide Exchange Factor 1 ) in four unrelated families with domi  nant or sporadic dHMN. Other known dHMN implicatedgenes were excluded. De novo or inherited mutations (c.2945G>A, p.Cys982Tyr; c.3410C>T, p.Ala1137Val; c.4382G>A, p.Arg1461Gln; and c.3524G>A, p.Trp1175*)were associated with slowly progressive distal muscle weakness and atrophy accompanied by musculoskeletal deformities (scoliosis, pes cavus, hammer toes). Electro physiological studies consistently revealed axonal motor neuropathy; three patients also had distal sensory loss. GBF1 plays a pivotal role in COPI vesicular traf ﬁcking and Golgi maintenance. Functional studies con ﬁrmed that the variants c.3410C>T, located after the 3 ′splice acceptor site (SAS), and c.4382G>A, predicted to introduce a novelSAS, do not affect splicing. Protein levels from patients ﬁbroblasts con ﬁrmed GBF1 haploinsuf ﬁciency for the W1175* mutation, whereas A1137V and R1461Q exhibitedmoderately increased GBF1 levels. Preliminary immunos  taining analyses revealed Golgi fragmentation in ﬁbroblast lines p.Ala1137Val and p.Arg1461Gln. Conclusion: Previous studies have linked disrupted COPI transport and Golgi fragmentation with other motor neuropathies. Our results emphasize the role of GBF1 inthese contexts and indicate that GBF1 mutations are a novel cause of dHMN. N. Mendoza Ferreira: None. M. Karakaya: None. I. Hölker: None. D. Beijer: None. B.

Using exome sequencing, we identi ﬁed recessive mutations in the muscle speci ﬁc exon 15 of FXR1 in two unrelated families with congenital myopathy, one of them having a neonatal lethal phenotype. To investigate thepathogenicity of exon 15 mutations, we generated a CRISPR Cas9 mouse model carrying the same mutation as the family with lethal phenotype (delACAG) and adifferent exon 15 mutant (dupA) that results in low FXR1P levels. Mutant homozygous mice were found with decreased muscle volume, muscle strength and bone densityby MRI, behavioural tests and DEXA respectively, while histopathological studies showed muscle ﬁbers of reduced diameter, increased centralized nuclei, and type I predomi nance. Ultra structural analysis of ﬁbers from mutant mice also revealed multiple cores and Z band disruption. Notably, phenotypic severity was greater in delACAGmutants than in dupA mice. Histopathology of a triceps biopsy from a FXR1 patient was consistent with these ﬁndings. We additionally demonstrate that the delACAG mutation leads to abnormal FXR1P isoforms which accumulate in a new type of cytoplasmic granules in human and mouse muscle cells. In conclusion, we reportthat mutations in exon 15 of FXR1 are associated with a multi minicore myopathy which varies in severity depend  ing on to the effect of each mutation on the protein. This istheﬁrst time that mutations in FXR1 are demonstrated to be associated with a human condition. Funding: MINECO/ CIBERER/NINDS E. Fernández Núñez: None. M. Estañ: None. M.S. Zaki: None. M.

Recently our studies identi ﬁed novel mutations in MYBPC1 associated with a new form of myopathy. Materials and Methods: Exome sequencing and in silico prognostic tools were used to identify novel MYBPC1 pathogenic variants. Biochemical assays and molecular dynamics were performed to examine the impact of the MYBPC1 variants on actomyosin binding, the structure and stability of sMyBP C. A knock in mouse model containing one of the pathogenic mutations was generated. Results: We have identi ﬁed novel autosomal dominant mutations in MYBPC1 that co segregate with a new form of myopathy characterized by muscle weakness, hypotonia, facial/body deformities, and tremor of possibly myogenicorigin. The individual mutations differentially affect the stability, structure and ability of sMyBP C to bind myosin. The generated knock in mouse model faithfully recapitu lates the myopathic phenotype and disease progression observed in patients. Heterozygous knock in mice are sig  niﬁcantly smaller and exhibit behavioural, morphological and contractile de ﬁcits compared to their wild type littermates. Conclusion: Our work expands the range of myopathies associated with MYBPC1 mutations, which was limited to severe and lethal forms of distal arthrogryposis. We now present evidence for a MYBPC1  linked myopathy asso  ciated with tremor.1142This work was supported by NIH/NIAMS (T32AR007592  17 to JG & R21AR072981 to AKK), Muscular Dystrophy Association (313579 to AKK), European Regional Develop  ment Fund (No. 2010/0223/2DP/2.1.1.1.0/10/APIA/VIAA/ 025 to BL) and FULBRIGHT PROGRAM (PS00266997 to JS).

Here, we utilized exome sequencing in two siblings with progressive ataxia and muscular weakness and identi ﬁed a novel homozygous mutation (c.3020 1G>A) in neurofascin ( NFASC) . In RNA extracted from ﬁbroblasts we showed that the mutation resulted in inframe skipping of exon 26, with deprived expression of the transcript thatcorresponds to NFASC isoform NF186. To further inves  tigate the disease mechanisms, we assessed the NFASC mutation in our established in vitro neural cell model.Fibroblasts from one affected sibling and the unaffected parents were reprogrammed to pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), directed to long term neuroepithelial stem cells(NESCs) and ﬁnally differentiated to neurons. In early neurogenesis, differentiating cells with a selective depletion of the NF186 isoform showed signi ﬁcantly reduced neurite outgrowth as well as fewer emerging neurites. Furthermore, whole cell patch clamp recordings of patient derived neural cells revealed a lower threshold for openings, indicatingaltered Na +channel kinetics suggesting a lower threshold for openings as compared to neural cells without theNFASC mutation. Taken together, our results strongly suggest that loss of NFASC isoform NF186 causes perturbed neurogenesis and impaired neuronal biophysical properties resulting in a novel early onset autosomal recessive ataxia syndrome.

Peters VA Medical Center, Bronx, NY, United States Introduction: Neurodegeneration occurs in a variety of human diseases, but molecular pro ﬁling of the brain is difﬁcult. Cell free DNA (cfDNA) derived from neurological tissue holds great potential for very early detection and monitoring of neurodegeneration. Materials and Methods: We characterised DNA methylation speci ﬁc to human brain cells and brain region using genome wide epigenetic pro ﬁles and compared these with targeted deep sequencing (bisul ﬁte) of cfDNA methylation in acute and chronic neurodegenerative disease subjects. To detect brain derived cfDNA we developed anew statistical approach for analysing DNA methylation at the single molecule level using k mers. Results: We detected an acute appearance in cfDNA from dorsolateral prefrontal cortex neurons (DLPFC neuron) following blast exposure within a unique cohort of active duty military personnel involved in operational breaching.We also detected brain derived cfDNA during cognitive decline within a unique cohort of type 2 diabetic patientsAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1143with and without cognitive decline in which we identi ﬁed stage dependent patterns of DLPFC neuron cfDNA and the presence of cerebellar derived cfDNA. Finally, we identi  ﬁed signi ﬁcant (p < 0.05) DLPFC neuron cfDNA among patients with DLPFC neurodegeneration validated by longitudinal structural magnetic resonance brain imaging.

Insights into the molecular functions of MYOCD have been obtained from cell culturestudies and, to date, our in vivo knowledge about MYOCD comes exclusively from experimental animals. For example, expression of dominant negative Myocd disrupts myocardial differentiation in embryonic frogs, while Myocd null mice die midgestation with failed vascular smooth muscle (SM)1144cell differentiation. Here, we de ﬁne a devastating and often lethal human congenital disease associated with inheritance of pathogenic MYOCD variants, with 14 affected indivi  duals in four families. This disease manifests as a massively dilated urinary bladder, or megabladder, with a disrupted SM wall. These human results are supported by evidence ofmegabladder in two distinct mouse models with reduced Myocd levels. Together, these ﬁndings highlight a vital role for MYOCD in mammalian organogenesis. In conclusion,we demonstrate for the ﬁrst time that variations in MYOCD result in human disease, and propose that loss of function variants in MYOCD cause semi dominant congenitalmegabladder. This has important implications for genetic counseling of families with congenital megabladder, sheds new light on bladder development, and expands thepathophysiological spectrum of inherited SM disorders.

In search of novel causative genes, we studied a family with renal in addition to skeletal, eye, ear malformations in one sibling, and ear anomalies in another sibling and their mother. Whole exome sequencing yielded a rare heterozygous missense variant in the growth differentiation factor 6 ( GDF6 ) gene known to cause autosomal dominant Klippel Feil syndrome type 1 (KFS1) in all affected family members. While skeletal and hearing abnormalities are characteristic of KFS1, renal anomalieshave not been described as a hallmark. To assess whether GDF6 is involved in the pathogenesis of renal malforma  tion, we performed mutational analysis of 193 furtherpatients identifying two more cases with rare GDF6 missense variants. A CRISPR/Cas9 derived knockout in murine IMCD3 cells showing that Gdf6  deﬁciency attenu  ated cell migration was rescued by expression of human wildtype but not mutant GDF6 , indicating variant patho  genicity with respect to a developmental phenotype. RNAin situ hybridization on murine embryo sections revealed expression of Gdf6 in the developing urogenital system. As gdf6 expression was also observed in the pronephros of Xenopus laevis , this model was used for in vivo gdf6 knockdown studies, resulting in impaired pronephros development in embryos with downregulated gdf6 expres  sion. Altogether, we demonstrate rare heterozygous deleter  ious GDF6 variants in patients with renal malformation (1.6%), and renal combined with ear, eye or skeletalanomalies (5.2%), and provide evidence for an involvement of GDF6 in early nephrogenesis.

Hauner Children ’s Hospital, Ludwig Maximilians University, Munich, Germany Introduction: Hereditary nephropathies are both clinically and genetically heterogeneous disorders. In some patients the phenotype resembles a speci ﬁc disease, but they do not carry the established genotype (phenocopy). Exomesequencing has been successfully employed in various hereditary kidney disorders. This study shows the spectrum and frequency of phenocopies identi ﬁed by exome sequen  cing in a cohort encompassing monogenic inherited kidney disorders. Materials and Methods: 174 index patients with a pre  sumed hereditary kidney disease were recruited for exome sequencing and categorized in 7 disease groups according to their clinical presentation ( Table 1 ). Variants were rated as per ACMG criteria. “Likely pathogenic ”and“pathogenic ” variants led to the designation “solved case ”. Results: In 52/174 (30%), a genetic diagnosis could be made, in 10/52 (19%), a phenocopy could be identi ﬁed (6% of total cohort, see table 1). 5 phenocopies were Alport syndrome presenting clinically as FSGS/SRNS or viceversa. See Table 2 for the complete spectrum of phenocopies. Conclusion: Phenocopies where found in every 5th solved case. A comprehensive picture of phenocopies is drawn illustrating the huge spectrum of clinical presenta  tions of hereditary nephropathies and highlighting thatexome sequencing is an appropriate diagnostic tool to account for this heterogeneity.

Themain reason is a defective glomerular ﬁltration barrier allowing the passage of serum proteins, including albumin, into the urine. Largely overlooked, a failure of reabsorbingtheﬁltered proteins in the proximal tubular segment can also lead to a mild tubular proteinuria, but it is unclear if it is harmful for the kidney. Here, we combine targeted andexome sequencing to explore the contribution of tubular genes to chronic subnephrotic proteinuria (0,5 3 g/24h). Altogether, we identi ﬁed 24 patients with recessive mutations in the tubular uptake receptor cubilin ( CUBN) . Meta analyzing our in house genetic database, we further identify a signi ﬁcant association between loss of function CUBN mutations and proteinuric conditions. The tubular proteinuria in the CUBN patients was atypical, lacking important tubular proteinuria markers and consisting ofmore than 50% albumin. Importantly, the renal function was normal, even in old patients, suggesting that the proteinuria is benign. All identi ﬁed mutations localize to the C terminal half of the protein, which is in contrast to the known N terminal Imerslund Gräsbeck mutations for CUBN featured by Vitamin B12 malabsorption in addition to the proteinuria. Some mutations have an allele frequency of 0.5% suggesting that this kind of proteinuria is not uncommon. This is supported by the gnomAD databaseshowing a high prevalence of damaging CUBN variants, mostly localizing to the C terminal half. In summary, we identify C terminal CUBN mutations as a common but benign cause of chronic proteinuria. M. Bedin: None. O. Boyer: None. A. Servais: None. L. Villoing Gaudé: None. O. Gribouval: None.

Genome wide association studies (GWAS) liver iron, compared to circulating iron traits,permit detection of liver speci ﬁc susceptibility loci. We performed the ﬁrst GWAS of MRI determined liver iron in 8,289 individuals in UK Biobank and validated ourresults in 1,513 individuals from DIRECT. Liver iron was calculated from MRI data using LiverMultiScanTM. We used GEMMA, which corrects for relatedness and popula tion structure, and adjusted our model for age, sex, BMI and genotyping array. We identi ﬁed three independent genetic variants (rs1800562 & rs1799945 in HFE, rs855791 in TMPRSS6) associated with liver iron (P < 5x10 8). Both HFE and TMPRSS6 are involved in hepcidin production, the keyhormone responsible for iron balance in the body. We estimated the heritability of liver iron to be 7.39%. The most genetically correlated traits in LD score regressionanalysis were transferrin (rG ,−0.78) and ferritin (rG , 1.24) with nominal signi ﬁcant correlation. In our Mendelian randomisation analysis, we found some evidence that highercentral obesity, measured as waist to hip ratio, is casually associated with higher liver iron content (IVW P ,0.003). Phenome wide association analysis demonstrates sharedaetiology of elevated liver iron with high blood pressure, liver cirrhosis, extrahepatic malignancies, neuropsychiatric, endocrine and rheumatological conditions, and an inverseassociation with anaemias, lipidaemias and ischaemic heart disease. Our study provides genetic evidence that mechanisms underlying excess liver iron are likely systemic not organ speciﬁc. Our data provides new insights into the biology of liver iron and its link to metabolic and non metabolic dis ease outcomes.H.R. Wilman: None. C.A. Parisinos: None. N. Ata  baki pasdar: None. M.

Materials and Methods: To elucidate the pathogenetics of human lung development, using WGS, ES, SNP andCGH arrays, Sanger sequencing, and qPCR, we studied samples obtained from deceased individuals with clinically and histopathologically diagnosed interstitial neonatal lungdisorders: acinar dysplasia (n ,14), congenital alveolar dysplasia (n ,2), and other lethal lung hypoplasias (n , 10). Seventeen family members and control individualswith 17q23.1q23.2 (n ,13), 5p12 (n ,3), or an intragenic TBX4 (n,1) deletion but without a developmental lung disease were also investigated. Results: We identi ﬁed rare heterozygous copy number variant deletions or single nucleotide variants (SNVs) involving TBX4 (n,8 and n ,2, respectively) or FGF10 (n,2 and n ,2, respectively) in 16/26 (61%) affected individuals. In addition to TBX4 , the overlapping ~2 Mb recurrent and nonrecurrent deletions at 17q23.1q23.2 iden tiﬁed in seven individuals with lung hypoplasia also remove a lung speci ﬁc enhancer region. Individuals with coding variants involving either TBX4 orFGF10 also harbored at least one non coding SNV in the predicted lung speci ﬁc enhancer region, which was absent in 13 control individuals with the overlapping deletions but without any structurallung anomalies. Conclusion: The occurrence of rare coding variants involving TBX4 orFGF10 with the putative hypomorphic non coding SNVs implies a complex compound inheritance of these pulmonary hypoplasias. Moreover, they support the importance of TBX4 FGF10 FGFR2 epithelial mesenchymal signaling in human lung organogenesis, and help to explain the histopathological continuum observed in these rare lethal developmental disorders of the lung (NIH R01HL137203).J.A.

Genome sequencing has been shown to signi ﬁcantly increase diagnostic yield and is therefore set to have a profound impact for children and young people with rare diseases. Although the current legal perspective is that children below a jurisdiction speciﬁed age are unable to provide informed consent, young people, particularly adolescents, do frequently have the capacity to be actively involved in discussions about theirhealth. We sought to characterise the attitudes of young people towards this technology by conducting 27 interviews with 11 –18 year olds (excluding those with learning difﬁculties) taking part in the 100,000 Genomes Project.Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1149Results: Around two thirds of motivations cited by young people related to the potential bene ﬁts to themselves, including getting a diagnosis, “pinpointing ”the gene causing the condition, understanding if the condition was inherited and might be passed on to future children, guiding treatment choices, ending further investigations and puttingan end to the ongoing question of “why”. Young people don’t appear to be concerned about data security or com  panies having access to data, although some had concernsthe results might reveal something “life threatening ”and some were worried they would be “disappointed ”if they did not get a result. Most were realistic that a result fromgenome sequencing would not necessarily lead to their condition being cured. Conclusion: Young people are capable of grasping the potential bene ﬁts and limitations of genome sequencing and where possible should be actively engaged in the decision  making process. C.

To address this,semi structured interviews were conducted with 31 clinical geneticists and genetic counsellors from 30 institutions across Europe, Australia and Canada to explore theirexperiences with returning results from GS, including positive and negative results, unsolicited ﬁndings (UF), and variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VUS), to patients. GHPs remarked that patients ’reactions to receiving positive results varied; some patients are relieved or appreciative at the identi ﬁcation of a genetic cause, whilst others express negative emotions, including frustration that ﬁnding an answer does not lead to a treatment. Participants discussed the importance of managing expectations in pre test counselling sessions to minimise disappointment. GHPs felt that even though some patients/families experiencedmild distress, they generally cope quite well with receiving UF and appreciate receiving information about their increased risk. While many participants felt that most patients generally understand what a VUS means, a pro  portion of GHPs found VUS quite dif ﬁcult to convey to patients and had concerns for their level of understanding. Aconsiderable proportion of participants mentioned chal  lenges associated with non genetic HPs misinterpreting the signiﬁcance of VUS and conveying this information to patients. This could have negative implications for patients and impacts on their own practice. These results help us understand the challenges GHPs are experiencing in returning results from GS to patients, which has important implications for clinicians ’training. D.F. Vears: None. K.

However, littleis known about the experience that parents of critically unwell infants and children have during the testing process and beyond. Methods: Participants were recruited as part of the Australian Genomics Acute Care study, a national rapid1150genomic diagnosis program for infants and children admitted to intensive care with suspected genetic condi  tions. Pre  and post test counselling was provided by genetic health professionals. Over 95% of parents offered testing gave consent. Results were available within ﬁve days of sample receipt. Parents were surveyed >12 weeksafter results return. We explored parental experiences with consent processes, perceived impact of testing on child health, relationships and reproductive decisions. Thisquestionnaire included the Decision Regret, Short Form Genetic Counselling Outcomes and PedsQL Family Impact Module scales. Results: From 21 respondents in the ﬁrst six months (RR,54%), most felt they received enough information during pre test (n ,21, 100%) and post test (n ,18, 86%) counselling. No respondents reported decisional regret regarding testing. Perceptions varied about the bene ﬁts of rapid genomic sequencing for the child. The majority ofrespondents (n ,13, 62%) were extremely concerned about the condition occurring in future children, regardless of their actual or self perceived recurrence risk. Eight respondents(38%) reported the test impacted their reproductive plans.

The French FIND study has been set up to determine the short and longer term bene ﬁts and risks according to the patients/families of returning SFs from diagnostic ES. Materials and Methods: A mixed methodology imple  mented in three centers of expertise. This study offered to 330 patients with an undiagnosed developmental disorder the search for actionable a list of SFs from ES: SF1) pre disposition to late onset diseases (122 genes); SF2) carrier status of recessive or X linked diseases that could impact reproductive projects (114 genes); SF3) pharmacogenomicvariants that could impact medical treatment (3 genes). Results: Quantitative data show that 21% of patients did not wish to access SFs, citing anxiety, timing, or the studyconstraints. 94% wished to access all SFs; 2% refused SF1, 1.6% SF2 and 3% SF3. Semi directive interviews were scheduled with 15 patients whose SF results were positive,immediately after the results were returned. None of the patients expressed regrets regarding access to the SFs. Patients found it dif ﬁcult to anticipate the psychological consequences of announcing an elevated risk of disease (SF1). Heterozygous carrier patients found it dif ﬁcult to imagine the effects of sharing their results with theirfamilies (SF2). As for SF3, the medical bene ﬁts were not yet clear. Conclusion: Literature showed that patients/families massively desire to know all SFs in hypothetical situations,Abstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1151contrasting with a 21% of refusal and with psychological effects in a real life context.

" Variant data sharing by clinical laboratories throughpublic databases: consent, privacy and further contact for research policies",C22.5,M. Shabani,"1, S. Dyke2, L. Marelli1, P. Borry1","1KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,2McGill, Montreal, QC, Canada Access to detailed variant data is key to inform and verify the interpretation of genomic data. Clinical laboratories can play a signi ﬁcant role in sharing patients ’data through public variant databases. In order to facilitate data sharing,various public databases such as ClinVar (in collaboration with ClinGen) and DECIPHER have been established, which accept data submission from laboratories, clinicians,researchers and patients. Despite clear bene ﬁts to sharing, questions may arise about the adequate form of consent to be obtained from patients when sharing data from theirclinical tests through public databases. In particular, how much information should be communicated to the patients regarding data sharing? Should patients have the option toopt out? Under what conditions could laboratories share more detailed information (e.g. supporting individual level data) about the patients than simply the aggregate variant level classi ﬁcations? In order to address these questions, we conducted a content analysis of the relevant consent policies of the major public databases and of the consent forms ofclinical laboratories who share variant data.

The aim is noble: to increase data sharing which facilitates reproducibility and new discoveries.However, data deposit requirements may con ﬂict with ethical and legal obligations, including the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The main obstacles relate toi) loss of control over further processing; ii) realization of rights and obligations; iii) national derogations; iv) jurisdictional issues; and v) accountability. These ethicaland legal challenges of depositing individual level genetic data in research repositories such as dbGaP will be described and illustrated with practical real life examplesfrom some of Europe ’s largest biobanks. The framework of research data deposition, if not adapted, could lead to the unwanted consequence of researchers complying with thelaw facing dif ﬁculties publishing their work, irrespective of its scienti ﬁc qualities. Such de facto inequities in the1152scienti ﬁc evaluation process, may endanger scienti ﬁc excellence and evidence based medicine. In addition to bringing current repositories in compliance, further poten  tial solutions to optimize responsible data sharing will be described, including i) dynamic consent, ii) data tagging, and iii) federated data sharing.

Aradhya Invitae, San Francisco, CA, United States Analysis of mosaic variants in hereditary diseases can provide insight into analytic requirements for detecting such variants and their clinical implications. We validated a next generation sequencing method with high depth of coverage to detect mosaic single nucleotide variants (SNVs), indels, and copy number variants (CNVs) using Genome in a Bottle (GiaB) sample dilution series. In a clinical cohort of 421,220 individuals, we identi ﬁed 1,799 mosaic SNVs and small indels and 84 mosaic CNVs across 245 genes,corresponding to 0.6% of reported variants. This represents an incidence of 0.9% among individuals who had at least one reported variant. Approximately 40% of mosaicvariants were classi ﬁed as likely or de ﬁnitively pathogenic and these contributed to 1.1% of de ﬁnitive diagnoses in this cohort. Nearly 80% of clinically signi ﬁcant mosaic variants were associated with autosomal dominant disorders. There were nearly twice as many cancer related genes with mosaicvariants relative to those associated with pediatric, neuro  logical, or cardiovascular disorders. Later onset diseases were associated with lower levels of mosaicism in affected individuals compared to diseases with early onset (p , 0.002; Wilcoxon signed rank). In relation to hereditary cancer, individuals with mosaic variants were considerablyolder than those without mosaic variants (p ,6.5 X 10 −48; Student ’s t test). Finally, among individuals who had a disease with pathognomonic features, those with mosaicvariants showed non classical phenotypes compared to those with non mosaic variants (p ,0.0009; Fisher ’s exact test). These exhaustive analyses provide insight intomosaicism in Mendelian disease genes and inform expecta  tions for diagnostic testing, clinical correlations, and recurrence risk. D.

UPD can cause genetic disorders by disrupting imprinting or homozygosingheterozygous disease alleles. We present data on chromosomal scale UPD detection using whole genome sequence (WGS) data from parent child pairs in the RareDisease programme of the UK ’s 100,000 Genomes Project. Routine quality control ﬂags duos with atypical identity by descent sharing patterns or elevated Mendelian inconsis tency rates; signatures typical of UPD are reviewed to conﬁrm and characterise the event. We have currently identi ﬁed 42 UPD events (27 maternal, 14 paternal) at a rate of 0.34%. Both parents were sequenced for 37 events. Thirty eight involved wholeAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1153chromosomes while four were partial. Only four hetero  disomy events were detected, whereas isodisomy and mixed iso and heterodisomy occurred at similar frequencies. For 38 families UPD was detected in the only affected family member so could plausibly be the cause of the rare disorder. Thirteen events occurred on ﬁve chromosome/parent com  binations where UPD can cause imprinting disorders, enabling potential diagnoses invisible to small variant pipelines. Clinical interpretation has been completed for 9/42 families. Four events were con ﬁrmed from four attempts and three cases reported as solved. All three cases resultedfrom UPD homozygosing the disease allele (n ,2) or dis  rupting imprinting (n ,1). Our work shows that UPD can be detected using WGS from trios or duos where the under transmitting parent is sequenced.

However, next generation sequencing (NGS) techniques are providing useful andunprecedented tools that can be applied to reveal unex  plored mechanisms. We combine single cell DNA sequen  cing and high coverage (250X whole genome) DNAsequencing in three normal individuals to identify somatic single nucleotide variants (sSNVs) that arose during embryogenesis, and use them as forensic barcodes for celllineage tracing in postmortem adult humans. Analysis of 1,000 single neurons and non neuronal cells isolated from asingle individual generates a dense lineage tree that allows us to obtain the clonal structure of developmental variants for this individual. Variant deep targeted sequencing on bulk DNA extracted from serial coronal sections of an entire human cerebral hemisphere reveals gradual, clonal segrega  tion across the cortex with a persistent polyclonal end result,while analysis of 22 other organs and tissues reveals a mosaic architecture of organs deriving from distinct germ layers. Inferring the developmental cell stages of variantoccurrence discloses key aspects of human embryogenesis and numbers of effective progenitor cells at different steps such as blastocyst formation and gastrulation. We show thatsSNVs permit cell lineage maps of any human at postmortem, of density and breadth limited only by sequencing depth, with clonal analyses directly revealingkey aspects of human embryonic development.

We generated WGS data from freshly isolated single cells clonally expanded in vitro (N ,69) and created a genetic atlas of somatic mutations in healthy human tissues (kidney, skin,subcutaneous fat and visceral fat). Multi organ biopsies from the same individual allowed well controlled inspection of tissue speci ﬁc differences, while donors of two age groups (30s and 60s) provided data on the effects of aging. This analysis, complemented with a meta analysis of somatic mutations from healthy (N ,161) and tissue  matched cancer genomes (N ,192), showed a stereotyped mutational pattern across multiple cell types. Conversely,1154cells derived from the kidney tubules grouped into two separate populations showing either the stereotyped or a unique mutation pattern with high mutation burden, high signatures SBS5 and SBS40 and enrichment of mutations in transcribed genes. These ﬁndings challenged the concept of a tissue speci ﬁc mutation accumulation and instead sup  ported the idea that speci ﬁc mutagenic processes shape the genome of distinct cell types. A number of cells, including fat, skeletal muscle, kidney and blood progenitors, showedno signs of exposure to external mutagens, but a common “basal mutagenesis ”that we have characterised. The DNA  repair machinery counteracted the basal mutagenesis butwas less ef ﬁcient with aging and continuous mutagen exposure. Complete understanding of the mutagenic forces active in healthy cells will be important for the preventionof mutations and consequent cancer development.

These post  zygotic events are challenging for conventional diagnostic tools, as they concern only a fraction of cells often con ﬁned to the affected tissue. Thus, genetic basis of MCD still remained poorly understood. Materials and Methods: The M.U.S.T.A.R.D. cohort gathers DNA from skin biopsies of patients with develop  ment anomalies including MCD and their parents, pheno typed at the reference center for rare diseases MAGEC (Dijon), and referred to either targeted ultra deep sequen  cing (60,000X) of candidate genes, or trio exome sequen cing (ES) at 200X. Data are analysed with a tailored pipeline, allowing detection of low rate nucleotidic varia  tions or chromosomal events (mosaic CNV, mosaic uni parental disomy (UPD)). Results: From 2014 to 2019, 122 patients were included. ES was performed for 42, with identi ﬁcation of mosaic SNV in 5 candidate genes in 10 patients, and mosaic CNV (monosomy/trisomy/tetrasomy/triploidy) or UPD in 9. Based on the recognisable clinical presentations thereforeidenti ﬁed, we selected 40 patients for targeted sequencing of at least one candidate gene, with a con ﬁrmed mosaic SNV in 14, and a global diagnostic yield of 40%. Conclusion: This work highlights the importance of a versatile bioinformatic approach combined to a clinical expertise, to decipher the chromosomal and molecularaetiologies of developmental anomalies with MCD. It also pinpoints common pathogenesis pathways, which will help enhancing our understanding of MCD, and may ultimatelyresult in novel therapeutic opportunities. A. Sorlin: None. V. Carmignac: None.

The phenotype include arteriosclerosis, loss of vascular smooth muscle cells, calciﬁcation and increased arterial stiffness. A similar vascular phenotype is also observed in children with thepremature aging disease Hutchinson Gilford progeria syn  drome (HGPS). HGPS is caused by a single nucleotide mutation in the LMNA gene, c.1824C>T. This mutation leads to increased production of a truncated protein, progerin, and dysregulation of cell functions. Progerin has been found at low levels in skin and arteries from non progeroid individuals, but the underlaying mechanism is unknown. Materials and Methods: Here we analyzed the presence of progerin in epigastric arteries obtained from CKD stage 5 patients (GFR <15 ml/min) and controls, and its contribu  tion to premature vascular aging. Somatic mutation analysisincluded DNA extracted from progerin stained sections from CKD arteries (n ,27), using digital droplet PCR. Results: Immuno ﬂuorescence showed progerin positive cells in 70% of the arteries (46±2 yrs, n ,40). Progerin was detected in up to 7.4% of cells. The number of progerin positive cells correlated with number of years with thedisease ( P,0.03, r ,0.34). The arteries with higher fre  quency of progerin had an increased activation of DNA repair ( P,0.005, r ,0.63). Somatic mutation analysis identi ﬁed the LMNA c.1824C>T mutation in blood and arteries. Conclusion: Our results suggest that rare somatic muta  tions may become a risk when increased tissue regeneration is induced, and provide novel mechanistic insight to the underlying phenotype of premature vascular aging.

 A transcriptome wide Mendelian randomization study to uncover tissue dependent regulatory mechanismsacross the human phenome,C25.1,"T. G. Richardson, G. Hemani, T. R. Gaunt, C. L. Relton,",G. Davey Smith,"MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Bristol, United KingdomBackground: Developing insight into tissue speci ﬁc tran  scriptional mechanisms can help improve our understanding of how genetic variants exert their effects on complex traits and disease. By applying the principles of Mendelian randomization, we have undertaken a systematic analysis to evaluate transcriptome wide associations between geneexpression and 395 complex traits across 48 different tissue types. Results: Overall, we identi ﬁed 59,810 gene trait asso  ciations in at least 1 tissue type based on multiple testing and genetic colocalization corrections. These results indi  cate that genetic effects expressed more ubiquitously acrossdifferent tissues are more likely to be pleiotropic (i.e. associated with multiple diverse phenotypes). We have also explored these results in detail with a series of analyses thathighlight tissue dependent effects. For instance, TPO, NR3C2 andSPATA13 expression was only associated with thyroid disease in thyroid tissue, whereas FBN2 was asso  ciated with both cardiovascular and lung function traits but only when analysed in heart and lung tissue respectively. We also demonstrate that phenome wide investigations of our results can be valuable for drug validation purposes. Finally, we have evaluated the tissue dependency of ﬁnd  ings from genome wide association studies (GWAS). Thissuggested that integrating tissue speci ﬁc data with GWAS results can help elucidate the causal genes and tissues responsible for effects, as well uncover putative novelﬁndings. Conclusion: The atlas of tissue dependent associations we have constructed should prove extremely insightful tofuture studies investigating the genetic determinants of complex disease.

Since many in ﬂammatory markers are both correlated and associated with multiple diseases, we aimed to leverage correlated biomarkers in discovery of disease related genetic variants. We used data from the population based FINRISK Study of up to 26,705 Finns and imputed genotypes to 13M var  iants. We analyzed 66 cardiovascular or immunologicrelevant traits, including anthropometric and biomarkers such as blood lipids and in ﬂammatory markers. Out of the 66 traits, hierarchical clustering identi ﬁed one highly cor  related cluster, comprised of 12 in ﬂammatory markers   mainly interleukins and growth factors. We then performed multivariate GWAS on this cluster using metaCCA, asummary statistic based multivariate method applying Canonical Correlation Analysis. Using multivariate method, we observed 89 genome wide signiﬁcant loci, a substantial increase over the full set of 28 that were genome wide signi ﬁcant in one or more of the 12 traits. To illustrate, protective variant for pulmonaryembolism rs4656185 in F5 was genome wide signi ﬁcant only using multivariate method (multivariate p value , 7.9e 20, smallest univariate p value ,9.9e 4). In addition, out of 89 genome wide signi ﬁcant loci 13 were reported to associate with at least one of the traits in the cluster, 7 with other cytokines or leukocyte counts and 19 with at least onedisease endpoint (p < 1e 5) in GWAS catalog, UKBB or FinnGen. In conclusion, our study shows how multivariate method provides a remarkable boost in power for locusdiscovery, but also emphasizes the advantage of large biobank based phenome wide screening. S.E.

For this purpose we mapped population  based variation from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) and disease causing mutations from the HumanGene Mutation Database (HGMD) onto 5,250 Pfam protein domain families. We then aggregated population based and disease causing variants across 30,853 homologous proteindomains into 2,750 meta domains. Weﬁnd that genetic tolerance is consistent across 97% of domain homologues (p < 0.05, Bonferroni corrected), andthat patterns of genetic tolerance faithfully mimic patterns of evolutionary conservation (Pearson 0.97, p value < 1e  308). Interestingly, we ﬁnd that 2,201 of the aggregated domain positions are not evolutionary conserved, but highly intolerant to population based variation and contain at least one disease causing missense variant. An informativeexample concerns domain positions 17 and 21 in the “EGF  like domain ”(PF00008). These positions are not conserved but are depleted of population based variation in 60 genesand additionally cause disease in the NOTCH3 ,JAG1 , and CRB2 genes. Furthermore, we ﬁnd that the presence of disease causing missense variants at aggregated homo logous domain positions is often paired with the absence of population variation and vice versa . We realized that this information could be of great bene ﬁt to the genetic community and therefore developed Meta  Dome; a fast and easy to use web server that visualizes meta domain information and gene wide pro ﬁles of genetic tolerance.

" reg2gene: predicting enhancer gene associations using ensemble learning approachesAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1157I. Patarcic, V. Franke, A. Akalin MDC BIMSB, Berlin, GermanyModelling procedures such as JEME (Cao et al. 2017), FOCS (Hait et al. 2018), GeneHancer (Fishillevich et al.2017), and EnhancerAtlas(Gao et al. 2016) were recently used to associate regulatory regions and their target genes. These methods vary tremendously in the de ﬁnition of enhancer regions, prioritization of data sources, modelling approaches, selection of validation or benchmark datasets, and the ﬁnal enhancer promoter predictions. We set off to develop a systematic, integrative and accessible approach to associate regulatory regions with their target genes while overcoming inherited problems of previous methods. Wecombined multiple de ﬁnitions of enhancers, proposed by aforementioned publications and our own de ﬁnition, to deﬁned 286,723 enhancer regions in the human genome. We developed reg2gene R package, which we used to model gene expression and enhancer activity. Across cell type signals from multiple Roadmap datasets were modelledusing ﬁve different algorithms, and hierarchically majority voted. We obtained ﬁnal reg2gene predictions by majority voting reg2gene models and predictions from the afore mentioned publications. We predicted 89,820 “elite”EP associations (con ﬁrmed by minimum 3 publications), whereas 435,295 EP asso ciations were con ﬁrmed by at least 2 publications. To assess the performance of reg2gene approach, we created a set of positive and negative enhancer gene associations combin ing information from experiments (Gasperini et al. 2019) and the Roadmap dataset. reg2gen achieved better statistics (accuracy, PPV, speci ﬁcity) than the previously published methods.

This led to the identi ﬁcation of phenotypically similar sib pairs from which their common facial traits were derived, each representing global or local aspects of facialmorphology that were informative for accurately matching the siblings. Subsequently, these traits (N ,1592) were projected onto two independent European samples (N1 , 4680, N2 ,3566) and genome wide meta analyses were conducted. Results: Consistent with the literature on facial herit  ability, the sibling derived traits mainly captured variations involving the full face in addition to the nasal and orbital regions. We identi ﬁed 11,661 single nucleotide poly  morphisms (SNPs) at 310 separate loci that reached genome wide signi ﬁcance (P < 5×10 −8), inﬂuencing both global aspects of the face as well as local (e.g. the tip of thenose) aspects only. The majority of the associated segments represented variations in the nose. Conclusion: We here report a data driven approach to facial phenotyping starting from facial similarities observed between siblings. Complex shape transformations were converted into simple univariate descriptions of facial shapethrough vector projections, allowing for the use of standard meta analysis techniques in testing for genotype phenotype associations. Signi ﬁcant associations were found among 310 loci, further enhancing our understanding of the genetic basis of human facial shape.1158H. Hoskens: None. K. Indencleef: None. J. Li: None. J. D.

However, many of Mendelian syndromes are still not represented byexisting NGP tools as their disease causing gene has not been identi ﬁed yet. We therefore propose a facial gestalt matching approach to quantify the similarity among patientsand further explore the unknown genotype phenotype relationship. Materials and Methods: We compiled a dataset con  sisting of 679 patients with 105 different monogenic dis  orders. For each individual a frontal photo and the disease  causing mutation were available. We used additional net work architectures such as FaceNet to extract facial embeddings and constructed a Clinical Face Phenotype Space (CFPS) that was corrected for the confoundingeffects of age and ethnicity. Results: Given only the phenotypes as input we could visualize molecular interactions of genes by their closeproximity in the CFPS. A prominent cluster was formed e.g. byBRAF ,PTPN11 and other genes of the MAPKinase pathway that result in disorders such as Noonan or LEO PARD syndrome and which are considered similar. Beyond this proof of concept, we were able to match two unrelated patients with a novel progeria like facial phenotype withunknown molecular cause. They were also in close proxi  mity to cases with mutations in LMNA and PYCR1 and exome sequencing identi ﬁed in these patients the same de novo mutation in a novel disease gene that can also be assigned to nuclear envelopathies.

Whole exome sequencing (WES) performed on peripheral blood derived DNA of the affected siblings revealed two novel heterozygous variants, p.K537N (paternal) and p.G964R (maternal) in LIG3, a DNA ligaseinvolved in nuclear and mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) maintenance. lig3 ablation in zebra ﬁsh reproduced brain alterations and impaired gut transit, reminiscent of thehuman condition. Such phenotype was rescued with wild  type LIG3 mRNA, but not with mRNA encoding the two variants, indicating a loss of function mechanism. The p.K537N variant, mapping to the last base pair before the donor splice site, induced the skipping of the corresponding exon, in patient derived skin ﬁbroblasts. The p.G964R variant, residing in a C terminal binding site for XRCC1, impaired LIG3/XRCC1 binding.

The mitochondrial RNA polymerase (POLRMT) is the sole RNA polymerase in mitochondria and isresponsible for mtDNA transcription. Patients and Methods: Using whole exome sequencing, we identi ﬁed novel recessive and dominant POLRMT var  iants in ﬁve individuals presenting with a variety of clinical problems, ranging from global developmental delay, hypotonia and growth defects in childhood to late onsetprogressive external ophthalmoplegia (PEO). Where investigated, these defects were accompanied by either a mosaic cytochrome coxidase de ﬁciency in skeletal muscle and/or multiple respiratory chain enzyme de ﬁciencies. Mitochondrial mRNA and OXPHOS protein levels were assessed in mutant POLRMT ﬁbroblasts. In addition, we studied recombinant mutant POLRMT proteins to deter  mine the effect of POLRMT variants on mitochondrial transcriptional activity in vitro. Results: Functional characterisation of patient ﬁbroblasts revealed a defect in mitochondrial mRNA synthesis, although no mtDNA deletions or copy number abnormal ities were identi ﬁed. Mild decreases in the levels of both OXPHOS subunits and fully assembled complexes were observed in vivo, whilst functional in vitro characterisationof the investigated recombinant POLRMT variants revealed that patient mutations exhibited variable, but deleterious effects on mitochondrial transcription. Conclusion: Our results demonstrate that pathogenic variants in the POLRMT gene can cause a spectrum of clinical phenotypes ranging from childhood onset devel opmental delay to late onset PEO and emphasise the importance of defective mitochondrial transcription as a disease mechanism.

Mutations in nuclear genes encoding factors involved in mitochondrial translationresult in isolated or multiple OXPHOS de ﬁciencies and mitochondrial disease. Here, we report the identi ﬁcation of disease causing variants in the MRPS28 gene, encoding the small mitoribosomal subunit (mtSSU) protein bS1m in a patient with intrauterine grow th retardation, craniofacial dysmorphism and developmental delay. Whole exomesequencing helped identify a seemingly homozygous missense variant NM_014018.2:c.356A>G, p. (Lys119Arg) which affected a highly conserved lysineresidue. The variant was present in the mother in a heterozygous state, but not in the father who likely carried a large deletion spanning exon 2 and parts of introns 1 and2 that could account for the apparent homozygosity of the patient. PCR ampli ﬁcation and Sanger sequencing of MRPS28 cDNA from patient ﬁbroblasts revealed the presence of a truncated MRPS28 transcript, which lacked exon 2. Molecular and biochemical characterization of patient ﬁbroblasts revealed a decrease in the abundance of the bS1m protein, decreased abundance of assembled mtSSU and inhibited mitochond rial translation. Conse  quently, OXPHOS biogenesis and cellular respirationwere compromised in these cells. Expression of wild type MRPS28 restored mitoribosomal as sembly, mitochondrial translation and OXPHOS biogenesis, thereby demonstrat ing the deleterious nature of the identi ﬁedMRPS28 variants. Thus, MRPS28 joins the increasing number ofnuclear genes encoding mitorib osomal struct ural proteins linked to mitochondrial disease. J. Pulman: None. B. Ruzzenente: None. L. Bianchi: None. M.

 Brain on a chip a neurophysiological model of MELAS disease and comorbid psychopathology,C26.4,T. Kozicz,"1, T. Klein Gunnewiek2, D. Cassiman3,","T. Nelson1, R. Rodenburg2, E. Perales Clemente1, E. Morava1, N. Nadif Kasri2 1Mayo Clinic, Rochester, MN, United States,2Radboudumc, Nijmegen, Netherlands,3UZ Leuven, Leuven, Belgium Mitochondrial dysfunction is increasingly recognized in the ethology of psychiatric disorders. More than half of individuals with mitochondrial encephalomyopathy, lactic acidosis and stroke like episodes (MELAS), who carry thepathogenic variant m.3243A>G in their mtDNA, have depression as a comorbidity. Mechanistic insights into mitochondrial dysfunction in psychiatric diseases arelargely elusive. Here, we reprogramed skin ﬁbroblasts from MELAS patients with comorbid depression into induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). These cells exhibitedisogenic nuclear DNA but different levels of mtDNA heteroplasmy ( i.e.:0 and >80%) in m.3243A>G mutation. Next, we differentiated iPS cells into excitatory corticalneurons (iNeurons). We found that high levels of m.3243A>G heteroplasmy (>80%) resulted in mitochon  drial dysfunction, accompanied by reduced span andcomplexity of the dendritic arbors, as well as a reduction in axonal mitochondria. Furthermore, we found fewer excitatory synapses and accordingly a lower frequency ofspontaneous postsynaptic currents. Neuronal network recordings from microelectrode arrays showed less activity in general, as well as a decrease in synchronous networkbursts. We now provide conceptual advance on how impaired neuron energy metabolism disrupts synaptic structure and function, dendritic complexity, as well asnetwork activity and synchronicity. These speci ﬁc neuronal features are impaired to various degrees in psychiatric diseases as well. Overall, our results show that iNeurons arean effective disease model for improving our understanding of the role of mitochondrial dysfunction in the aetiology of psychopathology. iNeurons could also serve as screeningplatforms for novel genetic and/or pharmacological ther  apeutic discoveries.

Hinduja National Hospital & MRC, Mumbai, India,5Department of Pediatric Imaging, Tokyo Metropolitan Children ’s Medical Center, Fuchu, Japan, 6Centre of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp & University Hospital Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium Spondyloepimetaphyseal dysplasias (SEMD) are a group of genetically heterogeneous skeletal disorders characterizedby abnormal vertebral bodies and epimetaphyseal abnorm  alities. We investigated two families with a new SEMD type with one proband each. They showed mild facial dysmorph ism,ﬂat vertebral bodies (platyspondyly), large epiphyses, metaphyseal dysplasia, and hallux valgus as common clinical features. By trio exome sequencing, the homo zygous missense variant c.797G>A p.(Cys266Tyr) in PISD was found in both affected individuals. PISD encodes phosphatidylserine decarboxylase that is localized in theinner mitochondrial membrane and catalyzes the decarbox  ylation of phosphatidylserine to phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) in mammalian cells. PE occurs at high abundance inthe mitochondrial membranes, and structural properties of this phospholipid play an important role for various mitochondrial functions. To characterize the functionaleffects of the PISD missense variant we used ﬁbroblasts derived from one patient and healthy individuals. Western blot analysis revealed no difference in PISD protein amountin patient  and control derived ﬁbroblasts. In contrast to the control ﬁbroblasts, patient cells showed fragmented mito  chondrial morphology. Treatment of patient ﬁbroblasts with MG 132 or staurosporine to induce oxidative stress followed by the activation of the intrinsic apoptosis pathway showed signi ﬁcantly decreased cell viability with increased caspase 3 and −7 activation. Remarkably,ethanolamine supplementation largely restored cell viability and enhanced apoptosis in MG 132 stressed patient cells. Our data demonstrate that the bi allelic hypomorphic PISD variant p.(Cys266Tyr) is associated with a novel SEMD form, which may be treatable with PE or ethanolamine administration.

Pathogenic mutations in POLG/Twinkle impair mtDNA replication and cause mitochondrial dysfunctionleading to human infantile or late onset phenotypes. Materials and Methods: We analyzed by whole exome sequencing ﬁve families with an optic atrophy spectrum disorder, including retinal dystrophy and kidney insuf ﬁ  ciency, associated with mtDNA depletion. Functional experiments evaluating effects of potentially pathogenicvariants on protein amount and multimerization, mtDNA replication and cellular bioenergetics were performed in vitro and/or in patients ’ﬁbroblasts. Optic nerve size was measured in zebra ﬁsh after knock down and wildtype or mutant overexpression. Results: We identi ﬁed four heterozygous and one homozygous missense mutations in the SSBP1 gene. They affect mtDNA maintenance and replication, leading to mtDNA depletion, which resulted in a variable phenotypeof impaired oxidative phosphorylation, observed either in ﬁbroblasts or in affected tissues (kidney and skeletal mus  cle). SSBP1 suppression in zebra ﬁsh reduced optic nerve size, a phenotype rescued by wild type protein but not by the SSBP1 mutations, suggesting that all dominant muta  tions induced loss of function, whereas the recessivebehaved as a hypomorph. Conclusion: Mutations in SSBP1 cause defects in mtDNA replication, mitochondrial dysfunction and humandisease. Further investigations will contribute to improve knowledge about mtDNA replication, and enlarge the landscape of phenotypic expression of mitochondrial dis eases in humans.

C27 Developmental disorders 2C27.1 Diagnostic utility of genome wide DNA methylation testing in genetically unsolved patients with suspected hereditary conditions B. sadikovicLondon Health Sciences Centre, Canada, London, ON, Canada Conventional genetic testing of patients with neurodevelop  mental presentations and congenital anomalies (ND/CA),i.e., the analysis of sequence and copy number variants, leaves a substantial proportion of the patients unexplained. Some of these cases have been shown to result from DNAmethylation defects at a single locus ( epi variants ), while others can exhibit syndrome speci ﬁc DNA methylation changes across multiple loci ( epi signatures ). Here, we investigate the clinical diagnostic utility of genome wide DNA methylation analysis of peripheral blood in unre  solved ND/CA patients. We generate a computationalmodel enabling concurrent detection of 14 syndromes using peripheral blood DNA methylation data with full accuracy. We demonstrate the ability of this model to resolve 67patients with uncertain clinical diagnoses, some of whom had VUS ’s in the related genes. We show that the provisional diagnoses can be ruled out in many of thecases, some of whom are shown by our model to have other diseases initially not considered. By applying this model to a cohort of 965 ND/CA patients without a previousdiagnostic assumption and separate assessment of rare epi variants in this cohort, we identify 15 patients with syndromic genetic disorders, 12 patients with imprintingand trinucleotide repeat expansion disorders, as well as 106 patients with rare epi variants, a portion of which involved genes clinically or functionally linked to the patients ’ phenotype. This study demonstrates that genomic DNA methylation analysis can facilitate the molecular diagnosis of unresolved clinical cases, and highlights the potentialvalue of epigenomic testing in the routine clinical assess  ment of patients with ND/CA.

The Center for Undiagnosed Diseases at Stanford(CUD), a clinical site of the NIH funded Undiagnosed Diseases Network, evaluates patients with rare, undiag  nosed diseases in an effort to diagnose patients, improvemechanistic knowledge of diseases, and accelerate bioinfor  matics tool development. Methods: We reviewed the ﬁrst 400 applicants to the CUD to identify phenotypic characteristics, demographics, and prior genetics evaluations. 147 patients were enrolled with both subjective and objective evidence of undiagnoseddisease. Exome sequencing, sequence reanalysis focused on novel variant and gene discovery, and beyond exome approaches including short  and long read genomesequencing, RNAseq, untargeted metabolomics, immu  nomics, and model systems were applied to attempt to ﬁnd a diagnosis for each of these participants. Results: The most common predominantly affected sys  tems of applicants include neurologic, musculoskeletal, and immunologic. Among the 147 enrolled participants to date,114 have had evaluations completed, 34 participants received a con ﬁrmed diagnosis using a variety of clinical, genomic and research approaches. Speci ﬁc evaluations and additional research studies are determined on a case by case bases by CUD clinician scientists due to the diversity of presentation and prior work up of each participant. To date,the CUD has found a strong candidate diagnosis for 10 (9%) patients. Each candidate diagnosis is undergoing fur  ther functional investigation. Conclusions: Together with local and international col  laborators, a multiomic approach to undiagnosed patients has found success in the diagnosis and characterization ofrare diseases.

The diverse histological patterns of hair follicle tumours seen in this syndrome suggest genetic heterogeneity across these tumours. Methods: To investigate this, we comprehensively pro  ﬁled the genomic landscape of 42 benign and malignant tumours across 13 individuals in 4 multigenerationalfamilies with CYLD cutaneous syndrome (CCS; syn. Brooke Spiegler syndrome). Results: We found recurrent mutations in epigenetic modiﬁersDNMT3A and BCOR in 29% of tumours. Inte  grated genomic and methylation pro ﬁling suggest that mutant DNMT3A drives tumourigenesis mechanisticallythrough Wnt/ß catenin pathway signaling. In malignant tumours, epigenetic modi ﬁers CREBBP, KDM6A and EP300 were mutated. Some patients were heterozygous for loss of function mutations in MBD4 , with biallelic muta  tions demonstrated in a poorly differentiated malignant skin tumour with an associated increase in mutational burdenand the accrual of epigenetic modi ﬁers. To obtain insights into mechanisms that cause these mutations, mutational signature analysis was performed, and revealed UV relatedsignatures in sun exposed lesions but not sun protected tumours suggesting that non UV related mechanisms con  tribute towards CCS tumourigenesis. We also demonstratethat cutaneous tumours that metastasize to the lung carry a targetable recurrent driver mutation in AKT, and a UV signature, supporting the origin from the skin.

Girisha1 1Kasturba Medical College, Manipal, Manipal Academy of Higher Education, Manipal, Manipal, India,2Center of Medical Genetics, University of Antwerp and Antwerp University Hospital,, Antwerp, Belgium, Belgium Cartilage hair hypoplasia (CHH), anauxetic dysplasia 1 and anauxetic dysplasia 2 are rare metaphyseal dysplasias caused by biallelic pathogenic variants in RMRP and POP1 , which encode the components of RNAse MRP endoribonuclease complex (RMRP) in ribosomal biogenesis pathway. Nucleolus and neural progenitor protein(NEPRO), encoded by NEPRO (C3ORF17) interacts with multiple protein subunits of RMRP. We report a biallelic pathogenic variant in NEPRO , which could disrupt the normal function of RMRP and cause a similar skeletal dysplasia. We ascertained a 6 year old girl, with skeletal dysplasia resembling CHH. Analysis of parents child trioexomes and effect of the variant on protein structure and stability were performed. Two families with four affected individuals with a skeletal dysplasia and a homozygousmissense variant, c.280C>T (p. Arg94Cys) in NEPRO , were identi ﬁed from literature and their phenotype was critically re evaluated. RMRP andPOP1 in proband did not harbor any causative variant. Trio exome sequencing identi ﬁed a possible homozygous candidate variant, c. 435G>C (p. Leu145Phe) in NEPRO . All the ﬁve affected individuals have short stature, acromelia, skin laxity, joint hypermobi  lity and dislocations. They also have short metacarpals, broad middle phalanges, narrow acetabular angle andmetaphyseal irregularities. Protein modeling and stability prediction showed that the mutant protein has decreased stability. The reported variants are in the same domain ofthe protein. We report the identi ﬁcation and characterization of a new syndrome caused by biallelic variants in NEPRO inﬁve patients with features resembling CHH and thus expand the phenotypic and genotypic spectrum of ribosome biogenesis pathway related skeletal dysplasia.SB/SO/HS/ 005/2014 D.

Independent genome and exome sequen cing, identi ﬁed the same causative variant in ALPK1 inﬁve families*. We present phenotypic and functional studies characterising additional in ﬂammatory, ciliary and centro  somal abnormalities in six affected individuals from one of the families. Materials and Methods: ROSAH syndrome patients heterozygous for ALPK1 , c.710C>T, [p.Thr237Met]), underwent immunological, cerebral MRI, bone marrow and ophthalmic investigations. Centrosomal and primary ciliaryanalyses were conducted in human ﬁbroblasts, ARPE 19 and HeLa cells. HeLa cells were subject to overexpression of mutant and wildtype ALPK1, and ALPK1 knockdown.ALPK1 isoform characterisation was undertaken in human and mouse tissues. Results: Additional clinical features indicated innate immunity dysfunction with marked susceptibility to viral infections, and indication of abnormal in ﬂammatory responses including cerebral manifestations. Primary ciliaryand centrosomal abnormalities in cell culture investigations suggested a possible gain of function disease mechanism. ALPK1 isoform differences were identi ﬁed in human and mouse retina providing additional insight to disease mechanisms. Conclusion: Heterozygous abnormality in ALPK1 leads to the multisystem ROSAH disorder through impact on retinal and other tissues. There are primary cilia and cen  trosomal abnormalities as well as indicators of immunesystem dysfunction, and a likely gain of function disease mechanism. *ALPK1 missense pathogenic variant in ﬁve families leads to ROSAH syndrome, an ocular multisystem auto  somal dominant disorder.

Following exclusion of knowngenes in a multi generation family, we mapped the locus to Xq26.3 –27.2. Analysis of genome sequence data excluded coding variants in all genes in the interval, and revealedsplit reads, indicative of a potential structural variant. Using long range PCR and DNA walking, we identi ﬁed a 57 Kb inter chromosomal insertion of chr9p24.3, within anintergenic palindromic region on chrXq27.1. Structural variants can modulate mechanisms of gene regulation, affect gene dosage, or as a result of position effects,inﬂuence the expression of genes proximal or distal to the breakpoints. We hypothesised that retinal degeneration is caused by dysregulated gene expression, either near thepalindrome, or driven by expression of chr9p24.3 tran  scripts from the X chromosome. To explore the mechanism of disease with the insertion in genomic and cellularcontext, we reprogrammed patient ﬁbroblasts to induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) and differentiated 3D retinal organoids. RNAseq analysis of patient retinal organoids,compared to controls, revealed transcriptional dysregulation at this locus. Further analysis of the downstream effects includes immunostaining to assess retinal organoid mor phology and protein expression. We have subsequently identi ﬁed another family with a different inter chromosomal insertion within the same intergenic palindromic region ofchrX. These studies identify a new genomic mechanism for retinal degeneration, and the utility of patient iPSC derived retinal organoids to investigate dysregulated gene expres sion as the likely cause of disease.

Here we describe the ﬁrst tranche of large scale exome sequence data for 49,960 study participants, revealing approximately 4 million coding variants (ofwhich ~98.4% have frequency <1%). The data includes 231,631 predicted loss of function variants, a >10 fold increase compared to imputed sequence for the sameparticipants. Nearly all genes (>97%) had ≥1 predicted loss of function carrier, and most genes (>69%) had ≥10 loss of function carriers. We illustrate the power of characterizingloss of function variation in this large population through association analyses across 1,741 phenotypes. In addition to replicating a range of established associations, we discovernovel loss of function variants with large effects on disease traits, including PIEZO1 on varicose veins, COL6A1 on corneal resistance, MEPE on bone density, and IQGAP2 andGMPR on blood cell traits. We further demonstrate the value of exome sequencing by surveying the prevalence of1166pathogenic variants of clinical signi ﬁcance in this popula  tion, ﬁnding that 2% of the population has a medically actionable variant. Additionally, we leverage the phenotypic data to characterize the relationship between rare BRCA1 and BRCA2 pathogenic variants and cancer risk. Exomes from the ﬁrst 49,960 participants are now made accessible to the scienti ﬁc community and highlight the promise offered by genomic sequencing in large scale population  based studies. C.

All JBTS  genes encode proteins involved in the structure or functionof the primary cilium, an antenna like organelle essential for signal transduction. A majority of JBTS proteins formAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1167complexes at the ciliary transition zone, which acts as a gatekeeper controlling ciliary protein content. Recently, we identi ﬁedARMC9 , encoding a non transition zone protein, as a new JBTS gene. In this work, we utilize tandem af ﬁnity puriﬁcation and yeast two hybrid screens to ﬁnd protein interactors of ARMC9. We identify a novel ciliary modulecomposed of two known JBTS proteins (ARMC9, CEP104) and two proteins not currently associated with human disorders (TOGARAM1, CCDC66). We ﬁnd variants in TOGARAM1 in individuals with JBTS, and show that variants located in the TOG2 domain disrupt the interaction with ARMC9. We generate CRISPR edited armc9 and togaram1 zebra ﬁsh mutants which display reduced numbers of shortened cilia and typical ciliopathy phenotypes including curved bodies and pronephric cysts. Patientﬁbroblasts with ARMC9 orTOGARAM 1 mutations display ciliary abnormalities with axonemal shortening and reduced levels of post translational modi ﬁcations (acetylation and polyglutamylation), which are also found in our zebra ﬁsh models. Moreover, ciliary resorption induced by cold or by cell cycle reentry is affected in ARMC9 and TOGARAM 1 mutant cell lines, suggesting a role for this new JBTS  associated complex in axonemal microtubule stability.

 Index and vocabulary of accessible DNA elements in thehuman genome,C28.3,"W. Meuleman, S. Muratov, E. Rynes,",J. Stamatoyannopoulos,"Altius Institute for Biomedical Sciences, Seattle, WA, United States Regulatory information encoded in the human genome is activated by sequence speci ﬁc DNA binding factors, creating focal alterations in chromatin structure that are hypersensitive to DNase I. We created deep reference mapsof DNase I hypersensitive sites (DHSs) from 733 human biosamples encompassing 439 cell and tissue types and states, and integrated these to precisely delineate andnumerically index ~3.6 million DHSs encoded within the human genome, providing a common coordinate system for regulatory DNA. Here we show that the expansive scale ofcell and tissue states sampled exposes an unprecedented degree of stereotyped actuation of large sets of elements, signaling the operation of distinct genome scale regulatoryprograms. We show further that the complex actuation patterns of individual elements can be capturedcomprehensively by a simple regulatory vocabulary re ﬂect  ing their dominant program. This vocabulary, in turn, enables comprehensive and quantitative regulatory annota  tion of both protein coding genes and the vast array of well  deﬁned but poorly characterized non coding RNA genes. Finally, we show that regulatory vocabularies open newavenues for systematically interpreting non coding genetic variation, and substantially empower the connection of disease associated variation with speci ﬁc cell and tissue states. Taken together, our results provide a common and extensible coordinate system and vocabulary for human regulatory DNA, and open a new global perspective on thearchitecture of human gene regulation.

This is well illustrated by Branchiooculofacial Syndrome (BOFS), a rare congenital disorder mainly characterized by craniofacial malformations and orofacialcleft (OC). BOFS is caused by heterozygous mutations within TFAP2A , a master regulator of neural crest cells (NCC) and craniofacial development for which humans, butnot mice, are haploinsuf ﬁcient. Here we present a BOFS patient carrying a heterozygous inversion with one break  point located downstream of TFAP2A . As several hetero  zygous translocations breakpoints and risk haplotypes located downstream of TFAP2A were previously also associated with OC we asked if this region is importantforTFAP2A expression in NCC derived from hiPSCs. Using CRISPR/Cas9 technology we showed that TFAP2A is located within a Topologically Associating Domain (TAD) containing enhancers that are essential for TFAP2A expression and NCC development. Moreover, in NCC derived from patient speci ﬁc hiPSCs the inversion disconnects one TFAP2A allele from its cognate enhancers, leading to monoallelic and haploinsuf ﬁcient TFAP2A expression. Although the inversion shuf ﬂes within the same TAD the TFAP2A NCC enhancers with potentially novel target genes, this does not result in enhancer adoption. Our work illustrates the power of combining patient  speciﬁc hiPSCs differentiation with different genomic and genetic engineering tools to overcome current limitations in unveiling the long range pathological consequences ofhuman structural variation.

 Cerebral organoids provide insights into brain neurodevelopment disrupted by the 16p11.2 copynumber variants in autism,C28.5,L. Iakoucheva,"1, J. Urresti1, P. Zhang1, P. Moran Losada1,","P. Negraes1,N .Y u2, C. Trujillo1, M. Amar1, J. Yates III2, A. Muotri11University of California San Diego, La Jolla, CA, United States,2Scripps Research Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States Introduction: The 16p11.2 is the most common among all rare copy number variants (CNVs) associated with AutismSpectrum Disorder (ASD). We investigated neurodevelop  mental processes impacted by the dosage changes of 16p11.2 CNV using cerebral organoid models. Materials and Methods: We generated 3D cultures (i.e. human cerebral organoids) that model human fetal brain development using iPSCs derived from skin ﬁbroblasts of 16p11.2 deletion (DEL) and duplication (DUP) carriers. Transcriptome sequencing, proteomic pro ﬁling and immu  noﬂuorescence were carried out to investigate molecular and cellular impact of the 16p11.2 CNV. Cell migration, neuronal morphology and synaptogenesis were also investigated. Results: Cerebral organoid recapitulated macrocephaly and microcephaly phenotypes observed in 16p11.2 DEL and DUP carriers. Increased proliferation of neuropro genitor cells was observed in DELs. Gene co expression network analyses identi ﬁed co expression modules that were strongly associated with 16p11.2 copy number status.A module enriched in genes with cell migration and loco  motion functions was downregulated in DELs. A module enriched in genes with synaptic functions, was upregulatedin DELs. Severe migration defects in DEL organoids were conﬁrmed by Boyden chamber assay. Neurons derived from DEL organoids had longer neurites and increased soma size.The number of functional synapses was also higher in DEL organoids. Treatment with the RhoA inhibitor rhosin res  cued cell migration defects. Conclusion: Cerebral organoids recapitulate patients head size phenotypes and gene expression pro ﬁles of fetal human brain.

Here, we propose ASP  RNAi as effective therapeutic option also for genetic disorders associated with gene/s duplication. As a proof of concept, we studied Autosomal Dominant adult onset demyelinating LeukoDystrophy (ADLD), a hereditary, progressive and fatal disorder caused by Lamin B1(LMNB1 ) duplication. We have identi ﬁed three ASP  siRNAs able to speci ﬁcally and effectively silence the non duplicated allele of LMNB1 , maintaining transcription  ally active only two alleles as in healthy subjects, restoring its physiological mRNA/protein levels and ameliorating disease speci ﬁc cellular phenotypes in ADLD ﬁbroblasts. To determine ASP silencing ef ﬁcacy in cell types more relevant to the disease, we generated neurons directly reprogrammed from human ﬁbroblasts, and used rat oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs) overexpressing the human LMNB1 . We initially proved that these cellular models presented ADLD speci ﬁc cellular phenotypes, supporting their relevance as in vitro preclinical tools. Then, we treated both cellular models with the selected most ef ﬁcient ASP siRNA at two different time points. The treatment reduced LMNB1 protein level and ameliorated ADLD speci ﬁc cellular abnormalities (e.g., nuclear anoma  lies and neurite growth), further validating the therapeuticpotential of our RNA molecule and its allele speci ﬁcity. Overall, we demonstrated that ASP RNAi is a suitable andpromising therapeutic option for ADLD, prompting further in vivo studies to validate our results before a clinical trial. Moreover, our results have a broad translational value since our strategy can be extended to all pathological conditions associated with gene copy number gain. E. Giorgio: None. M. Lorenzati: None.

We addressed individuals from the general population to explore interest in being informed if a cancer genetic investigation, revealing an increased cancer risk,had been conducted in their family. We also investigated preferences on source and mode of information. Materials and Methods: A random sample of the gen  eral public was approached through a Swedish citizen web  panel during October 2018. Respondents were given the scenarios of being member of a family with an increasedrisk of colorectal cancer (CRC), 10 and 70% lifetime risk, and being a potential at risk relative. Regular colonoscopy was presented as a preventive measure to individuals at risk. Results: Out of 1900 invited, 977 responded (51%). For the scenario of 10 and 70% CRC risk, 89.2 and 90.6% respectively, would like to receive information about theinvestigation. The proportion preferring to be informed was higher among women (91.5%, 93.3%) than men (85.7%,117088.2%), (Chi2, p ,0.044, p ,0.047).

Regarding source of the information, 79.7 and 74.9% respectively would prefer to receive the information from health care and 16.9 and 19.1% from a family member. Conclusion: In this study a majority wanted to be informed about a completed cancer genetic investigation and preferred health care professionals to mediate thisinformation.

Yet, little is known about how young adults and their families perceive andmanage these interactions. Materials and Methods: Analysis was based on family systems theory using a mixed method approach: familyinterviews (N ,68 individuals; 21 families), young adults interviews (N ,33), pedigree data and standardized measures. Results: Six key themes were identi ﬁed and explored: 1) Responsibility to protect, 2) “It’s a woman ’s problem ”,3 )Family culture in ﬂuences communication, 4) Adversarial growth and connection, 5) Key events can be relational turning points, and 6) Health professionals can help. Family identities were solidi ﬁed through the incorporation of a pathogenic variant in family scripts, while members of the family who held differing views to their families expressedless agreeableness and openness to disseminate information. The collective family ’s experience and perspective towards a pathogenic variant can in ﬂuence a young adult ’s decision  making about genetic testing, risk management and family planning. The utilization of family therapy skills in routine practice would be helpful in facilitating communication andthe inclusion of standardized measures is bene ﬁcial to identify individuals needing ongoing psychological support. Conclusion: Understanding relationship dif ﬁculties that arise from family members holding family divergent views offers insight for future research inquiry and areas of further training and clinical support.

Implementation of polygenic testing has begun, with severalcommercial laboratories now offering the test. Despite implementation, there is little research investigating how women respond and understand PRS. This study aimed toexplore women ’s experience receiving their personalized breast cancer PRS and compare responses of women at different levels of polygenic risk. Methods: Eligible participants were affected and unaf  fected women from families clinically assessed to be at high risk for breast cancer who had received their perso nalized PRS as part of the Variants in Practice Psychosocial Study (ViPPs). In depth semi structured interviews wereAbstracts from the 52nd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: Oral Presentations 1171conducted up to four weeks after receiving PRS. Interviews were transcribed verbatim and analysed using thematic analysis. Results: Twenty one women participated in this qualita  tive study (mean age 53.4 years). Eleven women received a PRS that was in the top quartile of PRS distribution and 10in the lowest quartile. Women ’s lived experience with breast cancer informed how they responded to their PRS, constructed and made sense of breast cancer risk followingreceipt of their PRS, and how they integrated this new information into their breast cancer risk management. Regardless of risk level, all participants demonstrated broadknowledge of concepts related to polygenic information and were able to accurately describe the implications of their PRS. Receiving PRS did not appear to negatively impactwomen ’s distress levels. Conclusion: Polygenic breast cancer information is well received and understood by women at high risk for breastcancer. T.

Families and healthcare professionalscan face uncertainties regarding likely treatment outcomes and implications of genomic ﬁndings. ‘PRISM Impact ’ assesses families ’and healthcare professionals ’experiences with PRISM. Methods: Patients aged <21 years with a high risk cancer are eligible for PRISM. Parents, patients (>12 years), andhealthcare professionals opt in to PRISM Impact, complete surveys at enrolment, after results delivery, and then annually for ﬁve years. We interview healthcare profes  sionals annually. Results: Currently, 95 families have opted in and 76 parents (child ’s mean age: 8.68 years [range ,0–17]; 67.1% mothers) have returned surveys. We have inter  viewed 54 healthcare professionals (59% oncologists). Parents ’expectations of bene ﬁt vary widely, possibly due to feelings of uncertainty, with some reporting that their child is‘extremely likely ’to bene ﬁt (7.9%) while others report there is ‘no chance at all ’of bene ﬁt (6.6%). This contrasts with healthcare professionals ’expectations, with only 18.5% of professionals ranking ‘current patients ’as the stakeholder bene ﬁtting most from PRISM. Parents ’intol  erance of uncertainty ranged from 12 –51 (out of 60) and parents ’anxiety was high, on average 4.9 (SD ,2.99, range 0–10). Parents ’intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety were highly correlated (r ,0.555, p < 0.001). Conclusion: Parents with higher intolerance of uncer  tainty might be at greater risk of distress and may bene ﬁt from targeted psychosocial support. It will be important to analyze parents ’emotional reactions and coping after PRISM results delivery, and to assess whether their copingis associated with their baseline (in)tolerance of uncertainty.

However, little is yet known about the psychosocial and behavioural implications of MTP. The Molecular Screening and Therapeutics program is recruiting 1,000 patients with an advanced, solid, rare cancer toundertake MTP and, if an actionable variant is found, participate in a suitable therapeutic trial if available. The current mixed methods psychosocial sub study (PiGeOn)aims to explore participants ’understanding, experiences and views regarding MTP at three timepoints. Baseline qualitative results are reported here. PiGeOn participantswere purposively sampled to participate in a semi structured interview. Thematic analysis is employed to determine themes. Data saturation was reached at 20 (aged 41 –77 years). Participants ’motivations include: fear of death, trust in their oncologist, need for control and a sense of ‘nothing lost’. Desperation and fear of dying dominate motivation, but participants also value being able to help others. Participants tolerate uncertainty, hope for reduced prog  nostic uncertainty, but fear loss of hope if no actionableresult is found (the most likely outcome). They often lack understanding, but trust the science of MTP and the research process. This is one of few studies to explore theexperiences of people who have undergone MTP. Identify  ing new treatment options overshadows broader and familial implications of genetic testing in this population.This increases the dif ﬁculty of supporting informed consent and shared decision making in MTP testing.

 Dimensions of grief and loss for families living with Li Fraumeni Syndrome,C29.6,A. Werner Lin,"1, S. L. Merrill1, J. L. Young2,","C. D. Wilsnack1, V. Groner1, J. T. Loud3, R. C. Bremer3, J. A.

Khincha31School of Social Policy and Practice, Philadelphia, PA, United States,2Stanford University Center for Biomedical Ethics, Stanford, CA, United States,3National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States Li Fraumeni Syndrome (LFS) is an inherited cancer predisposition syndrome associated with germline muta  tions in TP53 . LFS is characterized by early onset, multiple primary malignancies with nearly 100% penetrance by age70 years, and substantial uncertainty regarding diagnostic timing and prognoses. An interdisciplinary team used Interpretive Description to analyze interviews with familygroups enrolled in the National Cancer Institute ’s LFS study (NCT01443468). Interviews elicited narratives about cancer experiences, evolving family structure and functioning, andcoping. Families reported limited reprieve between cancer diag  noses and deaths, which often occurred simultaneously andacross generations. Consequently, participants lived with grief as an integral feature of family life. Extensive disease  related uncertainty created ambiguous losses , with little guidance to interpret risk or prepare for the next change. Family groups reported anticipatory losses , shared expec  tations regarding predicted functional and emotional changeresulting from a new cancer or death. Individuals reported embodied loss , impairment to physical or aesthetic func  tioning due to cancer treatment or prevention. Thesetypes of grief occurred simultaneously, often went unac  knowledged , and were often neither recognized nor dis  cussed with social or provider networks. Unacknowledgedlosses included survivor guilt, identity, hoped for life experiences, and altered reproductive plans. Family experiences with loss may warrant clinical atten  tion over time, as opposed to solely at the time of diagnosis. Traditional medical teams may lack capacity to address the complex psychosocial needs of families grieving LFS related losses. Long term engagement of mental health providers with bereavement training may provide invalu  able support to families with LFS and facilitate engagementwith providers. A. Werner Lin: None. S.L.

Dissecting the molecular pathology of coeliac disease,PL1.,Wijmenga,"Complex Genetics Section, DG Dept","Medical Genetics, University Medical  Center Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands. Coeliac disease has become one of the best understood immune  related disorder  . The disease presents in the small intestine and results  from the interplay between multiple genes and gluten, the triggering environmental factor  . HLA class II genes explain 40% of the heritable  risk. Recently, we reported significant and replicable association to a  common variant located in intron 28 of the myosin IXB ( MYO9B ) gene .  Homozygosity for the at risk allele confers a 2 .3 higher risk to disease  (P = 1 .55 x 10 5) . MYO9B is an unconventional myosin that contains  a Rho GTPase activating domain which can negatively control Rho  proteins. Rho proteins are involved in cytoskeletal modifications and  tight junction assembly suggesting a role of MYO9B in the epithelial barrier  . Hence, the genetic association may point to a primary  impairment of the epithelial barrier, and may explain why immunogenic gluten peptides are able to pass through this barrier  . A recent  microarray study revealed enhanced neutrophil recruitment into the  small intestine in both active and remission patients, further confirming  our hypothesis of a genetic impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier  . Hence, ongoing genetic studies are currently focusing on tight  junction genes involved in epithelial barrier function . These studies are  being complemented with gene expression studies using intestinal biopsies from coeliac patients and control individuals . Interestingly,  MYO9B is also an attractive candidate gene for other inflammatory  disorders since increased permeability of the epithelial barrier is also seen in e .g . multiple sclerosis, type 1 diabetes and asthma .",2006
circadian biology,PL2.,Meijer,"Dept.Molecular Cell Biology, group Neurophysiology, LUMC, Leiden, The Neth   erlands. ","The earthâs rotation causes 24 hour cycles in many aspects of the  physical environment, while the earthâs revolution around the sun causes seasonal changes . Most living systems have developed circadian clocks to anticipate changes in the environment . Circadian  rhythms can be observed in many tissues and organs, and are  present at the level of gene expression, transmitter and hormone concentrations, enzyme activity, physiology and behavior  . Light is the  most important entraining signal from the environment and subserves entrainment to both daily and annual cycles . In mammals, circadian  rhythms are driven by a pacemaker located in the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) of the hypothalamus . Individual neurons of the SCN are  capable of generating circadian patterns on the basis of a molecular  feedback loop in which âclock genesâ are inhibited by their protein products . The molecular oscillations result in circadian rhythms in  membrane properties, resulting in rhythmic patterns in electrical impulse frequency of SCN neurons . Electrical impulse activity is an important output signal of the clock . We record electrical activity  patterns in brain slices and in behaving animals implanted with  microelectrodes, and investigated the ability of the SCN to code for  and synchronize to  daily and annual cycles . We obtained evidence  that the SCN is composed of multiple single cell oscillators, and that  the temporal distribution of these oscillators can be reconfigured by environmental changes . Within the SCN, sub regions show different  rates of entrainment to a shift in light dark cycle, with the ventral SCN shifting more rapidly than the dorsal SCN . In addition, we show that  areas outside the SCN can contribute critically to the resynchronization rate of the circadian system . We conclude that different properties of  the circadian system arise at different levels of organization within the organism . While generation of circadian rhythms can be explained at  the molecular level, synchronization to environmental signals requires neuronal networks .",2006

Genetic causes of Vascular malformations,PL5.,Vikkula,"Human Molecular Genetics, Christian de Duve Institute & UniversitÃ© Catholique  de Louvain, Brussels, Belgium","Vascular malformations are localized  errors of vascular development .  They are often identified on the skin as âbirthmarksâ of various sizes and shapes . They usually slowly grow with the growth of the child . They  may also be encountered in other organs, such as the liver, intestine and the brain . The lesions are consisted of tortuous vascular channels  of various types, with continuous endothelium surrounded by various numbers of support cells . Most of these lesions occur sporadically, yet sometimes as part of a syndrome or as an inherited disorder  . Genetic  studies of such families have lead to the identification of a number of genes that can cause vascular malformations . Our first discovery was the identification of the TIE2/TEK gene  encoding an endothelial receptor tyrosine kinase to be responsible  for hereditary mucocutaneous venous malformations (âcavernous hemangiomaâ) . As a continuation to this work, we unraveled that a  loss of function mutation in the VEGFR3 gene, encoding the vascular  endothelial growth factor 3 receptor, is responsible for congenital hereditary lymphedema . We also linked mutations in the KRIT1  gene to cutaneous capillary venous malformations associated with cerebral cavernous malformations . More recent work has lead to the  identification of mutations in glomulin to be responsible for hereditary  glomuvenous malformations (âglomangiomasâ), SOX18 mutations  to cause lymphedema hypotrichosis telangiectasia syndrome and  RASA1 mutations to cause a newly recognized disorder, which  associates atypical hereditary capillary malformations to arterio venous anomalies (CM AVM) . As the function of the genes identified using reverse genetics is  often unknown, in vivo  models are crucial for further dissection of the  molecular pathways involved in these disorders . Such models will  enable direct evaluation of the developmental function and significance  of the genes in vasculogenesis  and angiogenesis  . In addition, murine  models could serve for screening of novel therapeutic modalities .",2006
Huntingtonâs disease: molecular pathogenesis and  therapeutic approaches,PL6.,Bates,"Medical and Molecular Medicine, School of Medicine, Kingâs College London,  London, United Kingdom","Huntingtonâs disease (HD) is an inherited, progressive neurological  disorder caused by a CAG/polyglutamine repeat expansion for which there is no effective therapy  . We have developed and characterised  mouse models of HD that recapitulate many features of the human disease and have predicted novel aspects to human pathology  . We are  currently using these models to better understand molecular events  in disease pathogenesis including somatic repeat instability and  transcriptional dysregulation among others. Since the identification of  the HD mutation, new targets for therapeutic intervention have been  identified. We have established a battery of quantitative protocols for  the preclinical assessment of compounds in the R6/2 mouse model of HD . Histone deacetylase inhibitors have emerged as potential HD therapeutics and are being assessed .",2006
systems biology approaches for the study of aging and age  related diseases,PL7.,Baumeister,"ZBSA â Freiburg Center for Systems Biology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg,  Germany","In the past years the various genome projects succeeded in delivering a rapidly increasing amount of gene information . However, the  necessary functional analysis of this data with traditional research tools is far too slow to make optimal use of this information . In particular, it  is required to understand the networks of gene regulations and protein  interactions in order to interprete the phenotypic consequences of ESHG Plenary Lectures e .g . mutants associated with disease . For this purpose, we have  established a research platform using the soil nematode C. elegans   to study the genome wide consequences of genetic mutations .  We exploit this model for the analysis of genetic components and  signaling pathways affecting cellular and organismal aging and for  the functional interpretation of mutants associated, in humans, with  age related degenerative disorders like Alzheimerâs and Parkinsonâs  Disease . C. elegans  is particularly suited for the fast and genome wide  characterization of (disease relevant) gene functions and networks,  and it allows the testing of functional alterations in an otherwise intact organism . In addition, automation of particular experimental setups increases the throughput of data acquisition . The unique set of genetic,  molecular, and genetic tools available for this organism, in combination  with the high degree of sequence conservation between C. elegans   and human genomes, aims at greatly enhancing our understanding of age related disorders .",2006

making eyes: lessons from ocular malformations,PL9.,van Heyningen,"MRC Human Genetics Unit, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Charles Darwin considered the eye an âorgan of extreme perfectionâ .  The genes implicated in eye development are highly conserved across phyla . Study of ocular malformations led us to identify three major  transcription factors which cause severe ocular malformations, in some  cases with accompanying brain anomalies. PAX6 haploinsufficiency  was shown to cause human aniridia; SOX2 and OTX2 were identified  as significant causative genes for anophthalmia and microphthalmia.  Detailed analysis of the mutations and observed phenotypes has  highlighted key genetic mechanisms which we are pursuing using  model organisms, predominantly mouse and zebrafish. Continuing  exploration of patient mutations has also convinced us that humans  provide excellent models for defining gene function and interactions.  The search for additional candidate genes contributes significantly to the discovery of developmental pathways . Potential mechanisms  for environmental modification of phenotype are also emerging in our studies . Our results illustrate the invaluable contribution made to our  understanding of basic biology, as well as to clinical management, by the study of human disease, directly and in model organisms .  EsHG concurrent symposia s01.Analysis of quantitative trait loci H. GÃ¶ring ;   Southwest Foundation for Biomedical Research, Department of Genetics and  SNPRC, San Antonio, TX, United States. No abstract received . s02.Endophenotypes for cognitive ability E. de Geus , D. Boomsma, S. van der Sluis, D. Smit, D. Posthuma;   Dept. Biological Psychology & Centre for Neurogenomics and Cognitive Re   search, Vrije Universiteit, Amsterdam, The Netherlands. Population variation in higher order cognitive ability, assessed by  psychometric IQ, is largely determined by genetic variation . Recent  whole genome searches have suggested that the high heritability of IQ derives from many genes with small effect . An endophenotype  strategy may help counter the low power in linkage analyses implied by such a polygenic scenario . We aimed to develop endophenotypes  for cognition in three domains of brain characteristics: bulk, speed and connectivity  . Brain volumes, both total gray and white, showed the  required correlation to IQ which also proved to be entirely genetic in origin . Strong sex differences in the relationship between IQ and brain volume, however, may complicate their use as endophenotypes . In  the domain of procesing speed, a measure of early visual processing  speed, visual inspection time, was correlated to performance IQ entirely through an underlying genetic factor  . However, other indices of processing speed in the domain of EEG and ERP measures failed  to genetically correlate to IQ, even when we found them to be highly heritable . With regard to corticocortical connectivity, linear (EEG  coherence) and non linear (synchronization likelihood) synchrony in brain activation has been tested so far  . As with ERP latencies,  substantial heritability was found, but these connectivity measures were only modestly correlated to IQ . It is concluded that the endophenotype strategy is completely valid in theory but hard to put into practice . s03.Gene Expression signatures identify clinically relevant  subgroups of cancer   Examples from colon and bladder T. Orntoft ;   Aarhus University Hospital, Aarhus, Denmark. It has been a frustration in the clinical handling of cancer patients, that  two highly similar looking cancers (same TNM stage, same histology)  in two different individuals may show distinctly different disease courses . Two get a deeper look into the properties of cancers we have  used a large prospectively collected tissue bank with clinical follow up  data, as well as modern microarray technology and bioinformatic data mining . A number of gene expression signatures have been identified mainly  in bladder and colon cancer using cross validation and a maximum likelihood method . For bladder cancer we have signatures for stage,  progression, surrounding carcinoma in situ, recurrence, treatment  response etc. They have been identified on high density Affymetrix  GeneChips and validated on independent test sets of patients using in house gridded oligonucleotide microarrays . A multicenter European  validation spanning from Spain to Sweden has been initiated and data  from the first 400 patients will be reported, based on less than 500 genes in total . As end points we have used either clinical upstaging based on  TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classification, or a clinical risk score that detects aggressive tumors early  . In colon cancer we generated  signatures for MSI/MSS, for heredity in MSI cases, as well as for predicting recurrence . For some of the differentially expressed genes we have made in vitro  cellular studies of their biological function, and found several related to apoptosis or migration . Individualized medicine is now a possibility as more and more drugs are  being available for each cancer disease, and also individually planned follow up strategies are emerging . It requires, however, that we can  differentiate between individual tumors, in terms of their predicted behaviour and treatment response . Gene expression signatures seem to be a promising tool for this purpose if used in a correct way  . s04.Ectodermal dysplasias M. Mikkola ;   Developmental Biology Program, Institute of Biotechnology, Helsinki, Finland. Ectodermal dysplasias (ED) represent a large group of rare genetic  disorders with developmental abnormalities of the ectoderm and its derivatives such as teeth, hairs, nails, and sweat glands . Currently,  in less than 30 of the approximately 200 EDs described to date the  causative gene has been identified. Extensive recent progress  has been made in understanding the biology of EDs associated with mutations in p63 and ectodysplasin (Eda) signalling pathway  .  Mutations in Eda cause the most common form of EDs, the X linked  anhidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, which is now known to involve  deficient activation of the transcription factor NF ÎºB. Eda/NF ÎºB  signalling is required for the early stages of ectodermal organogenesis    novel findings on this pathway will be discussed. Mutations in p63,  a transcription factor similar to tumour suppressor p53, have been  described in a number of autosomal dominant EDs including EEC  (ectrodactyly ED clefting) and AEC (ankyloblepharon ectodermal  dysplasia clefting) syndromes. p63 deficient mice die at birth and are  featured by absence of stratified epidermis and lack of teeth, hairs, and mammary glands . Two fundamentally different types of p63  proteins are made: those containing an N terminal transactivating  (TA) domain similar to that found in p53 and those lacking this domain  (ÎN). However, the relative contribution of the different p63 isoforms in epithelial organogenesis has remained an enigma . We have used mouse as a model to analyze the function of p63 . Unexpectedly, we ESHG Plenary Lectures found that the ÎN isoforms are expressed at high levels in embryonic  ectoderm at all stages of the development of skin and its appendages,  teeth and hairs . Comparative in situ hybridization approach revealed several genes that lie downstream of p63 . The connection of p63 to other pathways implicated in EDs will be addressed . s05.ichthyosis P. Steylen ;   University Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands. No abstract received . s06.Genetics of skin pigmentation and pigmentary diseases R. Spritz ;   Human Medical Genetics Program, University of Colorado Health Sciences  Center, Aurora, CO, United States. Because of the immediate visual impact, genetic disorders of  pigmentation and the wide variation of normal pigmentation of humans,  animals, and plants have long drawn the interest of geneticists, breeders, and the general public . Oculocutaneous albinism is perhaps  the first genetic disorder ever described, and represents the first enzyme  deficiency ever identified. Piebaldism is thought to be the first trait for which a pedigree was presented . The inheritance of red hair was one  of the first normal human traits studied by early geneticists. Recent  years have seen remarkable progress in this field. In the mouse, more  than 130 genes are known to influence the pigmentary phenotype, and  most of these have now been identified. In humans, five genes are now  known for pure oculocutaneous albinism and twelve for oculocutaneous  albinism associated with various systemic manifestations (Hermansky Pudlak syndrome, Chediak Higashi syndrome, or Griscelli syndrome) .  Seven genes are known to cause human congenital white spotting  disorders (piebaldism and various types of Waardenburg syndrome),  and another four have been mapped but not yet identified. All of  these human pigmentary diseases have direct parallels in the mouse, as well as in many other mammalian species . There has also been  considerable recent progress in understanding the genetics of the  most common human pigmentary disorder, vitiligo, an acquired white  spotting disorder of autoimmune origin that is highly associated with  various other autoimmune/autoinflammatory diseases. Several genes  have been epidemiologically associated with vitiligo, and at least two  others have been identified by genetic linkage and positional cloning, perhaps opening up new avenues to treatment of this common disorder  .  Finally, evidence is mounting that some of these pigmentary disease  genes may also play roles in normal variation of human pigmentation  of the hair, the skin, and the eyes, opening the door to study of these incredibly rich and complex human phenotypes . s07.mechanism and medical implications of RNA surveillance by Nonsense mediated decay A. Kulozik ;   UniversitÃ¤tsklinik fÃ¼r Kinder  und. Jugendmedizin, Heidelberg, Germany. No abstract received . s08.RNA splicing in cancer J. P. Venables ;   Institution of Human Genetics, Newcastle upon Tyne, United Kingdom. More than 90% of protein coding transcripts undergo removal of introns and splicing together of exons . This process depends on recognition  of multiple signals, especially within 200 nucleotides of exon intron  boundaries, and mutation of these signals is thought to account for around 15% of genetic disease . âAlternative splicingâ is the process whereby the majority of genes encode more than one polypeptide .  Despite being from the same gene these variant proteins can be  functionally antagonistic and choreographed changes in isoform  balance can lead to specific modes of differentiation. In several tumour  types the ratio of splice variants, in genes involved in proliferation,  apoptosis or motility, is altered and has independent prognostic value . Moreover, inducing splice form imbalances characteristic of tumours can lead to malignant behaviour in cultured cells . Therefore  unbalanced alternative splicing of multiple target pre mRNAs caused  by dysregulation of splicing factors could be the primary cause of cancer in some instances .s09.Genetics of variation in human gene expression V.

No abstract received . s10.t aste Genetics: insights in individual t aste Worlds with  implications for Diet and Health B. Tepper ;   Department of Food Science, Rutgers University, New Brunswick, NJ, United  States. Taste is critical for the identification and selection of food and is therefore essential for human survival . Humans have an innate preference for  sweet taste, a source of calories, and an innate aversion to bitter taste, which might protect against the consumption of toxic substances . Aside  from these innate responses, there are large individual differences in taste preferences that are thought to be genetically determined .  The ability to taste bitter thiourea compounds and related chemicals is a well known human trait . The majority of individuals perceive  these compounds, typified by the bitterness of 6 n propylthiouracil  (PROP) and phenylthiocarbamide (PTC), as moderately to extremely bitter  . Approximately 30% of the population is taste blind to these  substances . PROP/PTC tasters are more sensitive to a wide range  of oral sensations including other bitter tastes, sweetness, spiciness of chili peppers, astringency of alcohol and the texture of fats . Tasters  typically show lower preferences for foods with these taste qualities  than non tasters who show the opposite set of responses (lower taste sensitivities and higher preferences for these sensory qualities) . We  have used PROP tasting as a screening tool to understand genetic  variation in food preferences that may have long term implications for diet and health . We have shown, for example, that the non taster  phenotype is associated with higher fat and energy intakes in children  and higher body weights in adults, especially women. These findings  suggest that the PROP/PTC bitter taste phenotype may be a marker for increased weight gain and obesity  . s11.Genetics of smell D.

Casanova1,2;   1Laboratoire de GÃ©nÃ©tique Humaine des Maladies Infectieuses, UniversitÃ© de  Paris RenÃ© Descartes INSERM U550, FacultÃ© de MÃ©decine Necker, Paris,  France, 2UnitÃ© dâImmunologie et dâHÃ©matologie PÃ©diatriques, HÃ´pital Necker  Enfants Malades, Paris, France. Primary immunodeficiencies are typically seen as rare monogenic  conditions associated with detectable immunological abnormalities,  resulting in a broad susceptibility to multiple and recurrent infections caused by weakly pathogenic and more virulent microorganisms . By  opposition to these conventional primary immunodeficiencies, we  describe non conventional primary immunodeficiencies as Mendelian  conditions manifesting in otherwise healthy patients as a narrow ESHG Plenary Lectures6 susceptibility to infections, recurrent or otherwise, caused by weakly  pathogenic or by more virulent microbes . Conventional primary  immunodeficiencies are suspected on the basis of a rare, striking, clinical  phenotype and are defined on the basis of an overt immunological  phenotype, often leading to identification of the disease causing  gene. Non conventional primary immunodeficiencies are defined on  the basis of a more common, less marked clinical phenotype, which  remains isolated until molecular cloning of the causal gene reveals a hitherto undetected immunological phenotype . Similar concepts may  be applied to primary immunodeficiencies presenting other clinical features, such as allergy and auto immunity  . Non conventional primary  immunodeficiencies thus expand the clinical boundaries of this group  of inherited disorders considerably, suggesting that Mendelian primary  immunodeficiencies are more common in the general population than  previously thought, and may affect children with a single infectious, allergic, or autoimmune disease . s16.constitutional aneuploidy and cancer predisposition N. Rahman ;   Institute of Cancer Research, Section of Cancer Genetics, Surrey, United King   dom. No abstract received . s17.spindle checkpoint proteins and their multiple roles in  regulating chromosome segregation C. E. Sunkel ;   IBMC, Instituto de Biologia Molecular e Celular, Universidade do Porto, Porto,  Portugal. Accurate segregation of chromosomes during cell division is essential to maintain genomic stability  . Cells have developed a surveillance  mechanism that monitors attachment of chromosomes to the spindle and delays anaphase onset until chromosomes congress properly  .  The basic signalling components of the Spindle Assembly Checkpoint  (SAC) have been shown to be and include the Bub and Mad family of proteins . When chromosomes are not correctly attached, these  proteins o provide an inhibitory signal that prevents activation of the ubiquitin dependent ligase complex (APC/C) inhibiting mitosis exit .  We have set out to dissect the SAC in Drosophila through functional studies of Bub3, BubR1 and Mad2 . The results indicate that apart from  their function in the SAC, these proteins appear to have other roles during mitosis . In vivo studies show that Mad2 is required during mitosis for the correct timing of prometaphase independently of kinetochore localization .  Bub3 was found to be involved in entry and progression through mitosis  by preventing premature degradation of cyclins and BubR1 appears  to regulate the stability of kinetochore microtubule interaction during prometaphase . Furthermore, genetic analysis of BubR1 has revealed  that the SAC it self is required during early embryo development, as  well as for the arrest of the polar body after meiosis. We also find that  BubR1 is essential during early stages of female meiosis to prevent chromosome missegregation . Overall our results suggest that SAC  proteins are used in different cellular and developmental contexts to maintain genomic stability  . s18.Regulating mitosis by proteolysis J. Pines ;   Wellcome Trust/Cancer Research UK, Cambridge, United Kingdom. No abstract received . s19.cascade screening: whose information is it anyway? G. de Wert ;   Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands. No abstract received . s20.Autonomy and prenatal testing decisions E. Dormandy , T. Marteau;   Kingâs College London, London, United Kingdom. The importance of acting in line with individual values is central to  the principle of autonomy, a highly valued, individualistic concept, governing encounters in medicine in developed countries . The  congruence between values and action is also central to the concept of informed choice . Increasingly the patient population in developed countries encompasses people from a variety of cultures including  those in which group perspectives can be valued more highly than those of the individual . Embedding value behaviour consistency at  the heart of informed choice could therefore be inappropriate when evaluating decision making across cultural groups . Studies in the US, Europe and Australia show that uptake of screening  for fetal abnormalities is lower amongst women from minority ethnic  groups. It is commonly assumed that this lower uptake reflects more negative attitudes towards testing in these women . Using a validated  measure of attitudes towards testing we found no difference in  attitudes towards undergoing the test but rather a lower consistency  between values and action in women from South Asia compared with  white women. One interpretation of these findings is that women from minority ethnic groups are less likely to act consistently with their values .  Another explanation is that the measure of values did not capture the  values importance to women from South Asia, a culture characterised more by collectivism than individualism . If this is the case it raises a  question of whether acting in line with collectivist values can or indeed  should be incorporated into the more individualistically based concept of informed choice . s21.shared decision making in clinical genetics. A. Lucassen ;   Wessex Clinical Genetic Service, Southampton, United Kingdom. One of the main aims of a clinical genetic service is to offer patients informed choices . Historically, a delivery mode of ânon directive  counsellingâ has been advocated in part to distance the speciality from  any association with the eugenic movement but also because there was little evidence basis for effectiveness of particular interventions .  As such an evidence basis accumulates and as more and more  complex diagnoses and predictions can be made, counselling through âshared decision making (SDM)â has been advocated . SDM is thought  to be particularly appropriate in situations of uncertainty where  several reasonable clinical alternatives exist; the patient and clinician  explore these and come to a shared decision on a course of action which incorporates the patientâs life experiences and intuitions . This process thus enhances autonomy by informing the consent process .  However, there are several characteristics of clinical genetics that  may make shared decision more difficult to achieve than in other areas of medicine . Guilt, worry about stigma or discrimination may  make decisions in genetics more difficult and the underlying concepts  and mechanisms may be more difficult to understand than non genetic tests . The shared nature of genetic test results among family  members may mean that one result points to others who might benefit from interventions . Certain interventions (such as thyroidectomy  in MEN2 carriers) may be so much more beneficial than any other  alternative, that the decision making model moves to a professional recommendation . Such challenges to autonomy and decision making will be explored . s22.Age related macula degeneration C. Klaver ;   Erasmus MC, Polikliniek Oogheelkunde, Rotterdam, The Netherlands. No abstract received . s23.Parkinson disease and LRRK2 T. Gasser ;   Dept. of Neurodegenerative Diseases, Hertie Institute for Clinical Brain Re   search, University of TÃ¼bingen, TÃ¼bingen, Germany. Genetic findings in rare inherited forms of Parkinsonâs disease (PD)  have greatly contributed to our understanding of the molecular pathogenesis of this disease . We have recently identified mutations in the gene for LRRK2 (leucine  rich repeat kinase 2) as the so far most common cause of dominantly inherited PD . Mutations are located in highly conserved domains of the gene . The LRRK2 protein belongs to the ROCO protein family, and  includes a ras domaine (ras of complex proteins) and a protein kinase  domain of the MAPKKK class and several other major functional domains . Extensive sequencing of families and sporadic patients by  many groups now shows that LRRK2 mutations account for about  10 to 15% of dominant PD, and for 1 to 2% of typical sporadic late onset PD . Pathologically, most patients show brainstem dopaminergic ESHG Plenary Lectures degeneration accompanied by typical Lewy body pathology, but  occasionally the picture is that of a diffuse Lewy body disease, nigral  degeneration without distinctive histopathology and even progressive  supranuclear palsy  . Recent analyses showed that LRRK2 is an active kinase, and that  pathogenic mutations may actually increase kinase activity, potentially opening up novel approaches to therapy  . s24.APP locus duplication causes autosomal dominant early  onset Alzheimer disease with cerebral amyloid angiopathy A. Rovelet Lecrux1, D. Hannequin1,2, G. Raux1, N. Le Meur3, A. LaquerriÃ¨re4,  A. Vital5, C. Dumanchin1, S. Feuillette1, A. Brice6, M. Verceletto7, F. Dubas8, D.  Campion1,9, T. Frebourg1;   1Inserm U614 IFRMP, Faculty of Medicine, Rouen, France, 2Department of  Neurology, University Hospital, Rouen, France, 3Laboratory of Cytogenetics,  EFS Normandy, Bois Guillaume, France, 4Department of Pathology, University  Hospital, Rouen, France, 5Department of Pathology, University Hospital, Bor   deaux, France, 6Inserm U679, SalpÃ©triÃ¨re Hospital, Paris, France, 7Department  of Neurology, University Hospital, Nantes, France, 8Department of Neurology,  University Hospital, Angers, France, 9Department of Research, CHSR, Sotte   ville les Rouen, France. The development of Alzheimer disease (AD) in patients with trisomy  21 led us to hypothesise that the APP locus located on chromosome  21q21 might be affected by gene dosage alterations in a subset of demented patients . We therefore analysed the  APP gene using  QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments)  in 12 unrelated autosomal dominant early onset Alzheimer disease  (ADEOAD) cases without PSEN1 , PSEN2  or APP mutation, 70  unrelated familial late onset AD cases and 100 healthy control subjects . We found a duplication of the  APP locus in 5 families with  ADEOAD and cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA) . Among families, the duplicated segments had a minimal size ranging from 0 .58 to 6 .37 Mb and contained from 5 to 12 annotated genes . Dementia of AD type (mean age of onset 52 Â± 4 .4 years) was associated, in some cases, with lobar intracerebral haemorrhages . Remarkably, retrospective  examination of the patients harbouring the chromosome 21 segmental  duplication did not reveal any clinical feature suggestive of Down syndrome . Brains from patients with  APP duplication presented  abundant parenchymal and vascular deposits of AÎ² peptides. These  data demonstrate that APP gene dosage alteration APP is sufficient  to induce AÎ² deposits and ADEOAD associated with CAA. This  validates the amyloid cascade model according to which AD results  from an abnormal production and/or aggregation of the AÎ² peptide.  After the report of alpha synuclein triplication in Parkinson disease,  this is a further evidence that gene dosage alterations are involved  in the genetic determinism of neurodegenerative disorders caused by protein or peptide accumulation . s25.segmental Duplication and Human Genome Variation E. E. Eichler ;   Department of Genome Sciences, University of Washington School of Medi   cine, Seattle, WA, United States. The abundance of segmental duplications within the human genome  (~4%) with relatively high sequence identity (>95%) suggests that  duplicative transposition or gene conversion of large segments of  DNA must have been a relatively common form of genetic variation during hominoid evolution . Moreover, the presence of such large  blocks of sequence at multiple regions creates the opportunity for non  allelic homologous recombination events that may have significantly restructured the genome in ancestral and present day populations . I  will present a survey of structural variation within the human population within these regions of the genome based on two different approaches .  Using BAC based array comparative genomic hybridization, I will  present a survey of copy number variation of these regions within the  human population and show that such regions are particularly enriched  for large scale variation. The analysis identifies ~40/130 regions that  appear to be ârecalcitrantâ to copy number changes among normals 21  of which are discovered to be variant among probands with idiopathic mental retardation . We suggest that some of these represent novel genomic disorders . Using paired end sequence analysis, I will provide  a first generation view of finer scale structural variation within the  human genome (inversions, deletions and insertions > 10 kb in length) based on a detailed analysis of two human genomes by paired end clone sequence analysis . Our data suggests that this form of variation  is common within and between primate species and preferentially occur within duplicated and often gene rich regions of the genome .  The nature and pattern of such variation will likely be an important consideration in genetic association studies of human disease . s26.Deconstructing deletion syndromes: new techniques and  old karyotypes C. van Ravenswaaij Arts ;   Dept. Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijme   gen, The Netherlands. New molecular cytogenetic techniques like arrayCGH and MLPA  were primarily introduced to search for submicroscopic chromosome aberrations in patients with unexplained mental retardation . However  these techniques may also improve phenotype genotype studies in microscopically visible chromosome aberrations . The exact  determination of breakpoints needed for these studies used to be  very time consuming and only feasible for rather common cytogenetic syndromes . Size and localisation of the chromosomal aneuploidies  can nowadays be determined with very high accuracy by tiling path arrayCGH in one single test run . With the availability of very high resolution genotyping, phenotyping  with an equally high accuracy is needed to fully benefit from the advantages of these new techniques . The combination of high  resolution genotyping with detailed phenotyping will enable us to  localise genes for specific traits in cytogenetic syndromes. Examples  are the determination of the critical region for congenital aural atresia with a size of 2 .3 Mb on chromosome 18q22 .3 and the critical region for trigonocephaly on 9p22 .3 . High quality and standardized collection  of molecular cytogenetic and detailed clinical information will also enable aneuploidy studies in less common chromosomal aberrations .  Van Buggenhout nicely demonstrated that accurate phenotyping and  genotyping in as less as four patients can already reveal a small region of interest for a behavioural phenotype (2q32 .3) . A short overview of classical phenotype genotype studies in  chromosomal syndromes will be presented followed by a review of studies using new techniques . Advantages and limitations of the  new approach and the need for sophisticated phenotyping and data collection will be discussed . s27.segmental Duplications in 22q11 mediate Deletions, translocations and Genomic instability B.

All vertebrates derive from a common ancestor that lived about 450  million years ago. The genome of this ancestor was modified by  chromosome rearrangements in different lineages, and the exquisite  details provided by the availability of the genome sequence for many  modern vertebrate species makes it possible to deduce most of these chromosome rearrangements . For example, the sequence of the  pufferfish Tetraodon nigroviridis genome showed with great clarity that  a whole genome duplication took place in an early fish ancestor that possessed only 12 chromosomes . The two signatures of this event  materialize when examining the distribution of duplicated genes on the  21 Tetraodon chromosomes on the one hand, and when comparing the distribution of human and Tetraodon genes on the other hand . A systematic comparison of gene organisations between fish and other  vertebrates thus provides a powerful basis to reconstruct their ancestral ESHG Plenary Lectures genome and trace its evolution in the fish, bird or mammalian lineages.  The general scenario follows some striking patterns, such as slow rate  of rearrangements along the fish and bird lineages, and a faster rate  along the mammalian line and provides a reference framework to  follow the distribution of genes and gene families in different lineages . s30.the complexity of human genes R.

Transcribed regions have been long been regarded as a distinguishing characteristic of functional portions of the human genome . Increasing  experimental evidence, however, indicates that larger portions of the genome are being transcribed than originally believed . As part of  the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE) project, the sites of  transcription in the non repeat sequences across a representative  1% of the human genome has been determined in a large number of  different cell line/tissue samples using of high throughput transcription interrogation technique . In addition, a detailed annotation of the protein  coding content of the ENCODE regions has been obtained through a combination of computati",2006
Exploring the role Wnt/Î² catenin signaling in intestinal and   mammary cancer stemness,S35.,"Gaspar1, P. Franken1, C. Breukel2, L. Molenaar1, R. Smits1, M. van der Valk3,  R. Fodde1","1Dept.of Pathology, Josephine Nefkens Institute, Erasmus University Medical  Center, Rotterdam, The Netherlands, 2Center for Human & Clinical Genetics,  Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Department of ESHG Plenary Lectures Experimental Animal Pathology, The Netherlands Cancer Institute, Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. ","Breast and colon cancers are generally thought to arise from normal  epithelial tissues through a stepwise accumulation of genetic alterations  in oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes . However, this model  does not take into account other essential characteristics of human  cancers, namely their vast intratumor cellular heterogeneity and the  role played by a minority of cells, the cancer stem cells, in determining local invasion into surrounding tissues and distant organ sites . The  Wnt/Î² catenin signal transduction pathway is known to play a central  role in self renewal and differentiation during embryonic development, and in the maintenance of many stem cell niches in adulthood .  Accordingly, mutations in several Wnt genes are rate limiting to trigger tumorigenesis in the corresponding tissues . To study how different dosages of Wnt signaling activation may  influence multi organ tumorigenesis, we have generated several  hypomorphic alleles of the Apc tumor suppressor gene by gene  targeting . Notably, while in general Apc mutations result in intestinal  cancer both in man and mouse, the novel Apc1572T mutation, resulting  in a 175 kDa truncated protein lacking the axin binding motifs but still  encompassing 3 Î² catenin down regulating domains, does not lead to predisposition to intestinal tumors . However, the majority of  Apc+/ 1572T females spontaneously develop multi focal and rapidly growing  mammary tumors . Notably, Apc1572T mammary tumors also form lung  metatstases . Both the primary tumors and their metastases were  found to encompass myoepithelial, squamous, and luminal epithelial  types, and were classified as lobular carcinomas with different degrees of metaplastic squamous differentiation . As previously observed for  intestinal cancers, intracellular Î² catenin accumulation, the earmark  of canonical Wnt signaling activation, was found to be heterogeneous within the tumor mass . However, when lung micro metastases (20  100 cells in size) were analyzed by IHC and compared with the  macrometastases and with the primary mammary lesions, differentiation  was found to be significantly reduced whereas almost every cell  showed cytoplasmatic and/or nuclear Î² catenin accumulation. These  results indicate that the specific Wnt signaling dosage encoded by the  Apc1572T mutation differentially affects homeostasis of the mammary  stem cell compartment and triggers tumor initiation, progression, and metastasis possibly by activating cancer stem cells . These novel  data will be discussed also in view of recent results from our and Dr . S . Robineâs (Paris, France) laboratories indicating a similar role  for Wnt/Î² catenin signaling in establishing cancer stem cells in an  Apc1638N/KRASV12G mouse model for intestinal tumorigenesis and liver  metastases (KP Janssen, et al ., submitted ) . s36.interference with signal transduction events emanating  from the ErbB2 receptor sensitizes breast cancer cells to taxol  induced cell death B. Groner , C. Borghouts, C. Kunz;   Georg Speyer Haus, Institute for Biomedical Research, Frankfurt, Germany. The ErbB2 receptor tyrosine kinase is overexpressed in approximately  30 percent of breast tumor cases and its overexpression correlates with an unfavorable prognosis . A major contributor to this course of the disease is the insensitivity of these tumors towards chemotherapy  .  Monoclonal antibodies, inhibiting the ligand induced activation of  the receptor and tyrosine kinase inhibitors acting on the intrinsic  enzymatic activity of the intracellular domain have been developed  as targeted drugs. Both have been shown to be beneficial for breast  cancer patients. We targeted a third aspect of receptor function; its association with intracellular signaling components . For this purpose  we selected peptide aptamers which specifically interact with defined domains of the intracellular part of the receptor  . The peptide aptamers  were selected from a random peptide library using a yeast two hybrid  system with the intracellular tyrosine kinase domain of ErbB2 as a bait construct . We investigated the functional consequences of the aptamer interaction with the ErbB2 receptor within tumor cells . The aptamer  sequences were either expressed intracellularly or introduced into the cells as recombinant aptamer proteins . The aptamers co localized with the intracellular domain of ErbB2 within cells . They reduced the extent of AKT kinase induction upon heregulin treatment of the cells . AKT is  a signaling component downstream of the heregulin induced ErbB2 ErbB3 heterodimer in MCF 7 breast cancer cells . High AKT activity is responsible for the enhanced resistance of ErbB2 overexpressing cancer cells towards chemotherapeutic agents . Peptide aptamer  interference with AKT activation resulted in the restoration of regular sensitivity of breast cancer cells to taxol . s37.On genes speech and language S. Fisher ;   Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, Oxford University, Oxford, United  Kingdom. Genes that are implicated in speech and language impairment can  provide molecular windows into neural mechanisms contributing to human communication . We have shown that people who have FOXP2  missense or nonsense mutations develop major problems with  controlling the complicated mouth movements needed for speech,  along with deficits in many aspects of language and grammar. The  gene encodes a conserved transcription factor that appears to help  regulate development of a subset of neuronal circuits in a wide range  of non speaking vertebrates, but evidence suggests that its role may  have been modified during human evolution. It is emphasised that  FOXP2 is not the mythical âgene for languageâ, but instead represents one piece of a complex evolutionary puzzle, involving multiple factors .  My laboratory are using FOXP2 as an entry point for investigating  neuronal pathways underlying speech and language acquisition, by  adopting a range of complementary functional genetic techniques, from cell lines to mutant mice . The FOXP2 story shows that understanding  of language origins requires a multidisciplinary perspective, integrating  psychology, neuroscience, genetics, developmental biology and evolutionary anthropology  . s38.molecular, cellular, and circuit mechanisms underlying the  storage of remote memories in cortical networks A. J. Silva ;   Departments of Neurobiology, Psychiatry and Psychology, Brain Research  Institute, University of California, Los Angeles, CA, United States. While the molecular, cellular and systems mechanisms required for  the initial processing of memory have been intensively investigated, those underlying remote storage remain elusive . I will present  neuroanatomical, pharmacological and genetic results demonstrating  that specific areas of the cortex play a critical role in remote memory.  Imaging of activity dependent genes shows that specific areas of the  cortex are activated by remote memory and that this activation is impaired by a null alpha CaMKII mutation that blocks remote memory  .  Accordingly, reversible inactivation of specific cortical structures in normal mice disrupts remote memory without affecting recent memory  .  Additionally, a genetic screen revealed several mutations that affect  specifically remote memory without disrupting acquisition or initial hippocampal dependent consolidation . s39.Dyslexia G. Schulte KÃ¶rne ;   Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry and Psychotherapy, Philipps  University, Marburg, Germany. Dyslexia is a specific disorder in learning to read and spell which is  not the direct result of other disorders such as mental retardation or  lesser impairments in general intelligence, gross neurological deficits,  uncorrected visual or auditory problems, or emotional disturbances or inadequate schooling .  A genetic involvement in dyslexia has long been evident from studies  showing familial clustering of the disorder and more recently through  twin studies. Linkage studies have identified several chromosomal regions of interest . Genetic loci have been mapped to at least nine different chromosomes (DYX1 DYX9) by several independent studies .  Candidate genes have so far been proposed for DYX1(DYX1C1, ROBO1) and DYX2 (VMP, DCDC2, KIAA0319, TTRAP, THEM2) . One of the major difficulties in dissecting the genetic aetiology of  learning disorders is that the clinical definitions comprise a number of heterogeneous conditions and phenocopies . In order to investigate  genetically informative endophenotypes in a German multicenter study  a broad spectrum of dyslexia related phenotypes including phonological  decoding, phoneme awareness, orthographic processing, short term  memory, rapid naming and mathematical abilities were investigated in large sample of 287 German dyslexia families . The interrelationship ESHG Plenary Lectures0 between the component phenotypes using correlation and principal  component analyses (PCA), estimated familiality for phenotypes as  well as for the factors suggested by PCA were investigated .In the future, a multidisciplinary project (www  .neurodys .com) will  investigate the biological basis of dyslexia by mapping dyslexia  susceptibility genes, identifying risk conferring genes used to  understand gene gene and gene environment interactions and gene  specific contributions to a variety of neurobiological correlates of dyslexia . Further, the environmental risk factors will be investigated  and the neuroscientific basis providing the prerequisites of reading  and spelling development and the central stages of becoming a fluent reader will be studied . These combined efforts will improve the basis for the development of successful diagnostics and therapies . s40.New insights into molecular genetics of ARVc B. Gerull ;   Max Delbrueck Center for Molecular Medicine, Berlin Buch, Germany. Patients with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC)  often present with unexplained ventricular arrhythmias, syncope or sudden cardiac death, the most feared clinical manifestation of disease .  ARVC is pathologically characterized by progressive replacement of  cardiac myocytes with fibrofatty tissue and occurs in rare syndromic and, more commonly, non syndromic forms . Syndromic forms of ARVC (e .g . Naxos disease and others) are caused by mutations in plakoglobin or desmoplakin . Non syndromic forms are mostly transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait . Three rare disease genes  encoding the cardiac ryanodine receptor, TGFÃ3 and desmoplakin can cause autosomal dominant transmitted ARVC . Additional disease loci have been suggested containing still unknown ARVC disease genes .  Recently we have identified a very common disease gene for ARVC,  plakophilin 2 ( PKP2 ) . Based on observations that Pkp2 deficient mice died early between  E10 11 due to reduced trabeculation, disarrayed cytoskeleton, ruptured  cardiac walls with blood leakage into the pericardial cavity, we screened  ARVC patients for defects in PKP2  . In 32 of 120 ARVC (26%) patients  insertion, deletion, nonsense, missense, and splice site mutations  were identified in the human PKP2  gene . Western blot analyses in a  case of a deletion PKP2  mutation revealed reduced amounts of PKP2  suggesting haploinsufficiency as genetic mechanism. The observation  of severely affected adolescents (including young individuals suffering  from sudden cardiac death) and mutation carriers who remained  healthy until old age points to a highly variable disease penetrance in  the presence of PKP2  mutations . s41.the role of tbx1 in DiGeorge syndrome A. Baldini , Z. Zhang, L. Chen, F. Vitelli, E. A. Lindsay;   Institute for Biosciences and Technologies, Texas A&M University Health Sci   ences Center, Houston, TX, United States. The 22q11 .2 Deletion / DiGeorge syndrome (DGS) is a relatively common  âgenomicâ disorder that results from heterozygous deletion of a 3 Mbp segment of chromosome 22 . Of the more than 30 genes deleted in this  syndrome, TBX1  is the only one that has been found to be mutated  in some patients with a DGS like phenotype, suggesting that TBX1   haploinsufficiency is a major contributor to the syndromeâs phenotype.  The main cardiovascular abnormalities in DGS and Tbx1  mouse mutants  concern the aortic arch and the cardiac outflow tract (OFT). Using a  series of engineered alleles of Tbx1  in the mouse, we have gathered data  suggesting that the pathogenetic mechanisms underlying the two types of defects are different . Aortic arch and great arteries patterning is more  sensitive to Tbx1 dosage than OFT morphogenesis, and requires Tbx1  in  pharyngeal epithelia early in embryonic development . OFT morphogenesis  requires Tbx1  function in the pharyngeal mesoderm and at a slightly  later developmental stage . Tbx1 is required, cell non autonomously, for  the formation of the pharyngeal arch arteries that later remodel into the aortic arch . An  Fgf8 Tbx1  interaction is critical for the remodeling of these  arteries . Concerning OFT development, our data demonstrated that Tbx1   is required to sustain proliferation of cardiomyocyte precursors destined to the OFT  . Loss of function of the gene in those cells resulted in severe  morphogenetic defects of the OFT  . In addition, cell fate mapping experiments  showed that Tbx1  mutation also affects cell lineage distribution within the  right ventricle, a potential mechanism for the observed malalignment of the ventricles with the OFT  .s42.concepts of cardiac development A. Moorman ;   Department of Anatomy & Embryology, Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam,  The Netherlands. In this presentation we discuss the formation of the synchronously  contracting chambered heart from a peristaltically contracting linear heart tube . It is proposed that members of the T box family of  transcription factors play a crucial role in the formation of the building plan of the formed heart . Tbx5 may confer veno arterial polarity to the  heart tube, whereas Tbx2 initially and Tbx3 in later developmental  stages prevent the cardiac inflow tract, atrioventricular region,  outflow tract, as well as the cardiac inner curvatures from chamber  differentiation. With the exception of the outflow tract that becomes  incorporated into the ventricles, these regions contribute to the cardiac  conduction system. Tbx1 specifically is involved in the formation of  the outflow tract, whereas Tbx18 is involved in the formation of the systemic venous tributaries . One of the most fascinating aspects in the formation of the heart  is the very early development of the electrical patterning as can be  registered by the ECG, which is the registration of the rhythmic waves of depolarising activity over the cardiac muscle . In the mature heart  the conduction system is held responsible for the rhythmic excitations and contractions . However, in chicken embryos a sinusoidal type of  ECG can already be derived from the linear heart tube stages at about  two days of development onward, and less than one day later when  chamber formation has just been initiated, an adult type of ECG can be monitored . The question can thus justifiably be asked whether the presence of an  adult type of ECG in these early embryonic hearts implies the presence  of a conduction system. Generally, the conduction system is defined as  the system of specialized myocardial tissues responsible for initiation and propagation of the sinus impulse . If we accept this functional  definition, then the early embryonic heart has a conduction system, which is already in place, because there is an adult type of ECG . On  the other hand, if we would apply strict anatomical and histological  definitions, the embryonic heart undeniably lacks a conduction system.  This field of tension concerning the recognition of the conduction  system using physiological versus anatomical / histological criteria has  led to many controversies in the field of the development of the âcardiac  specialized tissuesâ, which largely relate to definitions and semantics.  In this contribution we discuss the specification of the embryonic areas  that will become chamber and those areas that will not form chambers  and participate in the formation of the distinct components of the conduction system .

Meitinger1;   1TU Munich, Munich, Germany, 2Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes, Baltimore,  MD, United States, 3GSF National Research Center, Neuherberg, Germany,  4LMU Munich, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich, Germany. Aim: To map QTLs for cardiac repolarization   QT interval (QT)   we performed a genomewide SNP association study using 100k arrays .  QT is normally distributed with heritability >30% and   if unregular   predisposes to sudden cardiac death . Some of its QTLs from candidate gene display strong interaction with gender  . QTc_RAS is QT corrected  for covariates heart rate, age and gender  . Method: From the population based KORA S4 survey (n=3,966 after  exclusion criteria, including n=2,007 women) 103/103 women were selected from QTc_RAS distribution extremes (below 7 .5th and above 92 .5th percentile)   to avoid gender confounding   and were genotyped for 88 .500 SNPs with CR>0 .85 and MAF>0 .025 (phase I) . 60 most  significant SNPs (p<1e 4) were genotyped in additional 200/200  women (phase II). 7 SNPs significant at (p<5e 3) in combined phase I and II where screened in the remaining n=3,366 of S4 (phase III) . Results: Only one SNP in the 5â region of the CAPON/NOS1AP ESHG Concurrent Sessions1 gene clearly exceeded the genomewide significance level (p<1e 7).  We successfully replicated that association in n=2,646 independent  individuals from KORA F3 follow up of survey S3 (p<1e 11) . Conclusions: We identified a QTL of QTc_RAS in the CAPON/NOS1AP gene . The QTL modulates QT interval by about +6 ms and explains 1 .5% of trait variance . Future replication attempts as well as interaction analyses will depend on large datasets . Unravelling the  genuine architecture of human QTLs will help to devise even more  efficient strategies to confirm entire spectra of QTLs for any given human quantitative trait . c02. mutations in the facilitative glucose transporter GLUt10 alter arterial patterning and cause Arterial t ortuosity syndrome P.

Heritable connective tissue disorders comprise a diverse group  of genetic conditions associated with molecular defects involving  structural components of the collagen and elastic fibers. A subset  of these conditions presents with arterial aneurysms, a major cause of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality  . Arterial tortuosity  syndrome (ATS) is an autosomal recessive connective tissue disorder  characterised by arterial tortuosity, elongation, stenosis and aneurysm  formation of the major arteries due to disruption of elastic fibres in the medial layer of the arterial wall . Using homozygosity mapping a candidate gene was mapped in a 4 .1 Mb region on chromosome 20q13 .1 . Haplotype sharing between families originating from the same geographical region narrowed the candidate region to 1 .2 Mb containing 7 genes . Mutations in one of these genes,  SLC2A10 ,  encoding the facilitative glucose transporter GLUT10, were identified  in 6 ATS families. We found that GLUT10 deficiency is associated  with upregulation of the TGFÃ pathway in the arterial wall, a finding  also observed in Loeys Dietz syndrome, in which aortic aneurysms  associate with arterial tortuosity. The identification of a glucose  transporter gene responsible for altered arterial morphogenesis is novel  and surprising in view of the previously suggested link of GLUT10 with type 2 diabetes . Our data might shed new light on the mechanisms  causing micro angiopathic changes associated with diabetes and  suggest that therapeutic compounds intervening with TGFÃ signaling represent a new treatment strategy  . c03.

The phenotype of Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is defined by the  association of retinitis pigmentosa, obesity, polydactyly, hypogenitalism,  renal disease and cognitive impairment. The significant genetic heterogeneity of this condition is supported by the identification,  initially by classical linkage analysis and more recently by comparative  genomics, of nine genes ( BBS1  to 9) implicated in cilia assembly or  function . A large consanguineous Lebanese family living in a small village with 9 individuals affected with Bardet Biedl syndrome was studied . A  classical linkage analysis combined to a SNP homozygosity mapping  analysis identified a complex pattern of mutations in BBS genes. In one  sibship of the pedigree a BBS2  homozygous mutation was identified  and in three other sibships of the same family a mutation was identified in a novel BBS gene . A last sibship with only one affected individual disclosed two mutations in the new gene . The analysis of this family  challenged traditional and SNP linkage because of two loci implicated,  three mutations identified and to date no triallelism. Unlike other BBS genes , the new gene is vertebrate specific and  would have been missed by comparative genomics approaches that were successful for other BBS genes . This gene is mutated in at  least 20 % of families , a level similar to the BBS1 gene and much  higher than for the other known BBS genes, with immediate diagnostic consequences . c04. A genome wide sNP association study of rheumatoid  arthritis (RA) validates the DNA pooling approach J. S. Lanchbury1, A. Gutin1, V. Abkevich1, T. Merriman2, S. Steer3, K. Timms1,  T. Tran1, D. Shattuck1, M. Skolnick1;   1Myriad Genetics, Inc., Salt Lake City, UT, United States, 2University of Otago,  Auckland, New Zealand, 3GKT School of Medicine, Kingâs College, London,  United Kingdom. The human genome can now be screened for 500,000 or more SNPs using microarray based technologies . Cost is a major barrier  to widespread application of these tools for complex disease genetic association studies . We developed a robust, cost effective DNA  pooling approach to genome wide SNP analysis using the Affymetrix  Centurion and Illumina Infinium microarrays and tested whether we  could detect the association signals for HLA and PTPN22 loci in two RA populations . Power to detect an association depends strongly on precise  measurement of the hybridization intensities and the corresponding allele frequencies . We developed a new approach to estimate allele frequency with high precision . Using this approach the allele frequency  for a typical SNP on Affymetrix Centurion and Illumina Infinium microarrays can be estimated with standard deviation of 2 .0 2 .5% . We compared power to detect association using our DNA pooling  approach with power to detect association based on individual genotyping . The difference between the two approaches was 2% in a modeled example which will be presented . We hybridized pooled DNA from RA patients and appropriate controls from New Zealand and United Kingdom . Using a strategy that evaluates  consistency of association signal across the two populations, SNPs  close to HLA DRA and PTPN22 showed significant evidence of genome wide association . The combination of random (Affymetrix)  and gene targeted (Illumina) sets of SNP markers offers an enhanced opportunity for genome wide discovery  . The minimal loss of power  using the DNA pooling approach facilitates the widespread use of  high content SNP microarrays for a variety of disease association and population genetics applications . c05. copy Number Variation of NCF1  Gene is associated with  Rheumatoid Arthritis but not with Psoriatic Arthritis U. D. HÃ¼ffmeier1, H. Burkhardt2, C. T. Thiel1, J. Lascorz1, M. Streiter1, B.  BÃ¶hm2, R. Holmdahl3, H. Schulze Koops2, A. Reis1;   1Human Genetics, University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, 2Institute for  Clinical Immunology and Rheumatology, Department of Internal Medicine III,  University of Erlangen, Erlangen, Germany, 3Section for Medical Inflammation  Research, Lund University, Lund, Sweden. OBJECTIVE: Loss of NCF1 gene , encoding one of the subunits of  the NADPH oxidase complex, occurs due to unequal crossing over  with one of the two neighbouring pseudogenes in some patients with autosomal recessive chronic granulomatous disease (CGD) . In a rat  model of arthritis a missense polymorphism of Ncf1 was associated  with arthritis severity and shown to reduce the oxidative burst of the NADPH complex . We hypothesized that lower copy number of  NCF1  ESHG Concurrent Sessions might be a susceptibility factor for arthritic disease . METHODS: To determine copy number variation we developed a  quantitative PCR multiplex assay based on Taqman technology  . Three  cohorts   199 rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, 375 psoriatic arthritis patients (PSA), 282 controls   were screened . RESULTS: Performance was robust in the majority of DNAs, but as in previous quantitative methods DNA quality was critical . Interestingly, copy number varied between 1 5 gene copies . In all cohorts we observed a higher frequency of heterozygous deletion carriers (1 .1 9 .1  %) than expected from previously reported estimations of heterozygous carriers of CGD (0 .2 % or 1:500) . Fisherâs exact test revealed a highly  significant difference between RA patients and controls: 9.1 % vs. 1.1 % (p < 4 .9 x 10  5), while frequency of NCF1 deletion carriers in PSA  patients was similar to controls . CONCLUSIONS: Our observation of reduced NCF1  copy number  as a susceptibility factor for RA is based on relatively small patient  numbers and therefore needs independent confirmation. If confirmed  our findings provide evidence of an involvement of NADPH oxidase in the pathogenesis of RA . c06. Breaking loops for linkage analysis in complex pedigrees T. I. Axenovich ;   Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation. Recurrent inbreeding is a common feature in various populations,  including isolated and immigrant populations resulting in pedigree loops and high frequency of recessive diseases . Likelihood based linkage analysis is a conventional approach to genetic mapping . The Elston  Stewart algorithm used for complex pedigrees, however, is sensitive to the presence of pedigree loops . In case of multiple loops, approximate methods are to be used . One of them is based on breaking loops  by coping certain individuals and conditioning of likelihood of zero loop pedigree on phenotypes of copied individuals . The selection of breakers is usually based on the number of their possible genotypes .  This approach is not effective when many members of pedigree are unobserved or when large number of loci are analysed . We propose to select the loop breakers on the basis of loss of pedigree informativity induced by loop breaking . We used the classical graph theory Kruskal approach for selection of optimal loop breakers . In  our method a pedigree is represented as a graph with edges wich  correspond to the people who are the members of two nuclear families  and thus connect them. The weight of each edge is defined based on  the loss of pedigree informativity as measured by mean relationship after the elimination of this edge from the graph . We estimated  the loss of pedigree informativity in a series of inbred families with  hundreds of loops under different algorithms of loop breaking and demonstrated that our algorithm provides minimal loss of information .

We studied late onset Alzheimerâs disease (LOAD) in a young, genetically isolated population from the Southwest of the Netherlands .  Extensive genealogy was collected, resulting in a complex pedigree containing 103 LOAD patients and their 4,645 relatives . This genealogy provides a unique opportunity to identify LOAD loci .  However, utilization of such a pedigree in multipoint linkage analysis is computationally challenging . We aimed to develop a new algorithm to  cut the entire pedigree into computable sub units and conduct linkage analysis of LOAD . The algorithm developed clustered all patients into 35 sub pedigrees, which accounted for 87 .5% of the complete genealogic information . Subsequently, we performed a genome wide search under a dominant model using age dependent penetrances .  We confirmed four known loci on chromosomes 1 (LOD = 4.2 between D1S498 and D1S484), 6 (LOD = 2 .9 between D6S1610 and D6S257), 10 (LOD = 2 .6 between D10S1686 and D10S185) and 12 (LOD = 1 .7  between D12S345 and D12S85). We also identified two novel loci on chromosome 3 (LOD = 4 .3 at D3S1569) and 7 (LOD = 3 .2 between D7S484 and D7S510) . These linkage signals are currently under  further investigation by fine mapping. In conclusion, we developed  an algorithm that can split large pedigrees into manageable sub units and preserves maximum in",2006
"Aggressive fibromatosis, pathways that cross talk with Wnt  signaling",C23.,"Amini Nik , K. Van Dam, R. PourEbrahim, H. Xavier Zambrano Manrique, S.  Tejpar, J. J. Cassiman","University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Desmoid tumors, also known as aggressive fibromatosis, are rare  fibroblastic tumors that exhibit a wide range of local aggressiveness, from largely indolent to locally destructive . Although, we have already  shown constitutive activation of Wnt pathway in Desmoid tumors due  to APC or B Catenin mutation, our recent data revealed involvement  of some other signaling pathways like TGF/BMP signaling pathways in pathogenesis of Desmoid tumors . Western blot analysis revealed  over expression of phospho smad2 in desmoids in compare to control tissue (Fascia) of same patient . Induction of TGF signaling pathway  in normal human fibroblast, increased total and active form of Beta Catenin and consequently increased proliferation in these cells .  Over induction or blocking of TGF B signaling pathway in Desmoid cells changed their behavior particularly BrdU incorporation  .Using  transfection assay, TGF B could significantly down regulate IGFBP6  promoter (One of the direct target genes of Wnt B Catenin which is  highly down regulated in Desmoid tumors) in different cell line, while  it could up regulate TOPflash activity. The cross talk between these pathways leads us to a proposed Vogel gram for Desmoid tumors . c24. Genome wide analysis to unravel the molecular  mechanisms behind vitamin D resistance J. L. Costa1, P. Eijk1, M. Tijssen1, J. Narvaez2, J. Welsh2, B. Ylstra1;   1VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2University of  Notre Dame, Notre Dame, IN, United States. The role of vitamin D (1,25 dihydroxyvitamin D3) in cancer was  suggested by a strong epidemiological association between prostate,  breast, and colon cancer and vitamin D deficiency, and is thought to be a consequence of its anti proliferative action . We have initiated studies where we employ genomic approaches to unveil the genetics behind the anti tumorigenic action of vitamin D .  In our studies, we made use of the breast tumor cell line MCF 7 of  which four independent biological vitamin D resistant replicates were produced . Vitamin D resistance was studied with a variety of genomic  techniques; including expression arrays, NMD arrays and oligo CGH arrays . We, and others, have shown that studying drug resistance using  different array techniques may point directly towards pivotal genes underlying cancer progression . For the experiments RNA and DNA  from all 4 resistant cell lines was hybridized directly with the respective  RNA/DNA of the parental cell line onto human oligonucleotide (60 mer) arrays of 30 .000 probes . The oligo array CGH experiments pointed to an area in chromosome 11q as candidate region of DNA copy number changes . Parallel  expression analysis on the 30K oligo arrays revealed that no single  significant gene was involved in the acquired resistance. Instead a set  of genes was consistently altered, which led us to employ pathway analysis in the search for common signatures . The deregulation of  the pathway involving EGFR (epithelium growth factor receptor) was  identified in this analysis, indicating an important role for the EGFR pathway in the anti tumorigenic effect of vitamin D . c25. the major epigenetic effect of the histone deacetylase  inhibitor butyrate is a paradoxical decrease in promoter histone  acetylation and decrease in gene activity. A. Rada Iglesias1, A. Ameur2, S. Enroth2, C. Koch3, N. Carter3, D. Vetrie3, I.  Dunham3, J. Komorowski2, C. Wadelius1;   1Rudbeck Laboratory, Uppsala, Sweden, 2Linnaeus Centre for Bioinformatics,  Uppsala, Sweden, 3Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute, Cambridge, United King   dom. Butyrate is a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) and chemical derivatives are used in clinical trials . It is structurally similar to valproic  acid and phenylbutyrate that are approved for treatment of epilepsy and cancer  . HDACi treatment increases the overall acetylation of histones,  which is supposed to reactivate epigenetically silenced genes . The  liver cell line HepG2 was treated for 12h with sodium butyrate, which dramatically increased the total levels of acetylated H3 and H4 .  Distribution of AcH3 and AcH4 was characterised by ChIP chip in 1%  of the human genome as defined in the ENCODE project. The major ESHG Concurrent Sessions and surprising finding was that 100 150 regions with high AcH3 and  AcH4 suffered a pronounced deacetylation after treatment, many of  them located around transcription start sites. ChIP and locus specific  PCR was performed on a time series and confirmed 11/11 analysed  regions . For each of these promoters the expression of the gene was analysed and was found to be down regulated . ChIP chip analysis of  H3 and H3K4me showed that nucleosome loss could not explain the results . ChIP of RNA PolII suggested that transcription initiation and/ or elongation may be affected. Immunofluorescence analysis showed  that the increase in total histone acetylation was localized to the nuclear periphery and it may be located in heterochromatic regions .  It is probable that also other HDACiâs may have this effect on histone acetylation in euchromatic regions . Our results indicate that they  should be analysed in a similar way and that pre assumptions about their molecular mechanisms of action might need to be revised . c26. Birt Hogg Dube : A syndrome the geneticist should know C. D. DeLozier1,2, T. Treisman1, Y. Chang3, D. Tashjian4, T. McCalmont5, C. J.

In our full service genetics consultation we see approximately 200 families/year for assessment of a hereditary predisposition to cancer  .  Most consultations concern breast /ovarian or colorectal cancers, and most gene testing comes back negative . Although textbooks suggests  that ârare cancer predisposition syndromesâ account for less than one  percent of familial aggregation of cancer, our experience suggests that syndromic entities may well be under diagnosed . One such condition  is the Birt Hogg Dube (BHD) syndrome, due to mutations in the  presumed tumor suppressor gene folliculin (FCN) on chromosome 17p . BHD is best known to dermatologists because of skin lesions  with characteristic histology: fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas and  acrochordons. Renal tumors, specifically oncocytomas and papillary  renal cell carcinomas, are highly characteristic of BHD, which also  predisposes to spontaneous pneumothorax/ pulmonic cysts and to benign and malignant tumors of the uterus, ovaries, breast and colon .  We describe here the clinical, genetic and histological features of  three families with BHD syndrome presenting to the cancer genetics consultation in the same year  . All adults over 30 had typical facial and  thoracic skin lesions and each family had at least one person with a benign or malignant kidney tumor  . Two families had pneumothorax .  We believe that a thorough physical exam and the conscientious  histological verification of benign and malignant tumors in individuals  attending the cancer genetics clinic, will result in improved detection of this under diagnosed cancer predisposition syndrome .",2006
Identification of methylation and expression abnormalities  associated with breast cancer.,C27.,"V. Strelnikov1,2, E. B. Kuznetsova1, M. V. Nemtsova1,2, D. V. Zaletayev1,2","1Molecular Medicine Institute, I.M.Sechenov Moscow Medical Academy, Mos   cow, Russian Federation, 2Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Russian  Academy of Medical Sciences, Moscow, Russian Federation. ","We have elaborated a novel modification of arbitrary primed methylation  sensitive PCR to identify CpG islands (CGIs) abnormally methylated  in breast cancer (BC). By use of this technique we have identified  CGIs belonging to SEMA6B , BIN1 , VCPIP1 , LAMC3 , KCNH2 , RPSA ,  CACNG4  and PSMF1  genes . Methylation frequencies in 108 BC  samples were evaluated by methylation sensitive PCR and/or direct sequencing of bisulphite treated DNA (table1) . By means of bisulphite  sequencing we have constructed fine methylation maps for parts of  the identified genesâ promoter CGIs demonstrating individual cytosine methylation patterns characteristic for each . Methylation mapping  revealed nonrandom distribution of methylated cytosines across the  CGIs with certain regions within the same island being frequently and some rarely/never methylated in BC . Methylation was not restricted to the core regions of CGIs . Thus, in  BIN1  the intronic part of the promoter  CGI showed abnormal methylation, while its core region was never  methylated, which had led other authors to an erroneous conclusion of absence of BIN1  methylation in cancer, which was discordant with the  observation of its reactivation after 5 aza 2â deoxycytidine treatment .  Expression patterns were evaluated for every of the genes under study (table1, 16 BC samples versus their normal counterparts) . Discussion  of the structural/functional features of the CGIs and the patterns of expression of corresponding genes in BC will be presented .

Loci of shared segmental aneuploidy in the genomes of healthy and mentally retarded subjects detected by Array cGH M. Poot , M. J. Eleveld, R. Hochstenbach, H. K. Ploos van Amstel;   Department Medical Genetics, 3508 AB Utrecht, The Netherlands. By genome wide segmental aneuploidy profiling with a 3,782 BAC  array we detected in a panel of 131 unrelated affected children and 21  of their unaffected parents on average 35 autosomal loci of segmental  aneuploidy (SA) per subject. In total, we identified 696 distinct loci of SA that were shared among patients and parents . These loci occur  as deletion, duplication, or both, in frequencies up to 45% within our study population . Subjects of Turkish and Arab/Berber origin showed  significant overlap with Caucasians (87% and 92%, respectively). Plots  of the cumulative number of shared loci of SA indicate that their total  number may be finite. Loci of SA were distributed in the euchromatin with equal densities among Giemsa light and Giemsa dark bands .  Out of the 68 most frequently occurring loci of SA, 21 contained sites  of segmental duplication on the same chromosome, while 31 and 63  BAC clones were flanked by segmental duplications within a distance of 1 and 2 Mb, respectively  . Comparison with a set of 39 randomly  chosen BAC clones showed highly significant association of loci of SA with segmental duplications (p values of 0 .0001, 0 .0012 and <0 .0001, respectively) . Our data are consistent with the hypothesis that most  loci of SA have been generated through non allelic homologous recombination mediated by intrachromosomal sites of homology  .  Since loci of SA occur frequently in the general population, they should  be taken into account before clinical conclusions are to be drawn  upon detection of segmental aneuploidies in patients with congenital abnormalities or mental retardation . c29.

Recent studies have revealed a new type of genetic variation in the  human genome encompassing relatively large genomic segments (~100 kb   2 .2 Mb) 1 4 . These variations are referred to as copy number  variations (CNVs) . The full nature and extent of CNVs in terms of their  genomic locations and frequencies in different ethnic populations is still largely unknown . Here we describe the use of MLPA 5 for  determining the frequencies of 12 regions of recurrent CNV recently  detected by array CGH3,4. More than 300 individuals from five different ESHG Concurrent Sessions ethnic populations, including three distinct European, one Asian and  one African population, were tested for the occurrence of CNV using  at least one sequence unique MLPA primer pair per genomic region .  Seven of these regions showed extensive CNV in all populations,  including the Î² defensin gene cluster (8p23.1), the TBC1D3  region  (17q12), and (part of) the NSF gene (17q21 .31) . For the NSF locus,  ~70% of individuals showed copy numbers different from the median, with estimated copy numbers varying between 2 and 7 . Furthermore,  we detected different copy number distributions of the NSF gene  between populations, suggesting that this locus is under selective pressure . Future studies will be aimed at the effect of recurrent CNVs  on gene expression levels and their potential involvement in human health and disease . 1Sebat et al.

Gerstein1;   1Yale University School of Medicine, New Haven, CT, United States, 2European  Molecular Biology Laboratory, Heidelberg, Germany, 3Yale University, New  Haven, CT, United States. Large scale copy number polymorphisms (CNPs) represent an  abundant form of genomic variation in humans (1 3) and are likely  to be of increasing importance in molecular studies related to human diversity and disease (4) . While existing technologies allow  the detection of SNPs and small (<<1kb) deletions and insertions, the precise boundaries of larger CNPs have remained inaccessible .  We have developed a combined computational and experimental  approach that involves high resolution oligonucleotide tiling array data  processing, and a data mining strategy utilizing custom Gaussian  Hidden Markov Models, enabling the systematic discovery of CNP  boundaries across the human chromosomes 21, 22, X, and Encode regions . Predicted breakpoints are validated by DNA sequencing  following PCR or vectorette PCR amplification. Previously, breakpoint  validation for genomic alterations detected on chromosomes 22 and 11 showed that boundaries are predicted with an accuracy <500 bp (ref . 5) . We apply the approach on high resolution comparative genome  hybridization data from various patients and healthy individuals, utilizing  chromosome specific oligonucleotide tiling arrays (~400,000 probes) with average probe spacing <100 bp . Our initial results suggests that  the approach will help discriminate disease variants indistinguishable by technologies currently applied in clinics .1 . Sebat J, Lakshmi B  et al.

In mammals four Daf 16 homologues are present: Foxo1a,  Foxo3a, Foxo4 and Foxo6. Here we present the first data about the  influence of human Foxo1a and Foxo3a on disease at old age and lifespan . This study was carried out in the population based Leiden  85 plus Study consisting of 1245 participants aged 85 years and older, with a follow up of 5489 person years . Based on HapMap, 3 htSNPs  from Foxo1a and 9 htSNPs defining two haplotype blocks from Foxo3a were chosen . In addition 1 SNP from Foxo1a and 2 SNPs from Foxo3a were selected to describe the area before the haplotype block . The  haplotype analyses of Foxo1a revealed that carriers of 221 haplotype have higher Hba1C levels compared to 111 carriers (5 .90 (0 .02) vs . 5.70 (0.01), p=0.025), which was accompanied by a non significant trend for higher prevalence of myocardial infarction and diabetes . In addition, the 221 carriers had higher all cause (1 .08 (1 .00 1 .17)), non cardiovascular (1 .11 (1 .01 1 .22)), and other cause of mortality (1 .18 (1 .04 1 .33)) . In block 1 of the Foxo3a, carriers of the 1112 haplotype had higher risk for stroke (1 .92 (1 .19 3 .08)), but lower for myocardial infarction (0 .61 (0 .37 0 .99)) compared to the 1111 haplotype carriers . The same participants had higher all cause (1 .09 (1 .00 1 .19)) and stroke (1 .28 (1 .03 1 .60)) mortality  . No associations with the Foxo3a  block 2 or with the SNPs before the haplotype blocks were found .

Identification and Functional Analysis of CITED2 Mutations in Patients with congenital Heart Defects,C32.,"Hammer1, C. H. Grimm1, I. Dunkel1, S. Mebus2, H. Sperling2, A. Ebner3, R.  Galli1, H. Lehrach1, C. Fusch3, F. Berger2, S. Sperling1","1Max Planck Institute for Moleculare Genetics, Berlin, Germany, 2German Heart  Center Berlin, Berlin, Germany, 3Ernst Moritz Arndt University, Greifswald,  Germany","We present for the first time functionally relevant mutations of CITED2   in patients with congenital heart defects (CHD) (Sperling et al . Human Mutation 26(6), 575 582, 2005) . Recent reports have demonstrated  that mice lacking the transcription factor Cited2 die in utero showing various cardiac malformations .  CITED2  encodes a CBREBBP/EP300  interacting transcriptional modulator of HIF1A and TFAP2 . To study the potential impact of sequence variations in CITED2  for  CHD in human, we screened a cohort of 392 well characterized  patients and 192 control individuals using DHPLC, sequencing  and Amplifluorâ¢ genotyping techniques. We identified 15 CITED2   nucleotide alterations, thereof seven alterations that were only found  in CHD patients and not detected in controls including three mutations leading to alterations of the amino acid sequence (p .Ser170_Gly178del, p .Gly178_Ser179ins9, p .Ser198_Gly199del) . All three of the amino  acid changing mutations cluster in the serine glycine rich junction of the protein to which so far no functionality had been assigned . Here we  show that these mutations significantly reduce the capacity of CITED2 to transrepress HIF1A, additionally the p .Ser170_Gly178del mutation  significantly diminishes TFAP2C coactivation. This reveals a modifying role for the serine glycine rich region in CITED2 function . In summary,  these observed mutations occurring in patients with septal defects  indicate the causative impact of CITED2  in the development of CHD  in human . c33. mutations in Desmoglein 2 gene are associated to  arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy K.

Rampazzo1;   1Department of Biology, Padua, Italy, 2Department of Cardio Thoracic vascular  Sciences, Padua, Italy, 3Institute of Pathology, Padua, Italy, 4Department of  Pediatrics, Houston, TX, United States. Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy (ARVC) is a  myocardial disease characterized by progressive myocyte loss and  fibrous and fatty tissue replacement of the right ventricular free wall, which is the substrate for reentrant arrhythmias and sudden death .  The primarily mode of inheritance is autosomal dominant with reduced  and age related penetrance. Five disease genes have been identified  so far, three of them (desmoplakin, plakophilin 2 and plakoglobin) are involved in the desmosomal complex . We hypothesized that mutations in desmoglein 2 (DSG2), the only  desmoglein isoform expressed in cardiac myocytes, may account for ARVC . Sixty ARVC probands were screened for DSG2 mutations by  denaturing high performance liquid chromatography (DHPLC) and  direct sequencing. Ten DSG2 mutations have been identified in 9 patients (15%) . Among the DSG2 mutations, six were missense  (Y86C, G100R, N266S, K294E, E331K, V391I), two insertion deletions  (G678fsX681, E418fsX419), one a nonsense (Q558X) and one a splice site mutation (1181 2A>G) . None of the detected nucleotide changes was found in 560 control chromosomes . An endomyocardial biopsy  was obtained in five patients, showing extensive loss of myocytes with  fibro fatty tissue replacement. In three of them, electron microscopy ESHG Concurrent Sessions investigation was performed, showing intercalated disc paleness,  decreased desmosome number and intercellular gap widening . This is the first demonstration that mutations in DSG2 gene are  associated to ARVC. Based upon current data, we confirm that many forms of ARVC are due to alterations in the desmosome complex . c34. Genotype  Phenotype correlation in Patients with short  stature: Clinical indicators of SHOX Haploinsufficiency G. Rappold1, W. F. Blum2, B. J. Crowe3, R. Roeth1, E. P. Shavrikova4, C.

Short stature affects three in a hundred children . Despite an assumed  extraordinary genetic heterogeneity, mutations in a single gene,  SHOX , which encodes a homeodomain transcription factor involved  in bone growth, are relatively frequently found in patients with short  stature. Haploinsufficiency of the SHOX  gene causes short stature with  varying phenotypes ranging from isolated short stature to Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis and Langer dysplasia . In this study, we assessed  the association between the genotype and phenotype in a large cohort of short children from 14 different countries with an average age of 7 .6 years . Screening of 1641 unrelated children with sporadic or familial  short stature revealed SHOX  mutations in 68 (4 .2%) individuals . While  mean height was not different between patients with and without  SHOX  deficiency ( 2.57 versus  2.58 SDS), detailed anthropometric  measurements in all children revealed several bone deformities  including short forearm and lower leg, cubitus valgus, Madelung  deformity, high arched palate and muscular hypertrophy that differed  significantly (p<0.001). These phenotypic data were analysed and  compared to 33 children with Turner syndrome where haploinsufficiency  of SHOX is thought to be responsible for the height deficit. Different  types of SHOX  mutations (48/70.6% classified as complete deletions,  4/5 .9% as partial deletions and 16/23 .5% as point mutations) were  also compared to the respective phenotype suggesting a tendency  towards a more severe phenotype in individuals with homeodomain missense mutations . Altogether, this study offers a detailed genotype  phenotype comparison in a large cohort of children with short stature  and provides clear quantitative guidelines as to which children call for  testing of the  SHOX gene . c35.

Temple1,3;   1Wessex Clinical Genetics Service, Southampton, United Kingdom, 2Wessex  Regional Genetics Laboratory, Salisbury, United Kingdom, 3Department of Hu   man Genetics, Southampton University, United Kingdom. PTEN related disorder is the preferred term encompassing a group of  syndromes including Bannayan Zonana, Riley Ruvalcaba syndrome (BRR), benign familial macrocephaly and Cowden syndrome . We  present a clinical study of 30 individuals from 18 families with a known PTEN mutation . The patients were ascertained through clinical  geneticists or via the BRR patient group with the aim of documenting  the different clinical presentations dependent on age and deriving information about the national history of the condition . The age range of the probands was between 2 years and 69 years of age . The commonest presentation in childhood was developmental delay  . In adulthood the presentation was more varied and included  cerebellar disease and bowel cancer. Pertinent clinical findings of  the whole cohort included the observations that all patients were  macrocephalic with a head circumference over the 98th centile; four  out of thirty had a diagnosis within the autism spectrum, walking was  delayed with an average age of 20 months and twelve individuals had required speech therapy  . On examination, only one adult had normal  skin . Of fourteen adults who have been investigated eleven have benign thyroid disease . There were no cases of malignant thyroid disease, but one case of breast and colon cancer was observed . In conclusion, we did not demonstrate a genotype phenotype  correlation; variable expression within and between families was seen. Penetrance of the condition is age related . Practical clinical diagnostic and management tools will be discussed .c36. Pattern of p6 mutations and their phenotypes in human  ectodermal dysplasia syndromes T. Rinne , B. C. Hamel, R. Meijer, H. Scheffer, H. van Bokhoven, H. G. Brunner;   Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. Heterozygous mutations in the transcription factor gene p63 are  causative at least for six syndromes with various combinations of ectodermal dysplasia, orofacial clefting and limb malformations .  Symptoms in these syndromes are overlapping, but different enough to be considered as a single syndrome . EEC and AEC syndromes  present a strong genotype phenotype association, whereas association in the other syndromes is more ambiguous . We present the results  of an extensive study, which is based on 227 patients carrying a  p63 mutation. This study confirms previously observed genotype  phenotype associations . Yet, we also demonstrate that a remarkable  phenotypic variation can be recognized in individual syndromes, even  among patients carrying the same p63 mutation . Almost 90% of the EEC syndrome mutations are caused by five mutations . The phenotypic delineation of these âhot spotâ mutations  reveals that each of these five individual mutations imposes different  risks towards specific aspects of the complete phenotypic spectrum.  For example, patients with a R227 mutation rarely have facial clefts, whereas these are seen in >80% of patients with a R304 mutation .  Likewise, kidney and urethral problems were observed in 40% of  patients with an R227 mutation, but never among patients with a  R280 mutation. These and other mutation specific characteristics may  reflect the importance of these amino acids in a certain developmental event .

Common features in these patients are severe mental retardation,  hypotonia, brachycephaly, flat face with hypertelorism, synophrys,  anteverted nares, thickened lower lip and carp mouth with macroglossia and conotruncal heart defects . The minimal critical region responsible  for this 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome has been estimated to be less than 1 Mb . Recently, we have characterised the breakpoints of a de novo   balanced translocation t(X;9)(p11.23;q34.3) in a female with features  strikingly similar to those seen in the 9q  syndrome . The chromosome  9 breakpoint disrupted the Eu HMTase1  gene in the critical region  at 9qter, which encodes Euchromatin Histone Methyl Transferase 1 .  Mouse tissue ISH of Eu HMTase1 , indicates that this gene plays an  essential role in early embryonic development and that it is selectively expressed in adult brain . These observations suggest that disruption  of Eu HMTase1  is causative for the 9q  syndrome . To proof this, we  have developed an MLPA based screening protocol for microdeletions  in the Eu HMTase1  gene . MLPA analysis of a set of about 20 patients  with a clinical presentation reminiscent of the 9q subtelomeric deletion syndrome revealed 4 additional microdeletions . Moreover, we  identified a de novo  nonsense mutation in the Eu HMTase1  gene in a  clinically typical 9q  patient . In conclusion, these results establish that  haploinsufficiency of Eu HMTase1  is causative for the 9q subtelomeric  deletion syndrome .ESHG Concurrent Sessions0 c38.

By full coverage X array CGH we identified a 0.4 Mb duplication at  the MECP2 region in a family with severe mental retardation and  progressive spasticity  . Screening by real time quantitation (qPCR) of  17 additional MR patients with similar phenotypes revealed 3 additional duplications . Female carriers show skewed X inactivation and MECP2  expression levels in PBLs of affected males demonstrated the double  dosage. These findings revealed a yet unidentified mechanism for mental and developmental impairment (Van Esch et al ., AJHG 2005) .  In order to assess the prevalence in the XLMR population we screened  124 randomly selected MR patients as well as 60 patients that were negative for MECP2, L1CAM or ATRX mutations by qPCR . Only  one additional case from the ATRX negative group was identified. In  collaboration with other clinical groups, another 11 carefully selected patients were found which harbor duplications of the MECP2 gene . By  qPCR the location and extent of all 16 duplications were fine mapped up to 5 10 kb resolution . The duplication sizes ranged from 0 .3 to 1 Mb with the smallest overlapping region of 0 .2 Mb only containing the IRAK1 and MECP2 genes . In some patients, the known MR genes SLC6A8, L1CAM or GDI1 were included . Interestingly, all proximal  as well as distal breakpoints seem different which does not point to a common recombination mechanism . Based on this duplication  mapping and the well characterized clinical features of the affected  males, we performed a detailed genotype/phenotype correlation study of which the results will be discussed . c39. Glyc O Genetics of Walker Warburg syndrome and related  disorders J. van Reeuwijk1, S. Maugenre2, C. van den Elzen1, A. Verrips3, E. Bertini4, F.  Muntoni5, L. Merlini6, H. Scheffer1, H. G.

O linked glycosylation defects are the underlying cause for a group  of disorders, which phenotypically are characterized by congenital muscular dystrophy (CMD) with mild to severe brain  and eye anomalies .  Walker Warburg syndrome (WWS) patients display the most severe  developmental defects in this group of disorders, and generally die within  the first year of live. A combined approach of homozygosity mapping  in consanguineous families and candidate gene selection resulted  in identification of mutations in POMT1 , POMT2 , FCMD , and FRKP  .  Mutations in these four genes are causative in nearly one third of all WWS patients in our cohort . Homozygosity data from 12 sporadic WWS cases and four families suggest involvement of multiple other loci . In  order to identify the remaining WWS genes, we are screening genome  wide homozygosity data for candidate loci and use bioinformatics  approaches focused on identification of candidate genes in these loci that functionally interact with known WWS genes . In addition, we aim to  gain more insight in function and characteristics of known WWS genes, i .e . by studying genotype phenotype correlations for genes involved in  WWS and related disorders. Recently this resulted in the identification of  POMT1  mutations in patients with a less severe phenotype than WWS,  characterized by CMD with calf hypertrophy, microcephaly, and mental retardation . We postulate that in these patients one or both transcripts for POMT1 confer residual protein O mannosyltransferase activity  . This  suggests the existence of a disease spectrum of CMD including brain  and eye abnormalities resulting from POMT1  mutations .c40. t ranscriptome plasticity through RNA editing S. Maas1, A. Athanasiadis2,1, R. Kaushal1, N. J. Vendetti1;   1Lehigh University, Bethlehem, PA, United States, 2Massachusetts Institute of  Technology, Cambridge, MA, United States. RNA editing by adenosine deamination, catalyzed by the adenosine  deaminases acting on RNA (ADARs), is a posttranscriptional  mechanism for the regulation of gene expression and particularly widespread in mammals (1) . A to I RNA editing regulates important  functional properties of neurotransmitter receptor genes in the central nervous system by changing single codons in pre mRNA .  The deficiency or misregulation of editing has been implicated in the  etiology of neurological diseases, such as epilepsy, amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), depression and brain tumor progression . We have recently identified Alu repeat elements in the human genome  as a major target for post transcriptional processing by A to I RNA  editing (2). These findings suggest additional roles for RNA editing and  links it to other RNA processing phenomena, such as alternative pre  mRNA splicing as well as siRNA mediated gene silencing and miRNA function (3) . In a new bioinformatics screen we have identified additional candidate  genes for editing and experimentally confirmed cases where editing  alters codons and leads to amino acid changes in the affected proteins . The goal of our current work is to become able to predict which genes  are subject to RNA editing, what additional functions it serves in vivo and how changes in RNA editing contribute to human diseases .1 .

Life without sulfatases: exploiting a mouse model of  multiple sulfatase deficiency C. Settembre1,2, I. Annunziata1, G. Cobellis1,3, M. Sardiello1, A. Ballabio1,4;   1TIGEM  Telethon Institute of Genetics and Medicine, Naples, Italy, 2SEMM    European School of Molecular Medicine, Naples, Italy, 3Seconda Universitaâ  degli Studi di Napoli, Naples, Italy, 4Universitaâ degli Studi di Napoli Federico II,  Naples, Italy. Sulfatases are involved in several biological functions as diverse as  degradation of complex molecules, production of steroid hormones and cell signaling . Humans have 17 different sulfatases . Eight  diseases due to sulfatase deficiencies are known, while little is known  for the nine remaining sulfatases. In Multiple Sulfatase Deficiency  (MSD), the activities of all sulfatases are substantially reduced due  to a defect in their post translational modification. We have identified  the Sulfatase Modifying Factor 1 (SUMF1)  gene which is involved  in the post translational modification of sulfatases and is mutated in patients with MSD . We have now generated a  Sumf1  KO mouse  model . Preliminary analysis of homozygous Sumf1 KO mice revealed  neonatal lethality, severe growth deficiency and massive accumulation of glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) in all examined tissues . The activities  of five sulfatases tested were found completely absent. These data  indicate that sulfatase post translational modification in mammals  absolutely requires SUMF1 , thus excluding alternative mechanisms  and suggesting that the residual sulfatase activities observed in the  patients are the result of hypomorphic SUMF1  mutations . Interestingly,  heterozygous animals had consistently lower levels of all sulfatase  activities compared to their wild type littermates reinforcing our  previous hypothesis of SUMF1  being not only an essential but also a  limiting factor for sulfatase activity  . In this exceptional mouse model, the function of an entire protein  family has been completely abolished, thus offering an unprecedented  opportunity to study disease mechanisms and gene function in mammals . c42. Altered activity of AP 1 transcription factor components  in cystic kidneys of humans and mouse models for Autosomal  Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease. I. S. Lantinga van Leeuwen1, N. H. Le1, A. van der Wal2, W. N. Leonhard1, H.  van Dam3, E. de Heer2, M. H. Breuning1, D. J. M. Peters1;   1Center for Human and Clinical Genetics, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands,  2Department of Pathology, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Department of  Molecular Cell Biology, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands.ESHG Concurrent Sessions1 Autosomal Dominant Polycystic Kidney Disease (ADPKD) is a common  inherited disorder that predominantly manifests with the formation of  fluid filled cysts in both kidneys. The disease is caused by a mutation in  the PKD1 or PKD2  gene . To get insight in the crucial initial pathogenic  events leading to cystogenesis we have created several mouse lines  in which a large part of Pkd1  is either deleted, or flanked by loxP  sites . We also generated mice with a hypomorphic allele with reduced  Pkd1  gene expression, which are viable, showing bilaterally enlarged  polycystic kidneys . Polycystin 1, the PKD1  gene product, has been  implicated in several signaling complexes that are known to regulate  essential cellular functions . We demonstrated previously that aberrant  expression of polycystin 1 results in modification of activator protein 1 (AP 1) transcription factor activity in cultured renal epithelial cells . Also  in cystic kidneys of ADPKD patients and of homozygous hypomorphic  Pkd1  mice, AP 1 activity is altered . Interestingly, small cysts and/or  dilated collecting ducts, representing initial stages of cyst formation,  displayed highest expression levels of activated forms of ATF2, c Jun, and of c Fos . Recently, we generated mice with conditional Pkd1  deletion in renal  epithelial cells, using a tamoxifen inducible, kidney specific Cre  transgene . Biallelic inactivation of Pkd1  in adult mice resulted in a minor  cystic phenotype in the kidneys . However, inactivation of Pkd1  in 4  days old newborn mice resulted in rapid cyst growth. Again, significant up regulation of activated forms of ATF2 and c Jun was observed . Our  data suggest that altered AP 1 activity might play an important role in early cystogenesis . c43. the mutation in the Renin Receptor (A tP6A2) associated  with XMRE (X linked MR epilepsy) significantly reduces ERK 1/2  activation by NGF in neurites J. Walker, K. J. Franek, C. E. Schwartz ;   JC Self Research Institute, Greenwood, SC, United States. A neutral mutation (p .D107D) in the renin receptor (ATP6A2) in a  family with X linked mental retardation and epilepsy (XMRE) resulted  in exclusion of exon 4 (RERÎ4), as it altered an exon splice enhancer site (Ramser et al . HMG, 2005) . In order to further characterize its function and potential role in brain  development, we have transfected both wild type and mutant RER cDNA into rat PC 12 pheochromocytoma cells . The RERwt was  particularly localizated to an area near the nucleus and to the tips of  neural projections. However, RERÎ4 did not appear to accumulate at neurite tips . No other morphological differences between PC 12 cells  expressing RERwt and RERÎ4 were evident. Unstimulated PC 12  cells expressing RERwt exhibited 2 3 fold increased levels of ERK1/2  phosphorylation compared to controls (empty vector transfected PC  12 cells), whereas their RERÎ4 counterparts demonstrated 1/6 the level of ERK1/2 phosphorylation relative to controls . Moreover, nerve  growth factor stimulated RERÎ4 transfected cells exhibited 1/3 the level  of ERK1/2 activation compared to controls and wild type transfected  cells. Thus, RERÎ4 appears to act in a âdominant negativeâ manner to inhibit NGF mediated ERK1/2 phosphorylation . Using differentially  epitope tagged RERwt and RERÎ4, we determined that RERÎ4 can  dimerize with itself (RERÎ4  RERÎ4), as well as with wild type RER  (RERÎ4  RERwt). Together, our data suggest that the RERÎ4 mutation  associated with XMRE may result in a dominant negative form of renin  receptor and may impair the ability of neurites to respond to NGF via  the ERK1/2 pathway. These findings confirm the important role of the RER in cognitive functions . c44. mutant connexin 26 Enhances Epidermal Wound Healing And inhibits Bacterial invasion Y. K. S. Man , C. Trolove, A. Thomas, A. Papakonstantinopoulou, D. Patel, H.  Navsaria, E. A. OâToole, M. A. Curtis, D. P. Kelsell;   Institute of Cell and Molecular Sciences, Queen Maryâs University of London,  London, United Kingdom. A large proportion of recessive non syndromic hearing loss is due  to mutations in the GJB2 gene encoding connexin 26 (Cx26), a component of the gap junction . Within different ethnic groups, there are  specific common recessive mutations each with a carrier frequency of between 1 3 % suggesting a possibility of heterozygous advantage .  Indeed, carriers of the R143W GJB2 allele, the most prevalent in the  African population, present with a thicker epidermis than non carriers and in an in vitro  study we have previously demonstrated that human  keratinocytes expressing R143W Cx26 mutant are protected from cell death compared to wild type Cx26 . In our study, we investigated the  role of wild type Cx26 and R143W Cx26 in epidermal wound healing by focusing on key features of a regenerating epidermis . We show  increased migration and proliferation in cells expressing R143W Cx26 compared to wild type Cx26 counterpart . In addition, R143W Cx26  expressing keratinocytes form a significantly thicker epidermis in an organotypic co culture skin model . We also demonstrate that cells  expressing this mutant Cx26 are significantly less susceptible to cellular  invasion by the enteric pathogen Shigella flexneri  . These studies  demonstrate the advantageous effect of R143W Cx26 in epithelia by  enhancement of cellular aspects of epithelial wound healing and an inhibitory effect on bacterial invasion . These data suggest that loss  of Cx26 expression either through GJB2 mutation or topical inhibition  may have beneficial effects on the rate of wound repair and protection from infection .",2006
Gene expression profiling reveals a new molecular pathway involved in Oculopharyngeal muscular Dystrophy,C45.,"Sterrenburg1, S. J. E. Routledge2, B. M. van der Sluijs3, B. G. van Engelen3,  M.

OPMD is caused by a small expansion  of an alanine (Ala) tract at the N terminus of the nuclear poly(A) binding  protein (PABPN1) and is clinically characterised by progressive ptosis, dysphagia and limb muscle weakness . The pathological hallmark is  the accumulation of unique tubulofilamentous inclusions within the  nuclei of skeletal muscle fibers. These inclusions contain PABPN1 and  also sequester ubiquitin, proteasome subunits and heat shock proteins as well as poly(A) RNA . To model OPMD in a cellular system, we generated stable cell lines  of primary mouse myoblasts expressing either wild type (WT) or 7  alanine expanded (+7Ala) PABPN1 under the control of the muscle  specific human desmin control region. Following fusion into myotubes, these cells form intranuclear inclusions,  which stain for PABPN1, ubiquitin, poly(A)polymerase (PAP) and poly(A) RNA, similar to the pathological hallmarks seen in OPMD patients .  Large scale gene expression analysis reveals a group of genes which is differentially upregulated in a trend comparable to PABPN1 . A  separate group of genes showes a significant downregulation upon  PABPN1 overexpression, and the effect is strongly correlated with the percentage of inclusions present in the cells . The genes in this group  are largely extracellular matrix (ECM) components or involved in the  synthesis of the ECM. This is the first indication for involvement of the  ECM in OPMD, which should lead to a better understanding of the disease mechanism and possible therapeutic intervention . c46. Non invasive screening and rapid QF PcR assay could  reduce the need of conventional cytogenetic analyses in  prenatal diagnosis V. Cirigliano1,2, G. Voglino3, M. Adinolfi4;   1Dept.

Recently it has been shown that prenatal diagnosis by QF PCR can  detect the great majority of chromosome abnormalities, despite being deliberately targeted to chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y  . Main  advantages of the assay are low cost, speed and automation allowing large scale application .We developed a QF PCR assay that was applied on 28 .000 clinical samples with results issued in 24 hours . Common referral indications  were: biochemical risk (32%), maternal age (30%), parental anxiety (22%) abnormal ultrasound (7 %) increased nuchal translucency (6%) . All samples were also tested by cytogenetic analysis .QF PCR was normal in 26755 cases without false positive results . All ESHG Concurrent Sessions 1030 aneuploidies involving chromosomes 21, 18, 13, X and Y were  identified with 100% specificity. Several cases of partial trisomies and  mosaicism were also detected . QF PCR showed 100% sensitivity in identifying clinically relevant  abnormalities in samples referred for advanced maternal age and biochemical risk . In fetuses with abnormal ultrasound sensitivity was 95% . QF PCR proved highly reliable allowing termination of affected pregnancies without waiting for cytogenetic analysis . Our results raise the possibility of reducing the load of prenatal cytogenetics if pregnancies are monitored by non invasive tests .  Women with positive results are offered amniocentesis or CVS and QF PCR should always be performed . In case of abnormal QF PCR results  cytogenetic analyses may not be necessary as, in our experience,  parents have opted for early termination in most cases of autosomal trisomies . In cases of negative QF PCR results cytogenetic analyses  might only be performed for fetuses with abnormal ultrasound c47. chromosomal mosaicism, DNA methylation and  embryolethality: a possible link between cytogenetic and  epigenetic factors in the etiology of embryo aneuploidy I. N. Lebedev , E. N. Tolmacheva, E. A. Sazhenova, A. A. Kashevarova;   Insitute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation. Progress in preimplantation genetic diagnosis as well as introduction of  molecular cytogenetic techniques into analysis of human reproductive wastages have revealed a high frequency of chromosomal mosaicism .  The presence of cell lines with different karyotypes is the consequence of mitotic errors during early stages of embryo development . However  the molecular mechanisms of mitotic non disjunction in embryo cells  remain obscure. One of the most significant factors of genomic instability is inactivation of the cell cycle checkpoints . Several studies have  proved that aberrant promoter DNA methylation is a strong mechanism for gene silencing . A global epigenetic genome reprogramming takes place during early stage of mammalâs development . It is possible  that there is a close relation between disturbances of the genome  reprogramming and mitotic instability in the etiology of embryo aneuploidy  . To test this hypothesis a pilot analysis of DNA methylation  in promoters of the p16/pRB pathway genes in 11 spontaneous abortions with chromosomal mosaicism was carried out .  CDKN2A  and  RB1 hypermethylation was found in the cytotrophoblast of 82% and  56% spontaneous abortions, respectively  . The corresponding values  in the extraembryonic mesoderm were 91% and 88% . None of the mosaic embryos without hypermethylation of these genes were found .  At the same time no cases of aberrant methylation were found in the placental tissues of pregnancy term related 23 induced abortions . Our  preliminary results point out a possible link between aberrant epigenetic processes and etiology of mitotic non disjunction in human embryos .

A programme for PST of MJD of late onset neurological diseases is in place in Portugal since late 1995 . A multidisciplinary team  was gathered in each national centre for genetic counselling and psychosocial evaluation, and follow up . Periodic workshops take  place to develop and discuss intervention and research protocols, and compare experiences . IBMC is also the national reference lab for genetic testing of these disorders . At CGPP IBMC, in Porto, we received a total of 998 requests for PST  or PND of late onset neurological disorders: FAP I (728), HD (142),  MJD (67), FRDA (48) and other (23 for CADASIL, Wilson or SCA2), including 83 requests for PND .Age of consultands ranged 17 80 years . Most had a partner (50 .3%), 45 .4% were single, 2 .8% divorced, and 1 .5% widows . Women (59%)  predominated. Nearly 61% already had some children; only 57.5% were still in their reproductive years . About 85% reached delivery of  results; 51% tested ânon carriersâ, 49% âcarriersâ. The majority (48%) of our consultands came for PST mainly because  of their âwish to knowâ; 15% mainly worried about children they had;  13% mainly for family planning and their âwish to have childrenâ; 6%  for âgeneral life decisionsâ; 4% claiming âeasier access to a treatmentâ;  4% âpressed by othersâ; and 7% (with a pregnancy ongoing) came with a simultaneous request for PND and PST  . This reinforces the view  that family planning, and the wish not to pass the mutant gene on to  their children still to be born, are not the most important motivation for requesting and uptaking PST  . c49. single cell chromosomal imbalances detection by array cGH C.

Leuven, Leuven, Belgium. Single cell genetic analysis has important applications for basic research as well as for clinical purposes . Thus far, genome wide analysis of the DNA of a single cell has remained cumbersome . Array  Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is a new method that can detect chromosomal copy number changes across the genome . Thus  far, array CGH of isolated single cells has been challenging due to the low amount of DNA present in a single cell . By optimizing a non  specific Phi29 DNA polymerase amplification of all genomic sequences,  we generated sufficient quantities DNA of adequate quality for array  CGH. Amplified DNA from a single cell of respectively a trisomy 13,  18, 21, and monosomy X cell line was hybridized on a 1 Mb array versus normal control DNA . All aneuploidies were unambiguously  identified and, repeated experiments, showed the reproducible and accurate detection of the chromosomal aneuploidies being studied . In  addition to aneuploidy detection, we demonstrate that also segmental  aneusomies can be accurately identified. A fast protocol was generated allowing data interpretation in two days . This makes the method applicable for preimplantation genetic diagnosis . Currently, we are  performing aneuploidy screening on single human blastomeres and results of these experiments will be presented .",2006
Whole genome amplification with haplotype analysis   a  novel approach to preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) for a  wide range of diseases.,C50.,"J. Renwick1,2, J. Trussler2, H. Fassihi3, P.

Abbs1,2","1Genetics Centre, Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom, 2Centre for Preim   plantation Genetic Diagnosis, Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom, 3Kingâs  College, London, United Kingdom","PGD for single gene disorders is generally restricted to diseases with  a common mutation, such as the DF508 cystic fibrosis mutation, and  the number of diseases offered is limited by lengthy optimisation of assays at the single cell level . We present here a novel approach that  overcomes these limitations by using a generic step of whole genome  amplification (WGA) of single embryonic cells, followed by the disease  specific component of the test to obtain extended haplotypes spanning the disease locus . WGA of single cells is subject to allele drop out,  but this does not compromise diagnosis when using extensive marker panels . The proof of this principle was demonstrated by successfully obtaining Dystrophin haplotypes on 9 single buccal cells from a female donor  .  Thus two Dystrophin multiplex assays containing 12 intragenic STR  polymorphisms and 3 sex specific loci can be used to identify healthy  males, non carrier females, female carriers and males affected with Duchenne/Becker muscular dystrophy  . WGA and PCR analysis was carried out on 49 single blastomeres  collected from 8 human embryos (including 3 sibling pairs) using a  total of 57 polymorphic markers for chromosomes 1, 7, 13, 18, 21, X and Y  . Results were obtained for each blastomere, demonstrating that ESHG Concurrent Sessions this approach can be applied without technical difficulty. Linkage assays have been set up for cystic fibrosis, junctional  epidermolysis bullosa, and recurrent Prader Willi syndrome . The  combined techniques of WGA and haplotyping thus open the way to  the rapid, straightforward development and application of PGD tests for any mapped single gene disorder  . c51.

Stem cell transplantation from âsaviourâ siblings have been a valuable  alternative for therapy of a variety of monogenic disorders, hematologic malignancies and myelodysplasias . Between 2002 and 2005, 67  referrals to our center have been evaluated for eligibility to PGD of HLA match and monogenic disorder  . After stringent selection criteria,  56 couples have been found eligible for PGD . The others have been  rejected for reasons including unreproductive age, medical condition  of the affected child, unproper expectations of the family, economic  reasons, but most frequently decline of transplantation indication by the hematologists . PGD is performed on one or two single blastomeres biopsied from 6 8 cell embryos on day 3 after fertilization of the egg .  HLA A, HLA B and HLA DR regions and disease ( beta thalassemia,  Fanconi C, Fanconi A, SCID or Wiskott Aldrich syndrome) associated  gene were initially amplified by multiplex PCR after the blastomer lysis.  The embryos selected for HLA alleles by alternative methods including sequence based typing, real time PCR or STR haplotyping . Mutations  of monogenic disorders have been tested by sequencing or by real time PCR . Total of 8 pregnancies have been obtained which has resulted already 4 deliveries .

We have experienced that  PGD for HLA match and monogenic disease is feasible and provides valuable source for transplantation . c52. Evidence of in vivo increase of smN RNA and protein in smA carriers and patients treated with valproic acid L. Brichta1, I. HÃ¶lker1, K. Haug2, T. Klockgether3, B. Wirth1;   1Institute of Human Genetics, Institute of Genetics and Center for Molecular  Medicine Cologne, Cologne, Germany, 2Institute of Human Genetics, University  of Bonn, Germany, 3Department of Neurology, University of Bonn, Germany. Proximal spinal muscular atrophy (SMA), an autosomal recessively  inherited motoneuron disorder, leads to death in childhood in about half of all patients . While the disease is caused by homozygous  absence of the survival motor neuron gene 1 (SMN1), each patient retains 1 4 SMN2 copies . They are almost identical to SMN1, but exon 7 is skipped in 90% of SMN2 transcripts . The encoded protein  is not fully functional. Using fibroblasts from SMA patients, we have  previously demonstrated that therapeutic doses of valproic acid (VPA),  an antiepileptic drug, increase full length (FL) SMN2 mRNA/protein  levels in vitro by enhancing SMN2 transcription and promoting exon 7  inclusion. These findings opened an exciting perspective for a causal SMA therapy  . Here, we provide a first proof of principle of an in vivo activation of  a causative gene by VPA, a histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitor, in a human inherited disease . Ten SMA carriers with 1 SMN1 and 1 3 SMN2 copies were enrolled in a VPA pilot trial . Drug treatment  revealed increased FL SMN mRNA/protein levels in blood from 7/10 probands . In a subsequent investigation of peripheral whole  blood from 20 SMA type I III patients treated with VPA in individual  experimental curative approaches, FL SMN2 mRNA levels were found  to be increased in 7 patients, whereas 13 presented unchanged or  decreased transcript levels. Difficulties in developing effective clinical  biomarkers are pointed out and a strategy is suggested how to monitor drug response in treated patients . This will be an essential tool required  for discriminating between responders and non responders to VPA treatment .c53. Valproic acid stimulates ABcD2 gene expression: a novel  potential therapy for X adrenoleukodystrophy A. Pujol1, S. Fourcade1, L. Brichta2, E. Hahnen2, P. Aubourg3, B. Wirth2, J.  Mandel4;   1IRO/IDIBELL, Barcelona, Spain, 2Institute of Human Genetics, Cologne,  Germany, 3INSERM U561, UniversitÃ© Paris V, Paris, France, 4IGBMC, Illkirch,  Strasbourg, France. Our ultimate goal is to develop new therapies for X linked  adrenoleukodystrophy (X ALD), the most frequent inherited monogenic demyelinating disease (minimal incidence 1:17,000) . X ALD leads  to death in boys due to cerebral demyelination (cerebral childhoold  ALD, CCALD) or to motor disability in adults due to spinal cord and peripheral nerve degeneration (adrenomyeloneuropathy or AMN) . The  gene mutated in the disease (ABCD1) is a peroxisomal ATP binding  transporter of very long chain fatty acids, whose accumulation is the hallmark of the disease . We have generated and characterized mouse  models for X ALD by inactivation of ABCD1 and of a close homolog, the ABCD2 peroxisomal transporter  . Recently, we have shown that  stable overexpression of ABCD2 is able to prevent the late onset neurodegenerative phenotype presented by ABCD1 knock out mice .  This constitutes an in vivo  evidence of the overlapping functions  of both transporters in the mouse . Because ABCD2 is a target of  histone deacethylator (HDAC) inhibitors such as 4 phenylbutyrate,  we investigated the effect of valproic acid (VPA), an HDAC inhibitor successfully used for the long term treatment of epilepsy  . Indeed, VPA  stimulates ABCD2 expression in vitro  and ex vivo  in mouse and human .  When given to X ALD patients, a 2 to 4 fold upregulation of ABCD2 in peripheral mononuclear cells in 50% of the patients is reached . Thus,  our findings open encouraging perspectives for the therapy of this devastating disease .",2006
Pharmacologic Chaperone AT2101 Improves the Trafficking  and Activity of Acid Ã Glucosidase in Gaucher Fibroblasts,C54.,"Kornfeld1, B. Wustman2","12Department of Internal Medicine, Washington University School of Medicine, ,  MO 63110, USA., Saint Louis, MO, United States, 2Amicus Therapeutics, Cran   bury, NJ, United States. ","Gaucher disease is caused by mutations in acid Î² glucosidase  (GBA), the lysosomal enzyme responsible for the catabolism of glucosylceramide . The most common homozygous mutation in the  GBA enzyme (N370S) has been shown to result in reduced activity  and delayed trafficking of GBA to the lysosome in patient fibroblasts.  Defective GBA activity results in the progressive accumulation of  glucosylceramide within macrophages and osteoclasts, and GBA  retention in the ER with increased protein degradation and activation  of cytokines and release of inflammatory mediators ultimately leading  to a variety of clinical manifestations such as anemia, bone fragility and possible CNS impairment . Currently, enzyme replacement therapy  (ERT) and substrate reduction therapy (SRT) represent the only viable treatment options for patients with Gaucher disease . More recently,  the use of pharmacological chaperones as a means of rescuing GBA  activity in Gaucher fibroblasts has been explored. In this study, we  demonstrate that treatment of N370S fibroblasts with the glucose  analog AT2101 (30 100 ÂµM) increases the lysosomal steady state  levels of the GBA protein to near wild type levels with a corresponding two fold enhancement in GBA activity  . Pulse/chase experiments  indicate that AT2101 acts to both increase the intracellular trafficking  of newly synthesized GBA and prolongs the stability of the mutant enzyme within the lysosome . Although a glucose analog, AT2101  is a very poor inhibitor of alpha glucosidase II and does not alter N linked oligosaccharide processing at 500ÂµM . Taken together, these  data suggest that AT2101 may be a promising alternative to enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) for the treatment of Gaucher disease . c55. intrabody based therapy for protein aggregation disorders: OPmD as paradigm P. Verheesen1, A. de Kluijver1, S. van Koningsbruggen2, H. de Haard3, G. J.  van Ommen2, T. Verrips1, S. M. van der Maarel2;   1Department of Molecular and Cellular Biology, University of Utrecht, Utrecht,  The Netherlands, 2Center for Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University  Medical Center, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Ablynx NV, Ghent, Belgium. Oculopharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD) is regarded a paradigm ESHG Concurrent Sessions for the group of protein aggregation disorders . It is caused by extensions  of the N terminal polyalanine stretch of the nuclear polyA binding  protein 1 (PABPN1) causing the presence of PABPN1 containing  intranuclear aggregates in skeletal muscle . Intranuclear aggregation  of mutant PABPN1 is also observed in transgenic mouse and cell  models for OPMD and these models consistently support a direct role for the protein aggregation in OPMD pathogenesis . We have isolated  and characterized several single domain antibody reagents (VHH) that recognize at least two different epitopes in PABPN1 . The antibody  reagents specifically detect endogenous PABPN1 in cell lysates on western blot and label PABPN1 in cultured cells and muscle sections .  When expressed intracellularly as intrabodies in a cellular model for  OPMD, aggregation of PABPN1 was prevented in a dose dependent manner  . These intrabodies have also curative properties as they could  also reduce the presence of already existing aggregates . Given the  domain specificity of VHH mediated aggregation interference, this  approach allows the definition of the nucleation kernel in aggregation  prone proteins, thus facilitating etiological insight into this and other protein aggregation disorders . It may also provide useful therapeutic agents . c56. Advances in exon skipping trial development towards  proof of concept and systemic application in Duchenne muscular Dystrophy J. T. C. van Deutekom1, H. Heemskerk1, C. de Winter1, P. van Kuik2, S. de  Kimpe2, G. Platenburg2, G. J. B. van Ommen1;   1Center for Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center,  Leiden, The Netherlands, 2Prosensa B.V., Leiden, The Netherlands. Antisense oligonucleotides (AONs) are emerging as small molecule  drugs with a high, sequence specific, corrective potential on RNA level . Especially for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), AONs  have demonstrated to be an efficient and relatively simple and safe alternative to gene therapy approaches based on gene replacement .  Over the last five years we have successfully developed this antisense  approach towards clinical application. In the first half of 2006, a  âproof of conceptâ clinical study, based on intramuscular injections  of an exon 51 skipping AON, will be undertaken in a selected group of DMD patients, of which the set up will be discussed . To facilitate  full body treatment of DMD patients, we are now focusing on the  development of a safe and efficient systemic AON delivery method.  Using the mdx mouse model, we have compared efficacy, persistence  and biodistribution of an AON (containing 2â O methyl RNA with a full  length phosphorothioate backbone) targeting the mutated exon 23, after intravenous administration of increasing doses and intervals .  We obtained relatively high exon 23 skipping levels (up to 45%) in all  muscle types, including diaphragm and heart, resulting in significant dystrophin expression as detected by Western blot analysis . There  was an increased muscle specific uptake and efficacy of AON in the  mdx mice when compared to control mice . A highly sensitive ligation  ELISA for AONs, allowed us to assess the stability of the AON in the  different organs and tissues, showing a half life of 10 days in skeletal  muscle. The overall therapeutic effect was indicated by significantly  decreased creatin kinase levels in plasma of treated mice, and by improved performance in RotaRod studies . These results offer a  favourable perspective for the first clinical Phase I/IIa studies on AONs  in DMD patients, suggesting that these are within reach in the next few years . c57. clinical burden and penetrance of haemochromatosis:  estimates derived from routine data C. Patch , H. Yuen, P. Roderick, W. Rosenberg;   University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom. The prevalence of the at risk genotype for haemochromatosis is common at approximately 1 in 200, the clinical penetrance is unknown .  This study aims to determine the clinical burden of haemochromatosis  and provide an estimate of the probability of diagnosis and treatment for C282Y homozygotes in a Northern European population .  The prevalence and incidence of haemochromatosis requiring  hospitalisation together with associated co morbidity, patterns of  care and lifetime cumulative probability of admission was estimated from routine hospital admissions data for England . The data covered  six years from April 1997 to March 2003 and consisted of 56000 episodes of care relating to 6000 individual patients with a diagnosis of haemochromatosis . Crude prevalence was 53 per million of population (pmp) and crude incidence 21 pmp in 2002/3 . Indirectly age sex standardized  prevalence by health authority of residence indicated unexplained geographical variation . Lifetime probability of having an episode of  care related to haemochromatosis was 9% in males and 4% in females in a hypothetical cohort of 1000 C282Y homozygotes . 14% of patients  had liver disease recorded at the first episode of care. The majority of care was provided by haematologists . Despite a high prevalence of the at risk genotype, haemochromatosis is  uncommon. Lifetime penetrance was nearly 10% in males. A significant  percentage of individuals present with preventable complications at  their first episode of care. This together with geographical variation in prevalence suggests further scope for earlier diagnosis . c58. Preference for sweet foods is partially genetically  determined; a Finnish family study K. Keskitalo1,2, A. Knaapila1,2, M. Kallela3, A. Palotie4, M. Wessman4,5, S. Sam   malisto2, L. Peltonen2, H. Tuorila1, M. Perola2;   1Department of Food Technology, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland, 2De  partment of Molecular Medicine, National Public Health Institute (KTL), Hel   sinki, Finland, 3Department of Neurology, Helsinki University Central Hospital,  Helsinki, Finland, 4The Finnish Genome Center, University of Helsinki, Helsinki,  Finland, 5FolkhÃ¤lsan Research Institute, Helsinki, Finland. The human has an innate preference for sweet foods . However, the degree of sweet taste preference varies largely between individuals . The aim was to study if genetic elements contribute to these differences .  The study population consists of 146 members (32 % male, 68 %  female, 19 to 78 years old) of 26 Finnish families, genome scanned with 360 microsatellite markers . The subjects rated the sweetness intensity and pleasantness of 0, 3, 7 .5, and 18 .75 % sucrose solutions using labeled magnitude scales LMS (Green et al . 1993) and LAM (Schutz  & Cardello, 2001), and evaluated the pleasantness and use frequency  of 5 sweet foods (chocolate, candies, ice cream, sweet pastry, sweet desserts) using 7 point scales . Phenotypes for pleasantness and use  frequency of sweet foods were constructed as mean of ratings given to these 5 items . Program MERLIN was used for variance component linkage analysis of these quantitative traits . Highest heritabilities were observed for pleasantness of 7 .5 and 18 .75 % sucrose solution (h 2 =  23 and 48 %, respectively) and for sweet foodsâ pleasantness (h2 =  19 %) and use frequency (h2 = 35 %) . The multipoint linkage analysis  provided a LOD score of 3 .49 at marker GGAA3G05 located in Chr16p11 .2 to use frequency of sweet foods . These results suggest  that the preference for sweet taste is partially genetically determined and that locus 16p11 .2 harbors a genetic element modifying the use of sweet foods . c59.

Obesity is a heritable trait and a risk factor for many of the common ESHG Concurrent Sessions diseases such as type 2 diabetes, heart disease, and hypertension .  Here we use a dense, whole genome scan of the DNA samples from  the Framingham Heart Study cohort to identify a common genetic  variant near the INSIG2 gene ( insulin induced gene) associated with  obesity. We have replicated the finding in four separate samples  comprised of individuals of Western European ancestry, African  Americans and children . One of the replication samples was the large population based KORAS4 study from Germany (n=3996) . The obesity predisposing genotype is present in 10% of individuals . Our  study suggests that common genetic polymorphisms are important determinants of obesity  . c60. Genetic variants of RANtEs are associated with protection for t ype 1 Diabetes A. Zhernakova1, B. Z. Alizadeh1,2, P. Eerligh2, G. Valdigem1, P. Hanifi Moghad   dam2,3, N. C. Schloot3, B. Diosdado1, C. Wijmenga1, B. O. Roep2, B. P. C. Koel   eman1,2;   1Complex Genetics Section, Utrecht, The Netherlands, 2Department of Immu   nohematology and Blood Transfusion, LUMC, Leiden, The Netherlands, 3Diabe   tes Research Institute, Heinrich Heine University, Dusseldorf, Germany. Type 1 diabetes (T1D) is an autoimmune disease with complex genetic predisposition . RANTES (CCL5) is a Th1 chemokine, which promote T cell activation and proliferation . Genetic association of  RANTES   with asthma, sarcoidosis and multiple sclerosis have previously been described . Increased protein levels of RANTES at the primary sites of  inflammation have been reported for different autoimmune diseases. In this study we tested RANTES  as a candidate gene for association  with T1D, using three tagged SNPs to capture all haplotype information .  The minor allele of all three SNPs was found to be less transmitted to T1D offspring (transmission rates 37 .3%(p=0 .002), 38 .7%(p=0 .007) and 41 .0%(p=0 .013)), and also less frequent in case versus control design (p= 0 .009, 0 .03 and 0 .04 respectively) . A similar protective effect  was observed for the haplotype carrying all three minor alleles (TDT:  p=0.003; OR=0.55; CI: 0.37 0.83, case/control: p=0.03; OR=0.74; CI: 0 .55 0 .98) . Finally, individuals carrying the protective haplotype  express significantly lower serum level of RANTES, when compared to non carriers . Conclusion: Genetic variation of RANTES  is significantly associated  with T1D, both in a case control and in family based analysis . Carriers  of the protective haplotype express lower serum level of RANTES protein, suggesting lower T cell activation and proliferation . c61. screening and replication using the same data set: A  testing strategy for case/control studies M. B. McQueen1, J. Su1, A. Murphy1, K. Schneiter1, N. M. Laird1, S. T. Weiss2,  C. Lange1;   1Harvard School of Public Health, Boston, MA, United States, 2Harvard Medical  School, Boston, MA, United States. We propose a novel testing strategy for case/control studies that uses the same data set for the screening step and the replication step . For  family based designs, we proposed such 2 stage strategy in which  both steps are statistical independent: the screening step, in which  the strength of the genetic association between each marker and the  trait is assessed, and the replication step, in which a selected subset of markers is tested for genetic association with the trait . However, the approach has been limited to family data . Here, we propose a  testing strategy for case/control studies that uses the same data set  for screening and replication, and makes the necessity of family data for such testing strategies redundant . We outline the approach and assess its power compared to standard multiple testing procedures . Its  practical relevance for genome wide association studies is illustrated by applications to genome wide association studies . c62. Will systematic association studies of anonymous sNPs  succeed where linkage studies failed? J. K. Pickrell , F. Clerget Darpoux, C. Bourgain;   U535 INSERM, Villejuif, France. Systematic linkage screenings for complex disease genes have often had poor results, despite the impressive number of diseases studied .  As linkage studies have low power to detect common variants, it is  hypothesized that common polymorphisms may be involved in complex disease . In order to detect the contribution of these alleles, large scale association testing has been proposed as an alternative to linkage studies . Using maps of frequent SNPs, the entire genome, or more restricted regions of it, can be queried for association with a disease .  These large scale association studies have become a reality with the  recent availability of the HapMap database and are a promising tool for understanding the genetic component of complex diseases . However, the question of the actual power of this new approach for identifying genetic risk factors for complex diseases is still open .  Power studies published in support of the approach were based on the hypothesis of a single variant associated with the disease . Because  true complex disease etiology may include cases of several variants  in one gene or gene gene interactions, we perform power computation  under several of these more complex models using the ENCODE  data that exhaustively describes the SNPs in ten 500kb regions of the human genome . We show that under very realistic models,  including the scenario of common variants, the approach of systematic anonymous SNP association tests may also fail .",2006
Quantitative mapping of loci influencing susceptibility to  lentiviral infection.,C63.,"Deutsch1, C. Loeuillet2, M. Munoz2, M. Gagnebin1, J. Wyniger2, H. Attar1, J.  S. Beckmann3, S. E. Antonarakis1, A. Telenti2","1Department of Genetic Medicine, University of Geneva, Switzerland, 2Institute  of Microbiology, University of Lausanne, Switzerland, 3Service of Medical Ge   netics, CHUV  Lausanne, Switzerland","Susceptibility to lentiviral infection (including HIV) is a quantitative trait  that is likely to have a strong genetic component and be influenced by genetic variability of the host . To identify the genetic components underlying this trait we established  an ex vivo approach to measure lentiviral susceptibility in lymphoblastoid cells (LBLs), based on a GFP reporter system . The assay outputs  two phenotypes: fraction of infected cells, and expression of lentiviral genes . We measured lentiviral susceptibility in 198 LBLs from 15 three  generation CEPH families to calculate heritability and perform quantitative linkage using previously generated genotypes . Heritability calculations showed that both phenotypes have a strong genetic component with h2r of 0 .53 and 0 .43 respectively  . Quantitative  linkage analysis using variance components, lead to the identification  of a suggestive locus on chromosome 8q for the âfraction of infected cellsâ trait (LOD=2 .89, p=2E 04) . Because the phenotype is not  normally distributed we performed 500 simulations to determine the  empirical significance of the finding; the LOD score obtained was  genome wide significant (95% significance threshold = 2.83). To  further dissect the susceptibility locus, we measured the trait in LBLs of the 60 caucasian HapMap individuals . We selected all tag SNPs in  a 3Mb region centered on the marker with the highest LOD score and  performed association analysis, which identified a single significant  SNP (p=7.7E 05) after correction for multiple testing. This finding narrows down the candidate region to 5 10 genes . We thus identify  a new locus for lentiviral susceptibility that could help improve our understanding on the mechanisms of HIV infection . c64. Distinctive white matter abnormalities on mRi in patients  with 6p deletion syndrome S. A. J. Lesnik Oberstein1, M. Kriek1, K. Szuhai2, A. van Haeringen1, J. van der  Smagt3, K. B. M. Hansson1, M. H.

A girl with mental retardation, short stature and a distinct pattern of  multiple congenital abnormalities, including white matter abnormalities on MRI, presented at our department in 1999 . Despite intensive investigations, no diagnosis could be made . Recently, the parents presented with their third child . He showed a similar pattern of congenital and MRI abnormalities as his sister  . MAPH analysis, followed by  FISH and Array CGH, revealed a cryptic unbalanced chromosomal  translocation leading to a monosomy of 6pter and a trisomy 20qter  in both siblings. Based on analogous MRI findings, a third, unrelated  patient, was diagnosed and molecularly confirmed to have 6p deletion ESHG Concurrent Sessions6 syndrome by her neuroradiologist . The recent literature delineates a pattern of congenital abnormalities  and dysmorphic features that should alert the clinician to the possibility  of 6p deletion syndrome and instigation of appropriate investigations  (FISH or MAPH/MLPA of the 6p telomeric region) . In addition to the  already described features, we would like to add the finding that  children with 6p deletion syndrome seem to have a marked, and  possibly pathognomonic, pattern of white matter abnormalities on brain MRI . c65. Array cGH: A novel tool in genetic diagnosis of individuals  with congenital heart defects B. Thienpont1, L. Mertens2, B. Eyskens2, D. Boshoff2, N. Maas1, T. de Ravel1,  J. Fryns1, M. Gewillig2, J. R. Vermeesch1, K. Devriendt1;   1Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium, 2Pediatric Cardiology Unit,  Leuven, Belgium. Array CGH is a novel diagnostic tool for the detection of submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances . Moreover, it offers an opportunity to identify  novel genetic loci for specific genetic disorders. We report the results  of array CGH analysis in 60 patients with a congenital heart defect  (CHD) of unknown cause, who had, in addition, either developmental  delay/mental retardation and/or additional major malformation(s) and/or dysmorphism . Array CGH was performed using a home made 1Mb array, with the 1Mb BAC/PAC set from the Sanger institute . All detected anomalies  were confirmed and parents were investigated.New abnormalities were detected in 11/60 patients (18%) . Mosaicism  for monosomy 7 was detected in a patient with suspected diagnosis of Fanconi syndrome but normal DEB and mitomycin tests . Among  the 10 others, there were 4 interstitial deletions (maximal sizes  between 2 and 14 Mb), 1 interstitial duplication (6 Mb), a paternally inherited duplication in chromosome 22q11 .2, 1 terminal deletion 5q  (6 Mb), 1 unbalanced translocation (9q/20q) and two more complex  intrachromosomal rearrangements involving deletions, duplications and inversions .With the exception of TBX1 (dup 22q11 .2), NOTCH1 (del 9q34 .3) and",2006
"5 (del 5q35.12), no genes for CHD are known in the identified regions . Using ENDEAVOUR, a recently developed bioinformatics  tool to prioritize candidate genes in specified chromosomal regions,  we identified several novel candidate genes for CHD. Array CGH can  detect cryptic submicroscopic imbalances in a large proportion of patients with a CHD and a âchromosomalâ phenotype . Moreover, the  identified chromosomal imbalances are a source of novel candidate genes for CHD . c66. molecular cytogenetic (re )examinations of structural chromosome aberrations within the EcARUcA (European cytogeneticists Association Register of Unbalanced chromosome Aberrations) project reveals surprising results",NKX2.,"Riegel , A. Schinzel","University of ZÃ¼rich, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland","Within the ECARUCA project, molecular cytogenetic re examinations  were performed for European laboratories with the aim to better define breakpoints in various structural chromosome aberrations . As the main  aim of the Register is to better know and understand the phenotype and  course of rare chromosome aberrations, it was considered important  to precisely define the aneuploid segments with respect to karyotype phenotype correlation . For deletions and duplications, microsatellite marker analysis and FISH with BACs was the method of choice . For  additional marker chromosomes, chromosome dissection and reverse paiting was also applied . In selected cases also MLPA and array CGH was applied . More than 100 patients were so far examined . The initial determination of breakpoints had to be revised in almost all cases . In  some patients even the chromosome involved had not been correctly determined . Deletions in some cases concerned segments which were not even overlapping with the initially determined segment . Especially large was the discrepancy in instances of duplication deletions . From  the above mentioned results we conclude that many patients in whom  especially de novo duplications, interstitial deletions and additional  marker chromosomes were determined, should be re examinated with molecular cytogenetic methods . This will result in many revisions of  initial karyotypes and will improve our knowledge about the impact of the aneuploid state of specific chromosomal segments on the phenotype down to the gene level . c67. t argeted cloning of fragile sites   based on a previous  tagging of fragile regions in a breast cancer cell line A. Fechter , E. Kuehnel, I. Buettel, L. Savelyeva, M. Schwab;   German Cancer Research Center, Heidelberg, Germany. Common fragile sites are chromosomal loci which can be observed  as breaks or gaps on metaphase chromosomes after culturing the  cells under conditions inhibiting DNA replication or repair. They reflect  site specific genetic instability being involved in e.g. chromosome  rearrangements, sister chromatid exchanges and gene amplification.  During the last years progress has been made in understanding the  molecular basis of common fragile sites and the mechanisms which  account for their expression, however, the nature of common fragile sites is still not completely known . Point of departure for a targeted cloning of several fragile sites was  tagging of fragile site DNA by repair mediated integration of a marker gene into breaks . For this approach, the breast cancer cell line MDA  MB 436 was chosen as model, since it spontaneously expresses fragile  sites with a high frequency and displays other non random instable regions . A transfected marker gene integrated preferentially into fragile  sites and non random instable regions (44 respectively 41% of total integrations) and thus tagging the fragile regions . Using different  cloning approaches flanking sequences of the marker gene were  identified and the exact position of the respective corresponding fragile sites was determined . The co localization of the derived sequences  with the fragile site was confirmed by fluorescence in situ  hybridization  on metaphase chromosomes of lymphoblastoid cell lines treated with Aphidicolin to induce fragile site expression . The exact dimensions of the fragile sites were determined by FISH mapping analysis . c68. Genome wide tiling path array cGH analysis in a diagnostic  setting. A three year experience N. de Leeuw , R. Pfundt, D. Koolen, E. Sistermans, W. Nillesen, M. Egmont Pe   tersen, J. Veltman, A. Geurts van Kessel, B. de Vries, D. Smeets;   Dept. of Human Genetics, Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Centre, Ni   jmegen, The Netherlands. In April 2003, genome wide array based Comparative Genomic  Hybridisation (array CGH) analysis was diagnostically implemented in  our cytogenetic services in order to reach a resolution that extends far  beyond routine cytogenetic analysis1 . This was achieved by the mutual  efforts of people from five different fields of expertise: clinical genetics, cytogenetics, DNA diagnostics, bioinformatics, and biostatistics . One year after implementation, we switched from a first generation  1 Mb resolution BAC array to a second generation 100 kb resolution tiling path array encompassing over 32,000 BAC clones . After tackling  several practical high hurdles, one of the main being the correct clinical  interpretation of the analytical data and the subsequent classification  of imbalances as variant, unique or inherited, the first final diagnostic  array CGH outcomes (of a current total of ~500 array requests) were completed and reported to the requesting physicians early in 2005 . Various practical aspects that have resulted in our current diagnostic strategy are discussed . These include cytogenetic and subtelomere  Multiplex Ligase dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) analysis prior  to array CGH analysis, and subsequent validation of significant array  CGH aberrations by region specific MLPA and/or FISH. Other relevant  diagnostic issues such as parental testing, family and follow up studies, and ISCN based nomenclature are also addressed . Our current strategy enables us to routinely use this powerful, yet  expensive tool to detect submicroscopic imbalances and thereby to  unravel the causative defects in a growing number of patients with mental retardation with or without multiple congenital anomalies . 1De Vries et al ., Am .

Menten2, F.  Speleman2, K. Devriendt1, J. P. Fryns1, J. R. Vermeesch1;   1Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium, 2Center for Medical Genetics  Ghent, Ghent, Belgium. Submicroscopic telomeric imbalances are a major cause of  developmental and mental disorders and are detected in 3 to 7%  of patients with normal karyotypes . Screening for subtelomeric  aberrations has become a routine aspect of the diagnostic work up of patients with MCA/MR . Because of this strong correlation between  subtelomeric imbalances and developmental disorders, subtelomeric screening is being implemented in prenatal diagnostic techniques . In contrast to these findings, scattered reports in the literature describe phenotypically normal individuals carrying subtelomeric imbalances .  Here, we report on the detection of subtelomeric chromosomal  imbalances in phenotypically normal individuals at another six  subtelomeres of respectively chromosomes 4p, 6q 10q, 11q, 17p, 17q, and 18q . In addition, array CGH was applied and uncovered imbalances sized between 0 .4 Mb and 7 Mb . Surprisingly, this shows  that not only small chromosomal deletions and duplications, but  also large imbalances can be tolerated without obvious phenotypic anomalies . None of these subtelomeric imbalances are listed as common copy number variations of the human genome . Since most of  them have been ascertained through the detection of the imbalance in  a child with a developmental disorder, they are likely to be susceptibility  factors that, dependent on the genetic or environmental background, can lead to phenotypic anomalies . These observations raise major  ethical concerns for the introduction of subtelomeric and genome wide  screening tools in prenatal genetic diagnosis c70. cranio lenticulo sutural dysplasia is caused by a sEc23A  mutation disrupting ER to Golgi trafficking S.

We described Cranio lenticulo sutural dysplasia (CLSD) as a novel  autosomal recessive syndrome with late closing fontanels, sutural  cataracts, facial dysmorphisms, and skeletal defects mapped to chromosome 14q13 q21 . Using a positional cloning approach we  identified F382L missense mutation in SEC23A segregating with this syndrome . SEC23A is an essential component of the COPII coated  vesicles that transport secretory proteins from the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) to the Golgi complex . Electron microscopy and  immunofluorescence (IF) documented gross dilatation of the ER in  patient fibroblasts. The cells also exhibited cytoplasmic mislocalization  of SEC31 and delayed secretion of COL1A1. Transfection of fibroblast  cells with a mutant SEC23A expression vector produced cellular phenotypes similar to those observed in the mutant cells . These  observations were corroborated by in vitro cell free vesicle budding  assays which demonstrated that the F832L mutation results in loss of  SEC23A function and inefficient COPII complex formation. We propose  that a secretory defect of a distinct set of cargo proteins required for normal morphogenesis accounts for CLSD . c71. the transmembrane protein meckelin ( MKS ) is mutated in  meckel Gruber syndrome U.

Meckel Gruber syndrome (MKS) is a severe autosomal recessively  inherited disorder characterized by bilateral renal cystic dysplasia, developmental defects of the central nervous system (most commonly  occipital encephalocele), hepatic ductal dysplasia and cysts, and polydactyly  . MKS is genetically heterogeneous with three loci mapped:   MKS1 , 17q21 24; MKS2 , 11q13 and MKS3 . We have fine mapped  the MKS3 locus to a 12 .67 Mb candidate interval at chromosome  8q21 .13 q22 .1 . We sequenced 22 positional candidate genes before  we identified pathogenic mutations in TMEM67 for five MKS3  linked  consanguineous families with classic clinical features of MKS . MKS3 /TMEM67 is a novel, evolutionarily conserved gene that is  expressed in foetal spinal cord, brain, liver and kidney, as expected for the phenotype, as well as more general low levels of expression .  It encodes a novel, 995 amino acid, transmembrane protein that we have called meckelin . Meckelin has topological similarity to the G  protein coupled and the Frizzled (FZ) families of receptors, and may have a role in primary ciliary and basal body function . Further mutation  analysis has identified a number of frame shift, splice site and  missense changes, all of which are in exons encoding the extracellular domain of meckelin . We present initial genotype phenotype correlations for MKS, and  preliminary functional work that begins to elucidate the role of meckelin in normal human development . c72.

Costello syndrome is a rare, multiple congenital anomaly syndrome  characterized by coarse face, mental retardation, cardiomyopathy and predisposition to tumors . The molecular basis of the disease has been unknown . Mutations in tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2 ( PTPN11 )  have been identified in approximately 40% of patients with Noonan  syndrome1, which phenotypically overlaps with Costello syndrome .  We hypothesized that the causative gene(s) for Costello syndrome  and Noonan syndrome without PTPN11  mutations is a functionally  upstream or downstream molecule(s) of SHP 2 in the RAS RAF ERK pathway  . We sequenced the entire coding regions of the four RAS  genes ( KRAS , HRAS , NRAS and ERAS)  in genomic DNA from 13  individuals with Costello syndrome and 28 individuals with PTPN11   negative Noonan syndrome. We identified four heterozygous de novo   mutations of HRAS  (G12V, G12A, G12S and G13D) in 12 of 13 affected  individuals, all of which have been previously reported as somatic and âoncogenicâ mutations in various tumors . Fibroblasts established from  patients were hypersensitive to growth factor stimulation as compared  with control fibroblasts. Only a mutant allele was expressed in the  ganglioneuroblastoma tissue surgically isolated from an individual with  Costello syndrome despite the biallelic expression in her fibroblasts.  Furthermore, we recently identified genes mutated in CFC syndrome.  Our observations strongly suggest that dysregulation of the RAS  RAF ERK pathway is a common molecular basis for the three related disorders, Noonan, Costello, and CFC syndrome .1 .

Autosomal dominant lacrimo auriculo dento digital (LADD) syndrome  is a multiple congenital anomaly mainly characterized by lacrimal  duct aplasia, malformed ears and deafness, small teeth, and digital  anomalies . We genotyped three large LADD families using the  Affymetrix GeneChip 10K Array and mapped the LADD1 locus on chromosome 10q26 to a 6 .2 Mb critical region between markers  D10S1693  and D10S1723 . We identified heterozygous missense  mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of the fibroblast growth factor  receptor 2 ( FGFR2 ) in all three LADD families and a  de novo  FGFR2   mutation in a sporadic case . After exclusion of FGFR2  in two additional  LADD families we found a causative mutation in the tyrosine kinase  domain of FGFR3 in one family, and a missense mutation in the gene  encoding fibroblast growth factor 10 ( FGF10 ), a known FGFR ligand,  in the other family  . We conclude that LADD syndrome is a genetically heterogeneous  disorder caused by heterozygous missense mutations in either  FGFR2 , FGFR3 , or FGF10  . Interestingly, all FGFR mutations so far  identified in LADD are located within the tyrosine kinase domains  of FGFR2 and FGFR3 in loops that play a regulatory function in the control of tyrosine kinase activity  . Therefore, reduced functional activity  of FGFR2/3 seems to be an attractive plausible mechanism underlying the molecular basis of LADD syndrome . c74. Further evidence and functional proof of the pathogenic  relevance of TBX1  missense mutations A. Rauch1, C. Zweier1, C. Campbell2, H.

Deletion 22q11 .2 syndrome is the most frequent known microdeletion syndrome . It is associated with a highly variable phenotype including DiGeorge  and Shprintzen syndromes .From studies in several mouse  models, haploinsufficiency of the T box transcription factor TBX1 ,  which is located within the common deletion interval, was suggested to cause the phenotype . Nevertheless, to date only 3 patients from Japan  were described to have point mutations of TBX1  in association with five  of the major features of 22q11.2 deletion. We report the first Caucasian  patient with a TBX1  missense mutation within the T box, associated  with the typical facial gestalt, short stature and developmental delay  .  To prove the functional relevance of this mutation we tested our novel and the three published mutations in a transcriptional reporter assay  .  While the published truncating mutation showed remarkable reduction  of TBX1 transcriptional activity, the published and our novel missense  mutation showed significantly increased activity. While RNA levels  showed no increase of transcript, homology modelling of the mutant  protein showed new electrostatic interactions, which could enhance  the stability of dimers. We were able to confirm this hypothesis by an EMSA assay using the T box binding site . This unexpected results  are in line with data from a mouse model, which showed a similar phenotype in both, TBX1  under  and over expression . We therefore  provide the first functional evidence for the pathogenic relevance of  TBX1  missense mutations . c75.

Doublecortin (DCX) is mutated in cases of lissencephaly, a malformation  of cortical development associated with severe mental retardation and epilepsy  . In this disorder the cerebral cortex is highly disorganised,  most probably resulting from perturbed neuronal migration . We are  pursuing a variety of approaches in an attempt to better understand the pathophysiology of lissencephaly  . In addition to performing  mutation screening analyses, we identified and characterised several  protein partners of DCX, providing entry points into understanding the biochemical pathways in which it is implicated . These studies  show that DCX is a MAP, also implicated in vesicle trafficking and cell adhesion, likely to be important functions for neuronal migration . We  also generated Dcx knockout mice which interestingly, have only subtle  abnormalities in the mouse cortex . Nevertheless, our video microscopy  analyses of migrating knockout interneurons show defects in migratory  dynamics. Specifically, the formation and division of growth cones at  the extremities of neuronal processes are more frequent in knockout cells . As a consequence, cells are more extensively branched, although  individual branches are less stable. Dcx deficient cells thus migrate  in a disorganised manner, extending and retracting short branches and making less long distant movements of the nucleus . These novel data thus highlight an important role for Dcx in migrating interneurons .  Furthermore, comparative neuropathological analyses also identify  severe defects in the distribution of interneurons in type I lissencephaly brains . Perturbations of the number, distribution or function of  interneurons, which are important regulators of neuronal activity, are likely to contribute to the epilepsy observed in this disorder  .",2006

Boer1","1Center for Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden University Medical Center,  The Netherlands, 2Department of Pathology, Leiden University Medical Center,  The Netherlands","Epigenetic modification of gene expression by aberrant methylation  of promoter CpG islands plays an important role in the initiation and development of colorectal cancer (CRC) . DNA methylation based  markers are attractive because the aberrant methylation is thought to arise early in the development of CRC . In addition, the stability  of methylation changes in the DNA allows the development of cost  effective and sensitive assays. Therefore, we aim at the identification  of high performance DNA methylation markers for the detection  and classification of CRC and its precursor forms. We are carrying  out genome wide methylation studies in a consecutive series of  clinically well described colon tumors and paired normal samples using differential methylation hybridization of CpG island microarrays .  Patient DNA samples derived from macrodissected fresh frozen  tissues are digested with MseI and amplified by linker mediated PCR.  Subsequently, the amplicons are digested by two methylation sensitive  restriction enzymes, Cy labeled and co hybridized with a common  reference sample to microarrays containing 9,000 PCR amplified CpG  islands. We identified loci that are aberrantly methylated in a high  proportion of tumor samples, including promising candidate biomarkers with methylation in over 90% of the tested tumors . Currently, these loci  are being verified by bisulfite sequencing and studied in more detail.  Possible clinical applications of these markers include early detection  of cancer with applications such as in feces screening, and cancer prognosis .ESHG Concurrent Sessions",2006
Identification of regulatory Conserved Non Coding  sequences (cNcs) using the chicken genome and chicken  embryos,C77.,"Attanasio1, F. Chiodini2, C. Wyss1, J. M. Matter2, S. E. Antonarakis1","1Dpt Genetic Medicine & Development, University of Geneva Medical School,  Switzerland, 2Dpt of Biochemistry, Sciences II, University of Geneva, Switzer   land","Comparative genome analysis across mammals has revealed a large number of highly conserved non coding sequences (CNCs) . We had  studied CNCs from 21q and found that their evolutionary features strongly suggested functional importance . However the function of the majority of these sequences is unknown . We hypothesised that a possible role of a subset of CNCs is transcriptional regulation . In vitro  luciferase and DNaseI hypersensitive assays were used to  evaluate this putative regulatory function; the results of both screens  revealed that only 15% of CNCs have transcriptional regulators properties . This supports the current hypothesis that there may  be insufficient evolutionary distance between humans and others mammals to detect conserved regulatory sequences . In that view, the chicken offers a more divergent genome for  comparative analysis (310Mya for chicken human common ancestor)  and a tractable experimental system to evaluate the phylogenetic  distance necessary for regulatory elements identification. Alignment of 21q CNCs with the chicken genome revealed that ~10% of these are conserved down to birds . We electroporated chicken  retinas (E3 & E6) and chicken whole embryos (E2) with GFP reporter vectors to determine the regulatory potential of a set of those CNCs .  Preliminary data on 11 sequences suggest that the majority of the  tested CNCs (72%) strongly activate the GFP expression in explanted retina and in different embryonic tissues . We observed that few CNCs  behave as enhancers in early retina (E3) but not at later developmental stages (E6) . Our results suggest that the chicken genome could be used to identify transcriptional regulators among the mammalian CNCs .",2006

Smeets, A. Geurts van Kessel","Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands","Microarray based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH)  approaches have recently proven successful for detection of submicroscopic copy number alterations . Array CGH is now possible  with a genomewide tiling resolution of ~100 kilobases using 32,000 BAC clones . Improvements in resolution can be achieved by using higher  numbers of shorter fragments, provided that measurement precision is maintained . In this study we compared the performance of two  commercially available oligonucleotide platforms to our tiling resolution BAC array platform . DNAs from ten patients with submicroscopic copy  number abnormalities, identified by tiling resolution array CGH, were  hybridized in a blinded fashion onto 100k Affymetrix SNP arrays and 385k Nimblegen oligonucleotide arrays . We implemented a recently  published algorithm for SNP based copy number detection, corrected  for systematic variation using normal controls and automated data  analysis. Most known submicroscopic alterations were identified by  both platforms, as well as many additional copy number variants smaller than one megabase . Statistical power analyses indicated that the BAC  array platform exhibited the highest signal to noise ratio, allowing  reliable detection of single copy number alterations encompassing only 4 BACs . More targets needed to be combined for reliable copy number detection on the Affymetrix and Nimblegen arrays . The higher  target density of the latter two, however, compensated for the lower  detection power and the smaller size of the targets allowed detection  of alterations <100 kb. These findings indicate that genome profiling  results can be comparable across platforms, and increases in target  density will ultimately allow for copy number analysis of all 250,000 exons in the human genome .c79.

Array based genomic screening is a powerful strategy to identify chromosomal and allelic rearrangements . Among these techniques,  whole genome analysis using high density SNP genotyping  oligonucleotide arrays allow identification of yet unknown microdeletions, microduplications and uniparental disomies . We  collected a cohort of 70 children and, when available, their parents  with unexplained mental and developmental retardation, facial and/ or sceletal dysmorphologies, and other symptoms as well. The first  screening of the patients, including high resolution banding analysis and metabolic investigations was unconspicuous . The patients  genomic DNAs were analysed using the Affymetrix GeneChip 100K  Array, consisting of 116,204 single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) probes with an average spacing of 23 .6 kilobases . Data analysis was perfomed with dChip, Bioconductor and Perl script . Preliminary analysis revealed approximately 10% de novo rearrangements . These  deletions and duplications varied in size from 200 kb to 10 Mb and span regions which contain up to 118 known genes . Rearrangements  will be confirmed by LOH, quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) . We were also able to detect deletions at the  breakpoint region of 2 children with known translocations/inversions, which were not detected by cytogenetic investigations . Therefore,  microarrays provide an efficient way to serve as a tool for precise  mapping regions with allelic imbalances and chromosomal breakpoints  and may help to characterize new microrearrangement syndromes,  delineate regions of UPD and identify genes involved in chromosomal rearrangement phenotypes .

The aim of the ENCODE project (http://genome .gov/10005107) is ultimately to identify all the functional elements of the human genome .  During its pilot phase, ENCODE focuses on 44 regions of the human  genome corresponding to 1% of its sequence (Science, 2004, 306, 636 40) . As part of this project, the GENCODE consortium by combining  manual annotation with experimental validation, thus allowing constant  refinements, produced a high quality annotation of the genome to be used as the âreference setâ by the ENCODE consortium members . To uncover further the complex architecture of the human transcriptome  and potentially identify new gene elements (exons), we combined 5âRACEs with high density 22 nucleotides resolution tiling arrays .  PolyA RNA from twelve adult human tissues and three established  human cell lines were analyzed to investigate the complexity of the human transcriptome expressed in the ENCODE regions . Indeed, the  use of the RACE technology allows the detection of low copy number  transcripts/isoforms and a high resolution analysis of each gene in an individual manner but with high throughput using pooling strategies .  These experiments allowed the identification of as yet unannotated  exons and tissue/cell line specific, distal unannotated 5â exons in  the majority of the 399 tested genes. A significant subset of these  alternative distal 5â exon span large segment of genomic sequences  away from the main portion of the coding transcript and often overlap with the next 5â positioned gene(s) . These data are supported by  independent experiments mapping the transcription start sites using CAGE and PET Ditags .ESHG Concurrent Sessions100 c81. island of euchromatic like sequence and expressed genes  within the short arm of HsA21: sequence and copy number  variability.

Although the sequence of the euchromatic portion of the human genome is essentially complete, the heterochromatic regions remain unknown . These regions include the short arms of the acrocentric chromosomes .  Among these, the short arm of HSA21 (21p) has special significance because of its involvement in translocations resulting in trisomy21 . We  constructed a BAC library from the human mouse somatic hybrid cell line WAV17, monoallelic for HSA21 . We generated 1 .3Mb of 21p sequence from 8 BACs . Surprisingly, 21p contains islands of sequence showing  euchromatic like features with an interspersed repeat content similar  to that found on 21q. In silico and EST based predictions identified 29  gene models, a third of which were shown to correspond to bona fide genes by RT PCR in 24 human tissues . We mapped the 5â ends of  these transcripts by RACE and defined their structures. Analysis of  these transcripts in different individuals shows extensive nucleotide  variability and alternative spliced isoforms among different tissues suggesting multiple inter  and intrachromosomal copies . Moreover  they map to the short arms of multiple acrocentrics as determined with  monochromosomal cell hybrids. Quantification of their copy number  by qPCR suggests that they are present in 4 50 copies in the human genome . Since the gene content of the heterochromatic regions of the  genome appears to be underestimated, more efforts should be made towards the characterization of these unexplored regions . For this goal  we have end sequenced the entire BACs WAV 17 library and selected 47 clones that do not correspond to 21q for further sequencing .  clinical genetic",2006

CFC syndrome (MIM 115150)  is distinguished from Noonan syndrome by the presence of abnormal hair and hyperkeratotic lesions and by its usual sporadic occurrence .  Because CFC syndrome had been considered to be a more severe  variant of Noonan syndrome, but not found abnormalities in the gene PTPN11 in CFC patients . The clinical diagnostic criteria be used in  future studies aimed at identifying a molecular basis for this condition, and also differentiated CFC from Noonan and Costello syndromes .",2006

Introduction: Partial duplication of the short arm of chromosome 7  is a rare chromosomal disorder, which results in developmental, craniofacial, skeletal, and cardiovascular anomalies . There have been  to our knowledge at least 58 confirmed cases of duplicated 7p which  suggests a well defined pattern of abnormalities. Clinical Report: We report a case of a nine month old female infant with a direct duplication of the 7p22 .1 p13 chromosome region . The infant  presented psychomotor retardation, stereotypic behavior, generalized hypotonia, and characteristic dysmorphic features . The weight, the  length, and the head circumference were at 3rd, 25th, and 3rd centile  correspondingly  . The propositus presented a characteristic craniofacial  appearance with a peculiar thin Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome like facies,  high forehead, hypertelorism, slight palpebral fissures, pale highly  arched eyebrows, thin lips, high narrow palate, micrognathia, straight  and thin nose with a broad bridge, slightly angulated pointed tip and narrow inverted nostrils . The ears were low set and there were abnormal palmar creases . Skeletal anomalies included kyphoscoliosis, irregular  form of the vertebrae, narrow thorax, and bilateral camptodactyly of the  index finger. Traditional G banding detected a partial 7p duplication,  which was further demonstrated to be entirely of chromosome 7 origin  by using a whole chromosome paint for chromosome 7 and derived from 7p22 .1 p13 by multicolor banding (MCB) studies . Discussion: Our observations in combination with other cases  confirm that 7p trisomy due to dir dup(7p) can be regarded as a  defined chromosome syndrome. FISH, when used, is essential in the  confirmation of the cytogenetic abnormality and further delineation of the chromosomal disorder  .",2006

OBJECTIVE: To assess the role of DJ 1  among more common forms  of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) . METHODS: DNA from 70  unrelated sporadic ALS patients of Italian origin was screened for  mutations in DJ 1  by direct sequencing of polymerase chain reaction  amplified fragments. All 7 exons of DJ 1  and splice sites were screened .  Each new variant identified was also analyzed among Italian controls.  In one case carrying a novel heterozygous mutation, cDNA analysis was performed on RT PCR material obtained from a muscle biopsy  .  RESULTS: two novel DJ 1  heterozygous variants were detected . The  missense p.A179T substitution was identified in ALS patients (2.8%) and controls (0 .8%), and is therefore unlikely to be pathogenic . The missense p .R156Q mutation was detected in one patient (1 .4%), but in none of 580 control chromosomes . Although cDNA analysis revealed  no evidence for a second mutation in this patient, a pathogenic role for the p .R156Q mutation cannot be excluded .

All four patients had a score â¥ 4 on  the clinical checklist, whereas no abnormalities were found in patients  scoring â¤3. Conclusions1 . We demonstrate the added value of array CGH by detection of  submicroscopic segmental aneuploidies in patients with epilepsy of unknown etiology  . 2 . We show that a clinical checklist is useful in preselecting candidate patients with epilepsy for analysis by array CGH .",2006

","Reciprocal translocations represent one of the most common structural  rearrangements observed in man, with an estimated prevalence ranging from 1/673 to 1/1000 . They usually are inherited, but can also  occur as de novo  mutations, that are much rarer entities . We report on a male patient showing developmental delay, minor dysmorphic features and autism . Standard cytogenetic analysis  revealed that he carried a de novo  apparently balanced translocation,  t(1;5)(q23;q22). Searching for cryptic chromosome abnormalities, YAC  clones in the region of the chromosomal breakpoints were selected and used as FISH probes . The patient showed a deletion in chromosome 1 from q23 .3 to q24 .2, with a loss of about 8 Mb . In an attempt to further  characterize the deletion, with the aim to delineate a better genotype  phenotype correlation, whole genome screening was conducted using array based CGH analysis, at a resolution of 75 kb . The array CGH  data confirmed a cryptic deletion in the q23.3 to q24.2 region, without  other imbalances. The breakpoints were better refined and the size of the deletion was evaluated in 4 .97 Mb . When an individual carries an apparently balanced de novo   rearrangement, the risk for phenotypic abnormalities is significantly  higher than for an individual who has inherited a similar rearrangement from a normal parent . A number of different mechanisms can be responsible for the abnormal phenotypes .

","A mosaic of ring chromosome 17 and chromosome 17 monosomy was  found in a girl with neurofibromatosis, mild dysmorphic features, growth  and mental retardation, and atypical autism . The ring chromosome was  further analysed using fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) and  multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA) of subtelomeric regions . The classical cytogenetics mapped the breakpoints on both arms of the ring chromosome to the terminal G bands . The molecular  methods showed the absence of both subtelomeric loci but presence of the MDLS region on 17p . Therefore, the extent of the deletions must be between 0 .6 2 .5 Mb on 17p, and 0 .6 10 Mb on 17q . Interestingly,  the girl meets the NIH criteria for neurofibromatosis. Based on this and  on a literature review we argue that in addition to the universal âring  syndromeâ which is based on ring instability and is less specific for  the chromosome involved, various ring chromosomes may underlie their own characteristic phenotypes . In our patient the symptoms of  neurofibromatosis could be attributed to the mosaic hemizygosity for the NF1 gene in some of her somatic cells . Several candidate  loci for autism have been mapped to chromosome 17, and mosaic  hemizygosity or direct involvement of respective genes in the  aberration could possibly influence also this facet of the phenotype of our proband . It is a question if the chromosome 17 monosomy in a  substantial fraction of her somatic cells can also have consequences  for other future risks, for example due to her mosaic hemizygosity for the BRCA1 and TP53 genes .

Apart from rare monogenic forms such as APECED and IPEX the etiology is multifactorial . We describe a nonconsanguineous  German family with more than 25 members over 4 generations 5 of whom suffer from autoimmune diseases . Of those 3 females were  diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (T1D) and autoimmune thyroiditis (AT), 1 female with T1D, AT, and celiac disease (CD), and 1 female with AT  .  The age of onset ranges from 8 months to 35 years . Extensive serologic  investigations revealed the presence of autoantibodies specific for  AddisonÂ´s disease, primary biliary cirrhosis, pernicious anemia, T1D,  AT, and CD among affected as well as 5 additional family members without apparent clinical disease . Candidiasis, hypoparathyroidism,  and mutations in the AIRE gene were absent excluding the diagnosis  of APECED. Thus, the findings in this pedigree are consistent  with autosomal dominant autoimmunity resembling autoimmune  polyendocrinopathy type 2. Since organ specific autoimmune diseases  are T cell mediated we carried out gene expression profiling in  cultivated T cells from 2 affected and 2 normal controls using the HG U133 microarray  . We found a number of differentially expressed genes  involved in chemokine activity, signal transduction, and proliferation suggesting a pathogenic role of impaired T cell function . Currently, we  are carrying out whole genome linkage analysis to map the disease  locus. Identification of the gene causing this form of autoimmune  polyendocrinopathy may shed light onto the pathogenesis of more common forms of autoimmune disease such as T1D and AT  .",2006

Apart from mild  pulmonary emphysema, the condition has historically been considered as a strictly dermatological disease . However, recently aortic root dilatation was reported in 4 patients from two families . ADCL is caused  by frameshift mutations at the 3â end of the elastin gene ( ELN), resulting  in an extended protein . So far, only 7 mutations have been reported . We performed direct sequencing of the 3âend of the ELN gene (exons  28 34) and found two previously unpublished de novo  mutations in  exon 33, c .2278_2281dupGCAG and c .2315delC respectively, in two patients with generalised cutis laxa .

Importantly, both patients presented progressive aortic root dilatation  and mitral valve insufficiency at respectively 3 and 11 years old.  Interestingly, the latter also had a bicuspid aortic valve and a dilatation of the ascending aorta . It is likely that the presence of the bicuspid  aortic valve aggravated the aortic enlargement due to the deficient elastin . Moreover, she also presented severe pulmonary emphysema  (rest volume 208%; Tiffeneau index 40.4%). Our data contribute further evidence that ADCL is a systemic disease with cardiovascular and pulmonary complications . Progressive aortic  dilatation underscores the need for regular echocardiographic follow up . We are currently investigating the mechanism underlying this aortic aneurysm formation .",2006

In general, psychomotor development is normal, but 10 15% of patients develop epilepsy later in life . BFNC is caused by mutations in the voltage gated potassium channel subunit gene KCNQ2 (20q13 .3) or, less frequently, KCNQ3 (8q24) . Methods:  Analysis of the KCNQ2 gene was performed in seven families  and linkage analysis in one . Results:  In four families, four different mutations were detected;  one nonsense mutation (c .1756C>T, p .Gln586Stop), one missense mutation (c .1076C>A, p .Thr359Lys) and two frameshifts (c .1229delC,  p.Pro410fs; c.1601delC, p.Pro534fs). The missense mutation was  found in a proband and her affected mother, but not in the unaffected  grandparents, indicating a new mutation. In a fifth large family, linkage  analysis excluded the KCNQ3 locus, but screening of the KCNQ2 gene did not reveal a mutation . The proband was homozygous for a polymorphism (c .2339A>C, p .Asn780Thr) in this gene, while her daughter did not carry this allele . This indicated a large deletion of the  KCNQ2 gene, to be confirmed by MLPA analysis. Conclusion:  Five different mutations (71%) in the KCNQ2 gene were  detected in seven families with BFNC. This confirms that the KCNQ2  gene is a major locus for BFNC, also in the Netherlands. Our findings  illustrate that mutation analysis is also relevant in small families  and, probably, sporadic cases, and should include testing for large deletions .",2006

No data are available whether genetic polymorphisms play a role in bone disease development in premature infants . We performed  a pilot study to analyze the possible association between bone disease  in VLBW infants and allelic polymorphisms of the candidate genes  for osteoporosis, and we tried to identify fetal and maternal factors  influencing bone turnover. Sixty five VLBW infants were included. Twenty infants (30 .8%) were diagnosed with bone disease based on  positive radiological signs and high activity of bone formation (serum  alkaline phosphatase, osteocalcin) and bone resorption (urinary excretion of calcium and pyridinolin crosslink) markers .

Findings at birth included:  blepharophimosis, ptosis, epicanthus inversus, anteverted nares,  low set posteriorly rotated ears, cleft palate, absent uvula, a right  sided inguinal hernia, a small umbilical hernia, short neck, adducted  thumbs, gingival hypertrophy, second toe overiding hallux bilaterally  and a partial lack of separation of penoscrotal skin. Feeding difficulties necessitated placement of a gastrostomy tube . At 3 months of age he is globally delayed with microcephaly  . Chromosome analysis by routine G banding revealed an interstitial deletion of chromosome 3q (karyotype: 46,XY,del(3)(q24q25 .3)) .  Micro array CGH delineated a more centromeric de novo deletion;  del(3)(q22 .3q24) . This region includes the FOXL2  and ATR genes .  Further investigations are planned to determine whether the deletion is maternal or paternal in origin . Interstitial deletions of the long arm of chromosome 3 are uncommon and often give rise to BPES which maps to 3q23 . Heterozygous  mutations in, and deletions of, the FOXL2 gene, which encodes a  forkhead transcription factor, cause BPES . Deletions involving regions  larger than 3q23 have been described in patients with BPES with microcephaly, mild mental retardation and growth delay  . It has been  suggested that these additional features result from the absence of a  maternally inherited copy of the gene encoding ataxia telangiectasia  and Rad3 related protein ( ATR) .",2006

Early treatment can prevent sudden cardiac death . However, data on long term outcome  in unselected genotyped patients are scarce due to a lack of large registries . In 2005 a national internet based registry for familial heart  diseases in the Netherlands, named GENCOR, has been developed  in collaboration with the Interuniversity Cardiology Institute of the Netherlands . Objectives: GENCOR aims to assess the prevalence of familial heart  diseases in patients and families in the Netherlands and to facilitate  research to improve the quality of diagnostics and therapy in familial heart diseases . Methods: Patients who visit the (cardio)genetic outpatient clinic are  informed about GENCOR and consent is asked to store information  about cardiac examinations, family history and DNA diagnostics from all visits . Patientsâ data are entered in GENCOR by the cardiologist or Clinical genetics111 clinical geneticist in attendance . Additional information can be stored  for scientific research. Results: The registry has been tested in two university hospitals  which resulted in the inclusion of more than 200 patients . In 2006 all university hospitals will start using GENCOR .

We report a developmentally  delayed patient with congenital malformations carrying three different  rearrangements on both chromosome 22 homologues, including a  previously unidentified deletion of the 22q11.1 region. Although four  copies of the region are known to cause the Cat eye syndrome, we  postulate that a deletion of this region has no clinical relevance, as  five healthy family members also carried this deletion. In addition, the patient had a duplication of the DiGeorge critical region (22q11 .2) and a deletion of chromosome band 22q12 .1 . As several clinical  features, present in our patient, did not fit in the spectrum of the duplication 22q11 .2 syndrome, it is argued that an interstitial deletion of chromosome band 22q12 .1 might be related to the congenital malformations seen in the proband .

We investigated a group of 47 Spanish  patients (mostly from the Galician region) with a clinical diagnosis  of probable CMT and who had tested negative for the duplication  of a chromosomal segment containing PMP22 , the most frequent  molecular alteration in demyelinating CMT  . Systematic sequencing of  the coding region and exon intron junctions of PMP22 , MPZ , GDAP1  Clinical genetics11 and LITAF  was performed . We found two patients carrying previously  described mutations in MPZ : the first had a G to A substitution in exon  3 (R98H) and the second, a 486delC in exon 4 causing a frameshift  mutation (M172fs262). Additionally, we identified two novel coding  sequence alterations: i) one patient had a G to C substitution in the  first coding exon of PMP22 , predicting a leucine to phenylalanine  change in the protein (L5F) and ii) two apparently unrelated patients  exhibited a heterozygous GAA deletion in exon 5 resulting in the loss  of an arginine (R224del) in the GDAP1 protein.

The disease is associated with ischaemic  complications involving kidneys, heart and brain, severe multi organ dysfunction, and premature death . Among neurological symptoms, strokes and transient ischaemic attacks (TIA) have been reported . A  30 year old male patient, with FD, was referred to us for evaluation  of a sudden episode of dizziness, with disequilibrium, and diplopia, in agreement with the diagnosis of a TIA . Head magnetic resonance  imaging (MRI) showed no cerebrovascular involvement but revealed  the presence of Chiari type I malformation (CMI), a pathological  continuum  of hindbrain malformations defined by downward herniation  of the cerebellar tonsils of more than 5 mm below the foramen magnum  .  We subsequently performed head MRI in a cohort of 44 consecutive  hemizygous male patients and 10 heterozygous females affected with  FD, and identified 4 additional cases (one male and three female) and one case with borderline criteria of CMI . To the best of our knowledge,  this is the first time that CMI was found in association with Fabry disease . Whether this is coincidental or whether there is an increased  occurrence of CMI in FD is yet unknown but our data suggest that CMI should be ruled out in all patients with FD .",2006

Associated malformations in infants with OCs were collected between  1979 and 2003 in 334,262 consecutive births in the area covered by the registry of congenital anomalies of Northeastern France . The results showed that 35,9 % out of the 651cleft infants born during this period had associated malformations .Associated malformations  were more frequent in infants who had cleft palate(47,9 %) than in infants with cleft lip and palate(34,9 %) or with cleft lip only(14,4 %) . Malformations in the central nervous system and in the skeletal system  were the most common other anomalies, followed by malformations in the urogenital and cardiovascular systems . Weight, length, and head circumference of children with OCs and  multiple associated malformations were lower than in controls Prenatal diagnosis was rarely done by fetal ultrasonographic examination in isolated clefts . However, even in multiple associated  malformations, prenatal diagnosis by fetal ultrasonographic examination had a low sensitivity,43 .9% . In conclusion the overall prevalence of malformations, which was  one in more than three infants, emphasizes the need for a thorough investigation of infants with clefts . A routine screening for other  malformations especially skeletal, central nervous system, and cardiac  defects may need to be considered in infants with clefts, and genetic counseling seems warranted in most of these complicated cases .",2006

CMT is characterized by slowly progressive weakness and  atrophy of distal muscles in the feet and/or hands, often associated with  diminished deep tendon reflexes.

The Po protein  functions as a homophilic adhesion molecule in myelin compaction . As  other CMT1 types, CMT1B is a demyelinating peripheral neuropathy  characterized by distal muscle weakness and atrophy, sensory loss, and slow nerve conduction velocity  . It is usually slowly progressive and  often associated with pes cavus foot deformity and bilateral foot drop .  The range of the phenotypes associated with these neuropathies is  very wide, and correlations between the phenotypes and the individual mutations are useful . Here we report a portuguese family with CMT1B associated with a novel Po point mutation . Four clinical affected members of three consecutive  generations had a heterozygous mutation (278G>C) in exon 3, leading to a Gly93Ala substitution . In healthy family members no Gly93Ala was found . Gly93 is conserved among many other species suggesting that it is important in the formation of an extracellular Ig domain . Ikegami  et al . (1) reported a family with CMT1B associated with a Po point  mutation in the same position of exon 3 (278G>A, Gly93Glu) . The age of onset of symptoms varied from 11 to 51 years, suggesting  that in addition to the type and intragenic location of the mutation,  other mechanisms acting at the level of MPZ  gene expression, mRNA  stability and posttranslational protein modification may have an important effect on the ultimate clinical phenotype .(1) Ikegami T  .  et al .

CMT2A is the most frequent type among axonopathies, it is  caused by mutation in the gene of mitochondrial GTPase Mitofusin 2  (MFN2, 1p36 .2) . We have investigated 59 families with a clinical diagnosis of CMT2  and 28 families with CMT unknown type, in total 87 unrelated families . Mutations have been found in 10 families (all of them have diagnosis CMT2) . The most frequent mutation is Arg94Gln . We have  found it in five unrelated families. We have analyzed the cause of  the high frequency for this mutation by haplotype analysis using five polymorphic markers and seven intragenic SNPs . We determined that this mutation had independent origin in various families . In two other families a mutation Arg94Trp was found in the same codon .

High Prevalence of cohen syndrome amongst irish travellers,P0072.,"M. Murphy , A. Green, S. A. Lynch","National Centre for Medical Genetics, Our Ladyâs Hospital for Sick Children,  Dublin, Ireland","Cohen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder, prevalent in  the Finnish and Jewish populations. We report five cases of Cohen syndrome amongst three Irish Traveller families from Galway  . We are  aware of a sixth case in a UK based Irish Traveller child . All six have an identical homozygote mutation c .4471G>T mutation in the COH 1 gene . Using Traveller population data, from the 2002 census, we  estimate a minimum prevalence of Cohen syndrome of 8 per 1000 amongst Irish Traveller children in the County of Galway  . There are >30 other autosomal recessive conditions known to occur in this population . The prevalence of autosomal recessive disorders  is unknown but a recent study in County Galway reported that 2 % of  Traveller children have Hurler syndrome, 2% have Galactosemia, 1% have autosomal recessive OI and 3% are deaf . In addition, a further  5% had some form of disability and 28% of Traveller parents have suffered the death of a child . A delay in diagnosis occurred as many of the features were only  apparent in later childhood and, in the context of this community, follow  up is difficult as families move. The UK based case and our cases 4&5, who are unrelated to case 1,2  & 3, suggest that this disorder occurs throughout this community and  is not isolated to one clan. Molecular confirmation in this population is easy because the mutation is known . We recommend considering  this diagnosis in any child from this population who presents with developmental delay and microcephaly  .",2006

In 8 cases a splice  site alteration (involving introns 44, 47, 50, 53, 55) was present with one (c .3816+1G>A) being recurrent in two patients . One patient had  an in frame deletion of 18 nucleotides in exon 36 and in another patient a missense mutation (Gly1471Asp) was observed . In 6/10 patients  the phenotype was classified as Marshall syndrome because of the  early onset severe hearing loss and the severe midfacial retraction with short nose and protruding eyes . Ectodermal abnormalities were  absent in all patients but myopia and retinal detachment observed in some of them . One patient even had a type 1 vitreous anomaly  which has been considered to be specific for Stickler syndrome type 1 (caused by mutations in COL2A1) . In this group of 6 patients, 5 had a splice mutation and 1 had the 18 nt deletion in exon 36 . The phenotype  in the remaining 4/10 patients was similar to Stickler syndrome type 1 . The midface hypoplasia was less pronounced and only one patient presented with early onset sensorineural hearing loss . We conclude  that (in contrast to previous reports) splice mutations in COL11A1 can result in either a Marshall phenotype or a Stickler phenotype . We also  show that the vitreous phenotype is not always reliable in predicting  the molecular defect in patients with the Stickler Marshall phenotypic spectrum .",2006

The majority (>90%) of CAH is caused  by 21 hydroxylase enzyme deficiency (21OH). In response to concerns about the management of CAH patients in the UK an audit of CAH referrals to the laboratory was conducted . A  total of 495 CAH families referred for molecular testing of the CYP21   gene between January 2000 and June 2005 were examined . The  audit highlighted a requirement for further information on the complex  genetics of this disease and indicated that current population carrier risks may need reviewing [N .Gregersen  et al . 2006 . In preparation] . Another area the audit highlighted was the correlation between genotype and phenotype . In patients where two mutated alleles had  been identified we compared the expected mutation effect to the phenotype of the patient . The phenotype was as predicted from the  identified genotype in 80.7% of cases. It was also noted that in 31%  of patients only one mutation had been identified. To increase our  detection rate we have developed a rapid test, using pyro sequencing,  for another relatively common mutation in CYP21, the exon 6 cluster  mutation (g.1380T>A, g.1383T>A). To date we have identified 12%  (5/42) of patients, where only one mutation had previously been  identified, as positive for the exon 6 cluster mutation. This new test  avoids the need for sequencing the majority of the CYP21 gene, a time consuming and expensive test .",2006

Results of routine diagnostics of cornelia de Lange syndrome: screening for point mutations and deletions in the NiPBL gene,P0081.,"Lott , A. Gencik, H. Gabriel","Zentrum fuer Medizinische Genetik, Osnabrueck, Germany","Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a heterogeneous autosomal  dominant disorder characterized by typical facial features, growth  retardation, developmental delay, upper extremity malformations and a variety of other abnormalities . The prevalence of CdLS is estimated to be around 1/10,000 . Most cases are sporadic, although several familial cases are described . Since 2004 it is known that up to 50% of CdLS cases are caused by mutations in the NIPBL gene on chromosome 5p13 . This gene consists of 47 exons and mutations were found in the entire coding region . We introduced the mutation screening of NIPBL in 2005 and so far 23 patients were referred to our lab for testing of CdLS . To identify  mutations, we established a DGGE screening protocol for the rapid  and economical detection of mutations in all 46 coding exons and the splice consensus sites of the NIPBL gene . We detected 5 causative  mutations: one missense, two nonsense, one frameshift and one splice site mutation . To find out if the low mutation detection rate is partly due to  rearrangements resulting in deletion or duplication of one or more  exons, we tested the NIPBL gene for copy number changes with the  MLPA (multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification) technique. We detected no exon deletions in the 18 patients without point mutations . Our data indicate that DGGE is a highly sensitive screening method for detection of mutations in the NIPBL gene . Exon deletions in NIPBL are not a common cause of CdLS .",2006

Severity of CAD in patients was stratified into 3 groups as 1, 2 or 3 vessel CAD . 102 control subjects were selected among subjects with angiographically normal coronary arteries . Information on standard risk factors was collected . Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction (MDR)  analysis was performed to seek a model of coronary artery disease based on these 3 genetic polymorphisms .

Homozygosity mapping excluded the following loci: FGFR1  3 on chromosomes 8p12, 10q26 and 4ptel, TWIST and MSX2 on chromosomes 7p21 and 5q35 respectively  . Linkage analysis also  excluded all of these loci assuming autosomal dominant inheritance with reduced penetrance . AR inheritance has been suggested as a  likely mode of inheritance for this type of craniosynostosis in 1970âs (MIM # 218500) . However, this assumption was not further supported  since accumulating number of pedigrees clearly showed autosomal dominant tranmission . Moreover, heterozygote disease causing  mutations mainly in FGFR genes were also shown in many sporadic cases with unknown entity  . Neither a locus nor a gene has been  reported for AR form of this disorder as yet . Our study now provides  an evidence to reconsider a recessively inherited mutation at an  unmapped novel locus predisposing Crouzon like craniosynostosis (Supported by Hacettepe University Research Fund # 0201101010) .",2006

","Craniosynostosis can be either classified as simple or multiple. When  the sagittal suture is synostotic in conjunction with both coronal  sutures, the membranous bone of the calvaria expands between  the sutures, resulting in a characteristic lobulated skull configuration known as cloverleaf skull such as Carpenter Syndrome . We report on Clinical genetics11 a patient with bilateral multiple craniosynostosis involving the coronal  and lambdoid sutures .The proposita was the second child born to a healthy non consanguineous couple . The similar manifestations of the  Carpenter Syndrome and our case were: Acrocephaly, Brachycephaly,  Cloverleaf skull, Sloping forehead, Upturned nasal tip, Flat nasal bridge,  Epicanthic folds, Hypertelorism, Shallow orbits, Bilateral ptosis,Partial  syndactyly of the feet, Micrognathia, High arched, Short stature, Obesity, AR . Except to the above characteristics, our patient had other  manifestations included: Acral anomalies, Vertebral anomalies, High myopia, Proptosis, Anodontia . There were some typical features in  Carpenter Syndrome which we could not find in our case including:  Midfacial hypoplasia, Syndactyly, camptodactyly, Brachydactyly ,  clinodaclyly & Single flexion crease of the hands, Hypoplasia of the  middle phalanges, Preaxial polydaclyly of the feet, Dysplastic ears,  Low set ears, Genital abnormalities, Sclerocornea, CHD, Mental  deficiency, hearing loss. The features of our case were not typical of any known craniosynostosis syndrome . Search of POSSUM, LDDB and the medical literature uncovered no similar case . The constellation  of manifestations in this patient suggests a previously unrecognized syndrome resembling Carpenter Syndrome . Therefore, we conclude  that our patient may represent an extension of the Carpenter Syndrome or most probably a new Craniofacial Syndrome .",2006

Phenotypic  overlap with Schwartz Jampel syndrome type 2 (StÃ¼ve Wiedemann syndrome) exists . In the original report, Crisponi determined a low  level of gamma amino butyric acid (GABA) in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) in an infant, who died at 12 weeks of age . Our patients (two males and two females) are the offspring of three unrelated Turkish families . All children presented with perioral  contractions, dyspnea on exertion and camptodactyly in the neonatal period . Bowing of the long bones was not observed . They developed  truncal hypotonia and recurrent episodes of hyperthermia up to 42Â°C  in the first month of life. Because of severe swallowing problems, all  children needed a nasogastric feeding tube, which was followed by a percutaneous gastrostomy tube in two of the patients . In the most  severely affected child, low levels of GABA were detected in the CSF at the age of 18 and 19 months, respectively  . In the three other  children, CSF GABA levels were within the normal range . These three  patients are surviving with mild developmental delay, scoliosis and dysautonomia symptoms . The child with the low GABA concentrations died at the age of 30 months . We conclude that Crisponi syndrome can be distinguished from StÃ¼ve Wiedemann syndrome by the absence of bowing of the long bones .  Our data indicate, that low levels of GABA in the CSF of children with Crisponi syndrome might be associated with a poor prognosis .",2006

We present clinical and molecular data of  12 Greek patients aged 2 months 36 years with a clinical diagnosis of CS . Nine cases were sporadic and three familial . The most consistent  findings were craniofacial dysmorphic features (100%), followed by neurological (34%) and gastrointestinal anomalies (25%) . Exposure  conjunctivitis, poor visual acuity and optic atrophy were less frequent complications (18%) than shown in the literature . Midface hypoplasia  contributed to the development of high arched palate and probably  explains the high frequency (55%) of mouth breathing and tooth crowding . Congenital heart defects were noticed in 9%, while only one  patient had acanthosis nigricans involving eyelids and the skin of the neck . Five patients (42%) presented with mental retardation . Molecular  analysis by DGGE and direct sequencing in exons 8,10 of FGFR2 and exons 7,10 of FGFR3, revealed mutations in 8 cases .

The estimation of the expected  CF incidence in the Latvian population showed that the frequency of non mild CF cases in newborns should be 1:3300 . The average number of newborns per year in the period 2000 to 2004 was 20260 . So, the expected number of CF patients should be 6 per year  . However  in this 4 year period only 5 new CF patients were registered . This  discrepancy we wanted to explain by the ethnic diversity of Latvian inhabitants (Russians 28 .6%, Belorussians 3 .82%, Ukranians 2 .55%, Lithuanians 1 .37%) . In these populations, the frequency of dF508 mutation is less common . The aim of this study was to detect the frequency for dF508 mutation in the population of Latvia . 124 individuals were investigated (Latvians 59 .67%, Russians 30 .64%, Belorussians 3 .22%, Ukranians 3 .22%, Poles 3 .22%) . DNA diagnosis was performed using phenol ethanol DNA extraction method and PCR technique . Four individuals were found to be carriers of the dF508 mutation . Consequently, the  heterozygote frequency for the population of Latvia for CF dF508 mutation is 1:31 . In the beginning of the study it was expected that dF508 mutation frequency in the population of Latvia is less than previously reported . Instead, the mutation was found at a higher rate than it was expected .

Arakelyan","Center of Medical Genetics, Yerevan, Armenia","Cystic fibrosis (CF) is the most common severe inherited disease in Caucasians, occurring in approximately 1 in 2500 births . It results  from mutations in the CFTR gene, a transmembrane chloride ion channel . The defect in the chloride channel leads to a viscous mucous  production which, in turn leads to pathology in primarily three organ systems . The classic form of CF involves chronic pulmonary disease,  pancreatic insufficiency and infertility. Although there is wide range of  clinical expression, most individuals with CF experience substantial morbidity and require lifelong care . There is no data of this mutation and frequencies of carriers in Armenian population . In 55 patients with a clinical suspicion of CF  molecular testing has been performed for 25 frequent mutations and 8 polymorphisms . The genotyping analysis of these patients  revealed mutations in 8 cases. The detected mutation are ÎF508(1  case), and 3659delC ; 2184delA in compound heterozygote (7 cases). There have also been detected Poly(T) 5,7 or 9 polymorphisms . The  important difference with Poly(T) testing is that the role of 5T depends  on its relationship with R117H and that 5T variant alone was not usually associated with classic CF  . It is important testing in CF carrier  screening, because if one parent has R117H and 5T together on one  chromosome and the other parent carries another CF mutation, their children are at risk for having classic CF  .",2006

Parental origin and stage of meiotic error were studied using five STR markers . Meiotic nondisjunction of chromosome 21 was studied in 202 cases with free chromosome 21 . The parental origin and the  meiotic stage of chromosome 21 nondisjunction were detected in 190 of cases . Parental origin of nondisjunctions were derived as 167 (88%) maternal and 23 (12%) paternal . In maternally derived cases,  meiotic I nondisjunction was observed in 121 (64%) and meiosis II  in 46 (24%) of cases whereas in paternally derived cases meiosis I was detected in 13 (7%) and meiosis II in 10 (5%) cases . There  was no significant difference in the distribution of maternal ages between maternal meiosis I error versus maternal meiosis II error  .  It is unexpected that a nondisjunction at especial of maternal ages  between maternal meiosis I error against maternal II error, related  significantly to the rising incidence of Down syndrome with advancing maternal age . This data is usable in analysis of maternal and paternal  genetic or environmental risk factors to understand better the cause of chromosome 21 trisomy  .",2006

There have been only a few publications reporting mutations in the EDAR gene . To evaluate the contribution of EDAR  mutations, we analysed 8 families with clinical symptoms of ectodermal dysplasia so far  . All patients where previously tested negative for ED1  mutations . In a large german kindred with 9 affected family members the mutation Arg420Gln was detected in EDAR . The index patient is the youngest affected member of the family  .

Objectives : to describe  and compare clinical manifestations of ectopia lentis in younger and  older generations; to study the phenotype genotype correlation. Patients and methods : five affected persons from three generations  were investigated; evaluation included physical examination and a detailed family history  . Ocular examination included visual acuity and  visual field testing, retinoscopy and refraction, slit lamp examination,  fluorescein angiography. Results : the clinical expression of lens  dislocation was variable in this family  . The family pedigree showed an  autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with complete penetrance and variable expressivity  . Consanguinity was not present in this  family  . Family history was remarkable because grandmother and  motherâs siblings of our patient expressed severe phenotype of marfan  syndrome associated ectopia lentis (severe ocular, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular and dermatological manifestations) .

Several autosomal dominantly inherited  human syndromes have recently been shown to result from mutations in the p63 gene . These syndromes have various combinations of limb  malformations fitting the split hand split foot spectrum, orofacial clefting, and ectodermal dysplasia with some overlapping features . The p63  syndrome family includes the EEC syndrome, AEC syndrome (eyelid  adhesion/ ankyloblepharon ectodermal dysplasia clefting), ADULT  syndrome (acro dermato ungual lacrimal tooth), Limb mammary  syndrome (LMS), and non syndromic split hand/split foot malformation  (SHFM). The specific pattern of heterozygous mutations is distinct for  each of these syndromes and the functional effects on the p63 proteins also vary as well .

Factor VIII gene is located on Xq28 and comprises 26 exons . There is a need for genetic counseling despite the improvement of replacement therapies . Using  polymorphic markers in linkage studies would help in carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis . In this report we investigated the frequency of two short tandem repeats on factor VIII gene in Iranian population .methods:  DNA amplification of 70 unrelated individuals (93 X chromosomes) was performed . Two repetitive regions on factor VIII  including one in intron 13 and the other in intron 22 were amplified and resolved on 10% polyacrylamide gel and detected by silver staining . Results:  Different allelic bands were used as markers . These markers  were made by the recovery of each band and T/A cloning of them .  Studies have shown that there are six (18 23) allelic markers for intron 13 . Sequencing analysis of intron 22 had shown two repetitive units including AG (6 7) and GT (16 18) . This made it polymorphic but the  differences between each unit were identified by direct sequencing or SSCP  . conclusion:  Haplotype analysis of these intragenic dinucleotide  repeats has shown to be more informative than RFLP analysis and  could help us to provide carrier detection and prenatal diagnosis for familial cases . Although dinucleotides are polymorphic they may lead  us to genotyping errors of heterozygotes and homozygotes in the studied population .,2006

The father of the patient expressed a  hitherto undescribed aphidicolin induced fragile site, located in the chromosomal breakpoint region of the infant . The chromosomal  breakpoint was cloned and it was shown that the truncation is stabilized in vivo by the addition of repetitive telomeric sequence (TTAGGG) . The  breakpoint disrupts the DOK6  gene, which plays an important role in  the activation of receptor tyrosine kinases . In order to investigate the potential role of the observed fragile site in  the breakage mechanism we performed flexibility analysis, using the  Twistflex computer program, of the entire 18q22.2 region. The results  revealed that the 100 kb surrounding the breakpoint is extremely rich  in AT dinucleotide repeats, characteristic of aphidicolin induced fragile sites . Together, these data suggest that the breakpoint occurred within an aphidicolin sensitive fragile site, expressed in the father  . It is the  first time that an aphidicolin induced fragile site may be linked to in vivo chromosome breakage in the progeny  .

These patients  consulted our service of Cytogenetic and Biology of the Reproduction from July 2004 to July 2005 . The clinical investigation of these patients  reveals no prenatal, no neonatal and no postnatal origin of their mental retardation . The caryotype was normal for all . The molecular study, according to the international recommendations  for the diagnosis of the fragile X syndrome, was performed by two  different techniques: fluorescent CG rich PCR and Southern blot. Four of the screened patients (10%) showed an expansion of their  triplets CGG region confirming their X fragile status.Among these 4 patients only one is 13 years old . This one presents strongly evocative clinical features of fragile X syndrome . The 3 others, aged between 6 and 9 years, have poor clinical features . Indeed,  except MR, the other clinical criteria of X fragile syndrome appear  only after puberty, which makes difficult the clinical diagnosis at a very young age . Because of the important frequency of this syndrome in MR, its  phenotypic heterogeneity and its great risk of recurrence in the same  family, make its molecular diagnosis obligatory in front of any syndromic or not syndromic MR .Clinical genetics16",2006

The downstream promoter for the stimulatory G protein Î± subunit is unmethylated in all tissues apart for the renal proximal tubules . The  first and most upstream GNAS Differentially Methylated Region (DMR)  generates the NESP55 transcript and is paternally methylated, the  second DMR is maternally methylated and generates the XLÎ±s and the NESP Antisense (AS) transcript . Finally, the third DMR generates the 1A transcript and is also maternally methylated . Here we describe a  novel application of Methylation Specific Multiplex Ligation dependent  Probe Amplification (MS MLPA) which can detect changes in both CpG  methylation of all GNAS DMRs as well as the copy number of the whole region .

Materials and Methods: Questionaires were distributed in deaf schools,  hearing loss centers and rehabilitation centers in Qom and Markazi  provinces and were collected after filling by the parents.The information  such as age, sex, number of deaf individuals in families and their close  relatives, the marriage type of the parents and etiology were extracted from questionnaires and were analysed by SPSS software  . Result: 354 Questionaires containing complete information from hearing loss families were collected . 59 .3% and 36 .7% of parents have  consanguineous and nonconsanguineous marriage ,respectively and  the marriage type of 4% were not determined. By assesing the filled  questionnaires and pedigrees, the deafness aetiology in the studies population was categorized in genetic ( 70 .9 %), environment (9%) and unknown ( 20 .1%) . Conclusion:  Genetic factor with autosomal recessive inheritance  pattern was the most important cause of hearing loss due to the high prevalence of consanguineous marriage . This increased genetic factors to more than 50% . Large family sizes also increase the frequency of  hearing loss in families that have deaf with genetical background of this disorder  . In this study, environmental and unknown factors were  second cause of HL . We can interestingly reduce frequency of HL  in Iran by discouraging consanguineous marriage, health education, population regeneration control especially for high risk families .",2006

All  viral markers were negative, liver biopsy showed cirrhosis, in blood  biochemistry high serum ferritin (SF) was noted (1225 Î¼g/l). Her DNA was checked for mutations in HFE gene . The genotype revealed was C282Y/H63D . Unfortunately the phlebotomy treatment is not possible because she has anaemia (Hb 106 g/l) . Nevertheless SF decreased  spontaneously to 835 Î¼g/l, but later increased to 1300 Î¼g/l. Case 2: age 35, presented with chronic fatigue 8 months after hysterectomy due to myomatosis . Investigation revealed anaemia (Hb  109 g/l), elevated SF 403 Î¼g/l, which rised suspection for the HH. The HFE analysis showed genotype C282Y/C282Y  . Because of her low  Hb, she initiated treatment with desferal, but that was poorly tolerated, Clinical genetics10 because of side effects . Although case 2 has explanation for iron overload (hysterectomy), the  cause of anaemia has not been found, though both women consulted  a haemothologist .

Additional pedigrees, linking to one of these loci but  apparently being mutation negative, may inherit larger genomic aberrations . We have developed a multiplex ligation dependent probe  amplification (MLPA) assay allowing simultaneous standardised copy  number screening of almost every SPG3A  and SPG4 exon . In a cohort  of 18 HSP families, we identified 3 aberrant MLPA profiles segregating  with the disease and exclusively affecting SPG4  specific probes. Long  range PCR followed by sequencing revealed two novel multi exonic  deletions and a previously reported 3bp deletion as underlying these  MLPA results. Breakpoint analysis suggested specific but differing mutational events as having resulted in the deletions . Investigation at  the cDNA level showed that certain deletions may negatively influence  stability of the transcript from the mutated SPG4  allele . According to  these preliminary results, partial gene deletions in SPG4  seem to be a  rather frequent, but private, mutation type causing HSP  . To obtain more  solid data on their prevalence, we are currently investigating a larger series of index cases .

The attendance is 1 at 10 .000  live newborn,; 60 times higher at aborted human embryos. Depending  on the degree of differentiation and severity we can have 3 subtypes of holoprosencephaly: alobar  . semilobar and lobar  . Material and Method: The authors present a study on 3 premature  newborns, with lobar holoprosencephaly, an extremely rare affection in the current medical practice . Two of the patients didnât show any  symptoms until the age of two weeks when they presented generalized tonic clonic seizure . One of the newborns showed other associated malformations: unilateral anophthalmia and congenital septal defect .  Cerebral lesions were highlighted by cerebral imaging methods   head ultrasonography, CT in one of the cases and NMR in 2 of the cases .  Those investigations showed specific lesions at the median line. The  karyotype was normal in 2 of the cases; one of the cases presented trisomy 13 . The evolution of the cases was severe, causing death in  one of the cases and slowly evoluting with recurrent seizures and motor  and psychic retardation in two of the cases . Conclusions: Lobar holoprosencephaly is a rare affection, without  specific clinical expression and its diagnosis can be easily missed in the neonatal period . Cerebral imaging was the primary method in  the setting of the diagnosis: head ultrasonography tracked down the lesions and CT and NMR established their extension .",2006

Smeets","Academic Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht, The Netherlands","Holoprosencephaly (HPE) is a common severe malformation of  the brain that involves abnormal formation and septation of the developing central nervous system . The prevalence is 1:250 during early embryogenesis, but the live born prevalence is only 1:16000 .  The etiology of HPE is extremely heterogeneous and can include both a teratogenic and/or genetic basis . We studied four genes known to  be involved in HPE, namely SHH, ZIC2, SIX3 and TGIF by sequence analysis . A series of in total 47 sporadic and familial HPE cases with a variable clinical spectrum has been analysed . We detected 10  pathogenic mutations (21%), 5 out of 40 sporadic cases (13%) and 5 out of 7 familial cases (71%) . One of the familial cases was caused by a mutation in parental germ cells . Four mutations were detected  in the SIX3 gene, four mutations in the ZIC2 gene and two mutations in the SHH gene . The familial mutations displayed great phenotypic  heterogeneity of the disease, which makes it difficult to establish genotype phenotype correlations . This phenotypic variability may be  due both to environmental factors and to potential modifier genes.  HPE development is probably a multihit process , which implicates  more genes. This illustrates the importance of further identification of new genes .",2006

Most HCM mutations arise independently; founder effects are rarely observed . Mutations in the sarcomeric Myosin Binding  Protein C gene (MYBPC3) are associated with late onset HCM and  a relatively benign clinical expression. Previously we identified the  MYBPC3 2373insG mutation as an important Dutch HCM founder mutation . The MYBPC3 gene was sequenced in 208 Dutch HCM  probands to establish the prevalence of MYBPC3 associated HCM in the Dutch population . Results A pathogenic MYBPC3 gene mutation was identified in  95/208 (46%) probands .

The disorder affects males primarily but carrier females may  have mild manifestations . We report a 2 year old girl with severe manifestations of XLHED .case report : The presenting complaint was sore eyes and photophobia .  Her hair was sparse and thin . She had eyelashes but virtually no eyebrows . Her skin was fair with a tendency to wrinkling under the eyes . She had a single erupted conical maxillary incisor  . Three more conical  teeth in the same region were evident radiologically  . Psychomotor  development was normal . Parents were healthy and unrelated . Laboratory investigations : Routine chromosome analysis was  normal . X chromosome inactivation was completely skewed with the paternal X preferentially active . FISH paint X showed an insertion of X material into chromosome 9 . Further analyses using BAC probes  towards ED1 and XIST  confirmed that a fragment of at least 4Mb  containing XIST  was inserted into 9p13 in conjunction with a de novo   pericentric inversion of chromosome 9. The final karyotype was 46,X X,ins(9;X)(p13;q13q21)inv(9)(p13q13). BAC FISH confirmed that the  proximal breakpoint was in the ED1 gene . The distal breakpoint was  distal to the XIST  locus but was not further mapped . Both parents had  normal chromosomes, and the mother had a random X inactivation pattern .conclusion : Since XIST  was lacking on the X chromosome with a  disrupted ED1 gene, the normal X chromosome was inactivated  resulting in a severe phenotype of XLHED in this girl .",2006

Abnormalities of eyes, musculo skeletal system and of the central nervous system may also occur  . Other associated anomalies in  hands are  clinodactyly, syndactyly, and polydactyly and few cases with  HI and camptodactyly have been reported . Case report: 22 months old female with delayed psychomotor development and short stature . At  physical examination her weight wa 6,500 g ( 3pc); heigth of 75 cm  ( 3pc), CFO 47.5 (80 90); thin hair with alopecia in temporal regions,  facial dysmorphy characterized by triangular face, wide and prominent  forehead, hypertelorism, down slant9ing palpebral fisures, depressed  bridge of the nose, short philtrum, thin lips, low set and dysmorphic  ears; hypopigmented whorls, streaks, and patchy skin lesions that follow the lines of Blaschko on all body  . The hands showed fusiform  fingers, bilateral camptodactyly in 2 4th fingers, thenar and hypothenar  hypoplasia . In the lower extremities there was shortening of the  tibia and hallux valgus  in the right foot . Discussion: The HI (OMIM  300337) is an entity, with a wide clinical spectrum, and the principal  differential diagnosis in this case is the Terminal Osseous Dysplasia  and Pigmentary Defects Syndrome that is characterized by abnormal  and delayed ossification of bones in the hands and feet, brachydactyly,  camptodactyly, and clinodactyly, severe limb deformities, joint contractures and pigmentary skin lesions . The others skeletal and skin  abnormalities could be explained as part of the variable expressivity in HI .

Polymorphisms of Estrogen Receptor Beta Gene Are  Associated with Hypospadias A. Beleza Meireles1, I. Kockum1, L. FrisÃ©n1, A. NordenskjÃ¶ld1,2;   1Karolinska Institutet, Stockholm, Sweden, 2Astrid Lindgren Children Hospital,  Karolinska University Hospital, Stockholm, Sweden. Introduction: Hypospadias is a common congenital male urethral  malformation, defined as the displacement of the urethral meatus ventrally from the tip of the glans penis . The importance of androgen  receptor (AR) in male external genitalia development has been well recognized . Recently, the presence of active estrogen receptors (ESR) in the developing male genitalia has been demonstrated . There are  two isoforms of the human estrogen receptor,  ESR1 and ESR2 . The  detrimental effects of environmental toxicants with estrogenic activity  are mediated, in mice models, by ESR1, leading to feminization of male external genitalia . Besides, it has been shown that individuals  with relatively short CA repeat polymorphism in ESR2  displayed higher  androgen levels than those with longer CA repeats . We hypothesized  that modifications in these nuclear receptorsâ genes could lead to hypospadias . Patients & Methods: We have genotyped the CA repeat polymorphism  in ESR2  and the TA repeat polymorphism in ESR1  in sixty boys with  hypospadias and in a control population . Results: The CA repeat polymorphism in ESR2  is prolonged in  hypospadias patients than in controls (P<0,05) . Discussion: Variations in the ESR2  seem to influence risk to  hypospadias . Longer CA repeat polymorphisms might increas susceptibility to hypospadias due to lower levels of androgens . As  ESR2 is likely to be involved in the prenatal sexual differentiation, it  is possible that the effects observed are due to early organizational  effects of this receptor  . Acute effects of these receptors on the hormonal  production in the adrenal glands may be an explanation .",2006

The patient had a brother and a sister which  died in the first days of their life with congenital ichtyosis. Postnatal  development was delayed, with short stature and severe mental retardation . The patient evaluation revealed that ichthyosis is associate  with craniofacial dysmophism ( microphthalmia, anteverted nares,  macrostomia, micrognathia, dental caries and enamel abnormalities,  ears annomalies), limbs annomalies (arachnodactyly, fingers and  toes join contractures, congenital dislocation of hip, bilateral with femoral hypoplasia) . The association between ichthyosis, craniofacial  dysmorphology, hip dislocation and mental retardation allows us to believe that this case is about a syndromatic ichthyosis .

Belva,"Centre for Medical Genetics, AZ VUB, Brussels, Belgium","Background: Although thousands of children are born worldwide after  ICSI, there is still a major concern about its safety and the potential risks for the health and future fertility of the offspring . Methods: The medical outcome of 150 8 year old children born  through ICSI was compared with 147 singletons of the same age born Clinical genetics1 after spontaneous conception (SC) . A full clinical examination was  performed with special attention to congenital anomalies and pubertal  development . Information about their general health was obtained from the parents by means of a questionnaire . Results: No significant medical or neurological problem was documented in the two studied groups .  Physical examination did not  reveal important differences between ICSI and SC children . Weight,  heigth, head circumference and Body Mass Index did not differ between the two groups . 15/150 (10%) ICSI children experienced a major congenital malformation compared to 5/147 (3 .3%) SC children  (RR 2.94; 95% CI 1.09 7.89). Minor malformations were found in 35/145 (24 .1%) ICSI children compared to 25/145 (17 .2%) in SC  children (RR 1.40; 95% CI 0.88 2.21). Pubertal staging was similar in both groups . Genital examination, nearly in all children performed,  showed comparable numbers of abnormalities in boys (ICSI 4%, SC 6 .6%) and girls (all normal) . Conclusion: Physical examination including a thorough neurological  examination revealed reassuring findings. Major congenital malformations appeared to be more frequent in the ICSI group . Overall general health of the children born after ICSI seems satisfactory  .  Further monitoring of these children regarding further puberty and future fertility is mandatory  .",2006

Patients usually  have an expansion of more than 60 CAG repeats in the HD gene and paternal transmission is the rule . PATIENTS AND METHODS:  We retrospectively reviewed clinical and genetic data of JHD patients  (n=29) seen at the Referral center for HD of the SalpÃªtriÃ¨re hospital, Paris, France, between 1990 and 2005 . RESULTS: The mean delay before diagnosis was 9Â±6 years (0 21) . The most remarkable signs  at onset were severe psychiatric and cognitive disturbances (19/29, 65 .5%), whereas rigidity was absent . Unusual signs at onset included  myoclonic head tremor in 3 patients, severe isolated drug or alcohol  addiction in 2, psychotic disorder in 1 and difficulty writing in 1. During  the course of the disease, psychiatric disturbances were severe with at least one suicide attempt in 7/29 patients . Transmission was maternal in 25% . Forty six percent of JHD patients had less than 60 CAG repeats, six of whom inherited the disease from their father  .  Anticipation (18Â±9 versus 25Â±11, p=0 .27) and age at onset (17 .14Â±2 .2 versus 13 .29Â±5 .5 years, p=0 .086) were similar in patients with maternal compared to paternal transmission . CONCLUSION: Most JHD patients  started the disease with psychiatric and cognitive difficulties. This  lead to misdiagnosis or diagnosis delay, especially in cases without familial history of HD . Maternal transmissions and expansions of less  than 60 CAG repeats were unexpectedly frequent and should not be considered exceptional .",2006

Associated features can be bimanual synkinesia, renal agenesis, cleft lip/palate, dental agenesis and hearing loss . Two genes, responsible  for KS in approximately 20% of all cases, have been identified: KAL1 ,  involved in the X linked form (KAL1, OMIM #308700) and FGFR1,   causing the autosomal dominant form (KAL2, OMIM #147950) .

CHD7  on chromosome 8q12 .1 was discovered as the  major gene involved in CHARGE syndrome . Recent studies showed  that anosmia and hypogonadotropic hypogonadism are consistent  findings in CHARGE syndrome as well. Therefore, we investigated  whether mutations in CHD7  can also cause KS . Patients with a clinical diagnosis of KS, without mutations in KAL1  or  FGFR1  were screened for CHD7  mutations. None of the patients fulfilled  the diagnostic criteria for CHARGE syndrome .

We have sequenced the MGP gene in 7 individuals with tracheobronchial  cartilage calcifications and brachytelephalangy, and found mutations in 4 of them . Two girls of Turkish origin were homozygous for IVS1 2A>G, previously observed in another Turkish family  .

A boy of 12 years has been referred to our clinic due to statural  deficiency, hypogonadism and small testes. From the age of two years  he had seizures refractory to several combinations of anticonvulsant drugs . Dysmorphic features on his face included high forehead, deep set eyes, broad and long nose, pointed chin . His height was 3  SDS below the mean, long arms and legs in accordance to the body height . His IQ was 40 and he had speech impairment and behavioral problems such as insecurity and shyness . Karyotype was 47, XXY  .  Because of short stature, hormonal tests for growth hormone have  been performed; all with the values below 2 ng/ml. MRI of the brain was normal . Hormonal replacement therapy was not performed because of the risk for refractory seizures . However, follow up of the child  showed satisfactory growth velocity and spontaneous appearance of pubertal signs . Favorable outcome of the height without a hormonal  replacement therapy is due to the tendency towards higher growth in persons with KS .

Farhat  Hached university teaching hospital, sousse, Tunisia. ","Klinefelter syndrome is the most common form of male hypogonadism .  It is a genetically determined primary gonadal defect characterized by the XXY karyotype . Pituitary changes in patients with Klinefelter syndrome have not been evaluated in detail . In fact, protracted  stimulation of gonadotrophs due to lack of androgen feedback might  have been a factor in the formation of the gonadotroph adenoma or in the development of gonadotroph hyperplasia . Clinically silent GH microadenoma was also described . At our knowledge, only one case of  association between Klinefelter and prolactin (PRL) secreting adenoma was reported . We report here a new case of this association .A 16 year old patient who consulted for gynaecomastia . Laboratory  findings showed hypogonadism with high concentrations of FSH and  LH ( FSH=96 mUI/l and LH=38 mUI/l) and the diagnosis of Klinefelter  syndrome was confirmed by cytogenetic testing. However, the level  of serum prolactin was high (PRL= 1030ÂµUI/l) and the MR imaging  pituitary showed a non invasive macroadenoma with enlarged sella  turcica In conclusion, clinical features in Klinefelter syndrome are commonly caused by peripheral hypogonadism . However, an association with hyperprolactinemia must be researched .",2006

Villaverde, B. Garcia Sandoval, C.  Ayuso","FundaciÃ³n JimÃ©nez DÃ­az, Madrid, Spain","INTRODUCTION:Leber Congenital Amaurosis (LCA) is the most severe inherited retinopathy with the earliest age of onset . Non  syndromic LCA has been associated with mutations in eight genes: AIPL1, CRB1, CRX, GUCY2D, MERTK, LRAT, RPE65 and RPGRIP1 .  These genes are involved in different physiologic pathways in the retina . MATERIAL AND METHODS:We report a mutational analysis of a  Retinal Dystrophy family with two affected generations (four affected  members) with differnt phenotypic severity: one LCA affected patient  in the youngest generation and three early onset RP affected patients en two sibship of the oldest generation . They were studied with a genotyping microarray (disease chip) for LCA (www  .asperbio .com)  and have been further refined with the use of additional polymorphic markers (STRs) and direct sequencing . RESULTS:The patient affected with LCA presents three mutated alleles;  two mutations in CRB1 gene (C896X, found by LCA chip and E1330N,  newly found by direct sequencing) and the third one in RPGRIP1 gene (Q589H, found with LCA microarray) . The other affected members of  the family present E1330N (CRB1) mutation as well as the RPGRIP1 mutation . Haplotype analyses are compatible with CRB1 segregation in this  family and with the existence of a second CRB1 mutated allele in the three affected RP patients . CONCLUSION:In this family the presence of two CRB1 mutated alleles  and RPGRIP1 mutation in every case is associated with a severe but variable RP phenotyope . We propose that the RPGRIP1 mutation could affect the course of the disease but it does not explain the variability in this family  .",2006

Up to 90% of LS patients present missense  mutation in PTPN11  gene, encoding for the SRC homology 2 (SH2)  domain containing PTPase (SHP 2) . Several clinical manifestations  overlap those of Noonan syndrome (NS), which is due to different  PTPN11  mutations . In paediatric LS patients, CLS and/or lentigines  pose difficult differential diagnosis mostly with Neurofibromatosis type  1 (NF1) and NF/NS, largely caused by NF1 gene mutations . To date,  no other gene mutation has been concretely related to LS, even if a  mutation in NF1 gene was reported in a patient supposed to be affected  by LS. Increasing evidence suggests that SHP 2 and neurofibromin,  the NF1 gene product, play their modulatory role through a common  pathway  . This evidence prompted us to screen the NF1 gene in 4  full blown LS individuals, in which PTPN11  gene mutations had been  excluded by DHPLC and sequence analysis of the entire coding region .  The NF1 gene analysis was carried out by DHPLC and sequencing .  No pathogenic mutation was detected in our LS individuals . This result  indicates that NF1 gene mutations are not related to LS, thus implying  that the clinical overlap between LS and NF1 NFNS is not paralleled by a unique molecular event .",2006

Because the  clinical diagnosis is not always obvious, a set of diagnostic criteria was formulated in 1993, the âSchwartz criteriaâ (SC) . Purpose : Evaluation of the predictive value of the SC in relatives of  probands who carry a LQTS gene mutation, using molecular genetic testing as gold standard .methods and Results:  Since 1996 we identified 96 probands with a  disease causing mutation . 517 genotyped relatives were included in this study  . In relatives with a positive genetic test 40/212 had a SC â¥ 4 (sensitivity  19%, specificity 99%). Measuring QTc duration alone in 517 relatives  revealed a QTc duration â¥ 430 ms as the optimal cut off point to predict the genotype, with an area under the curve of 0,848 . Sensitivity and  specificity measured at QTc duration â¥ 430 ms are 71% and 86% respectively  . The rate of false positives increases when heart rate  exceeds 75/min or CL < 800 ms .conclusions:  The Schwartz score has low sensitivity in identifying  carriers of an aberrant gene in families with an established disease  causing mutation. Analysis of QTc duration alone (QTc â¥ 430 ms) has  a sensitivity of 71% and a specificity of 86% in predicting mutation carriership (AUC 0 .848) . An important cause of false positive results  using this method is a relatively fast heart rate; the specificity of this  method increases to 93% when relatives with a heart rate above 75 bpm (CL < 800 ms) are excluded .",2006

METHOD: One large pedigree with carriers of the G189R mutation in the KCNQ1 gene was obtained (55 persons) . Another large  pedigree with carriers of the 1795insD mutation in the SCN5A gene was obtained (179 persons) . All persons in the pedigree had a 100 % or 50% probability of carrying the mutation . All cause mortality was compared to the general Dutch population in similar time intervals . MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE: Standardized Mortality Ratio (SMR), the ratio between observed and expected mortality  . RESULTS: For LQTS1 patients; there was significant excess mortality in males (SMR 1 .9,CI 1 .2 2 .9), especially in the age categories 0 1 (SMR 3 .5,CI 1 .3 7 .6) and 1 10 years old (SMR 3 .4,CI 1 .3 7 .4) .

CONCLUSIONS: In this study on the natural course of two types of Long  QT syndrome, significant excess mortality was observed in different age categories . The observed age distributions are consistent with the literature . Based on these results, continuation of active cascade  screening, starting at young age, in LQTS families is justified.",2006

Our series illustrates the pattern  of characteristic findings while underscoring the unique issues in individual patients . Seven of our patients had a Chiari I malformation,  and four underwent surgical foramenectomy for concern of symptomatic brain stem compression . In some, cerebellar tonsillar ectopia recurred despite surgical intervention, possibly due to ongoing brain overgrowth .  These findings support the recent observations made by Garavelli et al (2005) that Chiari I was previously underappreciated in this syndrome .  It is widely suspected that M CMTC carries a tumor risk for affected  patients but the incidence and type of tumor predisposition is not well understood, thereby complicating anticipatory care recommendations .  One of our patients developed a cerebral mass with radiographic  appearance of a meningioma at age five years. Another unexpectedly  developed multifocal atrial tachycardia, a rare arrhythmia, with secondary cardiomyopathy  .

Early puberty is the most consistent feature of  this syndrome appearing in 24 of 25 cases reported to date . A 11 year old boy was referred to our clinic because of developmental delay  . He was the third son of young, healthy, unrelated parents . Clinical evaluation: proportionate short stature, postnatal microcephaly, short hands and feet, early puberty and hypertrichosis . GTG banding karyotype revealed a rob(13;14); one brother, mother,  two maternal uncles and maternal grandmother were also carriers of this translocation . DNA study with 14q specific polymorphic markers demonstrated  absence of paternal contribution for the regions studied, thereby establishing the diagnosis of mUPD(14) . For most markers a pattern consistent with maternal heterodisomy  was observed, whereas for the remaining markers the homozygous pattern observed in the patient indicated isodisomy  . This pattern  (coexistence of segmental isodisomy and segmental heterodisomy) can be explained by meiotic crossing over  . In this case the clinical pattern observed is consistent with previously reported cases of mUPD(14) .

Mutations in different genes can lead  to similar syndromes; in contrast, one single mutation can result in a variable clinical manifestation . The most frequent cause (80%)  of Mitochondrial Myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis and Stroke like episodes (MELAS) is the m .3243A>G point mutation in  the mitochondrial tRNALeu(UUR) gene . Other clinical manifestations  of this mutation are diabetes, deafness, renal tubulopathy and cardiomyopathy  . To explain the differences in pathology observed  in carriers of the m .3243A>G mutation, we applied global gene  expression profiling on muscle biopsies from affected and unaffected mutation carriers with different levels of the mutation and controls .  Protein turnover and reactive oxygen species (ROS) defence were  significantly up regulated pathways and changes were more prominent  in the unaffected group with lower mutation levels than in the affected group . Increased production of ROS between m .3243A>G mutation  carriers and controls was further demonstrated by dihydroethidium (DHE) staining of superoxide radicals in muscle . We hypothesise that  the accumulation of oxidative protein damage due to excessive ROS production stimulates protein turnover  . Apparently, this process is more  effective at lower mutation levels where the increased ROS production  can be dealt with by increasing the expression of genes involved in  protein breakdown and protein synthesis, preventing severe symptoms from occurring . If mutation levels get too high, compensation is no longer possible and severe symptoms become manifest .",2006

Interestingly, a  diagnostic analysis of approximately 200 MR cases onto our tiling  resolution BAC arrays detected two partially overlapping de novo   microdeletions and one de novo  microduplication in 2q23 .1q23 .2 .  Severe MR, postnatal growth retardation, microcephaly, coarse facies and epilepsy were noted in both microdeletion patients . The  microduplication was detected in a severely mentally retarded boy with marked hypotonia . The minimally affected region of 317 Kb encompasses two known  genes: methyl CpG binding domain protein 5 ( MBD5 ), and enhancer  of polycomb homolog 2 ( EPC2 ) . MBD5  is an autosomal homologue of  methyl CpG binding protein 2  (MeCP2 ), implicated in Rett syndrome .  Remarkably, some clinical overlap with Rett syndrome could be noted in our patients . In addition, duplication of  MeCP2  causes severe MR  and progressive neurological symptoms, as was observed in our microduplication patient . Therefore, we performed mutation analysis  as well as copy number analysis of MBD5  and EPC2 in 47 patients  referred to our centre for MeCP2  analysis, together with a 2q23 copy  number analysis of 200 additional MR patients . No additional genetic alterations were detected . In conclusion, 3 submicroscopic alterations at the 2q23 region have been identified in ~400 MR cases, pointing to a rather frequent microdeletion/duplication . The overlap in clinical features between the  two microdeletion patients points to a new MR syndrome which needs  to be further defined. European Human Genetics Conference 2006, Amsterdam",2006

Most studies that investigated the usefulness of  diagnostic tests in patients with MR are performed in institutionalized patients with severe MR . This study examines the frequency and types  of genetic defects among individuals undergoing neuropediatric and genetic evaluation because of DD and/or MR . Cases were ascertained through the population based Congenital  Anomalies Registry of Navarra that monitors children with a birth defect,  including DD/MR, whose mother lived in the province of Navarra at the time of diagnosis . All cases (248 males and 187 females) were  evaluated on at least one occasion by a neupediatrician and/or a clinical geneticist . Conventional karyotype was performed on 390  (90%) cases; a total of 102 (23%) children were screening for fragile X syndrome and 137 (31%) for subtelomeric rearrangements . A specific genetic cause of DD/MR was found in 201 (46%) cases.  Numerical aneuploidies were found in 121 (28%) children: 100 cases  had Down syndrome, 14 were trisomy 18 and 7 showed a sexual chromosome aberration . Subtelomeric rearrangements were detected in 10 (2 .3%) cases, 5 of whom had also other structural congenital defects . Eight children (1 .8%) had a microdeletion syndrome and 8 (1 .8%) carried other structural chromosomal anomaly  . Single gene  defects were observed in 47 individuals (10,8%), including seven cases (1,6%) with fragile X syndrome . This study shows that subtelomeric rearrangements are the third most  frequent cause of a DD/MR, especially if it is associated with structural defects .",2006

Our propose was to determine  molecular genetic cause of RCM type I in Yakutia and devise a simple method of diagnostics . We have considered that this disease had  widely distribution in Yakutia due to local founder effect and chose 4  polymorphic markers flanking the human b5R gene  (DIA1, 22q13 .31 )  to check this idea . Most of affected probands were homozygous for all markers and have identical haplotype .

Huntington  disease is inherited as an autosomal dominant condition . Increase in the number of CAG repeat, presented on chromosome 4p, causes HD .  This sequence may be duplicated many times in individuals (up to 26 times) in the general population . Individuals with HD may have from 40 to over 100 repeated CAG segments .Since there is a hypothesis  that the presence of some natural polymorphisms in some genes such  as MTHFR could affect the Huntington disease, now we are aiming  to investigate the possible role of these SNP in those clinically and genetically diagnosed affected patients . In addition we would like to  establish a real time PCR assay for the diagnosis of the Huntington  patient",2006

Production and  plasma levels of TGF Î²1 are influenced by polymorphisms in the TGF  Î²1 gene ( TGFB1 ) . We investigated whether the  509C/T (rs1800469),  868T/C (rs1982073), 913G/C (rs1800471), and 11929C/T (rs1800472)  polymorphisms of TGFB1  are associated with myocardial infarction . Methods and Results: The study population consisted of 3657 patients  with myocardial infarction (885 women and 2772 men) and 1211  control individuals (598 women and 613 men) with angiographically  normal coronary arteries and without signs or symptoms of myocardial infarction . Polymorphism related genotypes were determined with  TaqMan assays and haplotypes were estimated from the genotype data . The  509C/T polymorphism and  509C/868T/913G/11929C  (CTGC) haplotype were associated with myocardial infarction in men,  independently from the potentially confounding factors age, arterial  hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, cigarette smoking, and diabetes mellitus . Lower risks of myocardial infarction were observed among the  carriers of the  509CC genotype (adjusted OR 0.49, 95% CI 0.27 0.87;  P=0 .014) and homozygous carriers of the CTGC haplotype (adjusted  OR 0.61, 95% CI 0.38 0.98; P=0 .042) than among the noncarriers  of this genotype or haplotype . None of the genotypes ( Pâ¥0.37) or  haplotypes ( Pâ¥0.35) was associated with myocardial infarction in  women . Conclusions: Positive association findings in this study suggest that  TGFB1  is a susceptibility locus for myocardial infarction .",2006

A  distinguished group of NBIA patients show the typical eye of the tiger sign in MRI . Both missense and nonsense mutations have been found  in such patients in a gene encoding the mitochondrial pantothenate  kinase (PANK2), which is predicted to catalyse the first step of CoA biosynthesis . We completed a mutation screen in 91 patients with the diagnosis  NBIA based on clinical findings and radiological imaging. The entire  coding region of the PANK2  gene (20p12 .3) was investigated for  point mutations and deletions . We uncovered both mutant alleles in 52 patients . Deletions accounted for 4% of mutated alleles . Patients  with two loss of function alleles (n=13) displayed symptoms always at an early stage of live . In the presence of missense mutations (n=39)  the age of onset correlated with residual activity of the pantothenate kinase . Progression of disease measured by loss of ambulation was variable in both groups . We did not observe a strict correlation between  the eye of the tiger sign and PANK2  mutations . No PANK2  mutation  was identified in 39 patients. Clinical features of both groups were assessed and analyzed for similarities and discrepancies . Conclusions: Deletion screening of PANK2 should be part of the diagnostic spectrum . Other factors than enzymatic residual activity are determining the course of disease . There are strong arguments in favour of locus heterogeneity  .",2006

The major symptoms of neuromuscular disorders are generalized  muscle weakness and wasting, muscular atrophy, extraocular  ophthalmoplagia, respiratory, cardiac, and other smooth muscles  involvement. These disorders classified as follow, myopathies  (muscular dystrophies); neuromuscular Junction disorders (congenital  myasthenic syndromes); neuropathies (Charcot  Marie  Tooth); motor neuron disorder (Spinal Muscular Atrophy) .The aim of this study was  classification of neuromuscular disorders based on clinical, molecular  and immunohistochemistry (IHC) techniques in Iranian patients referred to Genetic Research Center during one year  . Result: We found 82 patients with Myotonic Dystrophy, 19 Duchenne/ Becker Muscular dystroophy (DMD/BMD), 21 Limb Girdle Muscular  Dystrophy (LGMD), 3 Fascioscapulohumeral Muscular Dystrophy  (FSHD), 2 Congenital Myasthenic Syndromes (CMS), 6 Congenital  Muscular Dystrophy (CMD), 10 Spinal Muscular Atrophy (SMA)  based on clinical examination, electromyography (EMG) and muscle enzymes . Conclusion: Therefore we must investigate the rest of the patients  with DM diagnosis for DM2 and also the rest of patients with clinical  symptoms of LGMD that they had normal sarcoglycan and dysferlin proteins in IHC . We need more analysis by using multiplex western  blot technique to detect calpain, dysferlin, and sarcoglycan proteins in  LGMD patients.

NOGGIN is secreted as a homodimer that binds to bone  morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and acts in an antagonistic way to BMP signalling .

It is mentioned that our proband did not present any of the  cardinal manifestations of Costello syndrome (papillomata, acanthosis  nigricans, loose skin, deep palmar creases), which shows phenotypic overlap with NS . At the age of 5 years he presented with recurrent abdominal pain and constipation . Laboratory evaluation with U/S and CT scan demonstrated the presence of an abdominal mass . A total  resection of the mass and consequent histology revealed embryonal rhabdomyosarcoma . Rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare tumor in children  with NS and to the best of our knowledge only four cases have  been reported so far, while in Costello syndrome, the frequency of rhabdomyosarcoma is approximately 17% . The presentation underlines  the importance of frequent follow up of patients with NS phenotype, since the incidence of various malignancies is small but existing .",2006

The phenotype is extremely variable and includes webbed neck, chest deformity, mild mental retardation, cryptorchidism,  feeding difficulties, bleeding diathesis, myeloproliferative disorders, and lymphatic dysplasias . This condition is relatively common, with a prevalence at birth of 1:1000 2500 live births . Missense mutations in the  PTPN11 gene on chromosome 12 (12q24) account for approximately 50% of NS cases . The gene encodes a non receptor protein tyrosine  phosphatase (PTP) SHP 2, with NS mutations resulting in gain of  function. A significantly higher prevalence of mutations is described in familial cases than in sporadic ones . Genotype phenotype correlations  demonstrate that pulmonary stenosis is associated with PTPN11  mutations, whereas hypertrophic cardiomyopathy is associated to mutation negative cases . In this study, we have analysed 27 patients  with NS clinical phenotype. Molecular lesions have been identified in  8 of them, presenting typical clinical features associated to pulmonary valve stenosis . A familial novel mutation, Leu261His, has been  identified in two sisters, and a Leu262Arg missense mutation has been observed in a sporadic case .",2006

","Oculo auriculo vertebral spectrum (OAVS or hemifacial microsomia)  is a relatively common disorder affecting ~1 in 5600 live birth and  results from a defect of blastogenesis involving primarily aural, oral and mandibular development . Clinically, OAVS ranges from microtia  or auricular or preauricular abnormalities with or without mandibular  hypoplasia, to a complex phenotype with skeletal, cardiac, renal, pulmonary, and CNS manifestations . Vertebral anomalies and  epibulbar dermoids, when present, delineates the so called Goldenhar syndrome . While diagnosis and management of OAVS are well  established after birth, its antenatal pattern of malformations is still poorly delineated . We describe a fetus with abnormal ultrasound imaging at 20 weeks showing hydrocephalus and radial aplasia . Post mortem examination  followed pregnancy termination and confirmed the diagnosis of OAVS . To delineate the spectrum of prenatal features of OAVS, we review 20 published fetuses showing abnormal US/MRI imaging . Cephalic abnormalities were found in 52 .4% (i .e . micro/anophthalmia, ear anomalies, hemifacial microsomia and facial cleft) .

However, the prevalence and nature of LRRK2  mutations,  the polymorphism content of the gene, and the associated phenotypes remain poorly understood .OBJECTIVE: We performed a comprehensive  study of this gene in a large sample of families with Parkinsonâs disease compatible with autosomal dominant inheritance (ADPD) .  METHODS: The full length open reading frame and splice sites of the LRRK2  gene (51 exons) were studied by genomic sequencing in 60  probands with ADPD (83% Italian) . RESULTS: Pathogenic mutations  were identified in six probands (10%): the heterozygous p.G2019S mutation in four (6 .6%), and the heterozygous p .R1441C mutation in two (3 .4%) probands . A further proband carried the heterozygous p .I1371V mutation, for which a pathogenic role could not be established with certainty  . Thirteen novel disease unrelated variants and three  intronic changes of uncertain significance were also characterized.  The phenotype associated with LRRK2  pathogenic mutations is the  one of typical PD, but with a broad range of onset ages (mean 55 .2, range 38 68 years) and, in some cases, slow disease progression .  CONCLUSION: On the basis of the comprehensive study in a large  sample, we conclude that pathogenic LRRK2  mutations are frequent  in ADPD, and they cluster in the C terminal half of the encoded protein .  These data have implications both for understanding the molecular  mechanisms of PD, and for directing the genetic screening in clinical practice .",2006

A number of biochemical abnormalities have been described in PBD  patients including decreased levels of plasmalogen, and increased levels of VLCFA and cholestanoic acid derivatives . More than 25 different entities have been diagnosed in the last two decades . The  diagnoses on suspected cases can now be confirmed precisely by detailed biochemical evaluation in some metabolic centers .Clinical genetics11 The most severe condition is the Zellweger syndrome, a condition  due to the absence of functional peroxyzomes . Affected patients are  severely ill, and show multiple congenital anomalies and neurological  aberrations. There are specific biochemical tests for evaluating peroxyzomal functions . Accumulation of certain VLCFAs (C24:0, and  C26:0); deficiency of plasmalogens, and elevation of phytanic acid are some of them . Chondrodysplasia punctata is another example, they are genetically  heterogeneous group of dysplasias having stippling of the epiphyses in infancy as a common feature . Peroxyzomal abnormalities only found in the rhizomelic type . A few cases of Zellweger syndrome and  Chondrodysplasia punctata will be presented with a brief overview on biochemical background, clinical evaluation, and diagnosis .",2006
Poland syndrome and paroxysmal supraventricular  tachycardia: a sequence or just coincidental findings?,P0233.,"Tumiene1, M. Jakutovic2, V. Cerniauskiene2, R. Janavicius1, A. Utkus1","1Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Vilnius, Lithuania, 2Vilnius Uni   versity Childrenâs Hospital, Vilnius, Lithuania","Poland syndrome is a developmental disorder of as yet undetermined etiology  . Several causes have been proposed for this syndrome, which  include primary hypoplasia of the central brainstem nuclei, secondary  brainstem nuclear degeneration, peripheral nerve involvement and mostly accepted sequence of prenatal subclavian artery disruption . Most cases are sporadic . The most consistent pattern of defects is  unilateral hypoplasia or aplasia of the pectoralis major muscle and  varying degrees of ipsilateral brachydactyly and syndactyly, less  consistent features include hypoplasia of breast and/or nipple, other  upper limb reduction defects, Sprengel anomaly, dextrocardia, rib and vertebrae anomalies . The syndrome is 3 times more common in males and 75% right sided . The presented patient was diagnosed with Poland syndrome at birth  (there were aplasia of the left pectoral major muscle, brachydactyly and syndactyly of ipsilateral hand) . Cardiac, abdomen ultrasonographic,  intracranial duplex sonoscopic findings and chest X ray were normal. The first paroxysm of supraventricular tachycardia was recorded at the age of 11 months during acute viral respiratory infection . More such episodes accurred during the 10 months period . Cardiac arrhythmias were treated with adenosine boluses, later amiodarone was added . Conclusion: only one case of Poland Moebius syndrome in association with cardiac arrhythmia was reported previously (Pierpont et al .) . It is  not known if this association is a sequence of the same etiology, or just the two coincidental factors .",2006
"A de novo paternal microdeletion of 6q, including sim1, is  not only associated with a Prader  Willi Like Phenotype (PWLP)  but also with Basedowâs disease and acanthosis nigricans",P0234.,"Wand , C.

","Three different classes of 6q deletions with shared phenotypic features have been described (Hopkins et al . 1997) . Rare cases  with microdeletions indicate that within deletion group B (6q15q25) a  distinct subgroup of patients with PWLP may result from hemizygosity  of the small chromosome segment 6q16q21 including also the SIM1 gene (Faivre et al . 2005) . We report about a 16 year old girl  with adipositas (BMI 30), severe mental retardation and other major features of PWLP  . BasedowÂ´s disease and acanthosis nigricans were  seen in addition to macrocephalus, dental anomalies, uvula bifida and kyphosis . Cytogenetic and microsatellite analysis revealed a de novo  paternal microdeletion including SIM1 at 6q16.3. Our study confirms  the assumption that 6q microdeletions including SIM1 are associated with obesity and PWLP  . Recently it has been assumed that hemizyosity  and/or functional loss of SIM1 is associated with hyperphagic obesity  via a disturbed regulation of MC4R expression in the paraventricular nuclei of hypothalamus (Holden et al . 2005) . BasedowÂ´s disease and  acanthosis nigricans have not been reported so far in the context of deletions including 6q16q21 . These additional clinical features of our  patient would indicate that hemizygosity for that 6q segment including SIM1 has additional neuroendocrinological effects, e .g . such as on the level of TRH and MSH .",2006

We report a two year old boy with  an apparently typical Hutchinson Gilford progeria syndrome (HGPS)  due to compound heterozygous missense mutations in LMNA  resulting  in T528M and M540T  . Both mutations affect a conserved region within  the C terminal globular domain of A type lamins, shown to be affected in other progeria like patients . The nuclei of our patient showed no  prelamin A accumulation, nor did the dysmorphic nuclei reveal the lobulation typical for HGPS . Instead, nuclear blebs with reduced/ absent expression of B type lamins as well as honeycomb figures could be detected . The healthy heterozygous parents showed similar nuclear changes, though in a smaller percentage of nuclei . Treatment  with a farnesyltransferase inhibitor to block the prelamin A processing  resulted in accumulation of prelamin A and improved the nuclear  phenotype. In conclusion, these findings suggest a critical role for the  affected lamin A/C region in nuclear structure and support a major contribution of abnormal polymerisation to the progeroid phenotype .   Prelamin A accumulation may not be the major determinant of the progeroid phenotype, in contrast to earlier suggestions .",2006

Progeria is an autosomal dominant condition which presents in early childhood with symptoms of premature aging and early death .  Mandibuloacral dysplasia is an autosomal recessive disorder,  characterized by mandibular hypoplasia, acroosteolysis, and progeroid facial appearance . These two diseases have been considered different  clinical entities based on differences in phenotype and inheritance pattern . We are describing a patient with failure to thrive, developmental delay, stroke, skin dyspigmentation, and facial dysmorphism . Brain  magnetic resonance imaging with MR angiography revealed severe atheromatous disease and recruitment of collateral circulation . His  history, physical exam and radiology findings were not completely  consistent with either progeria or MAD which presented a diagnostic dilemma . Molecular studies were conducted and revealed a novel, heterozygous (412 G>A) mutation in exon 2 of the lamin A/C gene .

Clinical symptoms occur  usually at age of 6   18 y  . and embrace myoclonus, severe tonic  clonic epizodes, dementia, ataxia and dysarthria . The most common  mutation is an expansion of a dodecamer repeat C4GC4GCG in 5â UTR  of CSTB  gene; the point mutations may occur as well. Normal alleles  contain 2 or 3 copies of the repeat, whereas mutant alleles contain more than 30 repeats .

We have  studied 3 male patients aged 0 11 years with PBS in order to appreciate  the frequency of different clinical features and to present some  particularities. Physical examinations revealed deficiency of abdominal wall muscles and cryptorchidism in all patients . Investigations (renal  ultrasound, CT, contrast voiding cystourethrogram, echocardiography)  showed various abnormalities: hypoplastic right kidney in one patient,  bilateral hydronephrosis in 2 patients, dilated ureters in all patients,  large and thick walled bladder in 2 patients, posterior urethral valve, vesicoureteral reflux and cardiac anomalies (ASD, PDA) in one patient.

Visual acuity remained normal . Decreased levels  of the vitamin K dependent coagulation factors were observed prior to surgery for a cerebral aneurysm . Three similar additional patients are currently being studied in a Belgian French Italian collaboration . The present phenotype shows clinical overlap with PXE because of i)  the initial skin manifestations mimicking the disorder, ii) the identical  light microscopical findings and iii) the angioid streaks in fundo.  However, several differences allow us to discriminate from PXE or cutis laxa . First, the skin involvement is more severe than in PXE, and  not confined to the neck and flexural areas. Secondly, the retinopathy is mild and does not affect visual acuity  . Thirdly, ultrastructural analysis  showed mottled appearance of elastic fibres, with mineralization as small electron dense precipitates, not observed in PXE . Fourthly,  analysis of the ABCC6  gene, responsible for PXE, failed to reveal any  mutation. Finally, the presence of elastic fibre mineralization and the retinopathy exclude known cutis laxa syndromes .

Eight mutations  in the HSPG2  gene encoding perlecan, a heparane sulphate  proteoglycan present within basement membranes, are described in 6 SJS families without a detailed clinical description . To assess the  spectrum of mutations and the associated phenotype, we investigated one third of the reported SJS population . Twenty three unrelated families (35 patients) were screened for  mutations in the HSPG2  gene . Perlecan expression was evaluated in  patientsâ cultured cells at the mRNA and protein level to examine the effect of the mutations . Retrospective clinical analysis was carried out  for patients with perlecan mutations. Twenty five perlecan mutations  were identified among the thirty five patients including genomic deletion, nonsense, frameshift, missense, and splice site mutations .  Their deleterious effect was confirmed by the reduced, though not abolished, secretion of perlecan by patientsâ cells . A distinct cellular  pattern was observed between truncating and missense mutations with  lower level of perlecan mRNAs for the former, and intracellular retention of perlecan protein for the latter  . Retrospective clinical analyses of the  cohort revealed that permanent muscle stiffness, mostly apparent in the face, was the hallmark of the disorder  . By contrast, chondrodysplasia  was more variable, and was absent in two cases . Schwartz Jampel syndrome may be defined as a progressive autosomal  recessive disorder with early childhood onset that associates mask  like face, neuromyotonia, and variable osteochondrodysplasia, with  deficiency in perlecan secretion.

Along with the clinical findings that are described in this syndrome he  had sever developmental delay which is not commonly found in these  patients and an autistic regression that was not described before in this syndrome . A possible explanation for the autistic regression might be the tendency for undetected hypoglycemic events in children with SRS . Another  explanation is that the autism is not a part of SRS but is due to the chromosomal abnormality  . A rare but important type of abnormality  that accounts for some of cases of autism is uniparental disomy (UPD) . There is a well established association of UPD with autism and  the imprinted 15q11 q13 Prader Willi/ Angelman syndrome (PW/AS) region . Recently there was a case with UPD of chromosome 1 and autism . This case suggests an association of autism with a locus on chromosome 7 . UPD can cause disease by two mechanisms .

Two  highly homologous SMN genes are  mapped on chromosome 5q13: SMN1 (telomeric copy, SMNT) and  SMN2 (centromeric copy, SMNC) . The disease is caused by mutation or  deletion in SMN1 gene, which differs from the SMN2 gene only in five nucleotides . One of these differences is located in the exon 7 splicing  enhancer that results in an incorrectly spliced transcript lacking exon  7 (SMNÎ7) for the SMN2 gene. More than 94% SMA patients have homozygous deletions in SMN1 exon 7, but not in the SMN2 gene .  It is known that SMN2 expresses about 10% of full length mRNA and  this form may influence the clinical presentation of the disease. Recent  reports about therapies for SMA contain approaches to increase the  expression of full length SMN2 gene transcript from by treatment of  phenylbutyrate or  valproic acid .

SMS is caused by  mutation or deletion of the retinoic acid induced 1 ( RAI1)  gene on  chromosome 17p11 .2 . In order to analyze the role of genes in the 17p11 .2 region in this disorder, we evaluated the molecular and  clinical findings in 32 SMS patients carrying either a 17p11.2 deletion  or a mutation in the RAI1  gene . Using FISH, we determined that  8/32 individuals carry a common ~3 .5 Mb deletion encompassing the 17p11 .2 region from  TNFRSF13B to ULK2  . Smaller deletions  were found in 9/32, while 4 individuals carried larger and/or atypical 17p11 .2 deletions .  RAI1  mutations, including single base and large  intragenic deletions and missense mutations, were identified in 11/32 patients . Genotype:phenotype analysis was performed by comparing  the features of patients with deletions and to those with mutations in  RAI1  using Fisherâs exact test . Phenotypic comparisons show that  cardiac anomalies, speech and motor delay, hypotonia, short stature and hearing loss are associated with 17p11 .2 deletions rather than  with RAI1  mutations at statistically significant proportions ( p <0 .05) .  Interestingly, data show that patients with mutations in RAI1  are  overgrown, with height and weight >97thcentile . Further, patients with  smaller deletions show features similar to those with RAI1  mutations .  We conclude that while RAI1  is the primary gene responsible for the  core features of SMS, other genes within 17p11 .2 contribute to the  variability and severity of the syndrome .",2006

Hypohidrotic ectodermal dysplasia, EDA, the most  common and best known ED, is usually inherited as an X linked  semidominant trait, although rarer autosomal dominant and recessive forms exist . Affected males show severe oligodontia or anodontia, and abnormalities in tooth shapes . Anomalies are seen in both primary and permanent dentitions . Further analysis established the causative mutation as a sub  microscopic deletion encompassing the PAX9  gene, thus, suggesting  that haploinsufficiency of PAX9 leads to tooth agenesis. Here we report the characterization of a small nuclear family  . Mandibular incisors,  premolars, molars, and maxillary incisors, canines, premolars, molars  are the teeth most often missing or having conical crowns in the some of current family members . Permanent teeth showed reduced mesiodistal dimensions and shorter root lengths than normal teeth . Primary teeth were normal in size, shape, and number  .

Huntingtonâs disease genetic testing standards,P0269.,"P. Jakupciak , K. L. Richie","Natl Inst of Standards and Technology, Gaithersburg, MD, United States","Huntingtonâs Disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disease that affects 4 to 7 individuals per 100,000 . HD is an autosomal dominant inherited  disease that is associated with an expansion of a trinucleotide (CAG) repeat located on chromosome 4 . Individuals with 26 triplet repeats or  less are normal, and while those with 27 to 35 repeats may not show symptoms themselves, their future generations may have the disease .  Individuals with 36 to 39 repeats are at risk, while 99% of HD patients have 40 or more CAG triplet repeats . International cooperation with  the Eurogentest community as well as NIST and the CDC is needed  to promote a strategy to initiate the acceptance and recognition of  validated materials to serve as international standards for genetic testing . In response to the need of standards for Huntingtonâs Disease  genetic testing, NIST, is validating a panel of Huntingtonâs Disease  genomic material for use as standard reference materials (SRM) for HD testing . The panel of standards (each consisting of two alleles)  include a pair of homozygous alleles, closely spaced normal alleles,  normal/expanded alleles, borderline/expanded alleles, closely spaced expanded alleles, and normal/large expanded alleles . Future  coordinated efforts between NIST, ACMG, CDC, and the Eurogentest  community will increase the number of standards for genetic testing  such that the health care community has the positive and negative  controls needed to significantly impact diagnostic accuracy especially  in difficult and ambiguous clinical situations.",2006

Transient Neonatal Diabetes Mellitus (TNDM) is a type of diabetes presenting in the neonatal period . It is caused by aberrations within an imprinted region at 6q24 .

We present the first report  of a family with recurrence of TNDM in two sisters with LOM at the TNDM DMR on 6q24 . In addition to the LOM TNDM both sisters had  partial LOM at the KCNQ1OT1 in the Beckwith Wiedemann Syndrome (BWS) region on chromosome 11p15 .5 (KvDMR, domain 2), as recently reported by us for the older sister (Mackay et al ., 2006) . The  parents are first cousins. The clinical phenotypes of the girls show  manifestations of both syndromes, albeit so far with macroglossia  as the only BWS feature in the younger sister in whom the level of the KCNQ1OT1 LOM is smaller compared to her older sister  . We  suggest that these sisters represent a novel, most likely autosomally  recessive inherited defect of the methylation machinery affecting at least two different loci . The present report has two important clinical  implications: Firstly, the detection of concomitant KCNQ1OT1 LOM in  these patients with LOM TNDM prompts for testing for KCNQ1OT1  LOM in future patients with LOM TNDM, as the molecular diagnosis  of BWS may have implications for the clinical management including renal ultrasonography  .

Recently, a linkage analysis  on sib pairs mapped susceptibility loci to chromosomes 15q11 13 and Xq26 . To identify host genetic factors involved in the susceptibility to  TB in Japanese, we performed a gene based association analysis of  21 candidate genes [SLC11A1 (NRAMP1), vitamin D receptor (R),  IL 1beta, IFN gamma, IFN gammaR1, IFN gammaR2, IL 12 (p40),  IL 12 (p35), IL 12Rbeta1, IL 12Rbeta2, STAT 1, IL 18, IL 18R, IL 23  (p19), IL 23R, IL 27 (p28), IL 27R (WSX 1), TNF alpha, TNFRSF1A,  TNFRSF1B and UBE3A genes] on 87 TB patients and 265 controls using marker single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) . For the genes  with two or more marker SNPs exhibiting significant allele association,  we subsequently analyzed the association between adjacent coding SNPs (cSNPs) and TB . Among a total of 118 marker SNPs, 3 of  IL1B and  2 of IL12RB1 showed association with TB . Non synomymous cSNPs  were not identified in  IL1B  . Association studies on 4 non synomymous  cSNPs of IL12RB1  (641A/G, 1094T/C, 1132G/C, 1573G/A) in linkage  disequilibrium showed that 3 of them were significantly associated with the development of TB . Haplotype analysis on the 4 cSNPs  demonstrated that frequency of ATGG  haplotype was significantly lower  in TB patients than in controls .

The 1173TT  genotypes was associated with significant reductions in mean warfarin dose   29 .3Â±2 .9 mg/week versus 42 .3Â±2 .3 mg/week for 1173CC and 40 .1Â±2 .6 mg/week for 1173CT (p<0 .05) . And this association was true  when the contribution of the CYP2C9 gene polymorphisms in inter individual sensitivity to warfarin was considered . No effect of G3730A on warfarin dose was detected in our population . In conclusion, the  C1173T VKORC1 gene polymorphism may modulate the warfarin  dose prescribed to acquire the target anticoagulation intensity and  investigation of this genetic variant has important clinical significance  in selection and individualization of warfarin dosage along with the CYP2C9 gene polymorphism determination .",2006

Pramparo2, O. Zuffardi2","1Istituto G.Gaslini, Genova, Italy, 2Dept. of Pathology and Medical Genetics,  University of Pavia, Pavia, Italy. ","SRY gene plays a key role in human sex determination and is  responsible for initiating male sexual differentiation . The protein  encoded by SRY contains a homeobox (HMG) domain, which is a DNA  binding domain present in some chromatin associated proteins of the high mobility group family, and in some transcription factors . Mutations  within the SRY open reading frame are reported to be associated  with XY pure gonadal dysgenesis . The majority of these are de novo   mutations affecting only one individual in a family  . Only a small subset  of mutations is shared between the father and one or more of his children . Most of these familial mutations are localized within the HMG  box and only two are at the N terminal domain of the SRY protein .  Herein, we describe a young girl with pure gonadal dysgenesis and her  phenotypically and fertile father carrying a novel familial mutation in  the SRY gene at codon number 3 . This mutation is resulting in a serine  (S) to leucine (L) substitution in the protein . The secondary structure of the SRY protein was carried out by protein modelling studies . This  analysis suggests, with high probability, that the N terminal domain  of the SRY protein, where we found the mutation, could form an Î±  helix from amino acid in position 2 to amino acid in position 13 . The  secondary structure prediction and the chemical properties of serine  to leucine substitution stands for a potential disruption of this N  terminal Î± helix in the SRY protein . This mutation could play a major  role in destabilizing the interaction of the SRY protein with the target  DNA or could favour a translocation of the SRY protein in a cellular  compartment where could not play its DNA binding function .",2006

Known genetic causes of these conditions include mutations of SRY,  duplications of DAX and WNT4 , deletions of DMRT , WT1 , SOX9 , or  SF 1 , or predominance of a 45,X cell line . We present here 10 cases  of females with a Y chromosome : six isodicentric Y chromosomes,  one ring Y chromosome, two XY females, and one XY individual  with pseudo hermaphroditism. Blood lymphocytes, skin fibroblasts  and gonadal tissues were investigated by standard and/or molecular cytogenetics . The seven patients with a structurally abnormal Y  chromosome were found to have a predominant 45,X cell line in blood and/or gonads, explaining their female phenotype . The patient  with pseudo hermaphroditism, who had a predominant 45,X cell line  in her blood lymphocytes, had a predominant 45,X cell line in some  structures of her gonads, but a predominant 46,XY cell line in the  remaining gonadal structures, therefore explaining her ambiguous phenotype . The last two patients had an homogeneous 46,XY cell line  in blood, and 46,XY/45,X mosaicism with a predominant 46,XY cell line in their gonads . Their phenotype is thus more probably explained  by an infrastructural rearrangement of one of the genes implicated in sexual differentiation .

In our laboratory,  cytogenetic diagnosis of FA is based on the combined analyses of several criteria . According to these criteria, only 12 cases were  classified as FA patients. Cases with sinificantly more breaks than in normal controls, but less than FA range, are considered ambiguous . In these cases, treatment with DEB or MMC on fibroblasts can be induce  elevation of chromosomal breakage and by this method itâs possible to  detect specifically the somatic mosaicism.

BRCA2  acts as a tumor  suppressor gene and consistent with it, BRCA2 protein plays a  significant role in maintaining genomic stability by involvement in DNA  repair and recombination. In pursuit of finding out whether mutation in  the BRCA2  gene influences the genomic instability, the constitutional  karyotypes of BRCA2  heterozygous mutation carriers were analyzed .  Previously, with the application of two color FISH with YAC probes, we  identified chromosomal rearrangements at 9p23 24 in three families with hereditary breast cancer  . A common region of duplications,  inversions and amplifications was established for them (Savelyeva et al ., 2001) . Our further analysis of distal 9p region by multicolor FISH with different  BAC clones allowed us to determine more precisely the map of rearrangements at the 9p region . In search of a cause of this instability, we propose that unknown fragile site might be responsible for observed chromosomal aberrations . We  induced fragile sites in lymphoblastoid cell lines of BRCA2  mutation  carriers by aphidicolin, which partially inhibits the DNA synthesis . This  led to the identification and further detailed genomic localization of the  new aphidicolin inducible fragile site, FRA(9)(p22.2 ). We show that  FRA(9)(p22.2)  breaks are limited to a 500 kb region .

Dicentric autosomes are considered as unstable constitutional  chromosomes in humans . The presence of centromeres on the  same chromosome leads to a high risk of attachment of the same  chromatid to the mitotic spindle from opposite poles and to the  formation of anaphase bridge during cell division . Therefore, breakage  of the dicentric can occur  . We describe a fetus in which a minute  supernumerary marker chromosome (SMC) was detected in addition  to a larger pseudodicentri c chromosome . The case was a 12 week  fetus with mosaicism for a normal and two abnormal cell lines: one  had a dic (12;15)(q11.2;q11.2) chromosome the other a minute SMC.  Deletion of centromeric material was proposed as one mechanism of centromere inactivation in dicentric chromosomes . This SMC may be  the result of a deletion event leading to inactivation one centromere of a dicentric chromosome to generate a pseudodicentric chromosome .  Therefore, these case suggest possible mechanisms for the origin of minute SMC .",2006

The frequency of chromosome aberrations in  human peripheral blood lymphocytes were determined  with the help  of conventional cytogenetics, G banding analysis and FISH WCP method . The data received during 10 15 years following the accident  demonstrated a dose depended increase of chromosome aberrations  level in exposed groups and confirmed the growth of intensity of  somatic chromosome mutagenesis induced by Chernobyl accident factors . It have been shown that even so called âlowâ radiation doses  under prolonged exposure induce specific chromosome damages,  which can serve not only as biomarkers of radiation exposure, but as  indicators for selection of risk groups as regards to realize of harmful health effects with genetic component . In order to study late effects (in 15 20 years) following the accident,  new approaches for the evaluation of genetic consequences of human radiation exposure have been introduced . These include the  study of so called âdisgenomic effectsâ (especially delayed, hidden,  transmissible chromosome instability and âbystander effectâ both in exposed persons and in their progeny  .

clarifying the role of cell cycle control proteins chk1 and AtR using cytogenetics and molecualr cytogenetics.,P0321.,D. Scott,"Sheffield Childrenâs NHS Trust, Sheffield, United Kingdom","ATR and CHK1 are proteins involved in cell cycle control . Their  purported action, when there is slow down or complete discontinuation  of DNA synthesis at replicatively complicated sites in the genome, is thought to halt synthesis elsewhere in the genome . Examples of such  sites are repeat sequences that allow DNA to twist into unconventional  non B DNA (non helical) structures making synthesis difficult. These  repeats are particularly prevalent at both common and rare fragile  sites (FS); and are thought to be the antecedents of FS expression seen in classical Cytogenetics . ATR/CHK1 induced cessation of DNA  synthesis allows replication machinery to reattach at these loci and proceed beyond them . A mechanism to investigate the role of CHK1 and ATR could therefore  be the potential increase in breakage at fragile site areas after knocking down the function of these proteins . We abrogated the normal in vivo  function of ATR and CHK1 in HELA cells using siRNA, and investigated the effect on metaphase phenotype and fragile site stability  . We have  designed a dual colour fusion probe spanning FRA16D and have found  by cytogenetics and FISH that the increase in FS expression upon knock down of the ATR/CHK1 pathway was marked . It corroborated  evidence for both non B DNA formation leading to replicative difficulty and for the putative functions of ATR and CHK1 .",2006

This study presents the  investigation of in vitro irradiation and individual cytogenetic effects  in peripheral blood lymphocytes of 20 healthy donors on different stages of the cell cycle . With this purpose analysis of chromosomal  aberrations in cultured lymphocytes after 1,5 Gy Î³ irradiation in G1, S  and G2 stages of cell cycle was carried out . It was shown that chromosomal radiosensitivity varies qualitatively and quantitatively during the cell cycle . Transition of chromosome type  aberrations to chromatid was marked during the progress of cells to  mitosis. Exchange aberrations prevailed in the first half of the cycle  whereas a change in damage spectrum to deletions in the second half of  cycle was observed. The lowest chromosomal sensitivity to Î³ radiation  was observed in the S  stage and the highest in late G1 stage and G2  stage . Thus the highest variations in individual chromosomal sensitivity  to radiation were detected in G2 stage (from 14 to 124 aberrations/100  lymphocytes) in comparison with G1 stage (from 56 to 83) . High CV  value 24% was observed for G2   radiosensitivity parameters .

Application of chromosome microsurgery in producing FisH probes,P0336.,Mahjoubi,"National centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Islamic  Republic of Iran","One of the advanced technologies in molecular cytogenetics is chromosome microsurgery  . With the help of this technology,  molecular genetics and cytogenetics come together in order to get more information about chromosome or part of a chromosome . In  chromosome microsurgery the chromosome of interest or chromosomal  region of interest is dissected using a fine glass microneedle under an inverted microscope . The chromosomal DNA isolated by chromosome  microsurgery is then amplified employing one of the molecular methods  such as PCR. The PCR amplified chromosomal DNA can be used  in different applications for example fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) . In FISH, fluorescently labelled nucleic acid molecules are deposited  in chromatin at the site of specific DNA sequences. By this method  unique sequence, chromosomal subregions, or entire genomes can be  specifically highlighted in metaphase or interphase cells. The technique  is simple in principle. Specific DNA or RNA sequences are first labelled with nonradioactive molecules, for example biotin . The probe and the target chromosomes or nucleic acids are denatured . Complementary sequences in the probe and target are then allowed to anneal . After  washing and incubation in fluorescently labelled affinity reagents, a  discrete fluorescent signal is visible at the site of probe hybridisation FISH has several applications both in research and diagnosis areas . In this presentation, briefly, the way to make FISH probes by  employing chromosome microsurgery will be explained and some of the applications of FISH probes will be mentioned .",2006

The chromosome 1  breakpoint is located between BAC clones AL096841 and AP001098 (1p36 .22) whereas the chromosome 11 breakpoint is located at AP003721 (11q12 .2) . Any other rearrangements and changes of chromosome 1 were not found by CGH method . M FISH investigation  of family 2 confirmed the breakpoint position obtained by banding techniques .

Around 20  human Cx isoforms have been identified and Cx mutations in the 31  kDa isoform, Cx31, underlie a myriad of human diseases, including  dominant or recessive skin disease, dominant or recessive deafness or dominant neuropathy with deafness . We previously demonstrated that Cx31 was expressed in differentiating keratinocytes in skin . Here  we show that endogenous Cx31 is also expressed in human neuronal cell lines, particularly in differentiated neurones . Exogenous Cx31  expression induced neuronal differentiation in the human neuronal cell  line SH SY5Y, but not keratinocyte differentiation in primary human keratinocytes . Neither the autosomal dominant neuropathy with  hearing loss mutation (66delD)Cx31 nor the (R42P)Cx31 skin disease  associated mutation are able to traffic to the plasma membrane and form functional gap junction channels . Remarkably, the (R42P)Cx31  mutant can nevertheless induce neuronal differentiation to a level equal  to wild type Cx31, whereas differentiation is reduced after (66delD)Cx31 expression . As well as indicating a potential disease mechanism for the  neuropathy with hearing loss Cx31 mutation, this work demonstrates a  tissue specific function of Cx31 and provides, for the first time, evidence that Cx proteins are essential to non junctional aspects of cell biology  .Cytogenetics1",2006

Aim: To investigate 400 suspected Fanconiâ²s anemia patients referred  to the Iranian Blood Transfusion Organization (IBTO) to confirm diagnosis . Methods: MMC was used to study induced chromosomal breakage in all those 350 patients . Peripheral blood was  cultured in the presence of  phytohemagglutinin . For each patient two cultures were set up . Results: In total sixty  one were cytogenetically diagnosed as Fanconi anemia (~%19 .2) . Most patients had high, spontaneous and induced chromosomal breakages . No relationship was found between the clinical severity of the disease, age of the onset and the anemic state .  In our study the percentages of female affected was slightly higher than male (19 .7% verses %17 .7) which is different from what have been reported by other researchers . We found in 3% patients mosaic situations for FA . They had 2 populations of  peripheral T cells: one  with the increased chromosomal breakage typical of FA and one with  wild type cytogenetics . The wild type clone may result from somatic  reversion of a mutated FA allele .In summary, although the initial  diagnosis of FA is made by the characteristic clinical features but the  definitive diagnosis can be achieved by cytogenetic investigation.",2006

This makes the clinical significance of these  duplications unclear, and may lead to hazardous interpretations especially during prenatal diagnosis . Recently the underlying molecular  mechanism of these benign inherited forms of cytogenetically visible duplications have been elucidated . High copy number variants of  at least two defensin  antimicrobial gene clusters, embedded within  several low copy repeat (LCR) clusters, are responsible for this  euchromatic variant.

However, FISH is expensive,  labor intensive, and requires a high skill level and subjective signal interpretation . Ikonisys  fastFISH(TM) is a fully robotic fluorescence  microscopy platform requiring only that slide containing cassettes are loaded into the instrument . The system scans each slide and returns it to the cassette with no requirement for user input . Images of cells  are digitally captured and automatically analyzed for the presence of  specific FISH signals, that are enumerated and reported. Following  scanning, the workstation provides a gallery for each slide, displaying  the image of each cell and its FISH signals, so that the operator can  confirm the diagnostic relevance of the data reported. We blindly  compared Ikonisys fastFISH(TM) against manual FISH analysis for  62 amniocentesis samples probed for chromosomes 13, 18, 21, X, and Y  . Two pairs of slides were produced from each sample, one pair  evaluated using standard manual microscopy and the other using the  Ikoniscope(TM) fastFISH(TM) Imaging System . 100% concordance  was observed between the results obtained using manual microscopy and the automated system . 10 samples were then analysed using  fastFISH(TM) Auto, that produces a test outcome based on fully  automated FISH dot count analysis .

Rare FS  are observed in less than 5% of humans and most are induced by  folic acid deficiency, whereas common FS are found in all individuals  and the majority (76/88) is induced by aphidicolin, the remaining by bromodeoxyuridine or 5 azacytidine . Untill now 14 common FS, all belonging to the aphidicolin induced  group and expressed with the highest frequency, have been cloned and characterised at the molecular level .

However, the localisation of the bromodeoxyuridine or 5 azacytidin  induced common FS and the majority of aphidicolin induced common  FS which are expressed with lower frequency, is only roughly known through G banding . To shed light on those unknown common FS, six  colour fluorescence in situ  hybridisation (FISH) with BAC probes labeled  with fluorescence conjugated nucleotides is used to determine their precise localisation and their molecular characterisation .

Buys, B. Sikkema Raddatz","Department of Clinical Genetics, University Medical Center Groningen, Gronin   gen, The Netherlands","Rearrangements of the short arm of chromosome 8 manifest as  complex inverted duplications and deletions, or as simple duplications or simple deletions . In most instances band 8p23 .1 is involved, and the  breakpoints are thought to correspond with segmental duplication sites at the proximal and distal 8p23 .1 boundaries . Recent reports have  shown convincing evidence that there might be a causal relationship between maternally heterozygous inversions in band 8p23 .1 and  inversion duplication deletions of 8p in the offspring, due to loop formation and meiotic recombination in meisosis I . We present three male patients with different chromosome 8p aberrations: i .e . an inv dup del(8p), an inv dup(8p) and a dup(8p) .  The rearrangements were ascertained by chromosome and FISH analyses, and further characterized by micro array CGH analysis . Two copy number transitions (breakpoints at 8p23 .1 proximal and 8p23 .1  distal) are observed in all three patients, coinciding with the known segmental duplication sites . We performed FISH analysis on the parents of all patients to see  whether we could find a heterozygous maternal inversion in 8p23.1  to support a causal relationship with the observed aberrations in our patients . The mothers of the inv dup del(8p) and the inv dup(8p) patients indeed carried a heterozygous inversion in 8p23 .1, whereas the fathers appeared normal . Interestingly, the mother of the dup(8p) patient had a homozygous inversion 8p23 .1, whereas the father had a heterozygous one . It is tempting to speculate that in this case the  paternal heterozyous inversion mediated the formation of the abnormal chromosome 8 .",2006

Here we report on an inverted Xq28 tandem duplication associated with a terminal Xq28 deletion . The childâs clinical  features are suggestive of a chromosome Xq28 functional disomy i .e . growth retardation, developmental delay, microcephaly, failure to  thrive, pulmonary veins stenosis, recurrent pulmonary infections and micropenis . Standard cytogenetic and FISH analysis revealed a Xqter deletion associated with a Xq28 duplication . The abnormal X is inherited from the phenotypically normal mother  . Cytogenetic studies after BrdU  incorporation and measure of incorporation ratios at the androgen receptor locus show extreme skewing of inactivation i .e . the abnormal X is preferentially inactivated . The presence of inverted homologous low copy repeats on the  terminal long arm of chromosome X suggests that they did mediate the  rearrangement.

Recently few  studies have shown that KFcases have 46, XY cell line and in such cases there may be isolated foci of spermatogenesis . Such cases have better prognosis on assisted reproductive techniques (ART)  .So we  tried to look for low level mosaicism in ten infertile Klinefelter patients  who did not show features of hypogonadism to identify for presence  of normal cell line which could not be identifyied on analyzing twenty metaphases . In these cases we analyzed 150 well spread G banded  metaphases in each case and found that two cases showed 4 5% 46,  XY cell line.This had not been identified on analyzing 20 metaphase spreads . The main problem with conventional karyotyping is that routinely 20  metaphases are analyzed and counted, this may miss low grade mosaicism . Such KF cases(diagnosed as pure 47,XXY) may have foci of spermatogenesis, which could be used for TESA in ART  . Therefore  analyzing a large number of metaphases may detect low percentage of 46, XY cell line and such cases carry a good prognosis on ART  . Recent techniques like FISH (florescence in situ hybridization) are rapid  and sensitive and can help in analyzing a large number of metaphases  and interphases cells in short time and can detect cryptic and low level mosacism, which may have been missed cytogenetically  .",2006

Common cytogenetic examination  identified abnormal karyotype (47,XXY). Due to some mild phenotypic features that could result from possible mosaicism FISH examination was indicated . Molecular cytogenetic Cytogenetics11 analysis was carried out with centromeric and locus specific probes  (DXZ1, KAL) to chromosome X and a heterochromatine probe (DYZ1)  to chromosome Y  . The FISH analysis demonstrated presence of a  very small derivative X chromosome that consist of only centromeric segment . It was present in 55% of cells . This small centric fragment  was not identified by a common cytogenetic analysis. At the beginning of the FISH analysis of mitotic chromosomes (using the  X centromeric probe) the free X centromeric fragment was considered  to be only a fluorescent artefact. Besides this one X chromosome showed only weak hybridisation signal on the centromeric region .  The previous FISH result on mitotic chromosomes had therefore the similar appearance as this in mitosis of a normal male . The second X  chromosome with the weak signal on centromeric region was identified  by subsequent FISH analysis using the Kallman region specific probe combined with X centromeric one . It is not excluded that the presence  of the small derivative X chromosome could lead to possible X chromosome mosaic in other tissues of the patient .

The RB1locus is within the deletion interval of del (13)(q12q14) in  leukemic cells, it is a tumor suppressor gene, responsible for the development of solid tumors . Its role in hematological diseases is unclear  . AIM OF THE STUDY: We showed that RB1gene deletion . is not  restricted in pts with lymphoproliferative disorders but it is expanded in  1stdegree relatives . PATIENTS: FAMILY A:a 73y old man with HCL .and a son (49y) with B CLL .Two children (10,12y) are studied .FAMILY B:a 69y old man has B CLL .A brother and two sisters (71,63,65y) have an udefined lymphoproliferative disease with an IgAk paraproteinemia . Six children (28 35y) are studied .FAMILY C: two brothers(72,75y) with B NHLand .two sons (25,45y) are included . METHODS: Bone marrow specimens and PB lymphocytes were cultured using standard techniques . Thirty GTG banded metaphases were analyzed (ISCN1995) .FISH was performed using the LSI13 probe so(VYSIS) .RESULTS: The karyotypes looked normal . With FISH we isolated single signals of RB1gene in both groups . We evaluated as a deletion  the presence of a single signal in 10% of the interphase nuclei (200 analyzed) or in 2 metaphases (20 analyzed) . CONCLUSIONS 1) FISH technique is valuable for detection of RB1 gene deletion in pts  with lymphoproliferative disorders and in 1stdegree relatives . 2) The del13q14 is compatible with an inherited condition . 3) The1st degree relatives are in high risk of a forthcoming similar  disease . 4) Our results are compatible to that in the literature which are referred  as familialleukemia, lymphoma, multiple myeloma, hairy cell leukemia .",2006

Different hypotheses  have been made as to correlations between Y/A translocations and  spermatogenetic disturbances . In an early review by Smith et al,  1979 it was postulated that Y:acrocentric translocations are less often  associated with infertily & hypogonadism that are Y;non acrocentric translocations . We are reporting 2 cases of balanced translocation of chromosome  Y and an autosome in azoospermic males. The first case, a 31 year  old male patient with 4 years history of infertility due to azoospermia  has 46,X,(Y;5)(p11;q13) and the second case, a 34 year old male with  azoospermia has 46,X,(Y;2)(q11.2;q35).  In the Mendelian cytogenetic network database of the 8 cases with breakpoints of Yq11 .2, 6 have aoospermia/oligospermia, and the one case with breakpoint at Yp11 also has Azoospermia/Oligospermia .  This would suggest that the Y;autosome translocations involving these  breakpoints are associated with Azoospermia/Oligospermia or as more generally postulated will lead to meiotic disturbances .",2006

We prepared synaptonemal complex spreads from  spermatocytes of male shrews of various karyotypes, identified  each autosome by DAPI banding, validated this identification by  fluorescence in situ  hybridization of chromosome specific DNA libraries,  and mapped recombination along individual chromosome arms, using  immunolocalisation of MLH1, a mismatch repair protein that marks sites of crossingover  . Majority of bivalents and the autosomal arm Cytogenetics1 of sex trivalent demonstrated high recombination frequency near  telomeres and low frequency near the centromeres . However each bivalent had unique pattern of crossover distribution along its length .

For this  purpose, 182 miscarriage DNA samples were tested with the SALSA P070 and P036B MLPA probe mixes . Results obtained by MLPA  were validated by performing targeted DNA microsatellite analysis, karyotyping and/or conventional CGH . As no false negative results  were obtained, MLPA with subtelomeric probes could be employed as  a first approach to the screening of aneuploidy in SAs. Nevertheless,  the presence of false positive results suggests the need of revise probes design in order to improve the accuracy of the technique .",2006

Although it is not typically associated with a distinctive phenotype,  some common findings including microcephaly, IUGR have been reported previously in children with MVA . It has been suggested  that a non random gain of chromosomes specific to each somatic  tissue might result in higher frequency of certain trisomic cell lines in different tissues . MVA has been previously reported in patients with malignancies, recurrent miscarriages and multiple malformations . We report a 16  month old male child born to a non consanguineous  couple , with antenatally diagnosed polyhydramnios and failure to thrive and developmental delay postnatally  . In addition he had  microcephaly, scaly skin with easy bruising and palmo plantar atrophy,  patchy alopecia, central nuclear cataracts detected by 7 months of age  and dysmorphic facial features including flat nasal bridge and short  nose, small mouth with high arched palate, crowded teeth, bilateral single palmer crease . His relevant investigations including biochemical studies for peroxisomal dysfunction, skeletal survey etc were normal . However, His karyotype revealed MVA .

FISH studies with biotinylated PCR products of pol and  gag sequences were performed on chromosomes, interphase nuclei  and chromatin fibers of stimulated peripheral blood lymphocytes. Although MSRV pol was found in all examined persons, the copy  number of this sequence was significantly greater in MS patients  (6 24 copies on nuclei) than in myasthenia (4 5 copies) and normal individuals (3 6 copies) . In addition, the MSRV pol sequence exists  as tandem repeats on chromatin fibers. MSRV pol probe hybridized to chromosomes 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 7, 10, 14, 17 and X . In the contrary, MSRV  gag sequence was found in range 2 4 copies in both MS patients and controls .

This malignancy is characterized by a broad spectrum of clinical  behavior. Low , intermediate, and high risk groups have been defined  based upon expected outcome following conventional therapy using both clinical and biological criteria . The criteria currently used to assign  risk group are as follows: Clinical stage, MYCN status, Shimada histology and DNA ploidy  . Recently, other cytogenetic changes as  3p, 11q deletions and 17q rearrangements may also have prognostic value . A global view of genetic imbalances in NB patients can be detected by CGH . With recently developed high resolution (HR CGH) method, we  can find aberrations of < 10 Mb. In our work, CGH was applied to 46 NB specimens and the data were  reviewed and correlated with clinical characteristics, including survival  analysis. The results from our study confirmed different CGH profiles in the three major clinicogenetic subgroups . Using conventional  CGH the highest incidence of genetic imbalances was observed on chromosomes 1p, 2p, 3p, 11q and 17q . In addition, by means of HR  CGH we were able to detect clones with whole or partially chromosome losses or gains occurring with low frequency  .

The intensity of aneu clastogenesis in organism of the patients was  valued on the level of micronuclei in erythrocytes and the quantity of aberrations in lymphocytes of peripheral blood . It was stated, that the level of micronuclei and reconstructions of  chromosomes in blood cells of most of the patients significantly (p <  0,001) exceeds the same indexes of the healthy people, both in acute  period of disease and in the periods reconvalescence (8 10 and 30 32 days from the illnesses onset) . The level of genomes injury was  correlated with the intensity and frequency of the disease and did not depended on the age and gender of the patients . It is supposed that destabilization of genome is unspecified stage in pathogenesis of streptococcus tonsillitis . The revealed phenomenon from the one hand can reflect the high level  of generation of endomutagens in the patientâs organism and from  the other lead to the reduction of activity of the genome protection systems . To control this suggestion by the method of solution we valued  the mutagenic activity of the blood serum, and by the method of culonometric titration we valued the oxidant volume of blood . The significant decrease of antimutagenic activity and antioxidant  volume of blood serum is indicated with the streptococcus tonsillitis patients .",2006

Conventional cytogenetic analysis of abortions from Tomsk population has revealed a high frequency of tetraploidy (22%) . In dead embryos tetraploidy usually present in the mosaic state . This situation is  considered to be an artifact due to increasing ploidy level during cell  culturing, therefore a true impact of tetraploidy on prenatal selection remains unclear  . On the other hand, polyploid cells are an obligatory  element of human placenta . The aim of the present research was to  determine the level of tetraploid cells in native extraembryonic tissues  of first trimester spontaneous abortions with 4n or 2n/4n karyotype  by dual colour interphase FISH with centromere specific DNA probes for chromosomes 11 and 17 . The one sided upper reference limit for  tetraploidy detection in the extraembryonic mesoderm of the placenta (1 .0%) was determined in the control group of induced abortions . Thirty  spontaneous abortions with 4n or 2n/4n karyotype after conventional cytogenetic analysis were studied . The frequency of tetraploid cells  in long term cultures of mosaic embryos and in non cultured tissue has varied from 4 to 69% and from 0 .3% to 95 .2%, respectively  . But  statistically significance excess of control level was registered for 13  embryos only (43%). Thus the verified frequency of tetraploidy among spontaneous abortions with chromosomal abnormalities is 9 .6% in studied population .

Are parents of trisomic offspring at increased risk for  carrying a chromosomal anomaly?,P0411.,"Keymolen , C. Staessen, I. Liebaers","University hospital, Dutch Speaking Free University, Brussels, Belgium","Karyotypes are often performed for parents of trisomic offspring . This  is merely done in order to detect structural anomalies which could  increase the risk for aneuploid gametes through interchromosomal effect . In this retrospective study, we looked at the laboratory files of 316 post   and prenatal cytogenetic analyses with trisomy and registered the parental karyotypes . The aim of the study was to see whether these  parents are more likely to carry a chromosomal anomaly compared to the general population . For the 316 trisomic samples, 309 maternal and 275 paternal karyotypes with G staining were performed . Of these 584 karyotypes, 577 were normal (98 .8%), 1 was numerically abnormal (0 .17%) and 6 were structurally abnormal (1,02%) . Three structural anomalies were  Robertsonian translocations causing the trisomy in the offspring and  3 structural anomalies involved other chromosomes than the trisomic  chromosome of the offspring (2 reciprocal translocations and 1 pericentric inversion) . If we omit the Robertsonian translocations, this  means that a parent of a child with regular trisomy has a risk of 3/581 (0 .51%) of being carrier of a balanced structural chromosal anomaly and a risk of 1/581 (0 .17%) of having a numerical chromosomal  anomaly. When we compare this to figures for the general population  (0.15% reciprocal translocations and inversions; 0.15% for sex  chromosomal aneuploidy), there seems to be an increase in the risk  for structural anomalies, however this study only contains a small number of samples and larger studies should be set up .",2006

Non enzymatic labeling of DNA using the universal Linkage system (ULs  tm) in arraycGH applications,P0413.,"Pappaioannou , D. Postma, C. Henriet, S. Snoeijers","Kreatech Biotechnology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","The Universal Linkage System (ULSâ¢) is a (platinum based) labeling  technology that allows labeling of biomolecules like RNA, DNA and  proteins with a large variety of widely used haptens and fluorophores.  Because the ULSâ¢ labeling system is a chemical labeling technology, complete control over the labeling process is achieved . The âno  need for enzymesâ approach makes the labeling procedure very reproducible and robust . For arrayCGH applications the ULSâ¢ system  demonstrates one of its key advantages by the direct labeling of genomic DNA samples isolated from both fresh and archival samples .  For instance, ULSâ¢ technology makes it easier to obtain high quality  arrayCGH data from old formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)  material.Many arrayCGH applications will require significant amounts  of genomic DNA from each sample, the available amount of DNA can  be limiting and whole genome amplification (WGA) is a necessity prior to hybridization . ULS TM offers a flexible and reproducible way to label  this WGA amplified DNA. The WGA amplification technology uses  unmodified nucleotides which gives higher yields and better quality  amplified DNA than with the use of Random Prime methods using  modified nucleotides. ULS technology provides a flexible way to label  the amplified DNA without a second enzymatic step.This results in a  very short labeling procedure with less introduction of bias compared to enzymatic labeling technologies . Here we will report data on the  performance of the ULSâ¢ technology in arrayCGH experiments on  genomic DNA, FFPE DNA and WGA amplified DNA.",2006

We have studied the spreading of X inactivation in a case of unbalanced  X;3 translocation presenting very mild phenotypic alterations. The  proband was a girl with a partial trisomy of the q arm of chromosome  3, including the 3q25 qter region, translocated to the p arm of one chromosome X .

The girl presented  with mild abnormalities such as short stature, relative macrocrania,  limb shortening, pelvis malformation and cholestasis, but no mental retardation . Methylation analysis at the androgen receptor locus showed completely  skewed X inactivation in the proband lymphocytes. A fluorescent BrdU  assay combined with in situ hybridization using whole chromosome 3  painting demonstrated that the der(X) chromosome was late replicating  in 100% of the analyzed metaphases and the late replicating region  extended from the X chromatin across quite all the autosomal fragment excluding only the 3q29 band . The pattern of gene silencing on the translocated chromosome  correlates well with the attenuation of the clinical phenotype associated with 3q25 qter trisomy  .

With FISH, using a SRY  (Sex determining Region Y chromosome) gene containing clone,  we observed the presence of the SRY gene at the telomere of the long arm of chromosome 16 . Further investigation using FISH with  BAC and PAC clones revealed insertion of a fragment of 600 Kb of  the Y chromosome containing the SRY gene and part of the pseudo autosomal region, at 16qter  . The majority of classical XX males have  the SRY gene, despite the fact they lack the Y chromosome . In these XX  males the SRY gene, which is located close to the pseudo autosomal boundary on Yp11 .3, is transferred from Yp to Xp . This is the result of  an abnormal exchange during paternal meiosis I between the pseudo  autosomal region of the Y chromosome and the PAR1 region of the X chromosome . In our patient most probably an insertional translocation  between Yp and 16q during parental gametogenesis gave rise to the  aberrant chromosome 16.

Gender of fetuses was  confirmed by cytogenetic analysis. Amplification of paternal STR alleles  was expected to serve as a positive control for the presence of fetal  DNA in maternal plasma in case of female fetuses, but unfortunately  in vast majority of samples amelogenin was the only fetal locus that  was successfully amplified. Out of 26 male fetuses, the presence of Y  chromosome DNA in maternal plasma was successfully determined in 25 of them using both methods (96,2%) . There were no falsely positive  detected Y chromosomes in female fetuses, but the results were partly  inconclusive because we were not able to eliminate the possibility that  the lack of male amelogenin was simply due to inadequate amount of fetal DNA .

Therefore, prenatal diagnosis is of great importance . Mutational analysis is not a routine analysis  in prenatal diagnosis: because of the large size of the PKHD1 gene, linkage analysis is the preferred method . Two families were reported  with prenatal diagnosis of ARPKD based on PKHD1 mutation analysis without analysis of material of the affected child . Absence of material  from the index case or unclear diagnosis prompted mutation analysis of the parents . Detection of a mutation in both parents offered the possibility for prenatal diagnosis in subsequent pregnancies . We report on a consanguineous Iraqi couple (niece and uncle)  referred for genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis of ARPKD Prenatal diagnosis1 at the 12th week of gestation. The first child died 20 minutes after  spontaneous premature delivery at 36th week of gestation . Autopsy  showed characteristical signs of ARPKD . No biological material was  preserved . Molecular analysis by sequencing of the PKHD1 gene in both parents  was initiated with the purpose to perform prenatal diagnosis in  following pregnancies if the result indicated a heterozygous mutation in both parents . The couple was advised that, unless mutations would  be found in both parents, ultrasound may be the only diagnostic tool in the current pregnancy  . Following the detection of the same novel heterozygous nonsense mutation p .S976X (c .2927C>G) in exon 27 in PKHD1 gene in both  parents at the 16th week of gestation, prenatal diagnosis was performed  in the current pregnancy without index patient (with the result of heterozygosity) .",2006
Autosomal trisomies   a very important cause of early  spontaneous abortions,P0438.,"Tonkovic Djurisevic , K. Crkvenac Gornik, D. Muzinic, L. Letica, R. Lasan,  D. Begovic","Division of Genetics and Metabolism, Department of Pediatrics, University  Hospital Centre Zagreb, Zagreb, Croatia","Spontaneous abortion is defined as the termination of pregnancy  before 20th weeks of gestation or below a fetal weight of 500 grams . A  total of 321 cases of first trimester spontaneous abortions between 4  and 13 weeks of gestation were analyzed cytogenetically by the direct   preparation method using chorionic villi . A total of 172 (54%) of the  specimens were chromosomal abnormal, and 91% were numerical chromosomal abnormalities . The most common abnormalities are  trisomies, arising de novo as a result of meiotic non disjunction during gametogenesis in parents with a normal karyotype . Gonadal mosaicism for trisomies can contribute to recurrent trisomy  . Autosomal trisomies comprise 34% of karyotyped spontaneous abortions, and the vast majorities were single trisomies . Trisomies for  all chromosomes, with the exception of chromosomes 1, 5, 11, 17 and  19 were observed. Double trisomies [48,XX,+2,+16; 48,XX,+16,+18;  48,XX,+21,+22] and mosaic trisomy [46,XY/47,XY,+7; 46,XX/ 48,XX,+7,+16; 47,XX,+20/48,XX,+7,+20; 47,XY,+14/48,XXY,+14] were rare . The most frequent was trisomy 16 (34%), followed by trisomy  22 (11%) and 21 (9%). When abortions were stratified by maternal  age, 23% of cases were trisomic in women younger than 35 years of age, and 57% were trisomic in women 35 years or older  . This study  confirms that the incidence of trisomy increases with maternal age. The mean gestational age was 8 9 weeks . A trisomyc karyotype in chorionic villi from a spontaneous abortion  explains the reason for the loss and does not place the couple at higher risk for repeated chromosomal trisomy and pregnancy loss .",2006

Prenatal diagnostic (PD) of beta thalassemia is one of the most effective means for preventing the birth of affected children .  More than 1256 PNDs have been performed in this laboratory, since mid 2000 . The Beta globin gene analysis of dizygotic twines (fraternal  twines) is one of the complexes of PD since there is problem in CV sampling and PD should be performed for two fetuses . materials  and methods:  Prenatal diagnosis has been performed for 9 cases of  twins so far  . We used combined ARMS and RFLP methods to detect  mutations .  Results:  Of these, in 8 (8/9 or 89%) cases both ARMS  and RFLP methods could help us to detect the pattern of mutation inheritance . In the remaining case the mutation was detected by  ARMS method, but RFLP analysis was semi informative (only one of the parental mutant alleles could be traced by PFLP analysis) . Discussion: Three out of 10 cases were most probably identical twin  since they had similar mutation and RFLP pattern . In the rest the twins  were not identical since they had either different PD result (5cases) or had different RFLP pattern (2cases) or they had different RFLP pattern (2 cases) or they had different sexes or VNTR result (1 case each) .",2006
cell surface bound fraction of cell free fetal DNA in  maternal blood as a new marker for non invasive prenatal  gender detection,P0440.,"Tokareva , I. Lebedev, S. Nazarenko","Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk Scientific Center, Siberian Divi   sion of Russian Academy of Medical Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation",It was detected that cell free fetal DNA circulates in the plasma and serum of pregnant women . This discovery served as incentive to development of new approaches for noninvasive prenatal diagnosis .  One of the first such studies was directed to Y chromosome sequences revealing in maternal blood to diagnose X linked disorders . It has been  shown that sensitivity of Y chromosome loci detection in maternal  plasma by conventional PCR varies from 50 to 95% in different studies  in the first trimester of pregnancy. It was recovered recently that there  are cell surface bound nucleic acids that form the main part of cell free DNA and RNA besides free circulating fraction in blood . In the present  study we realized the PCR analysis of fetal SRY gene in maternal  plasma and in cell surface bound fraction of cell free DNA as well as  estimated possibilities of using this new marker as additional source of fetal DNA for early noninvasive diagnosis of fetal gender  . In our study  the sensitivity of fetal SRY locus detection in maternal blood amounted  100% in 10 cases of male fetus carrying and 2 false positive signals  have been registered in the blood of 5 pregnant women who carried  female fetuses. It is significant to note that in 2 women carried male  fetuses SRY locus was revealed only in the cell surface bound fraction  of cell free DNA while no signal was found in maternal plasma . Thus the  use of cell surface bound fetal DNA allowed raising the informativeness of fetal gender prenatal detection approach up to 20% .,2006

The diagnosis was confirmed by karyotype analysis of fetal lymphocytes . Ultrasound examination revealed normal female genitalia . At term, a healthy baby girl was delivered, without any abnormality of the external genital organs . By definition, chimerism is produced by fusion of two different zygotes  in a single embryo, while mosaicism results from mitotic errors in a single zygote . Several mechanisms of production of chimera have been proposed in literature . Stricto sensu, chimerism occurs from the  postzygotic fusion of two distinct embryos leading to a tetragametic chimera . In addition, there are two other entities which are by extension,  also referred as chimera: parthogenetic chimera and chimera by fertilization of the second polar body  . We used polymorphic markers spanning chromosome X and several  autosomes in order to identify the genetic mechanism involved in our case . Mosaicism was excluded because of the presence of three alleles at 12 loci . The origin of this third allele was maternal for one marker (located on band 8p11 .2) and paternal for the other markers . Thus, two different paternal haploid sets were observed . These results  are compatible either to a tetragametic chimera or to the fertilization of the second polar body after 8p crossing over  . The strategies and  difficulties to study mechanisms leading to the production of chimeras will be discussed .",2006

Genetic screening of embryos and foetuses. should we  restrict the tests available and how could that be achieved by  law?,P0443.,Skene,"University of Melbourne, Melbourne, Australia","The community might decide that it is socially or morally desirable to  prevent women trying to âchooseâ the child they want, either by pre  implantation genetic tests; or by a prenatal test followed by termination of pregnancy (TOP) if the foetus has a genetic abnormality  . But would  the law be effective in implementing such a policy? A law that prevented TOP for relatively minor foetal abnormalities  would seem inconsistent with other grounds on which pregnancy may  currently be lawfully terminated, in practice if not according to the strict letter of the law  . Alternatively, a new law that penalised the conduct of genetic tests  except for certain âseriousâ conditions would be difficult to draft. What  conditions would be included? One might state the prohibited conditions  in broad terms, such as those that involve an essentially âcosmeticâ condition like cleft lip, rather than a medical one . Or, having agreed  on broad principles to be included in legislation, a committee could be established to determine periodically the conditions to be included .  That approach would have the benefit of flexibility   the conditions for  which testing is prohibited could be changed fairly simply as new tests become available . However, the decisions would be made without  public knowledge and without having to seek legislative amendments, which seems undesirable, especially in such a contentious area .This paper discusses and assesses these legal options for regulation .",2006

Vrbicka","Palacky universtiy, Olomouc, Czech Republic","Several studies have demonstrated a high association between absent nasal bone (NB) at the 11 14 wk scan and trisomy 21 . Evaluation  of the presence or absence of the NB for screening for trisomy 21  was retrospectively assessed in 181 pregnant women at 11 14 wk gestation . Of the 181 pregnant women that underwent invasive test, 161 had normal karyotype . Of the 20 chromosomal abnormalities, trisomy 21  was in 11 cases, trisomy 18 was in 6 cases, and in 3 cases other abnormalities were found . In the whole study group (n=181) the NB was present in 123 (68%), absent in 12 (7%) and was uncertain in 46 (25%) cases, while in the  161 cases with normal karyotype the NB was present in 119 (74%) absent in 4 (2%) and uncertain in 38 (24%) cases . In trisomy 21 (n=11) the NB was absent in 5 cases (46%), present in 3 (27%) and was uncertain in 3 (27%) . This gives a sensitivity of 63%  and a specificity of 95% and false positive rate of 5.6 for the absence of NB in trisomy 21 . In remaining 9 chromosomal abnormalities the NB was present in 1 case absent in 3 and uncertain in 5 cases . This gives a sensitivity  of 67% and a specificity of 98% and false positive rate of 3% for the absence of NB in other chromosomal abnormalities . Absence of the NB is an important marker of trisomy 21 . However, an appropriate training of operators is mandatory  .",2006

In this case  the Y  chromosome specific probes from male specific region (MSY) are used to distinguish male fetus . This work supported by IGA MZCR  NR 7817 3 describes possibilities in free foetal DNA detection and  quantification by STR. Methods and Results: Artificial genotype mixtures ranging from 0,2  % to 100 % to simulate maternal and paternal genotypes and 27  DNA samples from pregnant women in different stage of pregnancy  were used for DNA quantification and detection. Foetal genotype  was confirmed by biological father genotyping. The detection was  performed in STR from 21st chromosome Down syndrome (DS)  responsible region by innovated refined (R) QF PCR which allows to reveal and quantify even very rare DNA mosaics . The STR quantification was assessed in artificial mixtures of genotypes  and discriminability of particular genotypes was on the few percent level . Foetal DNA was detected in 74 % of tested samples . Conclusions: The RQF PCR application in quantification and  differentiation between maternal and foetal genotypes by STR loci  could have importance in noninvasive prenatal diagnostics as another possible marker for DS risk assessment .",2006

","PND in adulthood onset disorders presents several specific issues,  namely the possibility of several decades of a (physically) healthy life  and the need for the decision making process regarding termination  of pregnancy (TOP) to be completed before disclosure of the results,  to avoid performing a presymptomatic test (PST) in an unborn child  for an incurable disease (precluded by ethical and, sometimes, legal reasons) . Since 1996, we received 83 requests for PND, in familial amyloid  polyneuropathy (FAP I) ATTRV30M (53), Huntington disease (11),  Machado Joseph disease (4), SCA2 (2), Friedreich ataxia (11), and others (2) . PND was requested for the first pregnancy of 32 couples, while  20 already had one or more children; 5 couples had 2 requests, and one had 3 . The affected/carrier/at risk parent gender ratio was  1,2F/1M. Only 5 inquired about PND before actual pregnancy; about 2/3 requested PND before 12W gestation (mean=10 .2W) . Only 34  invasive procedures (15 amniocenteses and 19 chorionic villous  samplings) were actually performed (often, parents at risk, tested during pregnancy, were ânon carriersâ) . About 1/3 of cases were simultaneous requests for PST, a rather  stressful situation, given time constraints, and the potential for three distressful events in a short period (PST, PND, TOP) . Of the 20 âcarrierâ foetuses, only 19 underwent TOP  . One pregnancy was not terminated  despite a âcarrierâ result, due to a late reversal of the coupleâs decision;  non termination of this foetus implied the birth of a child whose parents know will become affected .

Fetal chromosomes were normal, maternal  infection was ruled out, and fetal intrauterine x rays confirmed femoral incurvation and osteoporosis . At birth, at 37 WG, intra uterine growth retardation and rhizomelic shortening of the limbs were present .  Skeletal x rays, performed at 3 days of life, revealed osteoporosis,  enlarged irregular metaphyses of the long bones, and bilateral femoral incurvation . Assessment of phosphorus and calcium metabolism showed severe hypercalcemia and increased alkaline phosphates . Parathyroid hormone was at the upper limit of normal . There were no  clinical sign of hypercalcemia and no lithiasis was identified. Treatment  by bisphosphonate was started, allowing a rapid decrease of the calcemia . Since hyperparathyroidism was suggested, a molecular  analysis of the Calcium Sensor Receptor gene was performed, which  revealed a heterozygote mutation responsible for the synthesis of a truncated protein . This mutation had been previously reported in cases  of familial hypocalciuric hypercalcemia, and, when associated with another mutation, in one case of severe neonatal hyperparathyroidism .

In the second trimester, a second blood sample was drawn at  15+3 weeks until 18+6 weeks of pregnancy to measure biochemical markers AFP, estriol and hCG . The results of the nuchal translucency  and the four biochemical markers were combined to calculate a risk  for Down syndrome for the second trimester. Women identified to  be screen positive (â¥1/200 term risk) were managed according to standard practice . Results: Between July 2002 and December 2005, 19 175 women  provided a first and second trimester sample. The total number of IPS screen positive cases for Down syndrome was 645 (3 .36%) and for trisomy 18 was 55 (0 .3%) . Amniocentesis was performed in 488 (73 .6%) cases . The abnormalities detected include the following: Down syndrome (6 .6%), trisomy 18 (1 .0%), trisomy 13 (0 .6%), other autosomal trisomies (0 .2%), triploidy (0 .4%) and sex chromosome aneuploidy (0 .6%) . Other abnormalities included inherited balanced rearrangements (0 .8%), de novo unbalanced rearrangements (0 .4%) and sex chromosome mosaicism (0 .2%) .conclusions:  IPS has been successfully implemented in the  Eastern Ontario region .

Such a broad definition obviously  includes normal individuals . The smaller the head circumference, the  higher the chances of associated mental retardation . The prenatal  diagnosis of microcephaly, particularly in cases of primary microcephaly,  is usually difficult before the 3rd trimester .  The etiologic heterogeneity and variability of microcephaly in genetic  syndromes are among the more difficult issues in prenatal ultrasound  in pregnancies either with an incidental finding of this anomaly, or in  cases with a recurrence risk,  thus the counseling for fetuses with a  small HC is difficult. Mental retardation can safely be predicted in cases with associated US  findings, abnormal karyotype or positive test for intrauterine infection.  In fetuses with isolated small HC an effort should be made to determine gyral normality in utero by US or MRI . The main tasks of the multidisciplinary clinic are to try to give the  most accurate diagnosis and prognosis and to counsel and escort the parents through this time of crisis and crucial decisions . To illustrate  these difficulties we will present our experience with 38 fetuses that  were referred to our clinic with suspected microcephaly (2001 2004), including neuro developmental follow up of these babies .

The karyotype resulted to be 46,XX  (35%)/46,XXr(22)(p11;q13.1)(65%). Once the presence of the mosaicism was diagnosed, and confirmed  by FISH with the use of the Di George probe (QBIO gene), the couple  was suggested a cordocentesis in order to confirm the results. The cytogenetic analysis of the fetal cord blood confirmed the presence of the mosaicism . The percentage of both cell lines in this tissue was 50% . In parallel to cord blood culture, MLPA technique with subtelomeric  probes was performed in order to test its accuracy in the assesment of terminal deletions/duplications for this kind of diagnosis . To discard  the occurrence of the event during cell culture, DNA samples from both the original sample and culture were analysed . The structural chromosomal mosaicism was detected in both samples using MLPA . The MLPA technique was not able to detect the mosaicism in a DNA  sample obtained from the cord blood due to the presence of maternal cell contamination .

The vast  majority of chromosomal abnormalities detected in prenatal samples are trisomy 13,18, 21 and sex chromosome aneuploidies . Since advanced  technologies in rapid diagnostic tests have been developed to detect  common trisomies prenatally it is essential that each laboratory should  evaluate their own prenatal diagnosis profile.

The Influence of Bioethics and Religious Ruling in  Prenatal Diagnosis and Abortion,P0469.,Mahjoubi,"National centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology, Tehran, Islamic  Republic of Iran","âBioethicsâ means the study of ethical issues arising from human involvement with life . Many concepts of bioethics can be traced  in religions and cultural patterns that may or may not share some universal ideals . This is especially true when we talk of reproduction and genetics, prenatal diagnosis, abortion etc . Decisions to undertake prenatal diagnosis, with more emphasizes  on Iran, involve a complex assessment of the best interests of the fetus and parentâs interest . Parents often accept a recommendation  for  prenatal diagnosis that is approached collaboratively, especially if the  test is of proven efficiency and have a low maternal/fetus risk and also low cost . The prenatal diagnosis poses a  potential conflict between  the parentâs own best interests, ideology, and very importantly faith on  one side and perception of the best interests of the fetus . In addition, if  prenatal diagnosis is linked to selective abortion then the autonomy of  the fetus plus religious faith of the parents could lead to a conflict. From the prenatal diagnosis experiences in Iran several other concerns have also been noticed by geneticists . These concerns  were as follows: fairness of access to genetic services, indications for  prenatal diagnosis, confidentiality problems, counseling incapacitated persons etc .

This increases the risk of involuntary infertility in this group and  reproductive problems connected with age . In November 2005  European Commission publicized results of two surveys on science  and technology and their related values . One of the issues examined was prenatal life . 53% of Europeans think it is âvery importantâ to protect the dignity of the foetus . The countries most concentrated on this issue (73%) are Malta, Greece and Ireland . Hungary, Denmark and Lithuania are at the bottom of the list (only 37%) . These attitudes  are important from the medical point of view, because every elective abortion has aggravating effect for future pregnancies . After abortion  future pregnancies appears to be in elderly age, when there is elevated possibility to chromosomal defects . Also there are risks for preterm birth and delivery complications . An important aspect of prenatal diagnostics (PD) is to discuss with a couple about advantages and disadvantages of PD . We report some cases:case1  .36 aged woman came to genetic counseling clinic with fertility  problems: in anamnesis second and third pregnancies ended in  miscarriages at 6 7 weeks, after first pregnancy ended in miscarriage  at 17 weeks, after amniocentesis ( answer of karyotype was normal 46XY) .case2.  42 aged woman, who previouslly had 6 abortions, delivered  child with Patau syndrome .case3.  37 aged woman, who conceived and used oral contraceptives,  not realising about pregnancy, till third month of pregnancy, came for PD .",2006

The major differences were found in Afro Caribbean and South Asian women . We conducted a  study to investigate the levels of serum markers and to estimate ethnic and weight correction factors in Chinese women . Our study population  consisted of 400,650 Caucasian and 30,960 Chinese women who were  non diabetic, had an unaffected singleton pregnancy and who were  screened in the Ontario Multiple Marker Screening Program between  10/1993 and 8/2004. Chinese women were identified from the ethnicity category of Asian using a published Chinese surname list . The median maternal weight was 66 .3 kg for Caucasian and 54 .5 kg for Chinese .  Using the current weight correction factors derived from Caucasian  women, the median MoMs of AFP, uE3, total hCG and PAPP A were 3%, 14%, 19% and 16% higher in Chinese women . The increase in uE3  and total hCG in Chinese women were consistent across most of the weight groups . The increase in PAPP A was largely due to inadequate weight correction for Chinese women . Quadratic weight correction  formulas based on analyte levels in Chinese women were derived, allowing correction for ethnicity and weight . Ethnic correction will have  variable effect on the false positive rate (FPR) for Down syndrome  for Chinese women depending upon marker combinations as the  influence of hCG is offset by the influence of uE3, AFP and PAPP A.  As nuchal translucency is probably increased in Chinese women, this marker correction is expected to reduce the FPR when included .",2006

Our data suggest the feasibility of proteomic approaches in identifying  proteins differentially expressed in AFS obtained from cases where the  fetus has trisomy 21 and allow further research to be conducted in the area . Since differentially expressed proteins and small peptides are  likely to cross the placenta barrier and be detected in maternal serum,  proteomic analysis carries the potential to enhance research in the study of noninvasive techniques for prenatal diagnosis of aneuploidies .

The oocytes were fertilized by means of intra cytoplasmic sperm injection . The resulting embryos  were biopsied 3 days after fertilization and the blastomeres were  analyzed with fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) where telomeric and centromeric probes were utilized . Balanced and unbalanced  embryos were evaluated in two cases. In the first case, 6 out of the 9 embryos (15 blastomeres) analyzed, revealed unbalanced constitution .  Only one of the remaining three that revealed balanced constitution was transferred . In second case, some 3 out of the 5 embryos (7  blastomeres) analyzed, revealed unbalanced constitution and one was not conclusive . Another embryo with balanced constitution was  transferred. The PGD results were confirmed by amniocentesis in  both cases, which resulted in uncomplicated birth of healthy babies,  one being a baby boy, the other girl, both with balanced (normal)  karyotypes. As a result, we conclude that, in cases identified as  translocation carrier, resorting to PGD supported IVF cycle will reduce  down the abortion risk and has a key role in enabling the delivery for healthy babies .",2006

We present a case of a fetus with mos 47,XY,+22[3]/  46,XY[30] detected during the 1st trimester  . Case Report: A CVS was performed at 13th week to a 30 years old  healthy primigravida woman after the detection of increased levels of  Î² hCG (6.5 MoM) in the combined screening test. Nuchal translucency was normal (1 .0 mm) . The results from QF PCR were normal for 13, 18 and 21 trisomies . Trisomy 22 was detected in 50 cells using conventional GTG banding (47,XY,+22) . At 16 weeksâ gestation the  sonogram revealed intrauterine growth restriction and echogenous bowel, and an amniocentesis was performed . In two different cultures  3/30 colonies with trisomy 22 were detected using the in situ culture method . The pregnancy was terminated after genetic counseling .  Post mortem examination showed dysmature and small placenta,  histologic signs of hypoperfusion, fetal hypoxia, asymmetrical growth restriction, and increased head circumference . Micropenis and simple (nonscrotal) hypospadias were the only malformations seen . Typical  abnormalities of trisomy 22, such as optic coloboma and preauricular pits were absent . Discussion: Autopsy findings were consistent with the low percentage  (5%) of trisomic cells in the fetus, taking into consideration the known phenotypic variability of trisomy 22 . It is remarkable that the invasive  prenatal diagnosis was undertaken after the detection of extremely  high levels of Î² hCG at 12 weeksâ gestation, before the presence of  any sonographic findings.",2006

Chromosomal aberrations are considered causal events in the process of leukemic transformation . They are frequently associated with  therapy related myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myelogenous leukemia and are thought to result from exposure to cytotoxic drugs .

The precise mechanism by which alkylating agents induce leukemias  is unclear, but it is possibly related to chromosomal damage causing  mutations or translocations of genes implicated in cellular growth  and differentiation. Specific DNA alterations may lead to a survival  advantage of a pluripotent cell that eventually encourages expansion  of the malignant clone.

The gene for reversion induced LIM domain adapter protein RIL expresses several alternative transcripts . The major  transcript encodes a PDZ LIM protein implicated in actin stress fiber dynamics . Minor transcripts lack certain exons resulting in either LIM domain substitution by a 23aa peptide due to a frame shift or loss of PDZ domain .  We overexpressed Flag tagged alternative proteins and a truncation mutant lacking LIM domain . RIL variants with alternative C terminus could  not be detected by immunoblotting due to rapid turnover while there was no difference in mRNA and translation levels . Fusion of the C terminal 33aa  alternative peptide to EGFP reduced fluorescence intensity and protein half life some 10 fold . Thus, the alternative C terminus confers instability to the whole RIL protein . It was previously shown that RIL interacts with  Î± actinin via its PDZ domain. We performed co immunoprecipitation assays with Flag tagged RIL variants . As expected, RILdeltaPDZ did not  bind to, while full length RIL only weakly coimmunoprecipitated with Î± actinin . Nevertheless, RIL variant with the alternative C terminus and RIL  truncation mutant exhibited dramatic increase in interaction with Î± actinin.  We speculate that loss or modification of LIM leads to greater affinity of  PDZ domain to Î± actinin. Moreover, in case of RIL with alternative C  terminus two additional bands of 27 and 55kD recognized by anti Î± actinin antibody were detected . These data suggest a role for RIL alternative  splice variant in regulation of Î± actinin degradation.

The proportion of  BRCA1  mutations due to genomic  rearrangements in different populations vary from 8 to ~30%, probably due to both ethnic diversity and the technical approach employed . In  order to estimate the contribution of BRCA1  genomic rearrangements  to hereditary breast/ovarian cancer (HBOC) predisposition in Greek  families we screened 95 families negative for point mutations or small  insertions/deletions in BRCA1  and BRCA2  genes using Quantitative  Multiplex PCR of Short Fluorescent Fragments.

A novel pathogenic mutation c .784C>T (p .Gln262X) in exon 11 of BRCA1 was detected . The carrier status of the parents was  assessed and revealed that the mutation was of maternal origin . The mother, aged 67, had never suffered from breast  or ovarian cancer  .  Strikingly, DGGE analysis of motherâs DNA from peripheral blood  leukocytes showed an imbalance between normal and mutant alleles, with a minority of mutant alleles . A similar ratio of normal and mutant alleles was found by direct sequencing . Subsequently we investigated  DNA isolated from a mouthwash and from cultured skin fibroblasts.  The ratio between normal and mutant alleles from the mouthwash was comparable to the ratio observed in peripheral blood leukocytes .  However, in the skin fibroblasts hardly any mutant alleles were detected . In conclusion, the mother of our index patient is mosaic for the c .784C>T mutation, and hence this mutation must have originated  de novo in the mother. To our knowledge this is the first report of a  mosaicism for a BRCA1  mutation . We will look for further proof for  the mutation being de novo  and a possible germcell mosaicism by  assessing the inheritance of BRCA1  alleles in siblings and children of  the mosaic woman respectively  .",2006

We therefore performed a haplotype based study of  BRCA1 and BRCA2 based on 22 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) spanning 80 .78 kb of the BRCA1 gene and 25 SNPs spanning  83.01kb of the BRCA2 gene. Out of five different BRCA1 haplotypes  with a frequency of > 5%, two common BRCA1 haplotypes accounted for two thirds of all chromosomes in our collective .

More than  80 % of newly diagnosed patients with chronic myeloid leukemia in  chronic phase will achieve a complete cytogenetic response (CCR) with the standard dose of 400 mg imatinib daily  . Minimal residual disease monitoring is important for assessment of  disease status in patients who obtain a complete cytogenetic remission to detect early signs of relapse . Quantitative RT PCR assays enable to monitor the kinetics of residual bcr abl transcripts over time . Serial peripheral bcr abl m RNA levels were monitored by quantitative  real time PCR using the Taq man probe system for 32 CML patients in  chronic phase for a median of 14 months after they achieved complete cytogenetic remission . The patients could be divided into three groups : in 16 Patients  transcript levels continued to decline during the period of observation ,  in 11 patients the transcript levels reached a plateau and in 5 patients transcript numbers rises  . rising levels of bcr abl are strongly predictive  of cytogenetic and hematologic relapse  . We conclude that the pattern of residual disease after achieving  complete cytogenetic remission on imatinib is variable The goal of early  detection of residual disease is to allow timely therapeutic intervention before overt relapse of therapy resistant disease occurs .",2006

The whole missing  chromosome 15 is translocated on the distal region of 3q and generates an extra long derivative chromosome 3 . In our case, no t(15;17) was observed, instead chromosome 15 is involved in another rearrangement . FISH will be used in order to  elucidate the events that generated the complex genomic abnormalities involving chromosomes 3 and 15, in promyelocytic transformation .

The human circadian rhythm is controlled by at least nine circadian genes . The aims of this study are to understand the aberrant  expression of the circadian genes between hepatocellular carcinoma  (HCC) tissues and non tumor tissues, and to explore the possible mechanism(s) contributing to the difference . We analyzed differential  expression of the 9 circadian genes in 46 HCC and paired non cancerous  tissues by real time quantitative RT PCR and immunohistochemical detection . We also tested the possible regulatory mechanism(s) by direct sequencing and methylation PCR analysis .  Our results showed  that decreased expression levels of PER1, PER2, PER3, CRY2  and  TIM in HCCs were observed . Down expression of these genes was  not caused by genetic mutations, and 34 .8% of the down regulated cases were caused by promoter methylation .  The down expression  of circadian genes may result in disturbance of cell cycle, but there is  no relationship between the level of down expression and the clinical status of patients . In conclusion, down regulation of circadian genes results in disturbance of circadian rhythm in HCC which may disrupt  the control of the central pacemaker and benefit selective survival of cancerous cells and promote carcinogenesis . It is possible that  the disturbance of circadian rhythm influence the cell cycle as well  as provide survival benefit for HCC. The differential expression of  circadian genes between non cancerous and cancerous cells may provide a molecular basis for chronotherapy of HCC .",2006

In the development of the disease, genetic and environmental factors are involved . Hereditary  Nonpolyposis Colorectal Cancer (HNPCC) accounts for 5 8% of all  colorectal cancers and has been linked to mutations in DNA mismatch  repair (MMR) genes, resulting in genetic alterations as microsatellite instability (MSI) . Approximately 12 17% of the sporadic cases also show MSI but MMR mutations are unfrequently found . BRAF gene  encodes a serine/threonine kinase and plays an important role in the mitogen activated protein kinase signaling pathway  . Recently, an  oncogenic V600E hotspot mutation within BRAF, has been found to  be associated with sporadic colorectal cancer with MSI, but not with HNPCC . The aim of this study was to analyze the frequency of this hotspot  mutation in our group of patients and the applicability of this analysis in the HNPCC diagnostics . A total of 140 patients with CRC (39 sporadic and 101 familial cases) with known MSI status have been studied .  The V600E mutation has been detected by SSCP analysis and direct sequencing . The BRAF V600E hotspot mutation has been found in 6 of the MSI and in 2 of the stable tumors . A strong correlation has been found between  the mutation and the sporadic origin of the tumors (p<0,002), supposing  that screening for MMR mutations in cases positive for BRAF mutation can be avoided .

Consistent with the role of MMR proteins in the  maintenance of genomic stability, loss of MMR function predisposes to cancer  . MMR process is proposed to consist of three steps, mismatch  recognition and assembly of the repairosome, degradation of the error containing strand, and repair synthesis . In man, one key factor in the  assembly of the repairosome is suggested to be MutLÎ±, a heterodimer of MLH1 and PMS2 . Another heterodimer of MutL homologues MLH1  and MLH3, MutLÎ³, was recently suggested to assist in the repair of base base mismatches and single extrahelical nucleotides . Consistent with the functions, MMR proteins are mainly localized in the nucleus .  Two different proteins, MLH1 and a transcription factor p73, have been  shown to influence the subcellular distribution of PMS2 and dimerization  of MLH1 and PMS2 has been shown to limit nuclear localization of  MutLa. Whether nuclear localization of MLH1 is limited or influenced  by its dimerization with PMS2 or MLH3 as well as nuclear localization  of MLH3/ MutLÎ³ has remained questionable. Here, by using normal  human MLH1, PMS2, and MLH3 proteins and mutated MLH1 proteins,  which were unable to interact or lacked nuclear localization signal  (NLS), we demonstrate that protein interaction is essential to nuclear import of PMS2 but not of MLH1 .

In fact, inhibition of activated protein kinases has emerged as an effective approach to cancer therapy  . Recent studies showed that the mutations in the kinase domain of  EGFR  gene in non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) tissues could predict  significant clinical responses to tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs). The different involvement of EGFR mutations in several types of cancer  and the correlation between mutations and clinical benefits prompted  us to examine the presence of mutations in exons 18, 19, 20 and 21 in  EGFR for HNC Spanish patients .

Most of the mutations in the APC gene were frameshift mutations  (n=108, 49%) and nonsense mutations (n=73, 33%), furthermore  we found splice mutations (n=20, 9%) and complete or partial gene deletions (n=20, 9%) . Also, the Ile1307Lys variant, which is found in  6% of the Ashkenazi Jewish population and confers a relative risk of 1 .5 2 .0 for colorectal cancer was found in 4 patiÃ«nts . One of these  appeared to be a carrier of two MUTYH mutations, and one was also carrier of a nonsense APC mutation . Most of the 20 deletions identified by MLPA were found only once.  The recurrent deletions were the whole gene deletions (n=7), exon 9 15 (n=3), and exon 7 13 (n=2) . The majority of the APC deletion  patients displayed the classical FAP phenotype (100 1000 colorectal  adenomas), however, the two families carrying the deletion from exon  7 13 seem to show a more atypical FAP phenotype (less polyps and late onset) .

Molecular  and cytogenetic studies have delineated that  different grades of gliomas correlate with specific genetic alterations.  Glioblastomas, the most malignant form of gliomas, may develop de  novo (primary glioblastomas) or through progression from low grade or anaplastic astrocytomas (secondary glioblastomas) .Cell culture analysis may be biased by clonal selection artifacts .  Homogenized tissue lacks control over the tissue composition and  permits contamination of the tumor specimen with preexisting and reactive nonneoplastic tissue . Moreover, gliomas exhibit a diffuse  infiltrating growth pattern into normal brain so that no tumor area contains a uniform cellular composition . Genetic heterogeneity can hardly be detected by conventional methods . In order to evaluate an  intratumoral genetic heterogeneity we performed FISH investigations  and microdissection analysis in paraffin embedded glioma tissue Using this method we examined 124 tumor areas from 41 gliomas .  Furthermore we correlate the cytogenetic data with the histomorphology of the given tumor areas . Low grade astrocytomas most often showed normal karyotypes, by conventional cytogenetic methods . However, we were able to identify  numerous alterations in low grade astrocytomas, especially in areas with a gemistocytic appearance . Primary glioblastomas and secondary  glioblastomas showed consistant as well as different genetic findings,  which correlate partial with the histomorphological features of the investigated areas .

The  glutathione S transferase (GST) is one of the metabolising enzymes,  which plays an important role in the detoxification of mutagens and  carcinogens . Different studies have shown an increased frequency  of GST null genotypes in several malignancies . Objective: To  investigate the rate of GSTT1 and GSTM1 null genotypes and to  determine its importance in prognosis of the disease in AML patients . methods:  DNA was extracted from peripheral blood or bone marrow  of 180 patients who were in presentation status of AML . A multiplex  PCR method was used simultaneously to amplify regions of GSTM1 ,  GSTT1 , and Î²ÎµÏÎ± globin genes in genomic DNA . The survival curves  were analyzed by the Kaplan Meier method and compared by the log rank test (Mantel Cox) using the SPSS software program .  Results: Of  the total of 180 patients, 23 cases (12 .8%) showed null genotypes in both genes, while in 52 patients (28 .9%) both genes were wild types .  GSTM1 null GSTT1 wild type was detected in 91 patients (50 .6%) and  GSTM1 wild type  GSTT1 null genotype was detected in 14 patients  (7 .8%) . These rates are within the upper limit of the rates detected in  the normal European population. There was no significant difference  in the overall survival and in disease free survival between different groups . conclusion:  These observations suggest that the inherited  absence of the GSTT1 and GSTM1 carcinogen detoxification pathway  may be related to carcinogenesis but it is not an important determinant of prognosis in AML .",2006
Nonsense associated exon skipping is not sufficient to  suppress cancerogenesis in Gorlin syndrome,P0541.,W. Bauer,"Dept Dermatology, Salzburg, Austria. ","Mutations of the transmembrane transporter protein Patched (Ptc),  a member of the Hedgehog pathway regulating homeostasis of cell  proliferation and differentiation in a variety of tissues, are implicated  in the development of autosomal dominant Gorlin syndrome (NBCCS,  nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome) characterized by multiple skin and endodermally derived cancers as well as congenital abnormalities .  Tumor promotion is thought to be associated with reduced functionality  of ptc leading to deregulation of downstream targets like sonic hedgehog and Gli pathways . However, transcriptional events leading  to the reduced suppression effects of patched have not been studied in detail . We describe a heterozygous germline polymorphism P1315L  in a patient suffering from Gorlin syndrome, which contrasts to the bi  allelic, somatic âtwo hitâ mutations G1019X (sharing the same allele  with P1315L) and I1070M in genomic DNA of a basal cell carcinoma (BCC) in this patient . Despite the stop codon present in the BCC, real  time RT PCR and western blotting showed an over expression of ptc in tumor cells . This upregulation is mediated by in frame skipping of  the exon 19, harbouring G1019X, thus constituting a failing rescue  attempt of the transcriptional machinery to escape the consequences of this premature stop codon . These molecular alterations underscore  the significance of structurally unaltered ptc protein for suppression of cancerogenesis .",2006

We evaluated the efficiency of the ACmod and BGmod to identify  patients with germ line mutations in MLH1 and MSH2 in 81 unrelated Austrian HNPCC families . Microsatellite (MS) analysis was performed in 55 tumours . The new criteria included more families than the old  ones: BGmod, n=81; BG, n=72; ACmod, n=52 and ACII, n=35. The  more stringent old criteria tended to show greater positive predictive  value for association with a germ line mutation than the corresponding  new criteria: BGmod, 23%; BG, 26%; ACmod, 31% and ACII, 37%.  The larger number of patients analysed in the ACmod group resulted in greater sensitivity compared to the ACII . The increased workload for BGmod was not associated with greater sensitivity  . Microsatellite  instability (MSI) significantly enhanced specificity in all subgroups. We  recommend the use of the ACmod criteria to select patients for primary sequence analysis, when microsatellite analysis is not possible .

The highest difference in median AO was twelve years between  homozygous carriers of the wild type in both genes (42 years) and of the polymorphic allele in both genes (30 years), respectively  .

We examined IL 10 haplotypes consisting of three SNPs  1082(G/A),  819(C/T) and  592(C/A) within the promoter region of the IL 10 gene .  IL 10 production is associated with haplotypes that are defined by  these SNPs, so that individuals can be genotyped for higher or lower  levels IL10 production. These haplotypes might influence the risk for  colon cancer development and progression possibly by affecting the  efficiency of the antitumour immune response and/or pathways of angiogenesis . A total of 100 sporadic colon cancer (SCC) patients and 100 unrelated  cancer free controls were genotyped for  1082 SNP using real time  PCR TaqManÂ® SNP genotyping assay  . PCR RFLP method was used  for  819 and  592 SNPs . The most frequent IL 10 genotypes in both groups were medium  expressing genotypes ACC/GCC (30,0% in control and 29,9% in SCC) and ATA/GCC (22,9% in control and 24,7% in SCC) . High producing  genotype GCC/GCC was detected in 17,1 % of controls, and 15,5% of SCC samples . Low producing genotype ACC/ACC was more  frequent in controls (20,0%) when compared to SCC (6,2%), and low  producing genotype ATA/ATA was more frequent in SCC (8,2%) when Cancer genetics1 compared to the control where it was not detected at all .

In general, these lesions are solitary and have a low potential to become malignant . However, in patients  affected by the autosomal dominantly inherited juvenile polyposis  syndrome (JPS), multiple juvenile polyps are developed throughout the  gastrointestinal (GI) tract which if left untreated may cause bleeding, anemia and carry an elevated risk of developing GI cancer  . Germline  mutations in the SMAD4  or BMPR1A  genes, the members of the  transforming growth factor beta (TGFÎ²) receptor SMAD superfamily, have been shown to cause disease in 35 50% of JPS patients . So far, little data is available on the nature of the second, somatic mutation (eg .  loss of heterozygosity (LOH)) and oncogene activation in tumours from  JPS patients with an identified germline mutation. Here we present  the results of a molecular genetic survey on two juvenile polyposis  kindreds harbouring pathogenic SMAD4  (1244 1247delACAG) and  BMPR1A  (583C>T; G195X) germ line mutations, respectively.

The ratios between the alleles as  observed on DGGE correlated closely with the ratios from sequence curves . This led us to the notion that this patient could be a mosaic of  normal and heterozygous cells, and prompted us to examine the allele ratio in other non invasively sampled tissues .

Subsequent amplification can focus on selective amplification of  methylation patterns in CpG islands (methyation specific PCR, MSP)  or on amplification of bisulfite treated (converted) gDNA (Bisulfite  treatment specific PCR, BIS). Selection of PCR focus is done by primer design . After PCR, sequencing can clarify the methylation pattern but several factors must be taken into account to ensure reliable data . During the bisulfite treatment base composition will undergo dramatical changes . This must be taken under consideration during primer and  amplicon design for the initial amplification. Dependend on the base  composition of the target region the design may change the originally focused strategy for sequencing . In first instance, strategy is depending on preferred outcome:1 . More or less methylated? / Which CpG in target region is differentially methylated? > Direct sequencing of PCR products .2 .

","Objectives: Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) is an  autosomal dominant inherited disorder that is characterized primarily by the development of colorectal cancer (CRC) . CRC in adolescent patients is extremely rare even in families with HNPCC . Those cancers  require particular attention because the survival rate for this young group of patients is poor  . Here, we describe a family with HNPCC and  two germline mutations in MLH1 gene and very early onset colorectal  cancer in the proband (12 years old) . Our observations suggest that  the germline mutation of the both copies of the MLH1  gene could play  a important role in the early onset of CRC . Study design: Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood  lymphocytes from the proband and 8 members of the HNPCC family  and sequenced for MLH1  and MSH2  genes . DNA obtained from  probandÂ´s sigmoid tumour specimen was analyzed for high frequency microsatellite instability (MSI) . Results: Two germline MLH1  gene mutations have been identified. One  located in the exon 8 of MLH1  gene, R226X, and other change located  in the exon 19 of  MLH1  gene, V716M . Probandâs tumor demonstrated  MSI at each loci tested, defining the tumor as having high frequency MSI . Conclusions: In this patient, V716M mutation in addition to R226X  may lead to inactivation of both copies of the MLH1  gene allowing  earlier accumulation of mutations in microsatellites and other repetitive sequences, generating MSI and initiating the tumorigenic process .

Therefore it has been studied for half a century  now, ever since cytotoxic drugs were first used for cancer therapy.  So far, about three separate forms of MDR have been characterized in more detail: classical MDR, non Pgp MDR and atypical MDR .  The classical MDR drug pump is composed of a transmembrane  glycoprotein (P glyco protein Pgp) encoded by the so called multidrug resistance (MDR1) gene . Typically, non Pgp MDR has no  P gly coprotein expression, yet has about the same cross resistance pattern as classical MDR . This non Pgp MDR phenotype is caused  by over expression of the multidrug resistance associated protein (MRP1) gene . To the best of our knowledge (although one of the main obstacles in  chemotherapy success rate) no one systematically investigated the  role of MRP1 gene in inducing MDR phenotype in Iranian leukemic patients . By employing chromosome microdissection we shown that  increased in gene copy number and also over expression of MRP1  gene are involved in drug resistance in a drug resistance leukemia cell  line. In addition, we have used fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH)  and Real Time PCR technology to study the association between MRP1 and MDR phenotype in Iranian AML patients . So far we found  that over expression of MRP1 occurs in about 20% of the Iranian AML patients . We are aiming to further investigate whether or not elevated  MRP expression in Iranian patients at diagnosis is an unfavorable prognostic factor for clinical outcome of chemotherapy  .",2006

However, the clinical phenotype of HNPCC  patients reflects a complex interplay between the predisposing  mutation and putative constitutional and somatic modifiers.Certain MMR gene mutations predispose to combined occurrence of sebaceous gland neoplasms and visceral malignancies . This is  known as Muir Torre syndrome (MTS), and regarded as a phenotypic variant of HNPCC . The sebaceous tumors associated with MTS appear in many patients  before visceral malignancies, providing important predictability of HNPCC related cancers in mutation carriers . However, molecular  assessment needs to be carried out to verify the presence of the syndrome . Contribution of non truncating mutations found in  skin cancer patients is difficult to interpret and therefore, genetic assessment of MTS requires a functional test . Here, we studied the repair efficiency of the two MSH2 missense  mutations, L187P and C697F, found in HNPCC families including mutation carriers with sebaceous skin tumors . We assessed their  capability to correct DNA mispairs with a functional mismatch repair  assay. Both mutations were deficient in the assay, which together  with tumor findings, high MSI and loss of MSH2 protein expression,  suggested their predisposing role in both internal and skin malignancies in the families . The functional testing of the two missense mutations in MSH2  supports the notion that Muir Torre subphenotype of HNPCC is  associated with severe functional defects in the repair capability of  the mutated proteins, which is compatible with a phenotype fulfilling the Amsterdam criteria in the families .",2006

Studies at the PAFNORD  registry (regional multidisciplinary center of North of France) have  revealed a unique germline MSH2  c .1022T>C p .Leu341Pro missense  mutation that has never been reported . Detailed analyses showed  that this specific mutation constituted ~20% of all germline MMR gene  mutations identified in PAFNORD registry. The objectives of this study were : i) to determine if the c .1022T>C is  the disease causing mutation and not a clinically silent mutation ; ii) to  characterise the founder effect . Complete analysis of MSH2, MLH1  and MSH6 did not reveal  other pathogenic mutations. The c.1022T>C variant was identified in 7 .1% of HNPCC families in PAFNORD registry and was not  identified in 103 healthy controls. All colorectal cancer tested showed  microsatellite instability (4/4) and absence of MSH2 protein (3/3), by immunohistochemical analysis . The variant is located in a conserved domain of MSH2 important for structure of the protein . The c .1022T>C  variant segregates with the HNPCC phenotype in 17 patients (lod scores are being performed) . Thi allele was identified in 9 apparently unrelated families. All originated from the french region of Lille in North of France . Haplotypes are being  performed using microsatellite markers flanking the MSH2  gene in  order to characterise this variant as a founder mutation in North of France .All these results support the hypothesis that the c .1022T>C variant  is the disease causing mutation and encourage us to use it in  presymptomatic screening, even if functionnal assay has not been performed .",2006

Failure of the DNA mismatch repair  system causes high level microsatellite instability (MSI high) in  tumours of HNPCC patients and MSI analysis is often used to start Cancer genetics HNPCC diagnosis . The sensitivity of MSI analysis to detect MSH6   mutations is questioned . methods:  To investigate the role of MSH6  mutations in a cohort of  HNPCC suspected patients without microsatellite instability in their  tumour DNA, we performed immunohistochemical staining of the  MSH6 protein in these tumours and analyzed the MSH6  gene in  patients most suspected of HNPCC . Results:  All 380 tumours that were not MSI high showed presence  of the MSH6 protein . In 90 patients, from this group of 380 patients,  MSH6  germline mutation analysis was performed, and no pathogenic  mutation in MSH6 was detected . Pathogenic MSH6 mutations were  exclusively found in patients with MSI high tumours with loss of MSH6   expression (n=9) and in 2 patients in which MSI analysis was not performed .conclusion:  Presence of MSI high in tumour DNA is reliable to select  patients for MSH6  germline mutation analysis .

Typical hallmark symptoms are  multiple neurofibromas, hyperpigmented areas of the skin (cafÃ© au lait spots) and Lisch nodules . As the symptoms of NF1 show a high  interfamilial variability, the existence of modifying genes has long been proposed . NF1 patients with microdeletions spanning the  NF1 and  several surrounding genes with yet unknown function have an earlier  onset of neurofibromas and a higher tumor load as classical NF1 patients . Therefore, it seems likely that one of the genes additionally missing in these patients contributes to the severity of the disease .  On the other hand, two variants of classical NF1 exist where patients  present with markedly fewer or no neurofibromas. Familial Spinal NF  (FSNF) is characterised by the presence of spinal neurofibromas with a wide and symmetric distribution . Patients with this disease generally  lack dermal neurofibromas. Neurofibromatosis Noonan syndrome  (NFNS) is a variant showing phenotypic overlap with Noonan syndrome (including short stature, facial anomalies and webbed neck) .  It was recently shown to be caused by mutations in the NF1 but not  the PTPN11  gene which is responsible for plain Noonan syndrome .

NMU has also been shown to significantly reduce cellular proliferation, indicating tumour suppressing activity  . Expression analyses of the  NMU receptors and ligand were carried out on a panel of human cancer  cell lines derived from a range of tissues (prostate, breast, bladder, colon, AML) . Expression analyses revealed one of the following  patterns: expression of the ligand and both receptors, expression of  the ligand and one of the receptors, expression of one or both the receptors but not the ligand . Those cell lines lacking NMU expression  were examined for promoter hypermethylation. Twelve out of fifteen  cell lines examined expressed  the NMU ligand and one or both of its  receptors .

Therefore, understanding the  regulation of p53 function in tumor suppression is essential to design new therapeutic strategies to treat this disease . We investigated the  frequency of mutations in exon 5 and 7 of p53 gene and p53 protein in breast tissue by immunohistochemical analysis . Screening for p53 mutations was done by PCR SSCP analysis of exon 5 and 7 of the gene . Enzyme restrictions were performed on 175th  codon on 5th exon and 249th codon on 7th exon using enzymes HaeII  and HaeIII,respectively. Each of the paraffin embedded specimens was immunologically stained for the p53 biomarker expression . Mutation rate of 20 cases was found to be 30%, whereas mutation rates of exon 5 and 7 were found to be 20% and 11,8%, respectively  .  After immunohystochemical staining, more than 90% p53 staining was  achieved in 4 samples; 3% in 1 sample; 1% in 2 samples and 0,5% in 2 samples . No staining was detected in 11 samples . Staining was  positive in 3 p53 mutation cases and 6 mutation cases, and staining  was negative in 3 mutation cases and 8 mutation negative cases  (Fisherâs chi sq test; p>0.05). The results obtained in these breast carcinoma paraffin embedded  tissues indicate that no clear cut linear relationship exists between  the p53 mutational status and the extent of its respective mRNA and protein expression . Therefore, direct DNA analyses and functional  assays remain the only methods for the reliable detection of p53 mutations .",2006

Paraganglioma of the  head and neck occurs mostly sporadically and also in syndromic or nonsyndromic familial settings . To date four susceptibility genes for  pheochromocytoma have been reported that included RET proto  oncogene, VHL tumor suppressor gene and recently identified  genes SDHB and SDHD for succinate dehydrogenase subunit B and D respectively  . Mutations in these genes can predispose one to  pheochromocytoma and paraganglioma . All established genes were  analyzed to investigate possible genetic cause of apparently sporadic  pheochromocytoma (ASP) and paraganglioma in population of Czech patients . Among 27 patients with ASP two novel germline (missense)  mutation was found in the VHL  gene . Further, one novel coding single  nucleotide change and one inversion in SDHB gene were detected .  In a child with neuroblastoma and paraganglioma we detected a novel splice site mutation in SDHB gene . In addition, in one examined  patient with apparently sporadic paraganglioma we detected recently  identified mutation of the start codon in SDHD gene.

We aimed to unravel  the relationship of this polymorphism and the risk of breast cancer by means of an association study and a meta analysis . Women participating in the Rotterdam Study including 163 patients with breast cancer were genotyped for this polymorphism . We carried  out a logistic, a survival analysis by age and finally, we performed a meta analysis . The logistic regression analysis showed an increased risk of breast  cancer for Proline allele carriers (OR=1.5; 95%CI =1.1 2.2) against non carriers . Which was maintained when studying only incident  cases (OR=1.8; 95%CI =1.1 2.8). There were no differences in risk among prevalent cases . The survival analysis showed that carriers of this same allele had a HR of 1 .8 (95% CI = 1 .2 2 .7) compared non carriers .

Given the relatively high frequency of de novo  APC mutations, a substantial proportion of mosaic APC mutations are  to be expected in patients with polyposis coli . So far, only four cases of  mosaic APC mutations have been reported . Methods: We performed germline mutation analysis in 568 consecutive  index patients with polyposis coli referred for APC scanning using  DGGE and PTT, and subsequent sequence analysis in DNA fragments  displaying abnormal patterns . APC gene deletions were detected  either with Southern blot analysis or MLPA . Results: Scrutinizing the molecular genetic results of 223 index patients  with pathogenic APC mutations lead to the identification of 11 mosaic  cases (5%). Eight mosaic cases were identified as somatic, one case as gonadal and two cases as combined gonadal and somatic . We  observed C>T transitions in CGA sites in four of the eight cases with  somatic mosaicism, which is significantly more than 25 of the 212 non mosaic patients from our cohort (p=0 .011) . Phenotypes of patients with  somatic mosaicism ranged from an attenuated form of polyposis coli to  florid polyposis with major extra colonic manifestations. Conclusions: Mosaicism accounts for a significant number of APC  mutations and is predominantly identified in apparently de novo  cases  of FAP  . Patients with a somatic mosaicism exert a wide variety in  phenotype and arise repeatedly from mutations affecting CGA sites .  These observations have consequences for molecular genetic APC  testing and the clinical management of polyposis coli patients and their family members .",2006

We present here our experience of PGD for familial adenomatous polyposis, a dominant inherited cancer due to APC gene mutations . Twelve couples were referred between 2000 and 2005 . We initially developed tests to detect the mutation alone, but rapidly  we set up multiplex PCR combining mutation detection and indirect diagnosis using linked microsatellites . Protocols were optimised by  modifying standard conditions, particularly after a judicious primer choice, in order to add internal controls in single cell PCR . Finally,  we have set up multiplex indirect diagnoses to be able to offer a PGD whatever mutation is involved in familial cases . Mutation  detection strategies were based on: (i) a new double allele specific  PCR approach allowing the simultaneous detection of the wild type  and mutated allele; (ii) sizing the PCR fragments for deletions; or (iii) restriction length polymorphisms .

It was supported that neuroendocrine differentiation  plays an important role in the progression of prostate cancer to androgen independent state . We studied the effect of Valproic acid (VPA), an inhibitor of hystone  deacetylase (HDAC), in a human prostate cancer androgen dependent cell line (LnCaP) . LnCaP were treated with 5mM VPA, and after 48 hours, assayed  for viability, cell proliferation and gene expression patterns by a low density microarray (AndroChip) . VPA was able to induce apoptosis and inhibition of cell growth . The treatment caused a decrease of PSA  secretion and stimulated a NSE (neuron specific enolase) expression.  Microarray analysis showed that VPA was able to modulate the  expression of different androgen metabolism genes and in particular, up regulation of the UGT2B7 (FC 1 .9) gene, involved in DHT  (dihydrotestosterone) degradation, and a down regulation of PSA (FC   6 .19), AR (FC  1 .7) and its coregulator ARA24 ( FC  2 . 89) . The results suggest that VPA treatment reduces the expression of  PSA (at RNA and protein levels) and also the amount of androgen  available to prostate cells by increasing UGT2B7 expression,  nevertheless, the treatment stimulates the production of NSE, down regulates AR expression, and promotes neuroendocrine differentation .  Taken together, these results suggest that VPA treatment should not  be considered as a chemotherapeutic agent in androgen dependent prostate cancer  . This work was supported by an AIRC grant",2006

Loss of 3p is the most frequent aberration in this type of  tumors and can be found as the sole karyotypic change in about 10% of the cases . The region on 3p that is lost varies from p11 .2 to pter, with most of the breakpoints clustering around p14 .2 . The 3p losses occur by  terminal or interstitial deletions as well as by unbalanced translocations of the 3p region with other chromosomes (often chromosome 5) . The  frequent loss of 3p sequences suggests the presence of one or more  tumor suppressor gene(s) that are relevant for (the early stages of) tumor development . Indeed, several candidate genes on chromosome  3p with tumor suppressor activity have been associated with renal  tumorigenesis, including the FHIT  gene on 3p14, the RASSF1A gene  on 3p21, and the VHL gene on 3p25 .

We have  performed Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization studies, analysing  14 representative FTC and 14 matched OVCA cases at a genome wide scale with a medium resolution . In addition, we have compared the  results with data of a clinically agressive serous borderline malignancy of the ovary obtained with exactly the same platform . The studies  indicate that the analysed OVCAs and FTCs displayed both common and more distinctive patterns of changes . In contrast, the investigated borderline case did not show a similar pattern of changes . Zooming in  on the genes present in the altered regions results in the identification  of already known genes implicated in gynaecological malignancies, such as cMyc, ERBB2, CCNE1 and Akt2 . New genes found include  Brg1, whose product has been implicated in a BRCA1 linked pathway, suggesting that this pathway may also play a role in sporadic cancers .  A further development of DNA tests based on results of array CGH  might be useful for diagnostic purposes, especially to discriminate  between borderline tumors and OVCAs and FTCs and be instrumental to prevent erroneous chemotherapies for borderline patients .",2006
cD24 as a unique immunphenotyping marker for chronic myeloid Leukemia stem cell,P0603.,Sozer,"Uludag University, Bursa, Turkey","The purpose of this study was to find a marker that diminishes chronic  myeloid leukemia stem cells (CML SCs) from normal stem cells in a mouse model system of CML . As a mouse model retrovirus transduction  model was employed using a vector expressing p210/BCR/ABL  and the green fluorescent protein (GFP). Transplantation studies of  BCR/ABL infected cells in recipient mice demonstrated an aggressive  myeloproliferative disease within ~3 weeks, as has previously been observed with this approach . Phenotypic analysis of bone marrow from  BCR/ABL mice showed contribution by the transduced cells to multiple  lineages, suggesting a primitive stem/progenitor cell gives rise to the disease . Subsequent analysis of primary cells that arise  in vivo  showed  the leukemia initiating activity resides in cells that are Sca 1+/c kit+/Lin  . Further, comparison of the BCR/ABL mice and GFP control mice  revealed preferential over expression of CD24 (heat stable antigen)  in the primitive leukemic cells (~90%), demonstrating a possible BCR/ABL induced activation of the antigen . Sorting and serial transplantation studies of CD24+ vs . CD24  cells from BCR/ABL mice showed that  the leukemia initiating activity resides in the CD24+/ Lin  population .  Collectively, these data indicate that BCR/ABL expression increases proliferative of primitive CML cells and up regulates the CD24 antigen .  We suggest that the CD24 antigen represents a potential marker to  distinguish normal from CML stem cells and that it may confer specific functional properties on the CML population .",2006

We have focused on the identification of elements and factors playing  a role in the TLX3 physiological expression regulation, and therefore likely to be involved in cancer development . In particular, after identifying  the transcription start points, we have made use of in vitro tranfection  assays to demonstrate that the 5â untranslated region of the gene is  necessary for the basal promoter activity in cell lines from different origin . By site directed mutagenesis, two tandem CCAAT boxes have been localized as critical elements of this region . In vivo chromatin  immunoprecipitation and electrophoretic mobility shift assays have  indicated that nuclear factor Y (NFY) recognizes these sites in all the analyzed cell lines . The physiological role of such an interaction has  been confirmed by means of a dominant negative version of the NFY  transcription factor, that has turned out to decrease both in vitro TLX3 promoter activity and endogenous amount of mRNA . We propose  that proper cell specific regulation of the human TLX3 gene requires  the interaction of the NFY proximal sequence with long range tissue  specific cis elements which we are searching at present.",2006

We have previously shown that propolis inhibited the  expression of telomerase by decreasing the hTERT level in T cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell line . The aim of this study is to investigate  the effect of propolis prepared in different concentrations on hTERT in the leukemia cells obtained from leukemia patients . Telomerase activity in the cell cultures of bone marrow samples in 4  cases with leukemia have been evaluated following propolis treatment in 3 different concentrations after 24 and 48 . Cell viability of propolis treated and control cultures were analyzed by XTT assay  . The  LightCycler instrument was used for the quantification of hTERT. Propolis treatment was not effective in juvenile myelomonocytic  leukemia cells, however, significantly both positive and negative differences were observed in the hTERT of pre B cell leukemia .

Up to 53% of the patients die of metastatic disease . It is important to identify high risk patients, so that such  individuals could be monitored for the presence of liver metastases  and could be offered adjuvant chemotherapy or liver resection surgery at an early stage . Unfavourable prognostic factors among others are  tumor size, ciliary body involvement, the presence of epithelioid cells  and specific extravascular matrix patterns. Monosomy of chromosome  3 is also a significant indicator of poor prognosis in uveal melanoma.  The identification of this monosomy in tumor tissue is therefore very important . The aim of this study was to compare the detection rate of  monosomy 3 between cytogenetic analysis and interphase fluorescence  in situ hybridization (FISH) on cultured cells and interphase FISH on  nuclei isolated from paraffin embedded tissue. Both techniques were performed in a series of 50 enucleated uveal melanomas . FISH on  nuclei isolated from paraffin embedded tissue showed monosomy 3 in  62% of the cases while combining karyotyping and FISH on cultured  cells a monosomy of chromosome 3 was detected in only 38% of the cases . We can conclude that the use of interphase FISH on nuclei  isolated from paraffin embedded tissue increases the possibility to identify patients at high risk for metastases .",2006

Two  of these patients are the subject of this presentation: In a 15 year  old boy with abdominal and subsequent neurological symptomatology,  966insA (led to stop codon after 36 completely different amino acids  compared to wt sequence) mutation within PBGD was found ( de novo   mutation) . In another patient (female with acute attack in personal  history), two mutations [518G>A (R173Q), and 610C>A (Q204E)] were found to be located in the same allele of exon 10 . Structural modeling and the expression studies were performed . The probability of a life threatening porphyric attack in AIP is a  significant personal burden and creates a challenge for counseling and medical management . Introducing molecular biology techniques  to the diagnosis and heme arginate to the treatment of acute attacks increase our chances for effective treatment of AIP  .

Molecular characterization of the first missense mutation  in the fibrinogen Aalpha chain gene causing afibrinogenemia.,P0620.,"Asselta, M. PlatÃ¨, M. Malcovati, M. L. Tenchini, S. Duga","Department of Biology and Genetics for Medical Sciences, University of Milan,  Milan, Italy","Congenital afibrinogenemia (MIM#202400) is a rare coagulation  disorder characterized by very low or unmeasurable levels of  functional and immunoreactive fibrinogen in plasma, associated with a hemorrhagic phenotype of variable severity  . It is transmitted as an  autosomal recessive trait (prevalence 1:1 .000 .000) and is invariantly  associated with mutations affecting one of the three fibrinogen genes  (FGA, FGB and FGG , coding for AÎ±, BÎ² and Î³ chain, respectively).  Fibrinogen is secreted by hepatocytes as a hexamer composed of two  copies of each chain; the lack of one chain has been demonstrated to  prevent its secretion. Most genetic defects causing afibrinogenemia  are truncating mutations, whereas only few missense mutations (4)  have been identified so far, all located in FGB . In this study, direct sequencing of the fibrinogen genes in a 32 years  old afibrinogenemic Italian male identified the first missense mutation Molecular and biochemical basis of disease (Met51Arg) located in the AÎ± chain gene leading to a quantitative  fibrinogen deficiency. The patient was a compound heterozygote for a  previously described frameshift mutation (1215delT) in the same gene .  Met51Arg involves a residue located at the very beginning of the coiled  coil domain, in a region previously demonstrated to play a pivotal role in hexamer formation .  In vitro  expression experiments in COS 1 cells  showed that Met51Arg abolishes secretion of the hexameric molecule,  even though traces of not completely assembled trimeric intermediate were found in conditioned media . Western blot analysis performed on  the probandâs plasma confirmed the presence in vivo of the trimeric  fibrinogen, further supporting the hypothesis that the mutation alters  the final steps of fibrinogen assembly.",2006

Its homologue,  myoferlin localizes to the sarcolemma and the nuclear membrane and  is highly expressed during development. To further define the dysferlin  protein complex in skeletal muscle and to obtain functional insight in  dysferlin, we selected two single domain antibody reagents (VHH) that recognize different epitopes of dysferlin . Co immunoprecipitation coupled to MALDI allowed the identification of proteins that interact with dysferlin . Amongst these was AHNAK,  previously implicated in cortical actin cytoskeleton organization and cell membrane cytoarchitecture . GST pull down and co IP studies  confirmed the direct interaction between AHNAK and dysferlin or  myoferlin. Moreover, immunofluorescence microscopy revealed a  secondary reduction of AHNAK at the sarcolemma in dysferlinopathy patients . As AHNAK does not contain transmembrane domains, we  propose that dysferlin and myoferlin anchor AHNAKs to the membrane,  which provides a link between dysferlin and actin filaments.",2006

The COL4A5 gene has GC rich fragments and can be problematic for  heteroduplex analysis but the TGCE technology allows heteroduplexes to be identified using one temperature range. The data is analysed  using Revelation software which is specifically designed for the  identification of heteroduplexes. This enables traces to be overlaid and  shifts identified. Heteroduplex peak shifts are characterised by sequence analysis to  identify pathogenic mutations and to eliminate changes caused by polymorphisms .

Protein  expression was three  to fivefold over the basal level in the transfected  and induced clones. Clone H11 exhibited the highest GSK 3Î² and tau  levels; therefore it was chosen for investigation of tau phosphorylation  using phosphorylation site specific anti tau antibodies. In H11 cells pre treated with the inducing agent muristerone A (MuA),  a significant increase in tau phosphorylation at specific GSK 3Î² dependent phosphorylation sites (Ser 202 and Ser 396) was detected .  Flow cytometry analysis revealed a dose dependent up regulation of tau hyperphosphorylation with increasing concentration of MuA . In  addition, the GSK 3 selective inhibitor LiCl reduced tau phosphorylation in a concentration dependent manner  .

The same analytical approach was also applied to 171 relatives of the HSR+ patients . Variance component  analysis using these 14 families suggests that genetic differences  may explain 61% of the phenotypic variability of plasma APP activity  (p<0 .001) . Furthermore, we show that a polymorphism (C 2399A) at  the XPNPEP2  locus is a significant predictor of APP activity among the  HSR  controls ( p=0.029).

In this study, 24 Iranian patients affected with AT and 100 normal controls were examined . mt DNA was  extracted from whole blood and examined by 6 primers for existence  of any mitochondrial deletions. We also amplified and sequence the mtDNA HVS I by standard sequencing techniques . mtDNA deletions were present in 13 (76%) of our patients (9 .0 kb deletion in all samples, 5 .0 kb in one and 7 .5 kb in two patients), representing mtDNA damage which may be due to oxidative stress in mitochondria . Our results  showed that there is no association between mtDNA haplogroups and AT . Our results may explain involvement of mitochondrial damage in  the pathogenesis of the AT",2006

Peters","Center for Human and Clinical Genetics, Leiden, The Netherlands","Autosomal Recessive Polycystic Kidney Disease (ARPKD) is a  severe form of polycystic kidney disease characterized by enlarged  kidneys and congenital hepatic fibrosis. It is caused by mutations in  the Polycystic Kidney and Hepatic Disease 1 ( PKHD1 ) gene, which  consists of 86 exons that are variably assembled in a number of alternatively spliced transcripts . Mutation analysis was performed by  direct sequencing of the 67 exons encompassing the largest open reading frame . So far, in 39 families the following mutations were identified: 11 nonsense mutations, 15 deletions/insertions, 5 splice site mutations, and 39 missense mutations . To classify missense  variants we combined evolutionary conservation, using the human,  chimpanzee, dog, mouse, chicken and frog Pkhd1 sequences, with the Grantham score for chemical differences . Thirty three missense  mutations were considered pathogenic and 7 were classified as rare, probably pathogenic variants . In 31 index patients two mutations were  found, in 6 patients one mutation was found, leading to a mutation detection rate of 87% . More families are currently under investigation .  The analysis of amino acid conservation as well as applying the  Grantham score for chemical differences allowed us to determine the  pathogeneity for nearly all new missense mutations and thus proved to be useful tools to classify missense variants . In addition to sequence analysis, MLPA was used to identify multiple exon deletions . We selected 9 probes equally spread over the gene  but did not find deletions, indicating that large deletions in the PKHD1   gene are not a frequent cause of ARPKD .",2006

These patients have an increased incidence of diabetes mellitus, hypertension and congenital heart malformations . Although  BBS is rare in the general population (about 1/160,000 in West Europe),  there is a considerable interest in its study because the components of its phenotype are very common . Until now, nine involved genes  have been identified ( BBS1 9 ) and several pieces of evidence have  suggested their role in ciliary function . BBS is a complex inheritance  disease and it has been proposed as a triallelic trait in some families,  where three mutated alleles in two genes are necessary to exhibit the phenotype . The  BBS2  gene has 17 exons and is situated on 16q21 .  BBS2 displays a wide pattern of tissue expression, however there is  no information available regarding the specific function of this gene.  We analyzed the involvement of mutations in BBS2  for 44 patients  by PCR SSCP  . An abnormal pattern of SSCP was detected in exons  2 and 3 . The results show an implication of BBS2  in less than 5%  of our pool of patients . It has been described that 40% of the BBS2 families presents mutations in other related genes . The patients with  mutations in the BBS2  gene lack mutations in BBS1  and BBS6  genes,  previously analyzed by some of the authors, suggesting that the triallelic inheritance is not present in the families studied .",2006

The breakpoint on chromosome 18q11 .2 has been mapped down to 150kb . Within the 2,5Mb surrounding this breakpoint, two candidate  genes have been described (in both human and mouse): LAMA3  gene, coding for Î±3 chain of the adhesion molecule Laminin 5, which  strongly promotes adhesion, migration, and scattering of cells through  binding to integrins Î±3Î²1, Î±6Î²1 and Î±6Î²4; and ROCK1 gene, coding  for a Rho associated coiled coil forming kinase, involved in integrin and integrin associated structure organization .   It seems possible that the chromosomal localization of these two  genes might be important for their expression, and so a chromosomal  rearrangement involving the region between them could affect their  transcription. If so, the translocation identified in proband B2157 that  separates LAMA3 and ROCK1 genes, could be the cause of a reduced  adhesion capacity of the epithelial cells, which are directly involved  in the adhesion and fusion of the palatal shelves in the formation of the secondary palate . The consequence of this lack of adhesion and fusion would be the appearance of a cleft palate .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease1",2006

The gene encodes a polypeptide which is arranged in hexametric array and form gap junctions . We describe two novel mutations in the connexin32 gene in two Norwegian families .  Family 1 had a 225delG which cause a frameshift and premature stop codon at position 247 . This probably results in a polypeptide which is not arranged in a hexametric array due to the change in protein structure .  This family had a female preponderance of X linked CMT and several  abortions were observed. Family 2 had a 536 GâA transition which  cause a change of the highly conserved cysteine residue to tyrosine at amino acid position 179 . One man had pathological VEP and three  affected had markedly balance problems of probable central nervous  system origin. The mean age at onset was in the first decade in both  genders. Clinically the affected had symmetrical findings, while the  neurophysiological examination revealed minor asymmetrical findings in nerve conduction velocity in 6 of 10 affected .

Approximately one in  every 2500 people is affected and the onset of the disease usually  occurs in the second or third decade of life. Some classifications  are based on the type of the neuropathy, which may be axonal or demyelinating, and on the mode of inheritance . Electrophysiological studies are necessary to determine the type of neuropathy  . Different modes of inheritance are observed: autosomal  dominant, X linked, dominant, autosomal recessive . The X linked form of CMT (CMTX) is associated with mutations in the connexin 32 (Cx32) gene, which maps to chromosome Xq13 . Xq13s  are often reduced in CMTX males (< 40 m/s), but ranged from slightly reduced to normal values in females . Neuropathy in CMTX is primary axonal or demyelination with secondary axonal degeneration . CMTX involves defective Schwan cell function . So far, 33 kinds of mutation in 30 sites in the Cx32 gene have been found in CMTX disease patients .CMTX disease associated Cx32 gene mutations are not only unable to restore GJIC but also down regulate wild type Cx32 protein functions . In our study we detected a family with 3 males and 1 female affected CMT . Reviewing the pedigree and electrophysiological studies showed  that this disorder is suspected to be X linked CMT  . Therefore we  checked Cx32 by PCR method and sequencing for confirming our detection .",2006

About 70% of individuals with CMT1 have a duplication of PMP22 gene as the origin of disorder (CMT1A form) . One of the most effective  strategies for molecular diagnosis of CMT1A is based on quantitative PCR analysis of short tandem repeats (STRs) . To establish the  diagnostic potential of this method we used 3 STR markers, from within the CMT1A duplicated region   D17S2218, D17S2223 and D17S2229 .  A multiplex PCR protocol was developed to amplify simultaneously all 3 dinucleotide repeats . Products were analysed by automated  capillary electrophoresis on the ABI Prism 310. First we amplified  these sequences in a cohort of unaffected individuals from Belarus  population and assessed the heterozygosity and number of alleles for each of STR . Heterozygosity values of the selected STRs were 78%, 65 % and 76% respectively  . Then markers informativeness was tested  in a group of 58 patients with presumable clinical diagnoses of CMT  neuropathy and 68 their family members. We identified the PMP22  gene duplications in 9 families with a total number of 20 affected individuals . In all positive cases we were able to detect three different  alleles of at least one STR and clear semiquantitative dosage effect in other  . Additionally one family with hereditary neuropathy with liability  to pressure palsy (HNPP) was identified.

Proteolytic cleavage of its c terminal region originates endostatin, a potent angiogenesis inhibitor  . Angiogenesis  plays a crucial role in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) progression . Reduced Collagen XVIII expression is associated with larger and  higher vascularized HCC tumors and, lower endostatin serum levels in the blood of HCC patients have been associated with larger tumors .  Elucidating the factors that control Collagen XVIII expression in hepatocytes is important to understand its role in HCC progression .  We recently showed that Sp1, Sp3 and YY1 bind human Collagen XVIII promoter controlling liver expression . We characterized a SNP  in this region,  700 T/G, which influences transcription level. Allele G,  most common among African descendents (55%), has higher (39%)  transcription activity than allele T, most common among European  descendents (58%). Sp3 has higher affinity for the G allele, while YY1  has higher affinity for the T allele (Armelin Correa et al., Matrix Biol.  2005; 24:550 9). Sp3 and YY1 can activate or inhibite transcription in different contexts . Deletion of a sequence of 40bp containing the SNP  700 caused 31% increase in promoter activity when compared with the promoter containing the T allele . These results suggest that these 40bp contain an inhibitory element . We are now performing cotransfection  experiments to elucidate the role of Sp3 and YY1 in Collagen XVIII  expression in hepatocytes and, to verify if the different interactions of  YY1 and Sp3 with both alleles of SNP 700 are responsible for their difference in transcriptional activity  .

As differentiated colonic  cells arose from the constant renewal of Hedgehog expressing colonic stem cells, SHh could be involved in human colonic carcinogenesis . Methods: Tissue samples of colorectal adenocarcinoma (T) and  adjacent normal colon tissue (NT) were drawn for each of 44 consecutive colorectal cancer patients . Transcription of SHh, GLI1  and FOXM1 were quantified using RT PCR. Similar mRNA in vitro  measurements of GLI1 and FOXM1 after specific induction by SHh Np were performed in the HT 29 colorectal tumor cell line . Results: SHh was overexpressed in colorectal adenocarcinomas of 86% patients . In vivo GLI1 and FOXM1 transcription levels were correlated with SHh induction (SHh vs . GLI1 r=0 .77*, GLI1 vs .

Mutations of acetylcholine receptor (AChR) subunit genes  lead to endplate AChR deficiency or to altered kinetic properties of the receptor  . Mutations in the alpha, beta and delta subunits of the  AChR are less frequent than mutations of the epsilon subunit and often associated with a severe phenotype . In a sporadic CMS patient of German origin, we identified two  compound heterozygous mutations in the CHRND  gene encoding  the delta subunit of the AChR: a novel point mutation in the long  cytoplasmic loop, CHRND  E381K, and a 2 .2 kb microdeletion disrupting  the CHRND  gene . As the cytoplasmic loop of the AChR subunits is  known to be essential for AChR rapsyn coclustering, we studied the  interaction of AChR containing the CHRND  E381K mutation with  rapsyn . Interestingly, the mutated receptor showed severely reduced cluster formation compared to the wildtype receptor  . By contrast, the  corresponding amino acid substitution in the cytoplasmic loop of the  AChR epsilon ( CHRNE  E376K) as well as a recently reported CMS  mutation affecting this domain ( CHRNE  N436del) had no impact on  cluster formation .

Mutations in the  NIPBL  gene were recently  found to cause CdLS . NIPBL  anomalies are detected in ~40% of  reported cases, suggesting genetic and/or further allelic heterogeneity  in CdLS, some mutations being not detected by current screening methods . To test whether mutations in the 5â untranslated region  (5âUTR) and proximal promoter of the NIPBL  gene could contribute to  the pathogenesis of CdLS, we screened a cohort of 21 CdLS patients  with no previously identified mutation by direct sequencing of this part of the gene . This work allowed the identification of a small heterozygous deletion  insertion mutation in exon 1, 321 nucleotides upstream of the translation initiation codon, in one affected girl and in her mildly affected father  .  This mutation, which altered a nucleotide that is highly conserved  across species, occurred de novo  in the father  . Moreover, it was not  detected in 388 control alleles . Using real time quantitative PCR, we  showed that NIPBL  mRNA expression was lowered in both patientsâ  lymphocytes compared to control samples . Our results demonstrate that mutations in the 5â non coding region  of the NIPBL  gene may be involved in the pathogenesis of CdLS .  Moreover, the mutation reported here expands the spectrum of  NIPBL  anomalies in CdLS and suggests that mutations affecting the  regulatory or untranslated region of the gene might be associated with a mild phenotype .",2006

The majority of inherited non syndromic cataracts are transmitted as an autosomal dominant trait . Mutations in the CRYG  genes, which encode the main cytoplasmic proteins of the human lens, have been associated with cataracts of various appearances .  The aim of the present study was to identify the disease locus for  nuclear congenital cataract in a non consanguineous family with two affected members . DNA from leukocytes and bucal swab was isolated  to analyze the CRYGA D cluster genes and to discard paternity through gene scan with several highly polymorphic markers . DNA  sequencing analysis of the two affected members showed a novel heterozygous missense mutation in the CRYGD gene . Analysis of the  two unaffected members of the family and the normal parents showed a normal sequence of the CRYGA D cluster genes . Analysis of highly polymorphic markers shows no evidence for non paternity  . This  mutation was not found in a group of 120 unrelated controls .

In RI, the birth  prevalence of the Cystic fibrosis (CF) is particularly high in the population of European origin . In a previous study we have demonstrated that  the screening of the 27 exons of the CF transmembrane conductance  regulator (CFTR) gene by DHPLC allowed the detection of 93% of the  molecular defects present in RI. Unidentified CF mutations may lie in  introns or in regulatory regions, or correspond to gene rearrangements  at the heterozygous state which escape detection using current PCR based techniques . Using a combination of different methods, 6 of  the 13 unidentified CF alleles were found to harbor a novel deletion of 5288 bp, spanning the exons 17a, 17b and 18 . This accounts for  46% of unidentified alleles. Identification and examination of the  breakpoint sequences showed that this deletion is different from the 3120+1Kbdel8 .6Kb previously found in the Palestinian arabs .  The IVS16+3316_IVS18+644del5288 bearing chromosomes had a common intragenic haplotype . This mutation causes an in frame  deletion of 160 amino acids that are part of the transmembrane domain 2 of the CFTR protein . Clinical evaluation of homozygotes  (n=2) and compound heterozygotes (n=2) indicate that this deletion  represents a severe mutation associated with positive sweat test,  pancreatic insufficiency and early age at diagnosis.

However,  mutation screening of GJB2  has revealed a significant percentage of  hearing impaired patients with only one recessive GJB2  disease causing  mutation, or one mutation with uncertain pathogenic significance,  which could not clearly account for the hearing loss by its own . Most  of those studies performed to date only involved the analysis of the  GJB2  coding region . Therefore, mutations in non coding regions may  have been missed . In fact, there are no sequence variants described  in the exon 1, and there are only a few polymorphisms reported in the promoter  . At least four mutations in non coding regions of GJB1  gene have  already been described in patients affected by X linked dominant  Charcot Marie Tooth neuropathy, three of which have been found in  the nerve specific promoter and the fourth one in the 5â UTR of the  mRNA.

Effectively, this  deletion, later called del( GJB6  D13S1830), was shown to be the  accompanying mutation in many cases in which affected subjects  were GJB2  heterozygotes, thus only carrying one mutant allele . These findings led many research groups all over the world to  screen their patients with non syndromic prelingual deafness, and  carrying one or null GJB2  mutant allele, for the presence of del( GJB6   D13S1830) The results obtained, namely in a large multicenter study,  involving patients from nine countries, revealed that the GJB6  deletion  is present in most of the screened populations, but with quite different frequencies . In a preliminary study previously performed in our laboratory, the  deletion was absent in the 74 unrelated patients then tested (0/148  chromosomes), in a clear contrast with the high prevalence observed in Spain, but in accordance with its scarcity in Italy  .

Data were normalized using non HSA21 genes for which  expression levels are not affected by DS . Among the 90 HSA21 sequences that were sufficiently expressed in cell  lines, differential analysis revealed that 46 genes were overexpressed with DS/2N ratios from 1 .07 to 1 .73 . More surprisingly, 3 HSA21 genes  were significantly classified as invariants. Finally this analysis showed  that biological variability has a significant effect on the expression of 21 HSA21 genes .",2006

This situation has changed only recently with  the development of MAPH and MLPA, two easy and versatile methods for the detection of both deletions and duplications .We present here  a retrospective study of 123 unrelated DMD/BMD patients (already  screened for deletions in the hot spot regions using modified multiplex PCR kits) .Rescreening these with MLPA revealed nine duplications, dispersed over the whole gene . This corresponds to a duplication  rate of 17% among deletion negative and 7% among all patients, an  ocerall duplication frequency comparable with what previous studies had suggested .The majority of cases contain a simple contiguous  duplication, but we also detected one non contiguous duplication/triplication . In most non contiguous duplications reported thus far the 3â end of the gene is affected . Whilst potentially disturbing the reading  frame of the mRNA, these mutations would go undetected using  standard multiplex PCR screening. These findings emphasize the  importance of screening the entire gene for rearrangements and that  duplications, compared to deletions, need to be treated with special care .",2006

This bleeding  disorder has a prevalence of about 1 per million and is associated with clinical manifestations ranging from mild to severe . Among rare  inherited coagulopathies, it is one of the least characterized from the molecular point of view  . The mutational screening of the FV gene in three FV deficient patients  identified five genetic defects, three hitherto unknown (the splicing  mutations IVS21+1G>A, IVS24+1_+4delGTAG, and IVS8+6T>C,  this last being the only one found in the homozygous state), and two already described (Arg1002ter and Arg2074His) . To demonstrate the  pathogenic role of the newly identified splicing defects, transfections of  appropriate FV minigene constructs (either wild type or mutant) were carried out in HeLa cells . RT PCR analysis on mRNA extracted from  transfected cells, demonstrated that the IVS8+6T>C transition causes the entire exon 8 to be skipped from the FV mRNA . Conversely,  both IVS21+1G>A and IVS24+1_+4delGTAG cause the activation of cryptic donor splice sites, located in exons 21 and 24, respectively  . In  all cases, the splicing defect results in the generation of a premature stop codon in the FV protein (p .Lys346SerfsX17, p .Gly1952ValfsX2, p .Met2120IlefsX12, mature protein) .

We have  analyzed the FLNA  gene in 48 patients who presented clinical and/or  brain MRI signs that belong to the spectrum of filaminopathies A. Material and Methods: Thirty two patients had PH, ten had OPD, two had MNS and four had complex congenital malformation disorders .  We used the dHPLC technology for an indirect search of mutation in  the entire coding region (47 exons), the 5â and 3â UTR regions, and in  the intron exon boundaries. All variants identified using dHPLC were secondary sequenced . Results: We have identified nine novel different mutations in ten patients with PH . The p .Pro207Leu missense mutation was observed in  six members of a large OPD family, and two novel missense mutations (p .N187Ser and p .Ser1199Leu) in two unrelated OPD patients . The previously known p .Ala1188Thr mutation was observed in the two unrelated patients with MNS . Discussion: We have identified eleven novel mutations in FLNA  .  Our data corroborate previous findings concerning the existence of  phenotype genotype correlations in filaminopathies A. Although PH is  largely due to loss of function mutations, OPD and MNS are caused  by mutations leading to the production of a full length protein and providing a gain of function effect . The later mutations clustered within a few regions and some are highly recurrent .",2006

Purified PCR products were sequenced in  an ABI 3100 automated capillary DNA sequencer with primers for the antisense strand .

This genetic disorder is characterized  by eyelid and craniofacial abnormalities and is often associated with premature ovarian failure . Several types of mutations have been found  in the open reading frame of FOXL2 , including nonsense and missense  mutations and polyalanine expansions or deletion . Premature stop  codons in FOXL2  have been considered so far as null alleles .  However, we demonstrated that such nonsense mutations might lead  to the production of N terminally truncated proteins by re initiation of translation downstream of the stop codon . Surprisingly, the truncated  proteins strongly aggregate in the nucleus, partially localize in the cytoplasm and retain a fraction of the wild type protein . Furthermore we have studied the effect of the polyalanine length variation . We  showed that mutant FOXL2 with an expanded polyAlanine tract forms  large aggregates both in the nucleus and the cytoplasm of transfected  cells, whereas the wild type protein localizes in the nucleus in a rather diffuse manner  .

molecular diagnosis of fragile X syndrome in mentally  retarded patients from Latvia,P0700.,"Daneberga1,2, Z. Krumina1, B. Lace1, N. Pronina1, R. Lugovska1","1Medical Genetic Clinic University Children`s Hospital, Riga, Latvia, 2Riga Stra   dins University, Riga, Latvia","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the second most common cause of mental retardation (MR) . FXS is mainly caused by massive expansion  of CGG triplet repeats located in the 5â untranslated region of the fragile X mental retardation 1  (FMR1 ) gene . The expanded CGG triplet  repeats are hypermethylated and the expression of the FMR1  gene  is repressed in patients with fragile X syndrome, which leads to the  absence of FMR1 protein (FMRP) and subsequent MR . Estimate  prevalence of FXS is 1 in 4000 â¦6000 males . Normal alleles vary  from 6 to approximately 50 CGG repeats . Intermediate alleles 45    55 repeats, premutation alleles 59   200 repeats (unmethylated), full mutation greater than approximately 200 repeats (methylated) . We analyzed a group of 171 unrelated males with MR referred from clinical geneticists . Molecular diagnostic includes screening by PCR  for a normal CGG repeat length and CGG repeat number detection by Applied Biosystems protocol on ABI Prism 310 . Three patients with  full mutation were detected. The final diagnosis confirmed by Southern blotting with kindly help of prof . K . Eiklid, Oslo, Norway  . One allele in  intermediate range was detected (50 repeats) . The estimation of AGG inserts structure and ATL1 SNP analysis for  further investigation of Latvian FXS patients and their families are in progress .FXS was detected in 1 .75% cases from analyzed patients with MR .

Fragile X A syndrome (FRAXA)  and fragile X E syndromes (FRAXE) are caused by trinucleotide expansions in FMR1 and FMR2 genes respectively  . Based on the  size and methylation status of the expansion, individuals are classified  into normal(2 60 CGG repeats), premutated (60 200 CGG repeats) and full mutated individuals(>200 CGG repeats) . When the repeat  number increases over 200, the gene gets hypermethylated and transcriptionally silenced, hence not producing the FMR protein . We  have screened 203 individuals from south India with MR of unknown etiology  . All the individuals are clinically evaluated by a 15 item check  list . Molecular diagnosis was carried out using PCR technique and  sizing of the amplicons were carried out by electrophoresis in denaturing  polyacrylamide gel. The cases in which the amplification failed were  suspected for the syndrome and were confirmed by southern blot analysis using Stb12 .3 probe . Of the 203 cases screened, 7 are full  mutated males and 5 carrier females for FRAXA and no cases of  FRAXE has been identified. 5 individuals who harbored methylation full  mutations for FRAXA were studied for mRNA expressions using RT  PCR and found 2 individuals expressing 2 5 fold increase, 1 individual  expressing almost equal and 2 individuals showing less expression in comparison with the FMR1 mRNA levels of normal individuals .  This shows that full mutations always do not necessarily focus the transcriptional silencing of the FMR1 gene .",2006

Non coding repeats expansions and pre mRNA  processing defects,P0704.,Pagani,"ICGEB, Human Molecular Genetics, Trieste, Italy","Transcribed non coding sequences contribute to a correct mRNA  formation by providing cis acting elements that regulate pre mRNA  processing. These sequences are a significant source of human  variability and have a mutation potential whose role in causing diseases is largely unexplored . We focused on non coding GAA repeat  expansions in the first intron of the frataxin gene associated with  Friedreich ataxia, to unravel basic and pathological mechanisms of pre mRNA processing . Using hybrid minigenes assay we showed that  the repeat expansion affect splice site selection in a position dependent manner  . Repeats insertion downstream a reported exon resulted in its  complete exclusion from the mature mRNA . Further insertion at the  3 end or insertions in the upstream intron had no effect on splice site selection . Insertion of control TTC sequences did not affect splicing .  In addition, the repeats placed in the first intron of a hybrid minigene,  at a location comparable to that found in frataxin gene, unexpectedly  resulted in the absence of mature mRNAs in a position dependent  manner. This data indicates, for the first time, an association between  GAA non coding repeats and aberrant pre mRNA processing and  suggests an alteration of the coordination between transcription and pre mRNA processing . Thus the current wisdom that ascribes the defect to a transcription block may have to be revisited . The elucidation  of the basic molecular mechanisms that affect pre mRNA processing  in relationship with non coding repeat expansions will provide a useful  insight into a new area with potential for therapeutic intervention in the  treatment of this severe degenerative disease",2006

Methylation of C5position of cytosine  residues in DNA has a great importance in epigenetic silencing .  A growing number of human diseases have been found to be associated with aberrant DNA methylation . Facioscapulohumeral  muscular dystrophy (FSHD, OMIM 158900) is an autosomal dominant neuromuscular disorder  . A contraction of the polymorphic D4Z4 repeat  array located at 4q35 locus is associated with the disease . Several  observations suggest an epigenetic aetiology in FSHD that causes the transcriptional deregulation of genes close to D4Z4 . Van Overveld at al .  (2003) has tested this hypothesis by checking the methylation status of  the proximal D4Z4 unit at 4q35 and hypomethylation in DNA samples of FSHD patients was detected . Aim of our study was to analyze the methylation state of D4Z4 repeats in 20 Hungarian FSHD patients .  Samples from 20 healthy and 10 non FSHD muscular dystrophy patients were also examined . Genomic DNA was isolated from  peripheral blood lymphocytes and digested with methylation sensitive restriction endonucleases (BsaAI and FseI) . Southern blot analysis  was performed using P32 labelled p13E 11 probe, specific for 4q35.  The intensity of the signals was measured and data were analysed by  a Mann Whitney U test. Significant difference was detected between  the methylation values of samples originating from FSHD patients  and healthy individuals, as well as FSHD patients and other muscular dystrophy patients .

FXTAS was described in fragile X families, with  a suggested age related penetrance higher that 75% in male carriers of 80 years or older  . The incidence of  FMR1  premutated carriers in  general population is relatively high and therefore FXTAS might explain a considerably number of sporadic cases of late onset ataxias .

Pediatric cases present with transient periods of muscle weakness, fatigue, and symptoms of neuromuscular irritability  . The causative  gene, SLC12A3 , encodes the thiazide sensitive NaCl co transporter  (NCC) in the distal convoluted tubule of the nephron . More than 100  different loss of function mutations in the SLC12A3  gene have been  reported . In the past few years DNA samples of 139 Gitelman syndrome patients  were analyzed by direct sequencing of all 26 exons of the SLC12A3   gene. In total 76 different mutations were identified, 44 of which have not been reported in literature before . These novel mutations contained  mostly missense mutations (30), but also splice site mutations (9), nonsense mutations (3), and deletions (2) were detected .In 71 patients two mutations were found . In another 20 patients one mutation was detected . In summary, in 65% of patients the diagnosis  Gitelman syndrome was supported, and 162/278 (58%) of the alleles  have been identified. Our results indicate that scanning the entire coding sequence of the  SLC12A3  gene leads to the identification of the majority of mutations in Gitelman Syndrome . Since heterozygous exonic deletions are not  detected with the currently used protocol, we plan to analyze the  incidence of exon deletions in our patient population by multiplex  ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). The detection  of a homozygous deletion of two SLC12A3 exons in one patient  demonstrates that exonic deletions significantly contribute to Gitelman syndrome .",2006

Hereditary Angioedema (HAE) (OMIM: 106100), an autosomal  dominant disease with incomplete penetrance occurs due to mutations  in the C1INH  gene . C1INH  deficiency may result in recurrent episodes  of acute, local, circumscribed edema of the skin or mucosa .Five years ago, we started a routine genetic testing protocol for HAE .  Over the years, we have analysed DNA samples from almost 400 patients suspicious for HAE . About 30% of our patients present with amino acid substitutions . Since there are some known polymorphisms in the gene which also lead to the substitution of amino acids (e .g .  V458M) it is impossible to predict the causality of the alterations offhand . Therefore, we have tested for the functional effect on C1INH  activity of a series of C1INH mutations in a recombinant expression system (HEK 293 cells) . Most substitutions studied so far resulted in  an almost complete loss of inhibitor activity of the recombinant proteins while some mutations (e .g . A 21V and S233T) retained a reduced activity when compared to wildtype protein . Since the crystal structure of C1INH  has not been elucidated yet,  we used data from other serpins to build an analogous 3 D model of the protein . This model was used to predict whether the observed  amino acid substitutions introduce significant changes in the protein structure . In summary, recombinant expression of mutated C1INH protein is a  useful tool to characterize the role of individual amino acid residues for C1INH activity  .",2006

Screening of the  four main genes ( SHH , ZIC2 , SIX3  and TGIF ) by DHPLC sequencing  and QMPSF revealed point mutations in 18% and microdeletions in 7% of HPE cases . This relative high frequency of microdeletions in the  main HPE genes incited us to search for candidate HPE genes using deletion cartography  . As two of the main HPE genes and six other candidate loci are located  in subtelomeres, we first searched for microrearrangements in these regions using SALSA MLPA kits (MRC Holland) .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease6 This analysis in 100 foetus and 140 live born infants with HPE revealed  subtelomeric rearrangements in known HPE loci (7q, 18p, 1q, 20p,  21q) but also in novel loci (1p, 5q, 7p, 8p, 9q, 17q, 18q and 22q) . Some  of these deleted regions (7p, 7q, 1p) were narrowed by quantitative PCR . A number of samples consisted of an association between a duplication  and a deletion in two chromosomal subtelomeres, like (7pdup;7qdel).  The finding of such double rearrangements in a same patient reinforces  the multigenic and multihit origin already evocated for HPE and will also  offer another explanation for the wide phenotypic spectrum described in this developmental disorder  . So the search for microrearrangements must be integrated into the  diagnosis of HPE, and the first results obtained by CGH array prove  the relevance of this pangenomic approach to identify loci of novel candidate genes .",2006

Despite intensive research, the pathophysiology of this association remains conjectural . To unravel the  mechanism involved we performed gene expression profiling in aorta of diet induced hyperhomocysteinemic rats . Methods and Results  Rats were fed a high methionine diet in  combination with a low B vitamin diet to induce hyperhomocysteinemia .  Application of oligonucleotide arrays demonstrated that the modifying  subunit of glutamate cysteine ligase (GCLM), which is involved in glutathione synthesis, was 2 .7 fold up regulated in the aorta of HHcy rats compared to control rats . In addition, we showed by HPLC  analysis that total levels of the anti oxidant glutathione were increased in serum of HHcy rats . As GCLM has been shown to be up regulated  in conditions of oxidative stress, we hypothesized that a hampered up regulation of GCLM increases the risk of vascular diseases . To test this  hypothesis we examined a functional single nucleotide polymorphism  (SNP) in the human GCLM gene ( 588 C>T) in a case control study consisting of 185 venous thrombosis patients and 500 controls . We  demonstrated that the presence of the  588 T allele increased the risk  of venous thrombosis more than 2 fold when also homocysteine levels  were elevated (OR 2.5 [1.04 6.11]), which confirmed our hypothesis. Conclusions  These data suggest that adequate functioning of GCLM  is required as a compensatory mechanism for protection against the  adverse oxidative effects of elevated homocysteine on the vascular  wall, and thus describe a previously undefined role for GCLM in homocysteine toxicity  .",2006

Sequence analysis may also  reveal mutations that could explain LHON in the 10 families where no primary mutation was found . We are also looking for mutations  that might contribute to the low penetrance of LHON in the 11 families  where only sporadic cases were identified. We also aim to find out  which sequence variants might account for the high penetrance of the  MTND4 /11778G>A and MTND1 /3460G>A mutations in haplogroup J .",2006

The aim of  our study was to investigate the process that underlies the platelet hyperaggregation . We formed a group of 14 volunteers with known  genotypes of Leu33Pro GPIIIa: 8   33LeuLeu carriers, 5   33ProLeu carriers and 1 carrier of 33ProPro . This group was analyzed on  spontaneous platelet aggregation, platelet aggregation in response to ADP and quantity of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors per platelet . For  detection of the Leu33Pro variants of the GPIIIa gene the polymerase Molecular and biochemical basis of disease chain reaction and endonuclease digestion with MspI were used,  the spontaneous platelet aggregation and ADP induced platelet  aggregation was measured by photometric method and quantity of the  GPIIb/IIIa receptors per platelet was measured by flow cytometry with  monoclonal antibodies . Mean GPIIb/IIIa quantity on platelet surface was (61330Â±2404) . The maximum GPIIb/IIIa quantity per platelet was 82698, while the minimum GPIIb/IIIa quantity per platelet was 50529 .  The GPIIb/IIIa quantity per platelet correlated with spontaneous platelet aggregation (R=0 .56, p=0 .07) and ADP induced platelet aggregation (R=0 .52, p=0 .07) . Furthermore, spontaneous platelet aggregation depended on the GPIIIa genotype: (1 .74Â±0 .22) and (2 .32Â±0 .27)  for LeuLeu genotype and LeuPro/ProPro genotypes, respectively  (p=0.06). These results donât achieve statistical significance may be because of small analyzing group and further studies are required . In  conclusion, the data obtained in this pilot study have shown that the  platelet hyperaggregation may depend on two factors   quantity of the  GPIIb/IIIa receptors per platelet and quality of the GPIIb/IIIa receptors due to Leu33Pro GPIIIa genetic variants .",2006

Besides acting as a classic transcriptional factor, this proteins also are involved in chromatin remodelling complexes . This gene family encodes zinc finger DNA binding proteins. All the  members of Ikaros family produce multiple isoforms via alternative mRNA splicing . Some of them are dominant negative isoforms with a non functional DNA binding domain . Those isoforms have been found  in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and may have a role in the development of leukemias or lymphomas . However, some of this dominant negative isoforms are also found in healthy people . Our group have characterized new Helios isoforms in haematopoietic and non haematopoietic cellular lines . Several of this new isoforms have novel alternatives exons located in differents introns (He .1+2a,He .1+3a,He .1+5a), Moreover we have cloned isoforms that present a  criptic process site in the exÃ³n 3 (He.1v y He.Î6v) and a new dominat negative isoforma named He .S, which is generated by a novel splicing mechanism . We have studied the intracellular localization and the protein protein interaction of some of these isoforms . Moreover, we have analized the Histones acetilation status . Our results suggest that He .1v plays an  important role in the histones acetilation, specifically in the Histone H3  and confirms that this proteins are involved in remodelling complexes.  The comparative study of differents isoforms will allow us to know  more about the role of this family in normal lymphoid development and its possible implication in tumor development .",2006

The parentsâ analysis showed that only the mothers were the mutation c .550delA carriers  and the paternity was confirmed with probability 99.999 in both cases.  This data draw the suspicion that the fathers should transmit deletions  larger than one base and we assumed the presence of deletions covering the whole exon 4 .To check this hypothesis we analyzed both patients on RNA level . The transcribed fragments were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis .  The obtained abnormally transcribed fragment, smaller than the normal one, was extracted from the agarose gel and sequenced .  A large deletion covering exons from 2 to 8 was detected in both patients . The same deletion has been previous reported [Joncourt et al ., 2003, ESHG], which shows that it could be a frequent cause  of LGMD2A and most probably it is due to independent mutational events . We hypothesize that such deletions might not be a rare event  in this gene, but using the routine sequence analysis exon by exon they are missed . Both our patients carry exactly the same mutations, but the clinical  manifestation of the disease differed significantly. One of them (male)  stopped walking at the age of 17, while the other (female) was still ambulant at the age of 21 .",2006

The most frequently found mutation for type I lissencephaly is  the complete deletion of the LIS1 gene, detectable by fluorescence  in situ hybridization (FISH) . In contrast, intragenic deletions in the  LIS1 gene detected by Southern blotting, have been less frequently  reported (about 10% of cases) . Using DNA sequencing of the coding  region to perform mutation analysis in the LIS1 gene we have detected  8 single nucleotide mutations, 6 of which have not previously been described .

LMNA  encodes two major isoforms: Lamin A, obtained through  post translational processing of its Prelamin A precursor, and Lamin C . The mechanism underlying most lamin associated progeroid  disorders is the toxic intranuclear accumulation of truncated or wild  type farnesylated Prelamin A, either due to intrinsic Prelamin A defects  hampering its post translational processing or to the absence/loss of  function of ZMPSTE24, one of its key post translational processing enzymes . We report eight novel ZMPSTE24  mutations: five homozygous  nonsense or splicing null mutations in patients affected with typical  RD, one homozygous loss of function mutation in a patient affected  with a complex progeroid syndrome combining premature aging and  a severe skeletal muscle dystrophy, and two compound heterozygous  ZMPSTE24  sequence variations in a child presenting with progeroid  features, lipodystrophy and insulin resistance .

Approximately 30 mutations have been detected world wide; in Finland,  however, all the patients (n=38) share the same homozygous mutation, 1181 2A  >T  .

Some patients also develop anaemia, pulmonary alveolar proteinosis and immunological abnormalities . The symptoms vary greatly, both within families and amongst patients affected by the same mutation . To unravel the possible molecular mechanisms behind the clinical  symptoms unexplained by the primary mutation, the gene expression  profiles of LPI patients were studied using microarray technology.  Whole blood RNA (PAXgene) was extracted from 13 Finnish patients and 10 healthy age  and sex matched controls .

In Machado Joseph disease (MJD), although the range  limits have been broadened with new allele sizes described in different  populations, intermediate alleles with 45 to 61 CAGs are very rare,  and their role on the generation of de novo  full expansions is still  unknown . To gain insight into this question, we compared intragenic haplotypes  of four intermediate alleles with those found in normal (n=18)  and expanded (n=10) chromosomes. We have identified 10 new  polymorphic sites, six of which were already analysed, as were three SNPs previously described . The three intermediate alleles associated with an abnormal phenotype  shared the H1: TCAAGC INT CAC haplotype, whereas an allele with 51  repeats, described as non pathogenic and stable upon transmission,  had the distinct haplotype H2: CTAGGT INT GCA   the most common among normal chromosomes (33%) . Expanded chromosomes displayed both haplotypes . The fact that only H1 was shared by the intermediate alleles associated  with a disease phenotype, urged us to study this lineage, in further  detail, in both intermediate and normal alleles, to search for cis acting  factors potentially involved in repeat instability  .

They include chromosome abnormalities, Y chromosome microdeletions  and certain mutations in the cystic fibrosis gene CFTR. Testing for  these alterations is important to establish the correct diagnosis and  then to assess the risk for the pregnacy  . Modern techniques of assited  reproduction can help achieve pregnancy, but they also increase the risk of having an affected child . In this study we analyzed infertile male  patients, who were potential candidates for ICSI (intracytoplasmic sperm injection) .Methods . We collected peripheral venous blood from male patients who were diagnosed with azoospermia or oligozoospermia . Analysis  included karyotyping, detection of Y chromosome microdeletions of  18 loci in 4 multiplex PCR reactions, detection of ÎF508 and R117H  mutations with allele specific PCR and detection of 5T/7T/9T alleles in intron 8 of the CFTR gene with the dot blot method .Results . A total of 125 patients were included in the study  . 20 patients  (16%) were carriers of a major chromosome abnormality which mostly involved sex chromosomes, 6 patients (4 .8%) were carriers of Y chromosome microdeletions, 8 patients (6 .4%) were heterozygotes for  the ÎF508 mutation, 4 patients (3.2%) were carriers of R117H mutation and in 12 patients (9 .6%) we detected the 5T allele .Conclusions . In our sample of patients the most important genetic  factor is chromosome abnormality followed by mutations in the CFTR gene . High frequency of CFTR mutations indicates that an extended  mutation analysis of this gene may be needed to fully estimate risk for  cystic fibrosis in offspring",2006

It manifests as a hypermetabolic crisis triggered  by commonly used inhalational anesthetics and a particular paralyzing drug . Malignant hyperthermia susceptibility (MHS) is a dominantly  inherited predisposition to MH that can be diagnosed by using an  invasive diagnostics test on excised muscle bundles, the in vitro contracture test (IVCT) . This test, based on the differential contractile  response of normal and MH muscle to caffeine and halothane,  differentiates between MHS and MH normal individuals and defines a third MH equivocal (MHE) group of unclear status . Mutations in the calcium channel of sarcoplasmic reticulum, ryanodine receptor type 1 (RYR1 at 19q13) are the major cause of MHS . We  sought to develop a reliable genetic screening strategy based on  efficient and relatively inexpansive mutation detection procedures. Molecular genetic test has been based on RT PCR approach with use  of total RNA extracted from muscles of individuals (N=50) diagnosed as MHS by IVCT  . The mutational hot spot RYR1 cDNA regions were  amplified in 9 overlapping fragmants and direct sequenced. Known  mutations or novel amino acid substitutions were identified in 25% of studied patients . Relatives of individuals who have been found to have a  mutation causative for MH were diagnosed by subsequent detection of the same mutation in blood extracted DNA .The improvement of RYR1  mutation identification in MHS individuals combined with subsequent  noninvasive genetic testing in family members suggests our strategy  for molecular diagnostics of malignant hypertermia susceptibility in the future .",2006

Despite considerable progress in pharmacotherapy of  epilepsy, more than 30% of the patients are resistant to antiepileptic drugs . In recent years, overexpression of multidrug transporters in blood brain barrier, have frequently been investigated . Although some  studies support evidence of an association between the polymorphisms  in these genes and the drug resistant epilepsy, there is also some data that indicates there is no association between these two . One of the  frequently investigated genes that is found to be responsible for drug resistance in epilepsy is multidrug resistance 1 (MDR1) gene . Instead  of single nucleotide polymorphism detection, haplotype analysis  of multiple SNPs in the genes involved in drug resistant epilepsy is preferantial . Therefore in this study we aimed to screen the MDR1 gene  for the most common polymorphisms C3435T and G2677AT in drug resistant epilepsy patients and control group . Besides analysing these  two polymorphisms in MDR1 gene, we also evaluated family histories, treatment regimes and the backgrounds of the patients . Thirty nine  drug resistant epilepsy and 92 control samples were involved in the study  . The polymorphism detection was performed by PCR RFLP  and Pyrosequencing from which the same results were obtained .  However, we found no associations between C3435T and G2677AT polymorphisms and multidrug resistant epilepsy  . Haplotype analysis  including these 2 polymorphisms showed no significant association.  As a conclusion these 2 MDR1 polymorphisms are considered not to  be responsible for the responsiveness to either different or combined antiepileptic drug therapy in our study group .",2006

The disease  has been mapped to Xp11 by linkage analysis in a four generation family with 5 affected males, previously  . The detected C/A substitution  segregated with the disease and was absent in 1500 tested control X chromosomes . It causes an aberrant splicing of exon 5 resulting in  a reduced level of wild type transcript and an elevated level of an exon 5 lacking variant in the patient . Real time experiments showed that the  amount of wild type transcript in the patient was reduced to one third  as compared to healthy controls, whereas the amount of the exon 5 lacking variant was 11 fold up regulated in the patient . Additionally the  amount of a third transcript variant harbouring a truncated form of exon 5 was 14 times higher in the patient as compared to controls . Finally,  in vitro  splicing experiments demonstrated that the silent mutation is  associated with the aberrant splicing event . Our result is in concordance  with the hypothesis that a prominent proportion of the approximately 260 MRX entities might be caused by unique aberrations . Furthermore,  aberrations in ubiquitously expressed MRX genes often seem to cause  a phenotype restricted to the brain, which might be more vulnerable to such changes than other tissues .",2006

To verify predictions that the entire  intracellular adenosylcobalamin metabolic pathway existed and was functional, the kinetic properties of the C . elegans mmcm 1were examined . RNA interference against mmcm 1, mmab 1, mmaa 1  in the presence of propionic acid revealed a chemical phenotype of  increased methylmalonic acid; deletion mutants of mmcm 1, mmab  1 and mce 1 displayed reduced C14 propionate incorporation into macromolecules . The mmcm 1 deletion mutant produced increased  amounts of methylmalonic acid in the culture medium, proving that a functional block in the pathway caused metabolite accumulation .  Lentiviral delivery of the C. elegans mmcm 1 into fibroblasts derived  from a patient with muto class methylmalonic acidemia and cells from  a Mut knock out mouse could partially restore propionate flux. The C.  elegans mce 1 deletion mutant demonstrates for the first time that a  lesion at the racemase step of methylmalonyl CoA metabolism can  functionally impair flux through the methylmalonyl CoA mutase pathway;  this suggests that malfunction of MCEE may cause methylmalonic acidemia in humans .

The proband had deafness while his mother had no  evidence of hearing loss . The mutation was found in heteroplasmic  form in the maternal grandmother and in her niece, who are monozygotic twins and one of them has deafness .

Methylation of individual CpG cytosines was extensive  within exons 2 14 while CpG cytosines in exon 1 were completely  unmethylated . All transitional mutations at CpG sites were located  between exons 2 and 14 . Non methylation at CpG sites correlated with  the absence of transitional mutations in exon 1 .For molecular diagnosis Sequence Analysis, is recommended .",2006

In this study, kinetic analysis of mitochondrial  respiratory chain complex I enzyme (measured as NADH ferricyanide  reductase) was performed on intact mitochondria isolated from fresh skeletal muscle in MS patients (n=10) and control subjects (n=11) .  Mitochondrial DNA common deletion and deletions were also tested  in MS patients. Our findings showed that complex I activities were  significantly reduced (P=0.007) in patients compared with control.  However, we could not find deletion in mtDNA of patients with MS. The  presupposition of relationship between MS and mitochondrial disorders  is due to predominant maternal transmission of MS in affected parent  child pairs, pathoaetiological role of respiratory chain dysfunction in  multisystem disorders and important role of it in neurodegenerative  disorders, a number of patients such as LHON or other mtDNA  abnormality with developed neurological symptoms indistinguishable  from MS and similarity of clinical symptoms in mitochondrial disorders to those of MS .

Loss of  immunological tolerance to self antigens seems to be a common feature  of autoimmune disorders. X linked self antigens could be influenced  by X chromosome inactivation pattern, and contribute to the skewed female:male ratio (2:1) in the frequency of MS . A high frequency of  skewed X inactivation was recently reported in females with autoimmune  thyroid disease, and skewed X inactivation has also been described in women with the autoimmune connective tissue disease scleroderma . In  order to investigate a similar potential role of X inactivation in MS, we  compared the X inactivation pattern in 125 female MS patients (aged  22 53, median 39 years) with a control group consisting of 117 blood donors (age 19 55, median 38 years) . The MS patients were divided  into two subgroups according to disease course; primary progressive  (PP, n=17) or relapsing remitting (RR, n=108, including 24 females with a secondary progressive course) . We found no difference in the  median degree of skewing between PP patients (median 60%), RR patients (median 64%) and controls (median 65%)(p= 0 .46 median test) . The frequency of skewed X inactivation (>80%) was higher in the PP patients (23 .5%) compared to the RR patients (14 .8%) and  controls (12.0%), but the difference was not statistically significant. We  conclude that X chromosome inactivation pattern does not seem to be  more skewed in MS patients than in controls and does not explain the skewed female to male frequency ratio of MS .",2006

We have recently  established that heterozygous mutations in the MYCN  gene on  chromosome 2p23 p24 are causative for the disorder in 15 unrelated FS families . All mutations were located in exon 3 and disrupt both  the full length protein as well as a novel shortened MYCN isoform,  denoted ÎMYCN. The MYCN  oncogene consists of three exons . The canonical MYCN  protein is produced by the use of an ATG start codon in exon 2 that is preceded by an Internal Ribosome Entry Site . Alternative transcripts  lacking exon 2 encode ÎMYCN, an N terminally truncated MYCN isoform produced by initiation of translation in exon 1 . Since all  previous mutations affected both the MYCN and ÎMYCN isoforms, it  was unknown whether the pathophysiological mechanism was caused by disruption of either one or both of the protein isoforms . Here we  describe the identification of 10 additional heterozygous mutations in FS families . While most of the mutations are located in the common  exon 3, frameshift mutations were identified in exon 2 in three unrelated  families. In addition, a polymorphism was identified in exon 1, which  disrupts the predicted open reading frame of the ÎMYCN isoform.  Taken together these results demonstrate that multiple aspects of early  embryogenesis, postnatal brain growth and tumorigenesis in humans  are tightly regulated by dosage of canonical MYCN protein and that  heterozygous disruption of ÎMYCN is not associated with any obvious phenotypic abnormalities .",2006

One sister suffered from cataract since  the age of 40 and one brother died unexpectedly of cardiac arrest at the age of 67 . Mild muscular symptoms came to attention in the next  generation and were diagnosed as fibromyalgia, except one case with  recognized myotonic dystrophy, where a confirmational Southern blot  analysis indicated 130 500 CTG repeats in one DMPK  allele . The  affected patient had a grandchild with a severe juvenile form . One  daughter of the cataract patient developed myotonic dystrophy in the presence of a relatively low number (53 61) of CTG repeats . Of the  offspring of the patient with cardiac arrest, which could represent a phenocopy, four individuals underwent molecular testing . All of them  exhibited an allele with only 40 CTG repeats in DMPK  . It has been  established that myotonic dystrophy is caused by DMPK  alleles with  more than 50 CTG repeats, while the normal number is 5 37 repeats .  Intermediate numbers of CTG repeats between 38 and 49 has been considered stable, although rare . The study of this kindred suggests  that an allele with 40 CTG repeats only has been able to expand, and  that anticipation resulted in a severe phenotype in two generations only and a severe juvenile form after another two generations . We  conclude that the so called intermediate number of CTG repeats must  be considered potentially unstable, and that this has consequences for genetic counseling .Molecular and biochemical basis of disease6",2006

Phenotype studies of Lmx1b /   mice revealed nail and  patellar anomalies similar to human NPS, which contributed to the  identification of mutations in the LIM homeodomain encoding LMX1B   gene as the genetic defect . It is as yet unclear why heterozygous LMX1B   mutations cause NPS in humans, whereas Lmx1b  heterozygous mice  are completely normal. The hypothesis that haploinsufficiency is the  main mechanism underlying dominant inheritance in human NPS is  based on the fact that the same phenotypic variability is observed in  individuals with LMX1B missense, nonsense, frameshift or splice site  mutations and that the range and severity of symptoms varies both within and between families . This assumption is supported by the  lack of any dominant negative effect observed by in vitro  experiments  studying missense and truncation LMX1B  mutations . By MLPA  analysis with specific probes for the different exons 1 8 of LMX1B ,  we found a deletion of the entire gene in two unrelated individuals  with NPS and a deletion of exons 3 8 in another patient from a series  of 3 classic NPS families (3/8; 38%) in which no mutation could be  detected by sequencing LMX1B  . The phenotype of these individuals  is comparable with our previously reported families in which LMX1B   missense mutations were identified. Further characterisation of the size  of the deletions is presently being performed. This first identification  of entire LMX1B  deletions strongly confirms the hypothesis that  haploinsufficiency is the principal pathogenic mechanism of NPS.",2006

In six of the eight patients studied, two  mutations could be identified in each patient, a result that is expected for an autosomal recessive disease . Four of these are homozygotes,  probably because of consanguinity of the parents: two carry a  nonsense mutation, one patient a frameshift mutation and one a splice site mutation .

Substitutions in the first 200 residues  are non lethal and have variable effect thereafter, unrelated to folding or helix stability domains . Two exclusively lethal regions (691 823 and  910 964) align with Major Ligand Binding Regions, suggesting crucial  interactions of collagen monomers or fibrils with integrins, MMPs,  fibronectin and COMP. Mutations in COL1A2 are predominantly non lethal (80%) . Lethal substitutions are located in 8 regularly spaced clusters along the chain, supporting a regional model .

Unlike Î±1(I), recurrences at the same site  in Î±2(I) are generally concordant for outcome. Splice site mutations  in COL1A1 are rarely lethal; they often lead to frameshifts and the  mild OI type I phenotype.

Increasing evidence suggests that genetic factors play an  important role in the pathogenesis of Parkinson disease (PD) . To date,  genetic analyses have detected linkage to eleven chromosomal regions  and have identified seven causative genes. Early onset Parkinson  disease (EOPD) may be associated with different mutations in PARK2  gene, from point mutations to complex rearrangements including deletion and/or multiplication of complete exons . Exon rearrangements  occur with the rate from 33% to 66% of the total amount of mutations  in PARK2 gene. It is therefore a question of scientific interest and  necessity to develop a new cost efficient, sensitive and fast method of detecting exon rearrangements . In the present study, we applied  TaqMan Real time PCR method to analyze and assess the frequency of deletions and duplications in PARK2 gene . We selected primers and  probes for exons 2 12 and examined 63 EOPD patients from Russia (age of onset less than 50 years) for exon deletions and duplications .  Exon rearrangements were detected in 14% of the EOPD patients in exons 2 7, being most frequent in exons 3 and 4 . The results of our  work let us presume that this method can be applied to mass screening  of deletions and duplications in PARK2 gene in patients with Parkinson disease .",2006

To explore the function of Pelo in  mammals, we have disrupted the mouse Pelo gene and shown that the  gene is essential for mouse embryonic development . Development of homozygous embryos arrests about 6 .5 7 .5 days after conception . The  failure of ICM and survival of trophoblast in Pelo /  blastocysts indicate  that the lethality of Pelo is due to defect cell proliferation . Increase  of polyploidy at E7 .5 can be directly responsible for the arrested  development and suggests that Pelo is required for the maintenance of the genomic stability  . Approaches to establish Pelo / cells failed  to detect a Pelo deficient cells. These results suggest that Pelo is  essential for cell viability and cellular proliferation. Using Pelo specific antibody, we found that Pelo is associated with cytoskeleton . Western  blot analysis revealed the presence of Pelo is in the cytoskeleton and membrane fractions but not in nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions .  These results demonstrate a possible role of Pelo in cytoskeleton organization and cell motility  . Using yeast two hybrid system, we  identified several putative interaction partners of Pelota which are associated with the cytoskeleton .

AS are coded by  degenerated codons (GCN) and characterized by rapidly evolving  nucleotidic sequences with high rates of expansions and contractions:  the longer and more pure the sequence, the higher the length polymorphism of the AS in the population . These genic sequences are  frequent in transcription factors and have recently been proposed as facilitators of evolution . Hitherto, polyalanine expansions and contractions have been ascribed to 9 human diseases, either autosomal dominant or X linked .  Considering both that : i) AS are coded by mixed (GCN)n codons and,  ii) that transmission over generations is stable, a polymerase slippage mechanism is unlikely  . A mechanism of unequal allelic homologous  recombination has thus been proposed . Worth noting, expansions  have been identified in asymptomatic parents for 3/9 disease causing  genes namely HOXD13 , ZIC2  and PHOX2B  for which mutations  account for synpolydactyly, holoprosencephaly and congenital central hypoventilation syndromes respectively  . In the latest case, 5% of the  asymptomatic parents from our series harbor an alanine expansion in their leucocytes . We tested carrier parents either by cloning the PCR fragment when a heterozygous SNP was present or by QMPSF  . We  show that, as speculated, carrier parents are somatic mosaics for the mutation . However, instead of the 3 alleles (wild type, expansion and  contraction) expected according to the mutational model, only 2 are observed in mosaic parents (wild type and expansion) . Therefore,  an alternative mutational model to generate alanine expansions and contractions will be proposed .",2006

ADPKD is principally linked to two genes, PKD1 and PKD2 . The pathogenesis of renal  cyst formation is currently thought to involve dysregulated epithelial  cell proliferation and differentiation, alteration in membrane proteins  polarity and abnormal fluid accumulation. The molecular mechanism  of cystogenesis originating from mutations in these two genes has not been fully elucidated . A recent report implicated polycystin 2 in  the regulation of epithelial cell proliferation. Specifically, the authors  suggested that PC2 over expression suppresses cell proliferation through inhibition of the p21/Cdk2 pathway  . To better understand the  role of PC 2 in epithelial cell proliferation, we utilized various cellular  models generated by stable expression of mutated (R742X and 1 702) and wild type PKD2 . In contrast to the previous data, over expression  of wild type or mutated polycystin 2 in two different cell lines does not affect cellular growth . Interestingly, primary renal epithelial cells  from transgenic rats generated by expression of the 1 702 PKD2 have elevated levels of the proliferation markers, PCNA and c myc . However,  in both primary cells and stable cell lines, wild  type or mutated PC 2 do not alter p21 levels and Cdk2 activity  . Collectively, these data  suggest that in our models, PC 2 regulates epithelial cell proliferation in a p21/Cdk2 independent manner  . In addition, these results highlight  the fact that inactivation of PC 2 is probably not the only factor involved in the abnormal proliferation observed in cystic epithelial cells .",2006

Wijmenga2, H. Omran4, M.  Witt1,5","1Institute of Human Genetics, Div"," Retinitis pigmentosa GTPase regulator (RPGR) protein has been  localized to photoreceptors connecting cilia of rods and cones and in the transitional zone of cilia . Mutations in the  RPGR gene  on Xp21 .1,  responsible for 70% of the X linked retinitis pigmentosa (RP), have  been reported to be associated with retinitis pigmentosa, hearing loss, and bronchosinusitis . Recently, a mutation in  RPGR  has been reported  in a family with overlapping phenotypes of the X linked RP and primary  ciliary dyskinesia (PCD) . Here, we analyzed the coding sequence and  intron/exon boundaries of the RPGR in a large Polish RP/PCD family  .  A missense mutation (G52R) found in the last nucleotide of RPGR   exon 2 is an example of an exonic mutation disrupting the splicing  process and leading to exon skipping. Immunostaining with fluorescent detection was performed on epithelial cells from nasal brushing .  Predictably, RPGR was not present in the transitional zone of cilia in the patient . Another antibody, targeting a component of inner dynein arms, revealed defect of those structures in patientâs cilia . These  results indicate that RPGR plays an important role in the transport of inner dynein arms components into the cilium . Defect of this process may cause overlapping symptoms of X linked RP and PCD .",2006
molecular analysis of the cPY1B1 gene in primary congenital glaucoma in a sample of mexican patients,P0799.,"Messina , L. Gonzalez, R. Rivera, S. Kofman, S.

The principal molecular defect in most  of PCG subjects occurs in the CYP1B1 gene, which is also expressed in the anterior chamber angle of the eye . CYP1B1 enzyme is able to metabolize steroid hormones and participates in tissue development . In  the present study, we analyze the CYP1B1 gene of 25 non related and sporadic and/or familial cases with PCG . Onset of clinical symptoms ranged from birth to 12 months (mean 4 .5 months), the male:female  ratio was 10:4 while ocular findings were similar in all patients except  for two cases of difficult control. Consanguinity was observed in 3 families . DNA sequencing analysis of the CYP1B1 gene showed  no missense or nonsense mutations in 21 cases, only polymorphic changes similar to those observed in normal controls were found . We observed four novel mutations in the rest of cases . These data allow  conclude that most cases with PCG are not consequence of mutations in the CYP1B1 gene in our population, at least in the analyzed sample .  This analysis is very important in diagnosis and genetic counseling of PCG in this population .",2006

On the basis of previously gathered genetic and biochemical data, we  proposed a model that splits NS  and leukemia associated PTPN11  mutations into two major classes of activating lesions with differential perturbing effects on development and hematopoiesis . To test this  model, we characterized biochemically a panel of SHP 2 mutants  recurring in NS (T42A, A72S, T73I, E76D, E139D, I282V, N308D and  M504V) and leukemia (A72V and E76K), and performed molecular  dynamic simulations to determine the structural effects of selected mutants (A72S, A72V, E76D and E76K) . Our results demonstrate that  NS causative mutations have less potency for promoting SHP 2 gain of function than do leukemia associated ones . Simulations provide, for  the first time, direct evidence supporting the hypothesis that mutations  leading to strong basal activation, as observed among the leukemia  associated mutants, perturb the interaction between the N SH2 and  PTP domains, and describe the molecular interactions leading to the displacement of the N SH2 loop from the PTP active site . Biochemical  data demonstrate that the recurrent LS causing Y279C and T468M  amino acid substitutions engender loss of SHP 2 catalytic activity,  identifying a previously unrecognized behaviour for this class of  missense mutations and suggesting that these mutants interfere with normal SHP 2 function by a dominant negative mechanism .

The prevalence of RP in the US and Europe is approximately from 1/3500 to 1/4000 . It can be inherited as an autosomal dominant, autosomal recessive, or X linked recessive disorder  . In the autosomal  dominant form (adRP), which comprises about 25% of total cases,  approximately 30% of families have mutations in the gene encoding the  rod photoreceptor specific protein rhodopsin. More than 90 different  rhodopsin point mutations have been identified, affecting 1 in 3500,  or an estimated 2 million people worldwide . The RHO gene maps to  human chromosome 3q21, consists of 5 exons . We have carried out  mutations screening of this gene by SSCP metod with further direct sequencing . We analyzed 5 exons of RHO gene in 119 unrelated  patients with RP and their relatives and 77 unaffected individuals from Bashkortostan . Patients were examined clinically and with visual  function tests. We have identified sequence change IVS3+4cât, and its frequency more in patients (0 .36) than in controls (0 .1) .

Purpose: To characterize the functional and clinical consequences of a  novel rhodopsin (RHO) mutation in comparison to a known pathogenic variant at the same amino acid position . Methods: 38 retinitis pigmentosa (RP) patients were screened for  mutations in RHO  by direct sequencing . Patients were characterized  clinically using visual acuity testing, slit lamp examination, fundoscopy,  Goldmann perimetry, dark adaptometry, and ERG recordings (ISCEV standard) . Structural analyses of the RHO protein were performed with the Swiss Pdb Viewer program . Results: We identified a novel RHO  mutation (G90V) in a three  generation Swiss family  . No additional mutation was found in this  family in four other genes associated with RP  . The clinical picture is  compatible with RP  . Interestingly, a different amino acid substitution at  the same position in RHO,  G90D, leads to night blindness instead of RP  by constitutive low level activation of the phototransduction cascade (Sieving et al ., 1995) . To elucidate whether the different amino acid  substitutions have specific effects on the 3D structure of RHO, we did in silico  simulations of the wild type, G90V and G90D variants of RHO .  The overlay of the three RHO structures showed different distortions of amino acid 90 in variant G90D and G90V  . Furthermore, the aspartic  acid side chain in the G90D shifts the opposing oxygen of Leucin 112 . Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first description of two different  phenotypes associated with mutations at the same amino acid position in RHO . Our data suggest that even small structural changes in RHO  influence the human phenotype.",2006

Given that MeCP2 is a transcriptional repressor,  we decided to study MECP2  mutation consequences on gene  expression . For this aim, we selected three classic RTT patients with early truncating mutations and balanced X inactivation . We isolated  RNA from lymphoblasts of patients and three healthy controls and we  performed gene expression profiling experiments on the two pools of samples . We used cDNA microarrays containing 19 .200 DNA spots  from human cDNA clones. We identified 75 up regulated and 81 down regulated genes .

Quantitative PCR on genomic DNA with assays covering the genomic  locus failed to identify any copy number differences between either  Dac mutant and wild type littermates . Both the human and mouse  phenotypes seem to be caused by a disruption in the normal gene  expression patterning in limb bud development, but the mechanisms  are not known . Complementary approaches in both human SHFM3  and mouse Dac will be important in identifying the causative genes  and uncover the regulatory mechanisms involved in gene expression in this region .",2006

The CAR haplotype is associated  with a more severe phenotype, while the Senegalese haplotype is  not. Other factors, (gender, modifier genes, fetal hemoglobin (HbF)  levels, etc are thought to influence sickle cell disease (SCD) severity.  We studied 33 patients with homozygous HbS mutations to compare  disease severity with Î² globin gene cluster haplotype. The majority of the patients were haplotype heterozygotes (19/20 42 .4%, 19/3,31 18 .2%), 21 .2% were homozygous for the CAR haplotype and only 6 .1% were homozygous for the Benin haplotype, which partially contradicts the historical records of the African slave trade . Patients  homozygous for the CAR haplotype, 50% of the 19/20 haplotype  heterozygotes and 33% of the 19/3,31 haplotype heterozygotes had severe manifestations of SCD . Clinical severity did not correlate with  HbF levels and Î² globin haplotypes. Puerto Rican subjects carrying  the sickle cell trait (AS, 79 parents and 81 infants) and 61 normal, the predominant haplotypes were the Benin and CAR haplotypes . The  AA chromosomes possessed mutations commonly associated with S chromosomes which indicates admixing in the Puerto Rican population .  Our results resemble the haplotype distribution reported for the island  of Cuba, where the predominant haplotypes were the Benin and the  CAR haplotypes and the Senegalese haplotype contributed less than 10% of the HbS chromosomes .

SLOS is caused by mutations in Molecular and biochemical basis of disease the delta7sterol reductase gene (DHCR7), which impair endogenous  cholesterol biosynthesis and make the growing embryo dependent  on exogenous (maternal) sources of cholesterol . Previous studies  demonstrated a correlation of severity with DHCR7 genotype and maternal ApoE genotype . We have now investigated whether other  genes involved in lipid metabolism (apoCIII, LCAT, CETP, LDLR,  ABCA1), and additionally MTHFR, involved in folic acid metabolism,  may act as modifiers of the severity of SLOS. SNP genotyping was performed in 68 SLOS patients, their mothers and fathers . We tested for correlation between patientsÂ´ clinical severity score and gene dose of the rare alleles in the patients and their parents . Neither patients nor paternal genotypes were associated with disease severity  .  In addition to the previously observed association with DHCR7 genotype and apoE genotypes, only maternal ABCA1 genotypes (p=0 .007) but  no SNPs in other genes showed a significant correlation. The rare  maternal K1587 allele in the ABCA1 gene was associated with milder phenotypes . The correlation of maternal ABCA1 genotypes and SLOS  severity persisted after stratification for cholesterol (p=0.041) and for the DHCR7 genotype of the patient (p=0 .008) . ABCA1, a transporter of cholesterol across membranes is highly expressed in the placenta .

We studied DNA of 11 patients, whose symptoms and laboratory tests  gathered 3 or more points by WD scoring system before mutation  analysis. The liver copper quantification and rhodanine staining of hepatocytes is not available for our patients . DNA was extracted from whole blood by standard phenol/chloroform  purification protocol. The DNA analysis methods used were PCR, SSCP and direct sequencing . Of 22 WD chromosomes analyzed 5 were found to carry the mutation H1069Q (two patients were H1069Q homozygotes, one heterozygote) .  Thus the frequency of this mutation in WD chromosomes in Latvia is 22 .7% . The relatively low frequency of the mutation H1069Q may be due to the small patient group . In addition in one patient a previosly not reported mutation was found . The mutation 3106G>A involving  first nucleotide of codon results in amino acid change V1036I.

The influence of VEGF polymorphism on the progression  of ADPKD,P0848.,"Reiterova1, J. Stekrova2, M. Merta1, V. Tesar1",1Nephrology Dept," A significant phenotypical variability is observed in autosomal dominant  polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD), the most common hereditary kidney disease . Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a potent angiogenic agent, a mitogen for endothelial cells . Dysregulation of  VEGF expression in the kidney has been demonstrated in a wide range of primary and acquired renal diseases . Higher VEGF expression was found in polycystic kidneys . We examined the influence of the 2578 C/A and the 1154G/A  polymorphism in the regulatory region of the VEGF gene on the progression of ADPKD towards end stage renal disease (ESRD) . The   2578C and  1154G allele were described to be associated with higher VEGF production . 287 ADPKD patients who had reached ESRD were analyzed . Patients were divided into three groups: 1 . with ESRD later than in 63 years , 2 . with ESRD before 45 years and 3 . with ESRD between 45 63 years . We compared the frequencies of different genotypes between the groups . The VEGF 2578 C/A genotype distribution showed no differences  among the groups. We observed nonsignificantly higher tendency to later ESRD in AA females (55 .1Â±8 .2) in comparison with CC females (51 .7Â±9 .4) (t test, p=0 .09) .

Of the many genes studied thus far with respect to the  disease, the only consistently replicated genetic risk factor has been the APOE gene . The APOE*4 allele of this gene may promote amyloid  beta (AÎ²) plaque fibrillation, which is one of the hallmarks of LOAD.  APOE may relate to LOAD through cholesterol by regulating the  production of AÎ², with high cellular cholesterol reducing AÎ² levels.  Cholesteryl ester transfer protein (CETP) is involved in the same pathway through regulation of the HDL levels . We studied both the  APOE gene and the I405V polymorphism of the CETP gene in relation  to LOAD and investigated whether this polymorphism is independently associated with LOAD risk, or acts in concert with the APOE gene . We  genotyped 525 LOAD cases and 5404 controls from the Rotterdam Study using a TaqMan allelic discrimination assay  . Our results show  that in the APOE*4 non carriers group, those homozygous for the V allele of the I405V polymorphism have a 1 .6 fold (95% CI 1 .1 2 .5, p = 0 .02) increase in risk of LOAD compared to non carriers .

The gene encoding androgen receptor ( AR  gene) (Xq11 q12) has been proposed as being a candidate gene for susceptibility to the syndrome . The (CAG) n repeat polymorphism in  exon 1 of AR gene was found to be inversely correlated to the geneâs  transcriptional activity and consequently to the transactivation potential of androgen receptor  . The aim of the present case control study was to  evaluate the incidence of the polymorphism in Slovene PCOS patients .  One hundred seventeen PCOS patients and 110 age matched fertile  controls were genotyped for the polymorphism, using polymerase chain reaction . Serum total testosterone (TT) levels were determined by radioimmunoassay, and body mass index (BMI) was calculated .  Considering either both of the two AR alleles or biallelic means, the  distributions between PCOS and control patients were of no statistical  significance ( P = 0 .334 and P = 0 .376, respectively) . In PCOS women,  BMI and serum TT levels were significantly positively correlated (R = 0 .276,  P = 0 .002) . However, the number of CAG repeats could  not explain the variability in serum TT levels in PCOS patients with  statistical significance (after adjustment for BMI, P = 0 .938, adjusted R2  = 0 .07) . To conclude, the (CAG)n AR repeat polymorphism is probably  not a key risk factor for the development of PCOS in Slovene patients,  but its indirect involvement in the pathogenesis of PCOS, by complex interactions with other susceptibility factors might not be excluded .",2006

To  assess the importance of responsible loci in Iranian population, we  screened 50 consanguineous families with Autosomal Recessive Non  Syndromic Hearing Loss (ARNSHL)for DFNB21, which was linked to ARNSHL in Middle East countries . Materials and Methods:  50 consanguineous families with at least  three affected children, previously excluded by mutational analysis from GJB2 and GJB6 genes, were included in this study  . We used  three polymorphic markers including D11S1998, D11S4464, and D11S1299 in this study  . Results:  Three families were linked to DFNB21 and two novel mutations  have been detected so far  .

Pedigree based QTL association analysis using  information on allele transmission (TDT like approach) is fast, reliable  and extendable, but when ethnic stratification can be ignored, the measured genotype approach may have greater power  . In the latter  approach, a marker studied for association is tested as a covariate in  a polygenic model accounting for additive genetic relationships within the pedigree . However, in complex genealogies (which are especially  typical for genetically isolated populations) the measured genotype  analysis may be very time consuming, which makes genome screening impractical . We have developed a new and fast step wise method for genome wide pedigree based QTL association analysis . The idea of  the proposed method is to perform polygenic analysis using complete  pedigree information and to use residuals as a novel QT, which can be analysed using conventional regression analysis . Using simulated and  real data we show that the non centrality parameter, which links directly  to the power, may be two to four times greater for measured genotypes compared to the TDT approach . When no QTL is present, the step  wise approach is slightly conservative, but when QTL is present itâs statistical power is close to that of the measured genotypes approach .  Our method provides a fast, powerful and relatively simpe means  of undertaking a genome wide QTL association analysis in general  pedigrees that facilitates empirical significance testing strategies and may also be used for 2D genome screening for interacting QTL .",2006
Phenome and syntropic genes,P0862.,P. Puzyrev,"Institute for Medical Genetics, Tomsk Scientific Centre, Russian Academy of  Medical Sciences, Tomsk, Russian Federation","Like 100 years ago, exploration of relationships between phenetic and genetic variability, genome and phenome, is still of current importance .  Sequencing of human genome has shown that an important practical  difference between genome and phenome is that while the genome  is bounded (approximately 3 bilion base pairs), the phenome is not (its bound depends on how far we wish to go) (Raigen, Eppig, 2000) .  In thirties of last century, famous Russian geneticist Serebrovsky  foreknew this while formulating statement about âunity of infinite  number of traits and finite number of genesâ. In postgenomic era,  phenotyping takes on special significance in resolving of the problem.  Our approach to phenotyping for common diseases gene mapping is based on the phenomenon of polypathies . Phenomenon of combination of several diseases in one individual and/ or in its relatives was noted in XIX century and was reflected in the idea of âarthritismâ (Bouchard, 1890) . Later in the beginning of XX century  this idea was developed by German pathologists who proposed to designate combined diseases by the term âsyntropyâ (Pfaundler, 1921) .  Such âcombinationsâ are perhaps non random and have evolutionary genetic basis . We call genes which are involved in susceptibility to such disease combinations as genes of syntropies (Puzyrev, 2000) . Thus,  combined diseases (syntropies) comprise those units of phenome that  might correspond to some gene set, sample of co regulated genes with similar structure (syntropic genes) .

Its etiology is multifactorial, with involvement of both genetic and environmental factors . Several lines  of evidence suggest a role of the serotonin transporter gene ( SLC6A4 )  in the genetic susceptibility to ADHD . Thus, the serotonin transporter  has been involved in impulsive behaviour, it plays an important role in  the dopaminergic system, which is involved in ADHD, and is a target  of different drugs used in the pharmacological treatment of ADHD, such as imipramine or venlafaxine . To evaluate the participation of  the SLC6A4 gene in ADHD we considered the functional 5HTTVNTR  polymorphism within intron 3 and performed a case control association  study in a sample of 99 ADHD adult patients and 99 healthy controls  matched for age, sex and ethnicity. Although no significant differences  were observed in allele frequencies, the genotype distribution of the  5HTTVNTR polymorphism differed significantly between the ADHD sample and the controls (P=0 .018), due to an overrepresentation of 5HTT 12R carriers in the group of patients (P=0 .009, OR=3 .68) . We did  not detect sex influence, and subdivision of the patients according to  the clinical subtypes of inattentive, hyperactive impulsive or combined  ADHD, did not produce any significant association, which could be  explained by the relatively small sample size and reduced statistical power  . Although preliminary, our results suggest that the 5HTT 12R  allele of the 5HTTVNTR polymorphism within the SLC6A4  gene may  predispose to ADHD and support a serotoninergic participation in the etiology of this neuropsychiatric phenotype .",2006

Moreover, the male:female ratio in multiplex families was 2 .8:1 (37 males:13 females), which appears to be lower than the typical male:female ratio of 4:1 . These data support  our hypothesis that ASD in some families may be caused by autosomal recessive inheritance . Linkage analyses were conducted in multiplex families .

BOR is  caused by mutations in the EYA1  (Eyes absent homolog) gene (8q13),  the SIX1 gene (14q21 .3), or in a third locus on 1q31 . Six Danish families were studied . In two out of three large families (Fam A and  B) linkage analysis showed significant LOD score to EYA1  (multipoint  LOD score: Fam A: Z = 6.88; Fam B: Z = 5.78), which encodes a transcriptional co activator with protein tyrosine phosphatase activity  .

The IVS10 1G>A mutation, which is known (http://www  .medicine . uiowa .edu), was predicted to move the splice site one nucleotide  and thereby introduce a frame shift and a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 387 . The new splice site mutation, IVS12+4A>G,  co segregated perfectly with BOR in 12 affected/11 unaffected over four generations and is predicted (https://splice .cmh .edu/) to move the  splice site four nucleotides, leading to a frame shift and a premature stop codon at amino acid residue 461 .

Screening of the AR, LH, SRD5A2, 17 B HSD receptors and SRY gene  were carried out in a family with ambiguous genitalia using automated  sequence analysis on the ABI Prism 310 machine . Characterization of  the 3 patients and their healthy family members did not showed any mutations in the mentioned genes . Analyzing mother and her children  AR exon1 showed that mother is heterozygote for both CAG and GGN repeat . All affected children inherited the longer CAG and GGN repeat  from their mother and all their healthy siblings inherited shorter CAG and GGN repeat . Only one girl has heterozygous situation like her mother  . Our results indicated that disease locus is in linkage disequilibrium to the CAG and GGN trinucleotide repeats in the AR gene . One of  the healthy girls of the family has inherited the expanded repeats  which means she is a potential carrier of the disease locus and she will pass the disease locus to her offspring . It is possible to offer her prenatal diagnosis producers . In addition our founding could help the  counseling of the affected family member regarding the use of intra cytoplasmic sperm injection .",2006

However several genetic tests for common  diseases are to be appearing in medical practice in few years .  While studying the genetic basis for cardiovascular diseases, we  detected several genetic polymorphisms as being risk factors for various CVD in Russian population . In particular we had noted that  the contribution of genetic polymorphisms to CV endophenotypes  interindividual variability could be strictly dependent on the presence of other certain risk factors, such as diabetes mellitus 2 or obesity  .  For example âoppositeâ NOS3  haplotypes were associated with the  presence of left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients with essential hypertension along and hypertension combined with DM2 . So we  think that for the aims of susceptibility testing, genetic tests should be  combined with the information on CV risk factors existing in patient yet in order to increase test accuracy  . To evaluate the usefulness of  genetic testing, we studied a sample of 53 males with middle age of 54 years to reveal predisposition to LVH . Test panel consisted of 3  polymorphisms (2 variants in ACE and one   in calcineurin A alfa gene,  which were associated with LVH in our previous study independently from the other âclassicalâ risk factors ) . It was detected that genetic  âdiagnosisâ (predisposed or not for LVH development) was confirmed by echocardiography in 59% . This was comparable with the share of genetic component, known to be around 60% for this common trait .",2006

The clinical presentation varies between a very severe multisystem disorder to a mild neurological picture . A plethora of PMM2 mutations have been described . The majority of them  are of the missense type, reflecting the requirement of a minimal phosphomannomutase activity for a cell or organism to be viable . We characterized two new truncating mutations in two CDG Ia  patients with an enzymatically confirmed PMM deficiency. Patient 1 is compound heterozygous for the p .V231M (c .691G>A) mutation and a deep intronic point mutation (c .639 15 .479C>T) . This variant activates  a cryptic splice donor in intron 7, resulting in an in frame insertion of 123 bp between exon 7 and 8 . Patient 2 is compound heterozygous for the p .V44A (c .131T>C) mutation and a large deletion of approximately  20 kb including exon 8 of the PMM2  gene . The transcripts of this  truncated allele include exons 1 to 7 from the PMM2  gene and different  fragments of the proximal gene CHSP_1 .

PCR fragments ranging from 120 to 126 bp,  corresponding to 10TG 13TG, were detected by automated capillary electrophoresis (CEQ8000, Beckman) . Method was assessed in 30  DNA samples carrying 5T allele, in which T TG tract was previously  genotyped by direct sequencing or by cloning into a plasmid vector followed by sequencing in ambiguous cases . As the method resulted specific, accurate and simple, we further  tested the TG repeat in 5T positive CBAVD and chronic pancreatitis patients, and in normal controls . 100% (7/7) CBAVD, 44,4% (4/9)  chronic pancreatitis patients and 48,4% (15/31) normal controls  showed 12TG. Our results confirm the pathogenic role of 5T 12TG in CBAVD . Moreover, the high prevalence of 5T 12TG haplotype makes  our method an useful tool for a reliable estimation of the disease risk in 5T individuals .",2006

The relationship between the aneuploidies found in arrested embryos  and viability rate of embryos obtained in the same cycle,3 . The relationship between the aneuploidy rate in arrested embryos  and sperm apoptosis, sperm FISH for chromosome X,Y and 18 and spermiogram . Twenty arrested embryos were analysed using PGD FISH probes (13,16,18,21 and 22) . The sperm which was obtained from the father  of the arrested embryos was analysed using FISH probes (X,Y and 18) . To evaluate apoptosis, TUNEL test was performed on sperm . Results: Chromosomal aneuploidy frequency in arrested embryos was found to be 80% . There was no relationship between the aneuploidies  found in arrested embryos and the viabilty rate of the embryos obtained in the same cycle or total aneuploidy rate in sperm . No correlation was  found between sperm apoptosis and chromosomal aneuploidy rates  found in arrested embryos. There was a significant correlation between  the spermiogram and the number of chromosome aneuploidies in the arrested embryos . Conclusion: Although there is no significant correlation between  the sperm FISH, the sperm apoptosis results and the number of  chromosomal aneuploidies in embryos, we propose the spermiogram  results are efficacious as an indication of preimplantation genetic diagnosis .",2006

The most prominent feature is the  presence of atypical CMs, which are small, round to oval in shape and pinkish red in color  . We showed that the CM AVM is caused by  mutations in the RASA1 gene and reported 6 different mutations . The  RASA1 gene codes for p120 RasGTPase activating protein (p120 RasGAP), which is one of the most important inactivators of Ras .  Here we report 25 distinct mutations in 26 novel families with CM AVM . The mutations were spread throughout the gene . Twenty four  mutations caused a premature stop codon: 10 nonsense, 7 frameshift  and 7 splicing mutations, suggesting a loss of function as the most  likely mechanism. In one family, a missense mutation was identified (Y426C) . Sixty six individuals carrying a RASA1 mutation were  identified in these families: 44 had CMs, 20 had CMs plus a high flow lesion (9 AVM, 1 AVF and 10 PWS) and 2 were nonpenetrant carriers .  In summary, 30 different RASA1 mutations have been identified so far, clearly delineating the CM AVM phenotype . A considerable proportion  of patients (30%) had, besides the atypical CMs, a high flow lesion.  Its specific clinical, radiological and genetic characteristics should  avoid the confusion with other vascular anomalies, such as hereditary benign telangiectasia or Klippel Trenaunay syndrome . Our data also  suggests that the CM AVM phenotype could be a relatively frequent genetic disorder  . (vikkula@bchm.ucl.ac.be) (http://www.icp.ucl.ac.be/vikkula)",2006

This  receptor is implicated in many physiological functions as pain control,  anxiety response, movement coordination, corporal temperature  regulation, appetite, inflammatory process and addictive development phenomena . CNR1 has a common polymorphism A1359G in third  position in its codon 453 which corresponds to a synonymous change in aminoacid Thr  . A previous report has linked this polymorphism to  brain tumors . We have analyzed this CNR1 polymorphism in 156 patients diagnosed of glioma and 300 control subjets, both groups aged more than 50 . We  found a significant difference (p<0,033) in allele distribution between glioma patients and controls . Our results suggest that the A allele in  CNR1 gene may confer susceptibility for glioma in people aged more  than 50 for its significantly association.",2006
myosin iXB variant increases the risk of celiac disease  and points towards a primary intestinal barrier defect,P0895.,"J. Monsuur , E. Van Oort, A. Zhernakova, M. R. Bevova, M. C. Wapenaar,  C. Wijmenga","Complex Genetics Section, Utrecht, The Netherlands","Celiac disease has probably become the best understood immune related disorder  . The disease presents in the small intestine and results  from the interplay between multiple genes and gluten, the triggering environmental factor  . Although HLA class II genes explain 40% of the  heritable risk, non HLA genes accounting for the majority of the familial  clustering have not yet been identified. Here we report significant and  replicable association ( P = 2 .1 x 10 6) to a common variant located in  intron 28 of the myosin IXB ( MYO9B ) gene . Homozygosity for the at  risk allele confers a 2 .3 higher risk to disease ( P = 1 .55 x 10 5) . Myosin  IXB is an unconventional myosin and is expressed in several cells, including leukocytes and epithelial cells . Its Rho GTPase activating  domain can negatively control Rho proteins, which are involved in  cytoskeletal modifications and tight junction assembly, suggesting myosin IXB has a role in the epithelial barrier  . This may point to a  primary impairment of the intestinal epithelial barrier, and may explain why immunogenic gluten peptides are able to pass through this barrier  .  MYO9B  could also be an interesting candidate gene for several  other disorders since increased permeability of the epithelial barrier  is also seen in e.g. inflammatory bowel disorders, type 1 diabetes, and asthma . Alternatively, myosin IXB may play a role in controlling bacterial invasion of epithelial cells and wound closure . We are  currently elucidating the exact function of myosin IXB in celiac disease  and trying to identify the true functional gene variant that causes the observed genetic association .",2006

These alleles can be  carried in cis position on the DR3 haplotype, or in trans  on the DR3/ DR3, DR3/DR7 and DR5/DR7 haplotypes combinations . In Northern  Europe DQB1*02 DRB1*03 and DQB1*02 DRB1*07 haplotype  frequencies are very similar and they both seem to confer comparable risk to the disease (Louka et al, 2002) . In Southern Europe the DR3/ DR7 genotype is relatively common while the DR3/DR3 is rarer, and Genetic analysis, linkage, and association a higher risk has been proposed for the heterozygotes compared to  those DR3 homozygotes . In order to address this hypothesis, we investigated the effects  of different haplotypes carried in trans to the DQA1*05 DQB1*02  haplotype in CD families of Spanish origin, using a previously described statistical method by Louka et al, 2002 (Other Haplotype Test) . A sample  of 225 affected individuals (112 from Navarra, 80 from Valencia and 33  from Basque Country) who carried at least one DQB1*02 DQA1*05 DRB1*03 haplotype and their parents were included in this study  . We confirmed that DQB1*02 DRB1*03 and DQB1*02 DRB1*07  are strongly associated with CD susceptibility (p= 5,7x10 7 and p=  0,001, respectively). However, we found no significant difference in transmissiÃ³n of one of these haplotypes (p=0,887 and p=0,451) .

We compared mean CES D scores between the MM, MT, and TT genotypes of the AGT M235T polymorphism . In the family based study  we additionally calculated to which extent AGT M235T explains the  heritability of the CES D scores by performing a variance components analysis .  Results   In both populations we found a significant relation  between the AGT M235T polymorphism and CES D scores in men . In ERF the heritability estimate for CES D scores was 32% . When AGT  genotype status was included in the analysis the heritability decreased to 31% . The AGT genotype contributed to 1% of the total variance in the CES D scores .

We found a strong association between  23Hph +/+ (95%CI;  1,8664<OR<6,408; p<0,0001) and +1127Pst /  (95%CI;  1,9429<OR<6,7237; p<0,0001) genotypes and T1DM development. This result is very similar with those published in the literature . The  distribution of IGF2Apa genotypes do not differs significant between T1DM and control T1DM (p>0,05) . Comparing with other Caucasian  population, no difference in alleles or genotypes frequencies of  analyzed polymorphisms between T2DM and control T2DM has been observed .

IDE is the Zn requiring metalloproteinase, which plays a  principal role in the insulin degradation . The linkage to chromosome  10q23 q25 (where IDE gene maps) was identified for T2DM and  related quantitative traits . IDE knockout mice are characterized by decrease insulin degradation, hyperinsulinemia, glucose intolerance .  It is interesting that significant evidence are demonstrated for effects  of sequence variations in IDE on both T2DM and plasma insulin and  glucose levels in some human populations of European descent, whereas such associations are not shown in other populations . To  evaluate a role of IDE gene polymorphisms in T2DM development in  Russia, we studied 5 SNPs within the IDE gene and in its region in 99 patients with T2DM and 102 controls . An initial case control analysis  revealed no significant differences in distribution of genotypes and alleles between groups of diabetic and control subjects . We found no associations between studied sequence variations and T2DM risk . We  can make a preliminary conclusion that analysis of Russian population  provides no evidence of the contribution of IDE polymorphisms to T2DM susceptibility  .",2006

So far sixteen genes have been shown to cause autosomal dominant familial dilated cardiomyopathy  . We  identified a large Korean family from the Cheju Island showing a clear  dominant Mendelian inheritance pattern of dilated cardiomyopathy and  we proceeded to locate the underlying gene in this family by using genetic linkage .mEtHODs : Twenty nine members of this four generation pedigree  were recruited, including DNA from six clearly affected individuals . The  diagnosis of dilated cardiomyopathy was made by our group according to standard criteria . Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood samples . 392 microsatellite markers at an average of 9 cM distance were genotyped throughout the genome . We used a dominant genetic model with 0 .95 penetrance, 0 .001 phenocopy rate, and a disease allele frequency of 0 .001 . Individuals younger than 40 years of age were set to undetermined status for the analyses .REsUL ts : Five regions with LOD scores above 1 were found in  parametric two point linkage analysis on chromosomes 1, 2, 7, 13 and 21 . Linkage to D1S1595 was strongly supported by the multipoint linkage analysis with a LOD=2 .82, the highest score in the study  . Fifteen  additional markers were added in the D1S1675 to D1S2107 interval .  Haplotype analysis with the additional markers allowed the definition of a 27 cM candidate interval (45 .9 Mb) including the centromere and  flanked by markers D1S1675 and D1S104.cONcLUsiONs : The interval contains the known candidate gene  LMNA encoding the laminin A/C which we will pursue .",2006

However, the mutated genes responsible for the majority of  cases have yet to be been identified.methods:  DCM was diagnosed on echocardiography if the left  ventricular end diastolic dimension was > 117% of normal when  corrected for body surface area and age and there was evidence of impaired contractility i .e . left ventricular ejection fraction was < 0 .50, or  fractional shortening was < 28% . Genome wide linkage analysis was  conducted using a 10 centimorgan resolution panel of microsatellite markers . Results: We have identified two kindreds, CM 50 and CM 100 in which  early onset DCM segregates as an autosomal dominant trait . Clinical  characteristics of this unusual form of DCM were sudden cardiac death  (SCD) and severe diffuse myocardial fibrosis. In the two families a  total of 32 individuals were considered affected, 25 unaffected and 9 of unknown status . Peak two point LOD scores >3 .0 were obtained  independently with each family using the markers D10S1773 and D10S1483 respectively  . Haplotype analyses in the two families  identified substantial locus overlap, and when considered together,  defined a critical interval of 14.0 centimorgans between D10S1237  and D10S1723. Multipoint linkage analyses confirmed this interval and generated a peak LOD score of 8 .2 .conclusions:  We have mapped a novel locus for cardiomyopathy,  diffuse myocardial fibrosis and SCD to chromosome 10q25 q26.

Short tandem repeats (STRs) are powerful genetic  tools for genetic mapping and could be used for human identification due to their high level of polymorphisms . Among STRs, dinucleotides  are more difficult to type. Here in, dinucleotide repeats were used for diagnostic purposes .methods:  DNA amplification of two repetitive regions of factor VIII gene  of 70 unrelated individuals was performed . The PCR products were detected on 10% polyacrylamide gel by silver nitrate staining . Many  bands were seen when working with dinucleotides which led us to genotyping errors . For characterizing each band, they were recovered from the gel . The recovered bands were cloned for sequencing analysis and each band was characterized . Results: Detected bands were the result of errors produced during  PCR processing . Allelic bands were the ones with stronger intensity  .  Minor bands were also seen including stutter bands, shadow bands,  non temple products, microvariety bands, and bands formed by the mutations in the repetitive region itself . Also heteroduplex and conformational bands were the result of electrophoresis conditions .conclusions:  STR markers allow rapid testing of carrier detection,  prenatal diagnosis and genetic transmission Studies . Therefore  indicating the errors are important for defining the true allele and  genotyping the population. We have concluded that these definitions  were effective for detecting PCR processing errors in studying  dinucleotide repeats that would lead to mistyping of heterozygotes and homozygotes .",2006

This means that these traits could be inherited  in chromosome patients from their parents more frequently than in their siblings . According to this hypothesis we investigated electrocardiograms (ECG) in Down syndrome (DS) patients . The single  parameter of ECG (individual peak amplitude, the duration of it and  interval between it) per se  is the final reflection of multiple hereditary  components beginning since histogenesis . The ECGâs were studied in a group of 302 patients with cytogenetically proven trisomy 21 . For all of them typical 12 standard leads were taken in region hospitals . The age of patients ranged in the limits from 1 to 46 yrs (average age 15 .3 yrs) . It seems that for such heterogenic  contingent it is difficult to choose adequate control group, especially  having in mind the fact that in hospitals and outpatient departments ECG is recorded when some heart pathology is suspected . In all aspects, in our opinion, siblings are the best for control . ECGâs were  taken for 278 brothers and sisters (age interval ranged from 1 to 60 yrs, average age 20 .0 yrs) .

In two brothers Duchenne muscular dystrophy was proved by  mutation analysis of the dystrophin (DMD) gene showing deletion of exons 45 50 . We performed microsatellite marker analysis of the X  chromosomes in the family, in order to identify the X chromosome carrying the mutation in the obligate carrier mother  .

Surprisingly, however, markers on the distal short  and long arms (DXS207, DXS691, DXS1283E) could be assigned to  different maternal X chromosomes in the two sons, indicating that the  DMD gene carrying the deletion might have been transferred between the two maternal X chromosomes . Moreover, further extended marker analyses of samples taken from  the maternal grandparents and other members of the motherâs family suggested germinal mosaicism of the mother  .

The majority of  these items could be explained by one underlying factor representing a quantitative measure of such a broad ED phenotype . Using the twin  sibling design it was subsequently indicated that individual differences  in this factor are mainly explained by an underlying genetic mechanism in females .

Genetically, FHM families can be linked to 19p13 presenting mutations  in the CACNA1A gene (FHM1), or linked to 1q23 with mutations in ATP1A2 gene (FHM2) . Recently, a third gene for the disease was reported in 2p24, the SCN1A gene (FHM3) . For FHM1 several recurrent  mutations have been described and allow a more accurate genotype phenotype correlation . For ATP1A2 however, recurrent mutations  are described only once, and other mutations are present in single (small) families . Our aim was to investigate the involvement of ATP1A2 gene in a Portuguese family with pure FHM . Six multiallelic markers  surrounding the ATP1A2 gene were genotyped and haplotype analysis was compatible with involvement of the ATP1A2 locus . Scanning the  ATP1A2 gene for mutations was performed by direct sequencing of all  exons and flanking regions, using genomic DNA of one patient of the  family. Thus we identified the M731T mutation, previously identified in  a Dutch pure FHM family, and confirmed cosegregation of the mutation with the disease phenotype in our family  . Comparison of haplotypes  of both the Dutch and the Portuguese family with the M731T mutation  indicated that the mutation is recurrent rather than result of a common founder effect . This mutation is disease causative in our family, also  because recent functional and kinetic consequences on ATPase pump functioning were reported .

Beers2, M. O. Woods1","1Memorial University of Newfoundland, St","Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis (IPF) is a form of interstitial lung disease that is usually diagnosed between ages 50 70 yrs . Up to 3% of IPF  patients have a familial form of the disease (familial pulmonary fibrosis or FPF) . In 2001, autosomal dominant mutations in the  Surfactant  Protein C gene  (SFPTC ) were shown to cause familial forms of lung disease, including FPF  . We have identified 14 Newfoundland (NL) FPF kindreds, from which  48 affected individuals and 268 unaffected family members have been recruited . We have also assembled a cohort of 24 âsporadicâ PF patients . The mean age of diagnosis in the familial group was 59  years, compared with 63 years in the sporadic group (not statistically  significant). However while no patient in the sporadic group was  diagnosed prior to age 40, almost 20% of the familial group were  diagnosed by this age, suggesting that FPF should be considered in any NL patient diagnosed with PF prior to 40 . Newfoundlandâs minimum  prevalence of FPF is 120 cases/million, which is over 100 fold greater  than that of the United Kingdom, so that the NL population appears to be enriched for this Mendelian disorder  . SFPTC  has been excluded in these 14 kindreds by immunohistochemistry  and DNA sequencing . Two of the families are large, with 7 or more  affected individuals, and are conducive for gene mapping using a traditional linkage analysis approach . Therefore, genome wide scans using microsatellite markers have been performed . This analysis has  identified several regions of interest which are being examined more thoroughly  .",2006

The aim of this work is: 1) to diagnose the patients with  clinical features suggesting LGMD2I, 2) to observe the frequency of this  pathology in these two populations and, 3) to offer genetic counselling to the affected families . We studied 60 Spanish and 10 Croatian patients presenting a LGMD2I  phenotype and in whom we previously excluded a dystrophinopathy, LGMD2A, LGMD2C and LGMD2D . The molecular study was performed  following two steps: 1) The analysis of the L276I mutation (reccurrent in North European population) by restriction enzyme analysis .2) The sequencing of the unique coding exon 4 . We found four missense mutations in seven patients: E55Q, R143S, L276I and G373S, two of them were novel mutations: E55Q and G373S .  Their pathogenia were demonstrate analysing 50 chromosomes from normal controls and 50 chromosomes from other myopathy patients . The L276I mutation was identified in four patients (3 Spanish and 1  Croatian) and should be considered the more frequent FKRP  mutation  in the populations studied . The low number of FKRP  mutations  identified despite the patients were very well classified could indicate the low frequency of LGMD2I in these two populations .",2006

By fine mapping we were able to exclude the MAPT gene in  which mutations have been previously found in several FTD families  linked to 17 (FTDP 17) and significantly refine the linkage interval to approximately 3 .4 cM .

Genetic influences on gene expression may be trans  acting  as well as cis acting, and are thus not limited to the gene locus itself .  Recent studies have demonstrated that expression of a gene is a  phenotype that is amenable to linkage analysis . These studies have  also indicated that a large proportion of the heritable variance in gene  expression is attributable to  trans  acting polymorphism . Our studies  are based on the principle that if cis acting variation within a âdisease  geneâ influences susceptibility to disease through effects on that geneâs  expression, then genes containing trans  acting polymorphism with the  same effect on the disease gene will also be susceptibility genes for the disorder  . For complex disorders, the effect size of these loci will  necessarily be greater on the intermediate expression phenotype than on the clinical phenotype, and thus should be more easily detected .  As a method for mapping novel susceptibility loci, we have conducted  linkage analysis of the expression of several susceptibility genes for  neuropsychiatric / neurodegenerative disorders, using real time PCR measures in large CEPH pedigrees .

GVMs are often hereditary and transmitted as an autosmal disorder  . The gene was linked to chromosome 1p21 22  and named glomulin (glmn) (Boon et al, 1999) . To date, 27 different  inherited mutations have been identified. The majority of the changes  cause the appearance of a premature stop codon and probably result in non sense mediated mRNA decay (Brouillard et al, 2002 & 2005) .  Nevertheless, haploinsuffisance may not be sufficient to create a  lesion, as a âsecond hitâ mutation was identified on the second allele in one lesion (Brouillard et al, 2002 & 2005) . By in situ hybridisation, we have shown that glomulin is specifically  expressed in vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) during murine development (McIntyre et al, 2004) . We now show that glomulin  expression begins in VSMCs after desmin, h caldesmon and smooth  muscle myosin heavy chain, but before the expression of smoothelin b (McIntyre et al, submitted) . We also demonstrate that glomus cells  in GVMs do not express glomulin nor smoothelin b, in contrast to venous malformations (McIntyre et al, submitted) . This complete  lack of glomulin supports the notion of GVMs being inherited in a paradominant fashion . We conclude that glomus cells have been deviated in their differentiation  process due to a complete lack of glomulin expression.

In this  study we have sequenced the ABCA12 gene of a further 13 patients,  the results show all of them contain either nonsense substitution or frameshift mutations . Non denaturing HPLC analysis and Agilent DNA  oligo arrays showed the presence of a heterozygous whole exon  deletion in a patient with no mutations previously located with standard sequencing . These mutation data establish  ABCA1 2 as the major HI  gene . Immunofluorescence demonstrated completely absent ABCA12 protein  expression in HI skin (n=2) with expression throughout normal, control epidermis, most strongly in the stratum granulosum . Furthermore  markers of late epidermal differentiation, such as transglutaminase  1 and ZO 1, had a highly abnormal distribution in HI skin being  expressed in the lower layers of the epidermis including the basal cell layer  . In summary mutations have been found in all HI patients studied  to date and exon copy number experiments should be considered when screening for HI . Immunostaining has proven that this protein  is completely absent in HI skin and that the normal pattern of late epidermal differentiation is severely impaired .

Thirty eight families had syndromic hearing loss . Majority of families had autosomal recessive non syndromic hearing loss (ARNSHL) pattern of inheritance . In 97  probands, no other affected relative could be identified   we classified these as simplex cases .  GJB2 mutation screening was complete in  1246 patients with presumed ARNSHL; initially we tested for 35delG mutation . Persons either negative or heterozygous for this mutation  were analyzed by denaturing high performance liquid chromatography and direct sequencing . We found  GJB2  related hearing loss in 210  of 1246 (15.6%) ARNSHL cases. Identified deafness causing allele  variants included 20 mutations which 507insAACG, 329delA, 363delC  and Q80L are the novel mutations and they have not been reported in other populations . The objective of this study is to identify the gene(s)  involve in ARNSHL in Iranian Populations. As the first step the 14  known loci of ARNSHL with three and more affected individuals are being investigated by homozygosity mapping using STRs Markers .  Whole Genome Screening using SNP typing has been performed for the families which can not be localized to the known loci . So far over 6  years, we have been able to collect over 722 families with two or more  affected deaf and our linkage result have identified 3 new Loci which have not been mapped previously  .",2006

Although high genetic  heterogeneity, mutations in the GJB2  (DFNB1 ) are a remarkably  frequent cause of ARNSHL in all populations studied so far  . Ninety unrelated familial patients with ARNSHL from the northeast of Turkey were evaluated . Screening for mutations in the  GJB2 gene  revealed five already described mutations, p.G12 fsX13 (35delG),  p .W24X, p .R104 fsX109 (310del14), p .E120del and p .R184P  . In  addition, two novel mutations, p.Q80K and p.P173S, were identified. In total, these mutations explain the ARNSHL in 29 (32 .2%) of the patients . 35delG was the most common mutation, accounting for 76%  of all mutant GJB2  alleles . A number of families with a single or without a GJB2  mutation and  suitable for homozygosity mapping were selected and analysed .  Homozygosity was detected in four families for TMC1 (DFNB7/11) ,  in three families for TMPRSS3  (DFNB8/10)  and in one family for  MYO15A  (DFNB3) . Subsequent sequencing of the coding region and  exon intron boundaries of these genes revealed four novel TMC1  mutations, p .Y259C, p .P274L, p .R445H, R362 fsX367, in 4 (4 .4%)  families . In TMPRSS3 , one known mutation, p .P404L, and two novel  mutations, p .R216L and p .Q398X, were found in 3 (3 .3%) families . In  MYO15A,  one novel mutation, p.G1831V, was identified in 1 family. Our results indicate that besides mutations in GJB2 , mutations in  TMC1 and TMPRSS3 contribute remarkably to ARNSHL, especially  considering the high level of genetic heterogeneity of ARNSHL .

The study was performed in 42 unrelated male patients with hemophilia A . Relatives from their families were also studied for carrier detection .  Total genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood according to standard procedures . A single nucleotide polymorphism in the FVIII  gene HindIII/intron19 and an extragenic St14 (DXS52) VNTR were studied by PCR based methods . Also these markers were analyzed in control group (64 unrelated X chromosomes) .The presence of the restriction site HindIII+ was observed in 40 .5% of hemophilia A patients . The frequency was similar to that observed in controls (35,9%) . Determination of the length of the St14 VNTR led to observation of twelve alleles ranged from 670bp to 2900bp .  The 1690bp allele was the most frequent allele with 42% and 35% frequency in patients and in control group, respectively  . The expected  heterozygozity rate was 0 .787 . Of 42 families with hemophilia A 36 (86%) were informative for these two polymorphisms . Twelve female  relatives (except patientsâ mothers) from 11 hemophilia A families were analyzed for carries status . In 7 of them the carrier status was rejected .

A multiplicative  oligogenic model with 3 loci has been proposed with RET proto  oncogene being the key player  . Indeed, almost all HSCR patients  harbor either a heterozygous mutation of the coding sequence or,  more frequently, a hypomorphic allele located in a conserved non gene sequence in intron 1 . In roughly 30% of the cases however, HSCR is associated to other malformations . Hitherto, the disease causing  gene is known in 4 syndromic HSCR forms with mendelien inheritance  among which CCHS (MIM209880, PHOX2B mutation) and Mowat  Wilson (MIM235730, ZFHX1B  mutation) . The penetrance of the HSCR  phenotype is estimated about 20% for PHOX2B  gene mutation and  60% for ZFHX1B  mutation . To test whether RET could be regarded as  a modifier gene for the enteric phenotype in these 2 syndromes, we  genotyped the RET locus in patients for which the disease causing  mutation had been identified previously for CCHS (N=143) or MWS (N=30) . Splitting patients into 2 groups (with or without HSCR) for each  syndrome showed a statistically significant over representation of the  RET hypomorphic allele in CCHS patients only ( Ï2=11.52; p<0.001).  Therefore RET acts as a modifier gene for the enteric phenotype to  occur in patients with a PHOX2B  gene mutation . These data illustrate  the concept of a developmental gene being either a major disease  causing gene or a modifier gene. Finally, we also suggest the possibility  of RET dependent and RET independent HSCR cases .",2006

We proposed a classification of HLA DRB1 alleles, reshaping  the shared epitope hypothesis in rheumatoid arthritis (RA): RA was  associated with the RAA shared epitope sequence (72 74 positions)  and the association was modulated by the amino acids at positions 70 and 71, resulting in 6 genotypes with different RA risks . Here, we  tested this classification for validation in an independent sample.Methods . A new sample of 100 French Caucasian families with one RA patient and both parents was genotyped for the HLA DRB1 gene . The  alleles were grouped as previously: S1 alleles for the sequences A RAA  or E RAA, S2 for Q or D K RAA, S3D for D R RAA, S3P for Q or R R  RAA, and X alleles for no RAA sequence . Over or undertransmission of alleles was investigated . Genotypes odds ratio (OR) calculation was performed through a conditional logistic regression, and homogeneity  of these OR with those of the 100 first trio families previously published was tested .Results . The S 2 and S3P alleles were significantly overtransmitted. The  undertransmitted S1, S3D and X alleles were grouped as L alleles, as  previoulsy. Under this 3 alleles classification, the risk hierarchy of the 6  resulting genotypes was, by decreasing OR: S2/S3P, S2/S2, S3P/S3P, S2/L  and S3P/L, the reference genotype being L/L . Those results validated  the proposed classification. Following an homogeneity test, we pooled  the two samples and improved estimates from the highest (S2/S3P) to  the lowest (S3P/L) risk genotype .

Vikkula2","1Department of Dermatology, University of Regensburg, Regensburg, Germany,  2Human Molecular Genetics dept","Familial progressive hypermelanosis is a new variant of a hereditary pigmentation disorders without associated symptoms . This phenotype  has so far been observed only in five families, all living in close proximity in a small town in south east of Germany (Zanardo et al ., 2004) . The phenotype, with an autosomal dominant inheritance  with reduced penetrance, consists of progressive diffuse, partly  blotchy hyperpigmentation, multiple cafÃ© au lait spots, intermingled with scattered hypopigmented appearing maculae, and lentigenes .  Histological and ultrastructural section from the hyperpigmented  spots display strong basal hyperpigmentation of the epidermis with numerous melanophages containing large amounts of pigment . In  contrast, the hypopigmented appearing macula show a slight basal  hyperpigmentation of epidermis, but virtually no melanophages in the upper dermis . The restricted area of occurrence of the disease and the extreme rarity  of the phenotype suggest a common origin and thus a founder effect for this genetic defect . Based on this hypothesis, we performed a  genome wide linkage analysis in the five families using the GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array SNP genotyping . The results demonstrate  the presence of significant linkage peaks with maximal LOD of 2.28  assuming the smallest genetic distance between the five families, on the long arm of chromosome 12 . All affected individuals shared  the same haplotype in this locus. This finding suggests that a gene involved in melanin distribution is located on chromosome 12 .

Progress towards understanding their genetic basis has  been slow because of the complex inheritance patterns and genetic  heterogeneity within phenotype definitions. Mapping susceptibility  genes for clearly identifiable neurophysiological endophenotypes,  such as variation in abnormal EEG responses to intermittent photic  stimulation, also called photosensitivity or photoparoxysmal response Genetic analysis, linkage, and association0 (PPR), may provide the means to dissect the genetic basis of IGEs .  Recently, we mapped two susceptibility loci for PPR at 7q32 and  16p13 in 16 PPR multiplex families with prominent myoclonic epilepsy  background (MS related PPR) . Here we present the follow up studies performed on these regions . The inheritance model for these two loci  was explored, showing that the 16p13 locus may have a recessive inheritance . A two locus linkage analysis was also performed to test  for different interaction models and higher evidence for linkage under a multiplicative model (P= 0 .001) was found, suggesting that both loci  are necessary, but each alone is not sufficient, to predispose to MS related PPR . Finally, sequence analysis of four plausible functional  genes localized in the two loci regions, three neurotransmitter G  protein coupled receptors (SSTR5, CHRM2 and GRM8) and one  voltage gated ion channel (CACNA1H), was performed in two patients from each family and in Dutch controls . Novel variants not reported  in the NCBI dbSNP and several known variants were found and  are currently being evaluated for familial segregation and putative  biological meaning. The identification of susceptibility genes for PPR would advance our understanding of epileptogenesis .",2006

HCV positive patients with persistent normal ALT (PNAL) represent the 20 30% of the HCV population . Here, we verify the potential role  of cytokines in inflammatory damage of CHC and in IFN therapy  resistance. So, polymorphisms in IL 10 and TNF Î± ( 1082 G/A and   308 G/A, respectively) were analyzed in: 156 CHC subjects; 45 with  cirrhosis; 34 CHC responder (CHC R) and 46 CHC non responder  (CHC NR); 22 PNAL patients.

A significant decrease of the low TNF Î± /high IL 10  producer genotype vs all the other genotypes was observed in Cirrhotic  group as compared with CHC subjects (P=0 .011) . In CHC NR patients  the high TNF Î±/high IL 10 producer genotype vs the other genotypes  increased significantly as compared with CHC R patients (P =0.048).  Finally, the arranged genotype distribution did not significantly differ  between PNAL and CHC groups. Conversely, the frequency of TNF Î±  A allele (high producer) is significantly increased (P=0.048) in PNAL subjects . Our results suggest that: PNAL patients seem characterized  by TNF Î± high producer; the TNF Î± high producer/IL 10 low producer  seems characterizing cirrothic patients; the TNF Î± high producer/IL  10 high producer seems influencing the negative response to antiviral treatment .",2006

Polymerase chain reactions were performed to analyze polymorphisms  in the promoter regions of IL 18 (positions  607 and  137) and IL 12B (4bp insertion) . When following the dominant model, the risk of recurrent spontaneous  abortion was higher in carriers of IL 12B allele 2 as compared to IL  12B 4bp insertion allele 1 (p=0.018). No significant differences in  frequencies of tested IL 18 promoter polymorphism genotypes and the occurrence of RSA were observed .

The type of FVIII gene  mutation, genes in the Major Histocompatibility Complex loci and also  other proteins participating in the presentation of antigens are the major predisposing factors for inhibitor formation . A national collaborative  effort was undertaken to identify the FVIII gene mutations in high responder inhibitor patients . Twenty six severely affected patients with known inhibitor levels of >5 Bethesda U/ml were included . Initially the  samples were screened for intron 22 inversions by Southern blotting and then for intron 1 inversions by PCR . The exonic regions corresponding  to A2, C2, and A3 domains that include functional binding sites of the  ligands of the FVIII protein were then sequenced in inversion negative patients . Complete sequencing of the FVIII gene was performed in those patients without a change in the former exonic regions . About  54% of patients had inversion mutations mostly involving intron 22,  and 26% had point mutations that involved 3 single nucleotide and  2 dinucleotide deletions, and 3 transitions in exons corresponding to  A2, C2 and A3 domains leading to either nonsense or frameshift and termination mutations, all resulting in protein truncations . One patient had a nucleotide change resulting in a splicing error  . Five patients  had large deletions of variable length . In conclusion, large genomic  rearrangements and termination mutations all leading to a defiency of  the FVIII protein were the prominent cause of the inhibitor development in this group of high responder hemophilia A patients .",2006
Design and validation of DNA pools in an ischaemic  stroke population,P0963.,"Ross Adams , A. Pasdar, D. St Clair, M. Macleod","University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","Background and Aim: Stroke is a complex, multifactorial disease thought to involve multiple genes of small effect . To identify these,  large scale association studies involving the systematic screening of numerous samples at hundreds of markers are required . This is expensive, time consuming and labour intensive . DNA pools provide a way to quickly and reliably screen case and control samples in a cost  effective manner by significantly reducing the quantity of DNA used, number of reactions and processing time . The aim of this study was  to design and validate DNA pools of stroke cases and healthy controls  from Scotland, which could be used to screen for association with single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using DNA chips . Methods: Using TOAST criteria, 373 stroke cases were sub divided into large and small vessel disease pools . Equimolar amounts of DNA  from each sample were combined to form 3 pools of over 100 samples each . DNA from 566 control patients was grouped in a similar way into 3 pools . Each had approximately equal proportions of males and females . Allele frequencies at 5 SNP loci were determined for each  individual and pool using dynamic allele specific hybridisation (DASH) and Pyrosequencing . Results: Allele frequency estimates between pool replicates were  consistent for each SNP (average r2=0 .950), and correlated well with  allele frequencies determined by individual genotyping (r2=0 .950) .  Further, alleles were detectable at a frequency as low as 2 .5% . These  results indicate the validity of these pools as an effective means by  which to screen our samples for associations between SNP marker and disease status .",2006

Search for  mutations in genes implicated in left right patterning in animal models  allowed to identify genes associated with heterotaxia defects in humans . However, these genes explain only a small percentage of human situs defects suggesting that other genes must play a role . In this study, we report a consanguineous family of Turkish origin,  composed of two unaffected parents and three children, two of whom presented Kartagener syndrome . On the basis of the family history, we hypothesize autosomal recessive mode of inheritance . Genotype  analysis with polymorphic markers did not show linkage with any known genes or loci causing laterality disorders . Array CGH did not detect a  duplication or microdeletion greater than 1 Mb as a possible cause either  . Genome wide screening using 10K Affymetrix SNP chips was  performed, allowing the identification of two regions of autozygosity, one in chromosome 1 and the other on chromosome 7 .

The presence of LD  between SNP markers can be used to save genotyping cost via  appropriate SNP tagging strategies, whereas absence or low level of LD between markers generally increase genotyping cost . It is  not uncommon that a large proportion of tagging SNPs in a tagging scheme often turn out to be singleton SNPs, i .e . SNPs that only tag themselves rather than contribute power to the rest of a region . If  genotyping cost is the primary concern, which may often be the case in  the present time for genome wide association studies, these singleton  tagging SNPs would be the primary targets to be removed from genotyping . It is important, however, to understand the characteristics of such SNPs and estimate the impact of removing them in a study  .  Using the HapMap genotype data, we assessed the distribution and functional implications of singleton SNPs in the human genome .

Fasting plasma lipids were determined by spectrophotometric chemical analysis . Individual SNPs were analysed with ANOVA .  Linkage disequilibrium blocks (n = 6) were estimated with HaploView; haplotypes were inferred and analysed utilizing haplo .stats . Marginal associations were observed (0 .05 < p < 0 .10) for several individual SNPs . Haplotypes in block one and two were associated with total  cholesterol (TC)/high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL) ratio (p = 0 .03 for both) . Block four haplotypes were associated with low  density lipoprotein cholesterol (p = 0.02). Variation in block five was  significantly associated with HDL levels (p = 0.01). Haplotypic variation in block six was associated with hypercholesterolemia (p = 0 .03) . These  results suggest that the genes in the ApoL cluster play an important  role in determining circulating lipid levels, particularly HDL and those measures dependent on it (TC/HDL ratio and affection) . Further study  of this comparatively unknown genomic region is warranted, particularly with larger sample sizes and denser genotyping .",2006

The LRRK2 gene product is a member of ROCO protein family, with multiple functional domains, colloquially named dardarin . The  Gly2019Ser substitution changes a highly conserved residue of the  DYG motif, at the start of kinase activation segment, probably causing an impairment of catalytic activity  . To understand this pathological  mechanism could help for individuation of new therapeutic strategies . We confirm that LRRK2 Gly2019Ser is, at the date, the most frequent causative mutation in Italian PD patients, likewise in other populations .  A reduced penetrance might account for the presence of the mutation in apparently sporadic PD patients . Moreover, the age at onset  heterogeneity of mutation carriers suggests that different factors contribute to disease evolution .",2006

The objective of this study is to establish a  semiautomatic protocol for rapid sequencing of both Marfan genes, FBN1 and TGFBR2 . METHODS Main features of the protocol are: i) successive analysis of  individual patient samples ii) optimized design of primer pairs allowing  uniform conditions for both PCR amplification and sequencing iii)  implementation of a liquid handling robot to achieve semiautomatic performance of all pre  and post PCR steps . RESULTS The protocol was validated by testing 25 consecutive  patients refered to hospital for ectomy of an aneurysm/dissection of the ascending aorta . 15 patients (60%) also showed other signs of  MfS. A mutation in FBN1 could be identified in 12/25 patients (48%). 9/12 mutations were novel (75%) . 67% of the patients with suspected  MfS showed a FBN1 mutation, while only 20% of the patients with no further signs of MfS carried a FBN1 mutation . No alteration in the  FBN1 coding sequence could be found in 13 out of 25 patients (52%), two of which were later found to harbor a mutation in TGFBR2 (8%) . CONCLUSION The novel protocol enables rapid detection of the disease causing mutation in the index patient . This may in turn pave  the way for timely identification of pre symptomatic relatives who should then be monitored closely  .",2006

There exists inter  and intra familial phenotypic variability among the MEN 2 families, even though when the disease  is caused by the same RET mutation, suggesting a role for genetic  modifiers, such as polymorphisms/haplotypes. We have sought to determine the frequency and position of RET  germline mutations in a cohort of 114 Spanish probands with any sign  of MEN 2, and to search for putative modifier loci. With this aim, the  distribution of 8 RET polymorphisms and the haplotypes comprising  them, were subsequently studied in the context of the families  positive for RET mutational screening . The relationship between  RET mutation type and presence of a polymorphism/haplotype was  analyzed . It was also studied the relationship between the presence of  pheochromocytoma (PC) and/or hiperparathyroidism (HPT) in carriers  of the same RET mutation, and the genotype for the specific variants.  The results derived from those analyses revealed no associations  of any variant/haplotype to a specific mutation or to the clinical presentation .

The purpose of our study  was to test if genetically driven variation of BDNF may significantly be  involved in a non illness specific susceptibility to mental disorders or,  alternatively, a certain group of disorders may be strongly related to this gene but others can result from spurious association studies .

We have found an overall gene  effect on psychiatric disorders as a single group. From the stratified  analysis according to diagnostic categories, we have found that in the  case of mood disorders (both in a global analysis and in another one  only considering bipolar patients) and schizophrenia, the Val66Met polymorphism in BDNF is not a risk factor  . Subtype analyses also  indicate that the association of the Val66Met polymorphism in BDNF  is confined to two particular diagnostics: substance related disorders and eating disorders .

The origin  of the extra 21 chromosome is maternal in 95% of cases and due to failure of normal chromosomal segregation during meiosis I . Advanced maternal age is the only fully accepted risk factor for trisomy 21 . Other risk factors are not well known . The relationship between chromosomal  non disjunction leading to aneuploidy and folate metabolism has drawn attention in the recent years . In this study, we examined the  two polymorphisms in genes encoding the folate metabolizing enzyme  methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) among 39 mothers of  children with Down syndrome and 90 age matched control mothers from West Siberia (Russia) . The frequencies of  MTHFR C677T  genotypes (CC, CT, and TT) were 51%, 36% and 13%, respectively,  in the case group and 49%, 41% and 10%, respectively, in the  control group. No significant differences were found in the genotypes  distribution for MTHFR C677T variant between the two groups ( P =  0 .81) . The frequencies of MTHFR A1298C genotypes (AA, AC, and  CC) among case mothers were 31%, 56% and 13%, respectively  . The  corresponding frequencies among controls were 48%, 43% and 9%,  respectively. No significant differences between the two groups were  found also ( P = 0 .28) . Our results do not support the link between the  C677T and A1298C polymorphisms of MTHFR  and risk of chromosome  21 non disjunction in maternal meiosis I .

Several studies suggest that serotonin related genes participate in its pathogenesis . Involvement of the serotonin  transporter gene ( SLC6A4 ) in migraine has been studied in different  populations with discordant results . To evaluate the association of  SLC6A4  polymorphisms with migraine in the Spanish population  we performed a case control study considering 91 migraineurs (34  migraine without aura (MO) and 57 migraine with aura (MA)  19 of which were hemiplegic  ) and 109 healthy controls . We selected three  polymorphisms distributed along the SLC6A4 gene: 5HTTLPR (a  deletion/insertion in the transcriptional regulatory region), 5HTTVNTR  in intron 3 and the rs2066713 tag SNP in intron 2. No significant  differences were observed for the 5HTTVNTR and rs2066713 polymorphisms . However, the genotype distribution of the 5HTTLPR  polymorphism was significantly different between the MA and control groups (p=0 .007) . Individuals carrying the L allele presented 4 times increased risk of suffering MA than non carriers (p=0 .003) . This  association remained significant in patients with non hemiplegic aura (p=0 .008 OR=4 .7) . Interestingly, although these results support the  implication of SLC6A4 in MA, we observed that our group of patients  showed an overrepresentation of the 5HTTLPR L allele instead of the  5HTTLPR S variant that has been associated with migraine in most of the previously studied populations . This observation, together with Genetic analysis, linkage, and association16 the fact that linkage disequilibrium patterns differ among populations,  suggests that the 5HTTLPR polymorphism may not confer susceptibility  to migraine, but is in linkage disequilibrium with another variant directly  involved in this complex phenotype .",2006

During this process transmission along these axons is impeded . Even though MS is such a prevalent  disease, affecting 1 in 1000 individuals, the cause(s) of this complex condition is not yet fully understood . Nitrous oxide has been implicated  in the onset of MS because of its action in the inhibition of the folate and homocysteine metabolic cycles . 5,10 Methylenetetrahydrofolate  reductase ( MTHFR ) is one of the enzymes that plays a role in the  folate cycle .

Previously reported data showed defective  fibrinolysis in MS with PAI 1 being one of the major enzymes included.  The effects of fibrinolytic system are mediated by plasmin, the protease  generated by the action of plasminogen activators (PA) on the inactive precursor plasminogen . The major inhibitor of tissue PA is PAI 1 . The  genetic polymorphism 4G/5G modulates the expression of PAI 1 gene  and individuals with the 4G/4G genotype have increased plasma PAI 1 concentrations . PAI 1 4G/5G polymorphism was evaluated in the  group of 313 patients with multiple sclerosis (MS) and 376 healthy  controls from Slovenia and Croatia.

With a mutation  detection rate of 65% in this selected group of patients, which is within  the expected range, our method proved to be an efficient tool for detection of known and new point mutations in the NF1 gene . Currently,  in order to improve overall mutation detection rate, as a second step  patients without identifiable point mutation are being screened for large deletions and the results will be presented .Genetic analysis, linkage, and association1",2006

Deletions involving connexin 30 (GJB6) were also associated with  NSHL; A1555G mutation in mitochondrial (mt)DNA has been shown to predispose to aminoglycoside ototoxicity  . Aim of our study was to evaluate the prevalence of these molecular defects in the Italian population . 133 patients with mild to profound, familiar or apparently sporadic NSHL were studied . 513 unaffected controls were also screened to evaluate the carrier frequency  .  Mutation screening by DHPLC and sequencing for GJB2, multiplex  PCR for 309kb and 232kb deletions in GJB6 and restriction analysis for A1555G mutation were performed .38 patients (28,6%) showed molecular variants of GJB2 . In addition to  known mutations two novel defects (G109W and 153delT) were found  in compound  heterozygotes with 35delG . Six novel variants (G>C   3277, IVS1 6T>C, IVS1 2A>C, Y158Y, K221N, N62N) were also detected .

Yet, it is believed that single major genes play a crucial role in familial inheritance of low BMD . To search for a genetic locus  that explains a major part of the variation in susceptibility of low peak  BMD we performed a genome wide screen using 380 microsatellite  markers in a single extended family (n=31) with high prevalence of  low spinal BMD (Z(BMD)â¤ 2) and characterised by a young onset. The  pattern of inheritance of the low BMD trait in this family is suggestive for autosomal dominance .

Next to this a non parametric linkage analysis (NPL analysis) was carried out .The highest LOD score (2 .83) obtained in two point analysis, when an affected/unaffected trait model was used, was at 1p36 .3 (D1S468) .  The chromosomal region at 1p36 has been previously implicated in several other linkage studies of BMD .

Absolute quantification  was performed by real time PCR 7900 HT SDS, using TaqMan probes for exons 2,3 and 7 . For exons 1,4,5 and 6 we set up a Sybr Green assay  . In a patient we detected an heterozygous nucleotide change (CâG) in intron 1 (nucleotide 10703, ref . AL034417) and a single heterozygous insertion mutation (IVS4+3insA) in intron 4 splice site . These novel variants were not found in 100 control subjects . In the same patient  genomic rearrangements were excluded by absolute quantification in real time PCR .The relevant effect of DJ 1 is its putative role in neuroprotection .  Cells lacking DJ 1 have been shown to be more sensitive to cellular stressors . The IVS4+3insA mutation lies in a conserved sequence of the invariant AG splice acceptor site of intron 4 . We hypothesized that this variant  could have consequences on DJ 1 RNA, leading to an aberrant transcript . Moreover, the detected intronic change is potentially  functional because it is localized 159 bp after the transcriptional  activation site and approximately 42 bp downstream of an SP1 binding site . Synergic action of both heterozygous variants could account for clinical features of the examined patient .",2006

Preeclampsia is a multifactorial disease of pregnancy  . The large number  of epidemiologic studies supports its heritable nature . Immunological  maladaptation theory is one of the leading hypotheses of preeclampsia origin . According to it the maternal immune system does not adequately adapt to the semi allogenic fetus . Polymorphism in the 3â UTR of the  HLA G gene has been found to be associated with differences in HLA G expression and it might be involved in preeclampsia pathogenesis . The patients with severe preeclampsia (n=47), women without any  gynecologic complications and background disorders (controls, n=46)  and unrelated individuals from North West region of Russia (population, n=109) were included in this study  . A  14bp/+14bp polymorphism in 3â  UTR region of the HLA G gene was studied by PCR assay  . The distribution of HLA G genotypes was in accordance with the Hardy Weinberg Equilibrium (p>0 .05) . Although the frequency of +14/+14 genotype was 2 fold higher in patients (20 .9%) compared to the control group (10 .9%), the difference  was not statistically significant (p>0.05). However, the frequency  of +14/+14 genotype of the HLA G gene was significantly higher (28 .6%, p<0 .05) in patients with pure form of severe preeclampsia (without background disorders, n=28) and controls .In conclusion we  should point out that despite of rather small samples, the carriers of  +14/+14 genotype of the HLA G gene have significantly higher risk of preeclampsia as compared to women, with one or two  14 alleles .  Thus there is already substantial evidence supporting a role for HLA G polymorphism in preeclampsia .",2006

Premature Ovarian Failure (POF) is a disorder characterized by lack of ovulation and elevated gonadotropin level before 40 years of age .  POF has a frequency of about 1% among females and has become a relevant cause of female infertility  . A genetic component of the disorder  is demonstrated by numerous familial cases and by the frequent  observation of X chromosome rearrangements that led to the definition of a POF critical region in Xq . Characterization of the POF critical region by analysis of a large panel  of X chromosome rearrangements showed that most of the breakpoints mapped to a 16 Mb gene poor region corresponding to Xq21 . In this  region only 3 genes resulted interrupted by the POF associated  breakpoints but their role in the pathogenesis remains unclear as  extensive mutation analysis on a cohort of italian POF patients failed to demonstrate any causative variants . Recent results from association  studies suggested however that one of these genes may contribute to POF as a susceptibility factor  . Accordingly, expression analysis of genes surrounding X;autosome  balanced translocation breakpoints in Xq did not reveal ovary specific  genes while analysis of the autosomal regions in all instances showed  genes with specific expression in mouse ovaries, thus making them candidate genes for POF  . Investigation of the effect of the breakpoints  on chromatin organization of X chromosome and autosomal regions,  showed specific alterations of chromatin modifications only at the  promoters of autosomal genes translocated to the X and indicated a role of the critical region on ovarian gene expression .Genetic analysis, linkage, and association",2006

Utilizing control chromosomes from this study, we determined levels  of linkage disequilibrium (LD) across the genome and used this information to construct the Quebec LD map (QLDM) . The QLDM  contains 81,000 markers, with density adjusted according to variation of LD, resulting in marker spacing of 1 SNP per 10 to 40 kb . This  map was used to perform a WGAS for psoriasis using 500 trios from the QFP  . We also performed genome wide conditional analyses  using the risk and protective haplotypes from the well established PSORS1 locus . Regions epistatic to or in genetic heterogeneity with  PSORS1 were thereby identified. Both the WGAS and the conditional  analyses, identified multiple regions with P values that met the criteria  of genome wide significance. The top candidate regions were further  refined by fine mapping. Following fine mapping, on average the top  21 regions with p values < 10 5 (including 8 regions from conditional  analyses) spanned approximately 300 kb and contained ~3 genes (excluding regions from PSORS1 locus) . Single gene resolution was obtained for multiple regions . The associated genes are currently  being analyzed in silico  for the construction of GeneMaps which will  reveal the underlying genetic etiology of the disease .

Participants were genotyped for the AGT M235T polymorphism . The auditory verbal learning test was used to assess  different components of memory (immediate recall, learning, delayed recall, recognition) . The Stroop test (card I, II, III) and Trail Making Test (TMT) were used to examine executive function . Regression analysis  was performed to study the effect of the AGT M235T polymorphism on  the cognitive tests with adjustment for age, sex, inbreeding, education  and intelligence. We also evaluated whether hypertension modified the effect of M235T polymorphism . The 235T allele, which has been related to high angiotensin II levels  in plasma in previous studies, was significantly associated with  reduced selective attention, as measured by the Stroop test (card I;  p value=0.03, card II; p value=0.06), in the hypertension group only.  This finding might be explained by an increased risk of cardiovascular complications in the brain of those with hypertension . In contrast, the  235T allele was associated with a better performance in recognition (p value = 0 .07), in line with recent studies showing that higher levels of angiotensin II increase performance in memory related tasks . This  effect was not modified by hypertension. Thus, genes encoding RAS  components might affect specific cognitive domains through different physiological pathways .",2006
A novel method for analysis of 5 methylcytosine in DNA  by capillary electrophoresis mobility shift,P1031.,"E. Karger , V. L. Boyd, K. I. Moody, K. J. Livak, G. Zon, J. W. Burns","Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States","A simple and completely novel method will be presented for capillary  electrophoretic resolution of amplicons derived from methylated and  non methylated gDNA following bisulfite conversion. Growing interest  in the role of methylation of genomic DNA in epigenetics is evidenced  by the increasing number of publications and awarded grants each year . There are a variety of methods available for methylation  analyses, most requiring primers and/or probes specific to either the  fully methylated or fully non methylated sequence, following bisulfite  conversion. We now report, for the first time, our discovery of a  straightforward analysis of amplicons, following bisulfite conversion of gDNA, in samples of mixed methylation states . Using a single primer  pair for simultaneous amplification of bisulfite converted methylated  and unmethylated gDNA, we found the amplicons can be separated  during denaturating gel electrophoresis. The separation efficiency is based on the number of T vs . C (or G vs . A) differences in the  unmethylated and methylated sample, and is predictable based on the nucleotide composition of the amplicons . The amplicons are generated  using standard PCR protocols, and are directly analyzed after PCR on an ABI PRISMÂ® 3100 Genetic Analyzer  . The minimal number of steps,  and oligonucleotide primer and probe syntheses that are required for  this methylation analysis scheme simplifies the workflow process. The  same amplicon sample is suitable for additional analyses, such as  bisulfite sequencing, single base extension, or additional CE analyses.  We will also present our PCR conditions for robust generation of  amplicons from bisulfite converted gDNA.",2006

AittomÃ¤ki1,3","1FolkhÃ¤lsan Institute of Genetics, Helsinki, Finland, 2Department of Obstetrics  and Gynecology, Helsinki, Finland, 3Department of Clinical Genetics, Helsinki,  Finland","Recent studies indicate that p53 may regulate the response of embryonic cells to diverse environmental stresses . Moreover, it  appears that maintaining a fine balance of p53 protein levels within  embryonic cells is important for optimal development as both over   and underexpression can lead to different malformations or embryonic lethality  . Because altered levels and activity of the p53 protein may be  caused by mutations or polymorphisms in both the coding and non  coding regions of the gene we aimed to investigate if variations in p53  are associated with susceptibility for recurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) . We screened 86 Finnish patients (40 couples and 6 women) with unexplained RSA and 96 controls using DHPLC and sequencing . The  six intronic and three exonic variations detected have been previously reported and are predicted to be common polymorphisms . When  comparing the genotypes and allele frequencies of these variations  between patients and controls, the C11992A polymorphism in intron  3, located 29 bp upstream of exon 4, was shown to be significantly Genetic analysis, linkage, and association6 more frequent in the patients than in the controls . Women carrying the  rarer A allele have a more than two fold increased risk of miscarriage  (p=0 .0193, OR 2 .333, CI 1 .1305 4 .816), indicating that the A allele is associated with RSA . Further studies are, however, necessary to  define whether this polymorphism has functional consequences. If the  variation has a phenotypic effect, the C11992A variation could be one of the of genetic factors increasing susceptibility to RSA .",2006

It affects up to 10% of the general population, and over 60% of the diagnosed RLS cases are familial . The objective of the present study  was to search for genetic factors causing this disorder in the French Canadian (FC) population . methods : We performed a 10 cM genome  wide scan using a large FC pedigree . For the two point parametric  linkage analysis we used MLINK and for the multipoint parametric linkage analysis we used SIMEWALK2 .  Results : We detected an  autosomal dominant locus for RLS mapping to chromosome 20p13, with a maximum multipoint LOD score of 3 .87 at marker D20S849 .

SNP identification was performed  with an original bioinformatics tool combined to Polyphred software  and only SNP observed consistently in both directions at least twice in the sample were selected . The analysis of the 9600 sequences yielded 151 SNPs, out of which 45 were absent in the public databases .

In the present study we reported  a linkage analysis in a southern Italy family, including 23 members  of whom 12 individuals expressed a homogeneous phenotype of simple FS . Lod score values were negative for FEB1, FEB2, FEB4, FEB5, FEB6 but showed strong linkage to the FEB3 locus . SCN1A  gene lies in this locus, but gene mutations causing simple FS have not been found . Flanking intron primers were used to sequence 26 exons of the SCN1A gene . We found a M145T mutation in a well  conserved aminoacid in the first transmembrane segment of domain I, that cosgregated in all affected individuals . Functional studies in  mammalian cells demonstrated that the mutation causes a 60%  reduction of current density and a 10mV positive shift of the activation curve .

It still  remains uncertain if severe myoclonic epilepsy in infancy (SMEI)  represents the end of the spectrum within the GEFS+ phenotype, or  it should be considered a distinct entity  . Here we report three novel  SCN1A mutations in three different patients . Two patients had classic  SMEI phenotype with early infantile febrile seizures, atypical absences, cognitive impairment, ataxia and drug resistance . The third patient had a milder phenotype and normal neurological development . He  had early prolonged FS, afebrile motor seizures and absences, which disappeared with antiepileptic therapy  . The 26 exons of SCN1A gene were individually amplified using primers  based on intronic sequences. The purified PCR products were then sequenced and analyzed with an automatic sequencer  . We identified three novel SCN1A mutations. In the first of the two SMEI patients we found a missense mutation, T1289I . His mother and brother carried the same mutation, but they never had any seizure . The  second SMEI patient carried a de novo frame shift mutation, 3840insT, that lead to a premature stop codon in the exon 19 . The third patient  carried a de novo single nucleotide substitution in the invariant AG splice acceptor site of intron 24 . The results of our study reinforce the belief that SMEI probably results  from the cumulative effects or interactions of a few or several genes, of  which the reported GEFS+ gene is only one player  .

Suicidal behavior is  associated with a serotonin deficit, and clear sex specific differences in serotonergic system were demonstrated in a number of studies .  Gender specificity in epidemiology and psychopathology of suicidal behavior suggests an X linked genetic factor  . In the present study we  performed analysis of some serotonergic system genes located on  the X chromosome, namely the HTR2C , MAOA  and MAOB , in suicide  attempters, separately in men and women . Cases for this study were 283 suicide attempts from 94 men and 189 women . The control group consisted of 261 healthy volunteers: 133 men and 128 women . Three  polymorphisms: the HTR2C Cys23Ser , A/G in intron 13 of the MAOB   and EcoRV  RFLP of the MAOA  were analyzed using PCR technique .  We computed multivariative logistic regressions to examine the joint effects of several variables in predicting the suicidal group . Sex was a  significant predictor of suicide group (p<0.001). MAOB*A  allele (coding  high activity enzyme) was associated with suicide both in men (p=0 .024, OR=2 .13) and in women (p=0 .016, OR=1 .59) .

The association was observed in the rheumatoid factor  positive (RF+) RA subgroup, showing no interaction with HLA DRB1,  the first RA gene. However, the range of allele frequencies in patients  overlaps with the range in controls, resulting in a risk of false positive  findings. OBJECTIVE : We aimed at confirming the association by linkage, using the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) .

The TDT was followed by an allelic (AFBAC) and genotypic association  analysis with odds ratio (OR) and 95% confidence interval (CI).  Interaction with HLA DRB1 was tested using the new modelisation that we recently validated . RESULTS : The TDT demonstrated linkage, showing 61% of transmissions for the 1858T allele (P<0 .002), contributed by RF+ RA families (63%, P<0 .001), with no linkage in RF  RA families (53%, NS) . In keeping with the litterature, the allele frequency increased from 10% in controls to 16% in RF+ RA (P<0 .001)  and the risk genotype (1858T/620W +) from 18% to 28% (P<0.001 ; OR=1,8 (CI 1,3 2,6)) .

Hereditary  haemorrhagic telangiectasia (HHT or Rendu Osler Weber disease)  is characterized by epistaxis, mucocutaneous telangiectases and  visceral arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) caused by mutations in Endoglin (ENG) or activin receptor like kinase 1 (ALK1) . Hereditary benign telangiectasia (HBT) is another, more rare variant . Affected  individuals present with cutaneous, punctate, radiating or arborising telangiectases . HBT distinguishes from the more serious hereditary  hemorrhagic telangiectasia, by the lack of AVMs and absence of mucosal lesions . These two telangiectasias are inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with variable penetrance . Another similar  hereditary cutaneous phenotype is CM AVM caused by mutations in RASA1 . These patients have more homogeneous, round to oval  pinkish red cutaneous lesions, atypical capillary malformations, which are sometimes associated with AVMs . We report a family with cutaneous telangiectasias with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance . The affected individuals develop  large, heteregenous telangiectasias, which are not associated with AVMs . This could be a more extensive variant of HBT  . We performed  a genome wide linkage analysis using microsatellite markers and SNP genotyping assay with the GeneChip Human Mapping 10K Array  . The  analysis excludes the three candidate genes, endoglin, ALK1 and RASA1 . This provides evidence for existence of a different causative gene for this type of hereditary telangiectasia .

The genetic predisposition appears to be an important  causative factor and current evidences suggest that TLE represents a complex phenotype with a polygenic or multifactorial inheritance .  Association studies showed that the prion protein gene (PRNP) is highly  prevalent in patients with intractable temporal lobe epilepsy and may  influence the surgical outcome. We evaluated the genetic contribution of PRNP gene in mild temporal lobe epileptic patients . We analysed  the PRNP M129V polymorphism in 289 patients with mild TLE and  compared to a neurologically unaffected age and sex matched control  group (n=272).

Although, there was no statistically significant difference in the genotype distribution within the study groups (p=0 .0101), interestingly,  we observed that the 129V allele was highly represented only in  women with TLE compared to control group (p=0.006, OR=1.632;  95%CI=1.15 2.31). These findings further support the hypothesis that  the common methionine/valine polymorphism at codon 129 of the PRNP gene may modify the susceptibility to mild TLE .

These effects are diagnosed easily by performing a  re analysis, but tri allelic patterns are sometimes observed at a single  locus in a multiplex STR profile. These extra peaks are not a result of a mixture but are reproducible artifacts of the sample . In a two siblings  bone marrow transplantation (BMT) chimerism analysis, the buccal  swab recipientâs genotype exhibits alleles 22, 23, and 27 at the FGA locus . This tri allelic banding pattern was restricted to a single locus  within a thirteen locus profile. Before performing BMT analysis, the  anomalous profile was studied further and additional tissue samples were collected to establish the genetic basis of the observed pattern .  Blood, buccal cells, coutaneus biopsy and plucked hairs, that showing  the same multibanded pattern, were investigated to the relative allele  proportions. The three alleles profile observed in several tissues  excludes the presence of microsatellites instability (MSI) frequently  detected in human neoplasia. A systematic examination of this profile  showed the unequal signal intensities of the three allele in all tissue  samples examined, suggesting that these mutational changes are due to somatic mosaicism . We concluded that more than one cell lineage  was affected and that the size differences between two minor alleles  would reflect the magnitude of the mutational change, depending upon  the particular stage of tissue development at which the mutational event occur  .",2006

Proinflammatory  cytokines, interleukin 18 (IL 18) and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF  Î±), both have been implicated in the pathogenesis of T1DM. Additionally  IL 18 plays a role in regulation of TNF Î± production. Therefore we  tested an association of two single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in  promoter regions of these genes with the susceptibility to T1DM in the Dalmation population (South Croatia) . MATERIALS AND METHODS: 134 T1DM patients and 132 control  subjects were tested for a G 137C change in a promoter region of IL  18 gene by a sequence specific PCR. TNF Î± G 308A promoter variant  was genotyped in a larger group of T1DM patients (206) and controls  (144) by standard PCR followed with NcoI endonuclease restriction .  Data were analysed using chi square test . RESULTS: A distribution of IL 18 G 137C and TNF Î± G 308A promoter  variants was equal between the T1DM patients and the controls (p=0 .9448 and p=0 .0655, respectively) . CONCLUSIONS: The present study provided no evidence of  association of IL 18 and TNF Î± promoter variants with susceptibility to T1DM in Dalmatian population . However as genotype frequencies  for TNF Î± G 308A polymorphism were close to the limit of statistical  significance (p=0.0655) further analysis should be conducted.",2006

Peltonen1","1National Public Health Institute of Finland, Helsinki, Finland, 2Dept","We recently reported association in Finnish families of the USF1  gene  with FCHL, a common dyslipidemia predisposing to cardiovascular  disease (CVD) . Expression and molecular studies were conducted  in members of dyslipidemic families to investigate the functional  relevance of different USF1  alleles on target genes in adipose tissue .  The role of specific USF1 alleles was also addressed by quantitative  analysis of arterial plaques in a human autopsy series . The best associating SNP in the FCHL families is located in a  conserved putative enhancer element in intron 7 that we established to bind nuclear proteins . In 19 fat biopsies, carriers of the risk allele of  USF1  presented with transcriptional changes in USF1  target genes  APOE, ABCA1 and AGT, all relevant to the pathogenesis of CVD . To further establish the role of different USF1  alleles on quantitative  measures of arterial atherosclerosis in humans, we examined two  autopsy series consisting of 700 males from the Helsinki area with sudden death, collected 1981 82 and 1991 92 . The data included  quantitative classification of atherosclerotic lesions in coronary arteries and abdominal aorta . In the autopsy series, specific USF1  alleles showed association with  size of fibrotic intimal lesions, amount of calcification of the arteries and atherosclerosis of the brain (P=0 .04   <0 .0001), as well as with death from ischemic heart disease (OR 5 .00, 95% CI 1 .75 14 .30, P=0 .003) . These results underline the importance of variants of the USF1  gene  as a CVD risk factor at the population level and give more insight into the pathogenesis associated with these genetic variants .",2006

IRF6 belongs to the IRF family of nine transcription factors . Both VWS and  PPS display an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance with high penetrance but variable expressivity  . The phenotype of VWS includes  pits in the lower lip, clefts of the lip and/or palate and hypodontia . In  addition, PPS includes webbing of the lower limbs, syndactyly of the toes and digits, ankyloblepheron, oral synechia, and genital abnormalities .  We performed direct sequence analysis on IRF6 exons on samples  from two large geographically defined cohorts, one from Brazil (113 VWS and 1 PPS) and one of mixed origin (197 VWS and 36 PPS) . We  identified mutations in IRF6 exons in 69% of all families with VWS, and 97% of families with PPS . The distribution of VWS causing mutations was not random, with exons 3, 4, 7, and 9 accounting for 80% . In total,  we identified 87 protein truncation mutations, scattered throughout  the gene, and 127 missense mutations that are concentrated in the DNA binding and protein binding domains . With 50% of the samples  sequenced from the CEPH diversity panel, none of these mutations have been observed . In addition, PolyPhen and SIFT analyses of the  missense mutations suggest that they are more likely to be damaging to gene function than all possible missense mutations (p< .001) . This  extensive mutation screen will assist clinicians to provide a DNA  diagnosis for patients with orofacial clefts and to identify genotype phenotype and structure function relationships .",2006

Gender specific effects of this polymorphism have not been studied yet . Purpose:  To investigate the association between the FokI polymorphism  in VDR and muscle strength in older men and women .methods:  The FokI polymorphism (rs2228570, Sequenom  MassARRAY SNP) was genotyped in 99 men (67 .1+/ 4 .2yr) and in 102 women (66 .4+/ 4 .5yr) . The peak torque of knee extension and  flexion was measured at velocities of 0Â°/s, 60Â°/s, 180Â°/s and 240Â°/s.  Genotype phenotype associations were tested using AN(C)OVA with muscle+bone cross sectional area of the thigh as covariate . Results: FokI genotypes were in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in  both men and women (p=0 .14 and p=0 .07, respectively) . In men no  significant association was found between FokI and any of the measured  strength phenotypes. In women, however, significant association was  found with all measurements of knee strength except peak torque  flexion at 0Â°/s and 60Â°/s. For most of the strength measurements the  heterozygous group performed less well in dynamic knee strength than both homozygous groups (p<0 .05) .conclusion:  The VDR FokI polymorphism is associated with knee  peak torque in senior women but not in men, confirming the possibility of  gender specific effects. The lack of association in men confirms results  of other research groups. As this is the first study to investigate the  association between the VDR FokI polymorphism and knee strength in  women, further research will be necessary to elucidate these findings.",2006

Previous investigations  indicated that no association is present between plasma levels of protein Z and ZPI and venous thrombosis . However, it has been  recently shown that two nonsense mutations (R67X and W303X) of  the ZPI gene are associated with venous thromboembolic disease  (VTE) in New Zealand (1) . Aim of this study was to investigate the presence of the R67X and  W303X mutations of the ZPI gene in VTE patients and control subjects  in a population of North East Italian region . DNA samples were collected from 183 consecutive VTE patients and 113 normal controls . The R67X and W303X mutations were detected  by bidirectional allele specific PCR, according to the method published by Van de Water et al . (1) . The R67X mutation was not present in any of the VTE patients or control subjects . The W303X mutation was present in two VTE patients (1,1%)  and one control (0,85%). This difference was not statistically significant.

Five XLRP loci have been mapped although  only two genes, RPGR  and RP2, have been cloned . We screened 30 unrelated XLRP Spanish families in order to determine the molecular cause of their disease . Methods: We have performed haplotype analysis and, in those families  in which the disease segregates with the RPGR and/or the RP2 locus, we carried out mutational screening . We have analyzed the  RP2 gene,  the first 15 exons of RPGR  at cDNA level and the ORF 14 and ORF 15  exons at genomic DNA level . Results: After haplotype analysis we could rule out the implication in  the disease of RP2 and RPGR in 6 and 4 families, respectively  . Among the 30 unrelated XLRP, we found 16 mutations in RPGR  (7 are  novel) and 4 mutations in RP2 (3 are novel) . Conclusions: In our cohort of XLRP families RPGR also seems to be the most prevalent form of XLRP  . Based in our results we propose a protocol for molecular diagnosis of  XLRP families, in four consecutive steps: 1) Haplotype analysis 2) In case that haplotype was not informative, we propose to analyze exon ORF 15 of RPGR gene . 3) Later the first 15 exons of gene RPGR. 4) And finally the 5 exons of gene RP2, in the last two cases using  mRNA .

To find a possible association to brain cancer susceptibility, we  analyzed both genotype and allele frequencies of XRCC3 Thr241Met polymorphism from DSB pathway in brain cancer patients . We have studied 230 individuals, previously diagnosed with brain cancer and 393 healthy controls . Analysis of allele distribution in XRCC3 Thr241Met showed a greater  representation of the Thr allele in the group of patients when compared to the controls (p=0 .000) and it is associated with an increased cancer risk (OR= 2 .653, 95% CI=2 .007 3 .507) .Genetic analysis, linkage, and association6 POLYMORPHISM n GENOTYPE P value XRCC3 241 Thr/Thr Thr/Met Met/Met Controls 38570 18 .2% 174 45 .2% 141 36 .6% Patients 14763 42 .9% 64 43 .5% 20 13 .6% <0.0011 Meningiomasa5524 43 .6% 25 45 .5% 6 10 .9% <0.0012 Gliomas 9239 42 .40% 39 42 .4% 14 15 .2% <0.0013 a Difference of genotype frequencies .

In aetiology of Hirschsprung disease various genes are included . It seems that the  most important role in its aetiology plays RET gene . There are plenty  of different mutations in this gene . No mutation is fully penetrant and  they have varying effects on the length of the aganglionic segment of the intestine . The aim of our study was to analyse single nucleotide  polimorphisms (SNP) of RET gene in exon 2, 3, 7, 11, 13, 14 and 15 .  To test how the Hd phenotype may be affected by the presence of  genetic variants, we compared the molecular results with clinical and long term follow up data . Molecular DNA analyses were performed in 70 patients with Hd . We found a short and ultra short segment of aganglionic gut in 84,3%, and long segment in 15,7% of all patients .  The 135G/A RET polymorphism in exon 2 was overârepresented in  Hd populations compared to normal, unrelated control individuals .  Two other polymorphisms: 2071G/A (exon 11) and 2712C/G (exon 15)  were underârepresented in the population of Hd. Moreover, the 135G/ A RET variant has been strongly shown to be associated with the Hd  phenotype . We have demonstrated that RET haplotypes containing  these polimorphisms play a role in the aetiology of Hd . While the allelic  variant in exon 2 can predispose to Hirschsprung disease development,  it seems that tested polymorphisms in exon 11 and 15 could have a protective effect against the severe type of aganglionosis .",2006

We found that C4B*Q0 confers an increased risk  of angina pectoris (AP), myocardial infarction (MI) and MI associated mortalities in smokers . C4B null alleles were raised at diagnosis in smokers with AP (p=0 .02) and MI (p=0 .001), but conspicuously absent  in patients who survived a MI and continued to smoke for a period exceeding 3 years . The risk of MI short term (<6 months) mortality  was much higher in C4B*Q0 carriers than in non carriers (adjusted odds ratio: 17 .77, p=0 .003) . In non smokers no increase was observed in C4B*Q0 at MI or AP  . The age associated decrease in C4B*Q0  previously observed in two remote Caucasian populations was in the  present study found to be strongly associated with smoking and to  occur already at age 50. C4B*Q0 can now be identified as a major  covariate of smoking in precipitating the risk for MI and associated deaths .

In women, having  had children is one of the non genetic factors reportedly associated with an increased risk of AD . Among genetic factors involved in AD  susceptibility, the APOE e*4 allele has a major role and its presence  reduces age at AD onset. But APOE is also thought to influence  human reproduction as well, and common APOE genotypes seem to be associated with differential fertility  . With this study, we investigated  possible relationships between APOE genotype, past fertility, and AD  onset age in a sample of 116 women with the sporadic form of the disease . Results from a comparison of APOE genotype distribution in parous and nulliparous AD women supported previous findings  indicating that the e*3/e*3 genotype was associated with higher fertility and the e*4 carrying genotypes with lower fertility  . When the  combined effects of fertility and APOE genotypes on AD onset age  were analysed parity was found to be associated with a significantly  lower AD onset age ( 72.3Â±5.9 years) than nulliparity (79.0Â±5.6 years; P=0 .004) among e*3/e*3 homozygotes . Since e*3/e*3 is the most frequent APOE genotype in Europe (0 . 56  0 .70), past fertility may  influence AD susceptibility in many women. A similar effect was absent  among e*4 carriers.

With  the aim of identification of heterozygous carriers and establishment  of the disease screening pattern, as well as for the description of the  gene pool ethnic features, the C282Y and H63D mutations in the HFE  gene were examined 594 individuals from 5 populations of Central Asia  belonging to Turkic group of Altaic language familty: Kazakhs, Uzbeks,  Kirgizis, Turkmens, and Uighurs, and from 2 populations belonging to Iranic group of Indoeuropean language family: Tadjiks, and Kurds . C282Y mutation has been found in Uighurs (0 .009), Kazakhs and Tadjiks (0 .012), but hasnât been found in other populations . H63D  mutation has been revealed in all investigated populations with frequency ranging from 0 .024 in Tadjiks to 0 .139 in Turkmens . The  obtained results demonstrate that Central Asian populations are  genetically situated between European and Eastern Asian populations, corresponding with Central Asia geographic location . There was no  population differentiation both in general and relative to the population  linguistic attribution, neither at the individual loci examined, nor over the two loci . The revealed low frequency of the C282Y mutation (< 1%),  which is the most functionally important of all known HFE mutations for  the development of hereditary hemochromatosis type 1, reduced the  attractivity of molecular genetic screening of the disease in the risk groups in this region as an effective diagnostic tool .",2006

We used the population based dataset of the Hungarian Case Control  Surveillance of Congenital Abnormalities in order to calculate the  frequencies of drug intake by mothers during their pregnancy from  1997 through 2002. Cases with birth defects (n = 7,559) were identified  from the HCAR, two healthy control babies (n = 14,448) were identified by public health nurses . For statistical analysis, we applied logistic regression . Medication use among younger pregnant women (<25 years)  was higher compared to older maternal age group (>=25 years)  (OR=1.21;95% CI=1.12 1.32). Vitamins, mineral supplements were  used by the majority of mothers among both cases and controls  (76% any time during pregnancy; 38% during the first trimester).

Medication use was lower among both case (19%)  and control (13%) mothers during the first trimester in comparison with  intake during the second and third trimester (28%; 23%, respectively).  Our preliminary analysis showed that large proportion of pregnant  women use medications in Hungary, which is higher among mothers of  cases with birth defects compared to the general Hungarian pregnant  population represented by mothers of healthy control babies in the  dataset. Our findings suggest the continuous need of postmarketing  drug surveillance among pregnant women in Hungary to evaluate the  risk benefit of medication use.",2006

We present  results of the population based epidemiological study of the classical form of Cornelia de Lange Syndrome (CdLS) .The data were provided by 33 registries form 16 European countries . Registries participate  in the large European network of birth defect registries   EUROCAT, using the same epidemiological methodologies . 106 cases of CdLS  have been identified in the total of 8 604 049 births, which corresponds to a prevalence of 1 .23/100000 births . There were 96 live births, 3 stillbirths, and 6 terminations of pregnancy  . Prenatal diagnosis by  ultrasound examination accounts for 23 .5% of all diagnosed cases .  Live born infants with CdLS have a high first week survival rate (81%) . The most frequent major congenital malformations associated with CdLS are limb defects (73 .1 %), congenital heart defects (45 .6 %), central nervous system malformations (40 .2%) and cleft palate  (21.7%). In the majority of cases the karyotype is normal. Identified  abnormal karyotypes (46,XYdel(3)(q12q21),inv(5)(p13q13) and 46,XX  t(X;22)(p11;qter)) presumably disrupt genes identified to be responsible for CdLS . Maternal age and paternal age do not seem to be the risk factors for CdLS . Almost 80% of the cases born after the 37 th week of  gestation weight less than 2500 g; low birth weight correlates with a more severe phenotype, including severe limb anomalies .

Genetic polymorphism at the  CYP2D6  gene locus is  responsible for pronounced interindividual and interethnic differences in the catalytic activity of the enzyme . Four main metabolic phenotypes  have been described in human populations : poor, intermediate, rapid, and ultra rapid metabolizers . Determination of individual metabolizer  status before initiation of therapy is crucial to ensure optimal dosing  recommendations; this should improve patient outcome by reducing  adverse effects and improving drug efficacy. The objective of this study is to identify the most informative CYP2D6   genetic markers for the prediction of individual metabolizer status . To  address this issue, several data mining tools were explored : decision  trees, random forests, artificial neural networks, and the multifactor dimensionality reduction (MDR) method . Marker selection was performed in eight population samples of various ethnic origin . Our results show that the number of polymorphisms required to predict  CYP2D6 metabolic phenotype with a high predictive accuracy can be  dramatically reduced owing to the strong haplotype block structure  observed at CYP2D6  . MDR and neural networks provided nearly  identical results and performed the best . The results of this study will  be helpful for the design of time  and cost effective genotyping tests,  adapted to specific populations, that could be used as routine tools in clinical practice .",2006

Knowledge of these  mutation spectra is needed for diagnostic purposes, for counselling in  CF families and for screening, either neonatal to improve prognosis, or preconceptional and prenatal to provide for reproductive options .  There is only limited knowledge about the mutation spectra in migrant populations in Europe . Objectives: To determine the identity and frequency of mutations found  in Turkish and North African CF patients and to study whether the test  sensitivity of common CFTR gene mutation panels is appropriate for Mediterranean people when offering CF carrier screening . Methods: In a survey among 373 European CF centres, we asked  whether and which mutations have been found among Turkish and North African CF patients .Results: Fifty different mutations had been found on 75 .2% (95%CI: 70 .4 80 .0%) of the CFTR alleles of patients (n=156) with both parents from Turkey or North Africa . The mean sensitivity of common CF gene mutation panels to detect these mutations was 50 .6% (95% CI: 45 .0   56.2%), and differed significantly between Turkish and North African people: 41 .7% (95% CI: 34 .7 48 .6%) versus 66 .4% (95% CI: 57 .7 75 .2%) . A sensitivity of 63 .6% (95% CI: 58 .2 69 .0) can be achieved by expanding the mutation panels with these Mediterranean mutations . Conclusion: A low test sensitivity of common CF gene mutation panels for CF carrier screening of Mediterranean people was observed .

When  analysing diseases with a complex inheritance, the detection of  deletions is very important, since deletions may in many cases directly contribute in the causation of disease . Null alleles, other than  deletions, are also of interest since undetected null alleles may cause errors in haplotype inference and population genetic analyses . We  have earlier described how deletions causing a dominant disease can be detected (Johansson et al . 2005 Hum .Hered . 60:26 35) . Here  we investigate a method that is useful for complex diseases, but also for normal variation . Null alleles can be detected as a special case of non Mendelian inheritance, i .e . when a parent and child appear to be homozygous for different alleles . The probability for this event was  derived for: a parent and one child, a trio, a trio with one grandparent and a trio with two grandparents . The power to detect a deletion for  a fixed overall number of investigated individuals was calculated for SNPs and multiallelic markers with varying allele frequencies . The  results show that for SNPs, a trio with two grandparents are always  more efficient than the other family types despite a lower total number of founder chromosomes . For multiallelic markers the outcome varies .  The method was applied to SNP data in 41 three generation pedigrees containing 4 5 individuals . Several cases of segregating deletions and other null alleles were detected and will be described .",2006

Between 1979 1988,1989 1996 and 1997 2002 TOP for DS was 16 .2%, 46 .8% and 73 .4%, respectively  .During the 3 time periods  the livebirth prevalence per 10,000 of DS was 9 .79, 10 .26, and 5 .14, respectively  .The total prevalence of Down syndrome was 11 .69,19 .31  and 19 .29, respectively  .The livebirth prevalence of DS has since 1997  increasingly diverged from the rising total prevalence .The main reason for these observations is the increase in maternal age, from 24 .8 to 30 .1 . In conclusion the rise of maternal age has brought with it an increase in the number of pregnancies affected by DS .The widespread practice  of routine prenatal diagnosis and TOP has counteract the effect of maternal age in its effect on livebirth prevalence of DS . However the  high total prevalence of fetal DS shows that more efforts on the primary prevention of chromosomal abnormalities are needed .",2006

Studies of their genetic  diversity were previously carried out at the level of Y chromosome and mitochondrial DNA . Here we are extending them to a polymorphic segment of the dystrophin locus in the chromosome Xp21 .3 . We genotyped thirty six polymorphisms (substitutions, small  insertions/deletions and T repeat microsatellite) in eight population groups from Armenia and derived the underlying haplotypes . 416  Armenian chromosomes were compared with previously typed 1121 chromosomes from Africa, Asia and Europe . Armenian populations were found to share 42 common haplotypes with other populations .  We also found 15 new Armenian specific haplotypes representing 4.6%  chromosomes, which can be derived from the frequent haplotypes Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology assuming simple recombination event . Our results show that geographically distinct Armenian regions do  not significantly differ both in the haplotype composition and in the  haplotype diversity (h=0.8) implying that gene flow took place in  the whole territory of Armenia . Fst analysis indicate that only 0 .23% of genetic variation is among populations and 99 .77%   within populations . Likewise, comparable haplotype diversity of Armenian  population to Europe and Arabian Peninsula also suggests gene flow  rather than isolation as well as a possibility of admixture, consistent  with the geography of Armenia, situated at the borders of Europe and Asia . These conclusions are also in agreement with the principal component analysis . These results will be discussed in the context of  other genetic systems studied earlier, providing interesting insight into genetic history of Armenian population .",2006
cytogenetic study on the effect of Prestige  oil on human  health,P1108.,"PÃ©rez CadahÃ­a1,2, B. Laffon1,2, E. PÃ¡saro1, J. MÃ©ndez2","1Toxicology Unit, La CoruÃ±a, Spain, 2Dept","Cell and Molecular Biology, Univer   sity of A CoruÃ±a, La CoruÃ±a, Spain. In November, 2002, the oil tanker Prestige  broke up in front of Galicia,  spilling more than 73,000 tons of crude oil . The oil was composed  basically of volatile organic compounds (VOC), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) and resins . From the beginning, a lot of people worked in the cleaning tasks . Among them, there were volunteers  that collaborated for one week (V), hired manual workers (MW) and high pressure cleaner workers (HPW) . The aim of this work was to  evaluate the genotoxic risk that oil exposure could exert on the human health . Environmental exposure to VOC was evaluated by passive dosimetres and a chromatographic methodology  . Two genotoxicity  tests were applied on human lymphocytes: micronucleus (MN) and sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) . It is well known that some intrinsic  factors may modulate the interindividual different responses to an exposure . Since epoxide hydrolase (encoded by EPHX1 gene) is one  of the main enzymes that take part in COV and PAH metabolisms,  and paying attention to the activating character of this enzyme when  dealing with these substances, we have also evaluated the association  between two polymorphisms in EPHX1 gene and the cytogenetic parameters analysed . No exposure effect was detected on MN frequency, but HPW showed  significantly higher SCE values than controls. Sex effect was observed  in SCE test and age influence was significant in the exposed population for both tests . Smoking increased SCE frequency both in exposed and in controls . Finally, the effect of epoxide hydrolase expected activity on the genotoxicity of the Prestige oil seemed not to be relevant .",2006

Bianchi","University âVita Saluteâ   San Raffaele, Milano, Italy","Adducin functions within the cytoskeleton as an heterodimer that is formed by an a_subunit and either a b_or g subunit . Each subunit  is coded by genes (ADD1, ADD2, ADD3) mapping on different chromosomes . In kidney tissue adducin expression leads to a prevalent presence of a g_heterodimer  . Hypertensive patients carrying the  ADD1 460Trp variant (rs4961) have a flattened slope of the pressure natriuresis curve . Epistatic interaction between ADD1 460Trp and  ADD3 IVS11+386G (rs3731566 SNP5) polymorphisms affects 24h  ambulatory blood pressure, pulse pressure and pressure natriuresis relationship in three indipendent studies . AIM: We investigated the pattern of variation at ADD3 locus starting  from SNP5 performing two different approaches: 1) SNP and haplotype  analysis; 2) comparative genomic analysis in different populations. METHODS: Bioinformatic searching in various databases (dbSNP,  ABI Celera, CNG, HapMap, Ensembl, UCSC); genotyping of 100  hypertensive patients; haplotype analysis using the criteria of Gabriel in Haploview package . RESULTS: 1 ADD3 SNP5 is peculiar of Europeans and the derived G  allele (MAF 0,40) is only included in the most frequent and long range haplotype class (H1) . 2  Only in Europeans ADD3 genomic region, but not surrounding genes, reports a negative Tajimaâs D value . 3 ADD3  HapMap data comparison indicates an unusual frequency spectrum of higher degree of rare variants only in Europeans . CONCLUSIONS: All these peculiarities raise the possibility that positive  selection recently has been acting or has acted in ADD3 region and  that the SNP5/haplotypeH1 spread rapidly in Europe, such as in skin pigmentation regulatory genes .",2006

One specific mutation 35delG, accounts for up to  70 % of the mutations detected in European populations and is one of  the most frequent disease mutations identified so far. The aim of this  study is to determine the percentage of carriers of this mutation in the Greek Cypriot population . Genomic DNA was isolated from a total of 405 healthy unrelated Greek Cypriot adults . Screening for the frameshift 35delG mutation  was performed by using an allele specific PCR protocol. Moreover,  using the Poisson probability distribution, we compared the carrier  frequencies of the 35delG mutation of the Greek Cypriot population to the various European and Middle Eastern populations . The carrier frequency in the Greek Cypriot population was estimated to be 2 .5 % and is similar to that observed in other European populations .  The variance estimate for 35delG mutation produces slightly wider  intervals with the Poisson model when compared with Binomial probability variance estimate .",2006

The  RET proto oncogene is a major HSCR gene, whose  coding sequence mutations account for a small proportion of cases,  while a common noncoding variant in intron 1 has been proposed as a major disease factor  . We have collected HSCR families from six countries over three  continents, and genotyped 2,672 individuals for 14 markers at the RET  locus . Overall, the T allele of the intron1 âI1 .357â SNP, demonstrated to  be an enhancer mutation, showed the highest transmission to affected  sibs (Ï=0.85; p=5.06 *10 66), with a frequency of 59% among transmitted  alleles and 24% in untransmitted chromosomes . Differences among  sample sets were consistent with the higher prevalence of HSCR in Chinese than in Caucasian populations . To prove the identity by descent Normal variation, population genetics, genetic epidemiology of the mutation, we reconstructed transmitted and untransmitted  haplotypes . In Caucasians, the two haplotypes that included the I1 .357  T allele, called âlongâ and âshortâ, were the most frequently transmitted, while in the Chinese sample only the long haplotype was present .  These haplotypes share a common allelic combination extending from 5â UTR to exon 5 . We conclude that the enhancer mutation arose on the long haplotype  which, after the Asian European split, rearranged to give also the short haplotype .

Reilly2","1University of MA School of Public Health and Health Sciences, Amherst, MA,  United States, 2University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, Philadelphia,  PA, United States","Background: The recent explosion of molecular level information  coupled with large epidemiological studies, presents an exciting  opportunity to uncover the genetic underpinnings of complex diseases;  however, analytic methods accounting for (1) synergy across a large  number of genetic loci and environmental factors and (2) uncertainty in allelic phase, will be essential . Methods: To this aim, we propose  a combination of multiple imputation and mixed effects modeling to  determine whether combinations of genetic polymorphisms contribute to ART associated hypertriglyceridemia in N=626 individuals with HIV 1 .  Four candidate genes were considered: ApoC III, SREBP1c, TNF alpha and MDR 1 . Simulation studies were performed to characterize the power and false discovery rates associated with this method . Results:  The proposed analytical technique identified an overall interaction  between ApoC III, TNF alpha, and PI exposure within Hispanics but not in Caucasians and Blacks . Simulation studies suggested that a sample  size of N=340 provides greater than 80% power to detect a standard deviation in multi locus effects as low as 0 .4 times the error standard deviation in 1,2,3 and 4 locus genotype models . False discovery rates were consistently <10% for 1,2,3 and 4 locus models . Conclusions:  The pathophysiology of dyslipidemia in ART treated HIV patients is  likely to be multifactorial and involve synergy among several gene and gene drug pathways . This manuscript presents a novel statistical  method to explore potential multi locus effects on plasma TGs across candidate genes that accounts for potential ambiguity in allelic phase .  Ultimately, this approach will allow investigators to discover complex  clinical and biological associations in the context of unobservable genetic information .",2006

These markers may be useful to control for the presence of genetic structure due to admixture (Bonilla et al . 2005) .  In the present study, AIMs were represented by mitochondrial DNA  (mtDNA), Y chromosome and three SNPs in the P gene associated with human pigmentation . Twelve Russian populations from European Russia were studied . It was found that 1 .5% of mtDNAs found in Russians fall into East Eurasian haplogroups . However, two  populations from North Western Russia (Velikij Novgorod and Volot) exhibited more than 3 .5% of East Eurasian lineages . Y chromosome  data show that only Pskov population (also from North Western  Russia) demonstrates a significant similarity with Finno Ugric/Baltic populations . Variability of Y chromosome microsatellite loci indicates  that high frequency of haplogroup N3 in Pskov population (35%) is  caused mostly by the presence of Baltic N3 variants, although gene  pools of Russians from central and southern parts of European Russia  are characterized by prevalence of lineages characteristic for Finno Ugric populations . Results of the P gene variation study show that  there are significant differences between distribution of SNP*R419G in Russian populations . Frequency of 419G allele (which is thought  to be associated with green/hazel colour of eyes) is much higher in  North Western Russians (6% in Novgorod and Pskov samples) than in South Western ones (3 .6% in Belgorod sample) . Thus, the data  presented demonstrate that North Western Russian populations  represent a complex pattern of population structure, reflecting diverse  interactions that occurred at different times between populations of West and East Eurasian ancestry  .",2006

In the IGF2 DMR, we found an average methylation level compatible  with the expected median methylated status, but with a highly variable  methylation level at successive CpGs, yielding a DMR specific profile irrespective of the biological sample . In contrast the methylation profile often departed from the expected  median methylated stage in maternal lymphocytes as well as in placental samples in the H19 DMR . Rather, three distinct methylation  levels were observed that were specific for a certain individual.  Moreover, a predominantly monoallelic expression of H19 was  preserved independently of the DMR methylation status demonstrating  that DMR allele specific methylation and allele specific expression of imprinted genes are not always correlated . Preliminary analysis of relatives from three families showed that the  inheritance of these methylation profiles was compatible with a simple Mendelian model considering one gene with three alleles . These results should lead us to be cautious when transferring results derived in mice to human epigenetics .",2006

Three hundreds and four TB, 49 salmonellosis, and 129  control cases matched by age and gender were genotyped by IL12B   1188A/C polymorphism . Also, 40 family trios with tuberculosis affected offspring were studied by Transmission/Disequlibrium Test (TDT) . The prevalence of the 1188C allele in TB (0 .240Â±0 .018) and in salmonellosis  (0.347Â±0.048) was significantly higher than in controls (0.174Â±0.024;  Ï2 = 4.075, p=0.044 and Ï2 = 11 .264, p=0 .001, respectively) . Also, the  1188C allele was overtransmitted from heterozygous parents to TB  offspring as compared to the alternate (13 vs. 2 times; TDT = 8.067, p = 0 .005) . Thus, both case control and family based association data  suggest that IL12B  1188A/C polymorphism predispose to Th1 mediated  infectious disorders due to intracellular bacteria . This association may  be because of impaired expression rate of the 1188C allele or due to  its linkage disequilibrium with other common polymorphisms in IL12B  .",2006

Alternative  promoters have recently been shown to be common to almost half of all human genes . The function of regulatory elements can be modulated by alleleic variants usually termed âregulatory SNPsâ . These may affect  transcription levels, alternative splicing and mRNA stability as well as  translation or post translational modification. In a candidate gene based LD mapping project of the QT interval,  we discovered a SNP (rs727957 G>T) located 50 kb upstream of  the KCNE1 gene which had an effect on QT interval in the general population (KORA S 4000, p =0 .0051) . 1 HapMAp data indicates this SNP may be under selection (polymorphic in CEU but monomorphic in HCB, JPT and YRI populations) .  Bioinformatic analysis shows that the transversion can produce a new  transcription factor binding site for the muscular transcription factor TEF 1 . Analysis of cDNAs from 48 different human hearts showed  that 3 alternative promoters of KCNE1 exist. All identified transcripts  of KCNE1 (contain up to 5 exons) are translated to the same KCNE1  protein. SNP rs727957 influences alternative promoter usage of KCNE1 . High resolution LD mapping of complex traits thus is shown to be a  powerful gene annotation method for functional genomics and systems biology  .",2006

The lactase persistence phenotype frequencies vary in human  populations, generally low frequencies may be found in the majority  of tested populations in sub Saharan Africa, but, in some populations,  particularly pastoral groups, it is significantly more frequent. In Europe,  the highest frequencies of lactase persistence can be observed in the  north western populations, where milk dependent pastoralism was  developed very early, traversing towards the south and east there is a decrease in prevalence of lactose persistence . Recently, the T allele  of a C/T polymorphism in a potential regulatory site located 13,910  bp upstream the lactase gene was found to be completely associated  with lactase persistence in Northern Europeans. A significant, although  less strong association, was also observed with a second  22,018 bp G/A mutation .

Bour   gain1","1INSERM U535   University Paris XI, Villejuif, France, 2Institute of Genetics and  Biophysics A","Buzatti Traverso, CNR, Naples, Italy. Large genealogies provide many individuals for linkage analysis .  However, the software available for nonparametric multipoint linkage  analysis is limited in the complexity of the families it can handle . Partition into subfamilies is necessary  . Two methods have been proposed to partition pedigrees automatically,  one based on factor analysis1, and the other on a maximum clique  partitioning approach2 . Both were proposed for the study of quantitative  traits . We adapted these methods to qualitative trait analysis and assessed the  sensitivity of subsequent NPL analysis to these approaches and their parameters . Better results were obtained when the pair relationship  measure on which the breaking is based is highly correlated with the linkage informativity of the pair  . Additionally, results were appreciably  improved if partitioning was first based on affected individuals only. Our results are illustrated with a genome wide NPL analysis of  hypertension in a 2636 member pedigree from the isolated village  of Campora, South Italy. We show that the genome wide significant  linkage detection of a new locus on 8q22 23 as well as the replication  of two known loci (1q42 43 and 4p16) are conditioned on the quality of the genealogy partition . Our results illustrate the great sensitivity of linkage analyses in large genealogies to the quality of the genealogy partition .

Familial clustering of migraine with aura (MA) and  without aura (MO), the two most common subtypes, was described in several studies . Probands and their first degree relatives were classified according to their migraine subtype, to evaluate familial risk for MA and MO . The  use of family history to classify relatives as migraine sufferers was also  validated; though probands were able to correctly identify their affected  relatives, migraine was still underestimated: only relatives with a direct interview were thus included . Familial risk was estimated using the relative risk (RR) in first degree relatives . Prevalence in our general population has been estimated previously at 1 .4% for MA, and 6 .0% for MO . The risk for MA and MO  was evaluated separately in 51 families of probands with MA and in 94 families of migraineurs with MO . The RR of MA and MO among first degree relatives of probands with MA was 10 .58 (95% CI: 6 .24 17 .93) and 6 .51 (95% CI: 4 .98 8 .51),  respectively. The RR of MO of first degree relatives of probands with MO was 8 .82 (7 .10 10 .95) . The risk for MA in relatives of MO probands  was not possible to estimate, as only a few parents were affected  by MA. Our findings show that, in our sample, MA is less frequent  than MO as previously described. The RR for first degree relatives of migraineurs with MA is highly suggestive of a genetic contribution .

Oral clefts (OCs) are important to public health in terms of birth prevalence, costs of care, and psychosocial impact . Recent genetic  and epidemiological studies have led to new theories about the causes of cleft lip and/or cleft palate (CL/CP) . It has been shown that there is considerable international variation in  the frequency of OCs influenced by numerous factors. There are many  parts of the world   including Eastern Europe   for which we still have little or no information on the frequency of OCs . Out of 382 newborns  with OCs registered in Lithuania during last 5 years there were 99 (25 .6%) syndromic and 283 (74 .1%) non syndromic CL/CP cases . The incidence of OCs in Lithuania was 1 .84 for 1000 newborns . A subset of candidate genes ( TGFA , END1 , RARA , TGFB , SK1,  DLX1/2 , PITXZ , PAX9 , AP2, TTF2 , PVRL1 ) have been shown to  play an important role in the development of the head, with particular relevance to the development of the lip and palate . Additional genes  coding for growth, signalling and transcription factors that play a role  in the facial development include JAG1 , SHH , PTCH , CREB1 , GLI3 ,  FGFR1 , CASK , TCOF1 , FGFR2 , DLX5/6 , and PAX3  . The purpose of  our research was to test the hypothesis that TGFA , TGFB3 , GABRB3 ,  RARA , BCL3  and IRF6  genes are involved in the etiology of CL/CP  . Three chromosomal rearrangements identified by comparative  genomic hybridization in 3 out of 27 syndromic CL/CP patients from Lithuania point to 14q32 .11 qter, 20p13 pter and 21q21 .2 qter as potential chromosomal regions to search for new candidate genes .",2006

Crow2","1IPATIMUP; FCUP, Porto, Portugal, 2Dep","Genes escaping X inactivation are predicted to contribute to differences  in gene dosage between the sexes and are the prime candidates  for being involved in the phenotype observed in individuals with X chromosome aneuploidies . Of particular interest is  ProtocadherinX   (PCDH11X  or PCDHX ), a recently described gene expressed in  brain . Although PCDH11X  has a homologue on the Y chromosome in  humans and is predicted to escape from X inactivation, there was only  weak evidence for the escapee status of this gene, from experiments in lymphoblastoid cell lines . Employing bisulfite sequencing we analyzed two CpG islands in the  5Â´end of the gene and found absence of methylation on both the active  and the inactive X chromosomes, in blood leukocytes and in brain  tissue (grey mater), giving a strong indication that PCDH11X  escapes  inactivation in humans . Furthermore, a sexual dimorphism in levels of  expression in brain tissue was observed for this gene, by quantitative  real time PCR, with females presenting an up to twofold excess in  the abundance of PCDH11X  transcripts. We relate these findings to  sexually dimorphic traits in the human brain .",2006

There are substantial differences in allele frequency distributions for independence DNA loci among ethnic groups .  Therefore in each region and for each ethnic group is essential to create  oneâs population genetic base on allele and genotype frequencies for DNA loci used in the world wide forensic genetic practice . We have  studied the STR polymorphism of FGA, vWF genes and D3S1358 in  ten East Eurasian populations: Bashkirs, Tatars, Chuvashes, Komies, Mordvinians, Udmurts, Russians, Ukrainians, Belarusians and Yakuts .  The exact test demonstrated that STR of the FGA gene had deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium in Udmurts and Russians (p<0 .05) only . Comparison of the informativeness of STR loci FGA, vWF and  D3S1358 allows us to consider the first more informative by findings of  statistical parameters of forensic importance: the average value of the observed heterozygosity was 0 .831 in FGA, 0 .818 in vWF and 0 .762  in D3S1358; polymorphism information content (PIC) and power of discrimination (pD) were also higher in FGA (PIC=0 .830, pD=0 .949) than  in vWF (PIC=0.765, pD=0.915) and in D3S1358 (PIC=0.721, pD=0.895);  matching probability (pM)   0.051, 0.085 and 0.011, consequently; the  coefficient of allelic variety was 6.662 in FGA, 4.892 in vWF and 4.230  in D3S1358; index of Shennon diversity   0.344, 0.321 and 0.285, consequently  .

Angiotensinogen is a component of the renin  angiotensin system and ACE inhibitors and Î² blockers both have a  direct influence on this system. Objective:  To investigate whether the association between use  of ACE inhibitors or Î² blockers and the risk of stroke or myocardial  infarction (MI) is modified by the T allele of the angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism .methods:  Data were used from the Rotterdam Study, a population  based prospective cohort study in the Netherlands . In total, 4093  subjects with hypertension were included from July 1st, 1991 onwards .  Follow up ended at the diagnosis of MI or stroke, death, or the end  of the study period (January 1st, 2002) . The drug gene interaction  and the risk of MI or stroke was determined with a Cox proportional  hazard model with adjustment for each drug class as time dependent covariates . Results:  The interaction between current use of ACE inhibitors and  the angiotensinogen M235T polymorphism was multiplicative on the  risk of MI (interaction HR:4.00; 95%CI:1.32 12.11). There was a non  significant increased risk of stroke (interaction HR: 1.83; 95%CI:0.95 3 .54) in subjects with the MT or TT genotype compared to the MM  genotype.

We could further show that this  congenital anomaly had almost always familial recurrence which is compatible with simple autosomal dominant inheritance . We therefore introduced the term hereditary prosopagnosia (Kennerknecht et al . 2002, GrÃ¼ter et al . 2005) .

The amplification of Y  chromosome alphoid DNA is a very robust reaction, not very sensitive to the quality and source of the DNA sample . The variable stringency  profile of the amplification reaction consisted in a succession of high  stringency / low stringency / high stringency stages, in all cases the  stringency being determined by the annealing temperature in the PCR reaction .

Kapitanovic","Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia","Thymidylate synthase (TS) is crucial enzyme in the nucleotide  biosynthetic pathway because it calalyzes the reductive methylation of dUMP by 5,10 MTHFR to form dTMP  . TS gene has been an important  target for a variety of chemotherapeutics such as 5 FU . The human  TS promoter region includes polymorphic enhancer containing two or  three 28 bp tandem repeats and has been implicated in affecting on TS mRNA expression . The majority of individual human TS alleles harbor  either a double repeat (2R) or a triple repeat (3R) for this polymorphism, creating genotypes of 2R/2R, 2R/3R i 3R/3R . Individuals homozygous  for the 3R were found to have elevated intratumoral TS mRNA and  protein level. Recently identified GâC SNP in the second repeat of  the 3R alleles has shown that the 3R sequence with G has three to  four times greater efficiency of translation than the 3R with C and the 2R sequence . Due to associations of the TS polymorphisms with the  prognosis of several tumor types, we performed a study to determine the distribution of TS polymorphisms in Croatian population . A total of 125  healthy unrelated individuals were genotyped for the TS  5â UTR polymorphisms using PCR RFLP method with HaeIII restriction enzyme . Genotype frequencies for 5â UTR TS polymorphisms were  26,4 %, 16%, 2,4%, 42,4%, 8,8% and 4% for 2R/3G, 3G/3C, 3G/3G, 2R/2R, 2R/3C, 3C/3C genotype respectively  .

tPmt gene polymorphisms in croatian population,P1155.,"Kapitanovic , M. Jokic, G. Jurisic","Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia","Thiopurine methyltransferase (TPMT) catalyzes the S methylation  of azathioprine (AZA), 6 mercaptopurine (6 MP) and thioguanine,  medications widely used to treat malignancies, rheumatic diseases,  dermatologic conditions, inflammatory bowel disease and solid organ  transplantat rejection. Low TPMT activity plays a significant role in  the occurence of life threatening myelosupression, a serious toxicity of thiopurine drugs . Altered TPMT activity predominantly results from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) . To date, eight TPMT alleles  have been identified, including three alleles (TPMT*2, TPMT*3A and  TPMT*3C) which account for 80 95% of intermediate or low enzyme activity  . Ten percent of individuals with intermediate activity are  heterozygous at the TPMT gene locus and 0 .3% are homozygous for low activity alleles . The aim of our study was to estimate allelic frequency for three SNPs in TPMT gene in the Croatian population . DNAs obtained from 350  unrelated individuals were genotyped for the TPMT*2, TPMT*3A,  TPMT*3B and TPMT*3C SNPs using allele specific PCR or PCR RFLP method . The frequency of heterozygous TPMT genotype in Croatian population was 5 .7% . The frequency of the three allelic variants of the TPMT gene were: 0 .6% for TPMT*2, 4 .2% for TPMT*3A, and 0 .9% for TPMT*3C . The TPMT*3B allele was not detected in any of the samples analyzed . In conclusion, this study demonstrate that the TPMT*3A allele is a common allele in the Croatian population . The low frequency of heterozygous TPMT genotype in Croatian population can be explained by interethnic variations of TPMT alleles . In our oppinion  this information would be helpful for identifying patients at high risk of inadequate responses to thiopurine therapy  .",2006

As new alleles are not generated at  Alu insertion/deletion loci, and as there is no identified selection  pressure on these loci, these loci have gained importance in the study of genetic structures of human populations . In the present study six  human   specific insertion/deletion polymorphisms were studied  in two endogamous tribal populations, namely, Minas and Bhils of Banswara and Rajputs of Rajasthan . DNA samples from 79 unrelated individuals (37 Bhils, 23 Minas and 19 Rajputs) were analysed . Of  these polymorphic markers five are Alu insertion/deletion markers (Alu  PV 92, Alu FX III B, Alu D1, Alu APO, Alu ACE and Alu CD4), while the  sixth marker (mt â NUC) pertains to a mitochondrial DNA segment, 540 bp in length, which got inserted into human nuclear genome .  The results of this study show that all loci are polymorphic in all three populations . Most of the loci showed high levels of heterozygosity in all three populations .

We  have undertaken a large mutation screening approach in 125 adult  individuals (66 males and 59 females) from 3 population groups  (Hellenic, Greek Cypriot and Iranian) to investigate whether the allelic  differences, present in the VN1R1  gene, are gender specific.

Given the equal distribution of both  VN1R1   1a and 1b allelic frequencies in male and female individuals of our  study sample and assuming that the functional properties of the two  allelic forms of the VN1R1 protein are different, based on the protein  conformation simulation, our data suggest that the absence of the  1a/1a genotype in females may correlate with distinct gender specific behaviour  .",2006

The majority of the populations analyzed speak languages belonging  to 4 different branches of the afroasiatic linguistic family (berber, semitic, cushitic and omotic) . When afroasiatic speaking populations  were grouped following their linguistic affiliation, we observed a low  and not significant level of apportionment of the variance between  groups, suggesting that the afroasiatic linguistic branches spread independently with respect to genes .

Unlike autosomal markers, Y chromosome haplotypes are uni parentally inherited and can therefore trace lineages . Y chromsome  markers also have the advantage of being inherited in the same  manner as surnames in some cultures, allowing for the comparison of cultural and genetic inheritance . Recent studies have shown that  due to Irelandâs relatively recent colonization by modern humans,  coupled with its geographic isolation, it an ideal location for surname/Y chromosome comparisons . Earlier work focused in the Republic of  Ireland has shown the majority of Irish males (>98% in Connaught) belong to a single haplotype, R1b3 . The remaining samples belong to haplogroup I . By contrast, a sample of the modern Norse population contains 30% Rlb3 and 28% I .

The dispersal of Bantu speaking farmers from central  west Africa towards the south (along both the western and eastern  coasts) is a typical example of a demic diffusion model of gene flow.  The increasing availability of food allowed population growth, which in turn led to the need for migrating . Data collected until now suggest  differences in the progression of the western and eastern waves of advance . Important questions remain concerning the numbers of  people involved not only in the whole process, but also in the two main independent Bantu migration routes . In this study, we use likelihood  analyses based on the coalescence theory (MIGRATE software) to  evaluate the magnitude of the male migration rates and of the male  population effective sizes involved in both waves of advance of the Bantu expansion . To investigate these, we analysed a collection of Y  chromosome biallelic and microsatellite markers in a population from  South western Africa and in a number of Sub Saharan populations  gathered from the literature that were in the path of both expansion waves . Estimated diversity indices, genetic distances and migration rates can be explained in light of the Bantu expansion .

These studies suggest that CNVs play a significant role in  phenotypic variation and are likely play a role in areas of human health  such as drug metabolism and susceptibility to complex diseases . In  addition to normal CNVs, it is anticipated that ultra high resolution DNA  copy number studies will reveal the presence of a significant number  of disease specific small sized deletions and amplifications (e.g., in  the case of running tumor and germline DNA from the same patient in cancer studies) . To investigate the full range of human genome variation, we have  developed an oligonucleotide based array CGH platform that contains 390K unique probes per array  .

We have developed a new methodology and software for  designing PCR amplifiable hybridization probes (200 600bp) that can be used for both array MAPH and array CGH . We have designed,  amplified, cloned and spotted onto arrays 560 target sequences for  human chromosome X to cover it uniformly with median spacing of 238kb . Another 107 autosomal sequences were selected and used as normalization controls . For validation of the new methodology,  several normal DNA samples and patient samples with known and unknown chromosome X aberrations were analyzed . Array MAPH  detected deletions and duplications, which were confirmed by PCR  and/or FISH analyses, demonstrating the accuracy and sensitivity of the new approach . The new array MAPH method was further applied  for screening of 20 male patients from families with X linked mental retardation (kindly provided by EURO XLMR consortium) . One deletion of approximately 500kb and two duplications of approximately 1 .6Mb and 0 .9Mb were detected and their segregation in the corresponding families was investigated .

The resulting deletions and translocations damage some genes (HPRT, SCL, etc .) . In this case sites targets of enzymes  are cryptic recombination signals (cRSS) which are not structurally  identical to recombination signal sequences (RSS) of Ig and TCR genes . At present no information is available about the quantity and  intragenic location of cRSS whose structure has a high recombination  potential and the number of theoretically possible intragenic deletions and inversions with the participation of such cRSS . Having researched the annotated DNA sequences of 24 chromosomes in silico we have discovered 5 .6 mln of 12 bp and 23 bp spacer cRSS outside the Ig and TCR loci . Their number is 1 .5 times bigger than the theoretically expected value . On average the discovered structures make about 6 % of genome DNA .

Current  indirect scanning methods such as DGGE and dHPLC are reliable, but the throughput is limited . We have studied whether Conformation  Sensitive Capillary Electrophoresis (CSCE) using the new POPTM  Conformational Analysis Polymer (CAP, Applied Biosystems) might be a fast and reliable alternative . Using this polymer under semi  denaturing conditions on an automated sequencer (Applied Biosystems  3730) we validated 243 different mutations in 14 genes, including 74  mutations in BRCA1 , 78 mutations in BRCA2 , 43 mutations in CHD7   (CHARGE syndrome) and 9 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA . All  mutations were correctly identified due to a shift in the peak pattern.  For mitochondrial DNA, mutations present at 10% heteroplasmy  could easily be identified. Several parameters were tested to further  optimise the method, including the length of the fragment and the use of common primers for labelling of the fragments . As CSCE allows the  possibility of multiplexing, at least 4 fragments can be simultaneously  analysed in each capillary in one sequencer run (2 hours, 50 cm capillary) . For a 48 capillary sequencer this results in a throughput of approximately 2300 fragments within a twenty four hoursâ period .

MGI maintains a pivotal role in comparative  phenotype analysis through full integration of rich biological data sets,  ultimately aiming to grant effortless navigation through sequence,  expression, mapping, biochemical process, phenotypic outcome and disease model information . Recent enhancements capitalize on  the robust annotation of aberrant mouse phenotypes in the context  of mutations, strain variations, QTLs, and complex traits that serve  as putative models of human genetic diseases, with supplementary phenotype related images, where possible . Enhanced querying  parameters include phenotype search terms from controlled  vocabularies that circumvent the limitations of data retrieval through textual searches . Hence, the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology  continues to evolve as a standardized, structured vocabulary that  permits phenotypic representation across different domains and  species, and supports annotations to individual genotypes (allelic  combination(s) plus genetic background) at varying degrees of granularity  . Application of hierarchical MP terms fosters new routes  to map molecular functional features of gene products to complex  phenotypic descriptions, and facilitates semantic interpretation and data mining from either a genotype or phenotype standpoint . Likewise,  use of the Human Disease Vocabulary Browser, a dynamic set of disease terms from OMIM (http://www  .ncbi .nlm .nih .gov/entrez/query  . fcgi?db=OMIM), optimizes access to human disease data for which Mendelian inheritance is suspected or proven .

A synergy between these advances and the development  of screening tools, which allow a rapid, reliable, and reasonably priced  screening of marker gene expression represents an important step towards an improved treatment strategy  . For a rapid and reliable  semi quantitative expression analysis of eleven candidate genes  for drug resistance in melanoma, we combined a multiplex RT  PCR (mRT PCR) approach with subsequent microfluidic fragment analysis . The functionality of this approach was demonstrated by low  inter experimental variations of amplicon quantities after endpoint analysis . Applied to RNA samples derived from drug sensitive and   resistant melanoma cell lines, the multiplex RT PCR delivered  results qualitatively concordant with data obtained from Northern blot  and array analyses . Further tests using an automated on chip  electrophoresis platform indicate the applicability of this approach for high throughput measurements .

In our laboratory, the commonly used multiplex PCR reactions,  Southern blot and hybridization techniques have been used in the routine molecular diagnosis of D/BMD . In total, there were 373 unrelated  referrals, including cases later seen to have been misdiagnosed,  presenting defects in other genes (ex: sarcoglycans, CAPN3 ) . These  methods enabled the characterization of DMD  deletions in 137 patients  of which 45% involved exons 45 52, 13% exons 3 19 and 16% a single exon (either 44 or 45) . We used MLPA assay to screen for mutations in 68 unrelated patients  (partially retrospective study). All 21 deletions were confirmed, and  a further 15 duplications were detected (8 undocumented changes),  two of which were already suspected based on routine screening  results. Additionally, carrier status was ascertained and/or clarified in  some families, also enabling determination of de novo versus  familial  mutations in sporadic cases, as well as the detection of gonadal mosaicism . The authors highlight the added value of complementing routine  methods with the MLPA technique in the molecular diagnosis of D/ BMD, considering that gross deletions and duplications comprise the  majority of mutations in the DMD  gene .",2006
improving the accuracy of mutation detection by DNA  sequencing using novel approaches to base calling and data  representation,P1192.,"M. Goodridge, H. Hogan, D. C. Sayer","Conexio Genomics, East Fremantle, Australia",A critical factor for the detection of mutations or heterozygous sequence  by automated DNA sequencing is the accuracy of automated base calling . Automated base calling accuracy is compromised by the  variable incorporation rates of di deoxynucleotides and subsequent variation in sequence peak heights . In some cases one of the peaks  at heterozygous positions may be so low it cannot be discriminated from background and maybe miscalled . Importantly this small peak  is usually approximately half the height of a homozygous peak of the same base at the same position . We have developed a base calling algorithm that is a feature of our Assign ATF software that improves  the accuracy of automated base calling and also enables semi quantitative applications of automated DNA sequencing . Our system exploits the reproducible nature of re sequencing . If the same position  is sequenced in different individuals the relative peak heights of the same bases at the same positions are almost identical . Our approach  normalizes the sequence data and represents the peaks relative to what is expected for a homozygous peak at each position . This  results in homozygous peaks being the same height as each other and heterozygous peaks being 50% of the homozygous peaks . Our software also dynamically calculates and subtracts the background .  Together these algorithms dramatically improve heterozygous base calling and minimize base call errors . We have used this approach to  sequence DNA pools to simultaneously screen for and compare the  frequency of SNPs between different populations and to detect low level mutants in HIV drug resistance genotyping .,2006

For each gene matching, a short description and a visualization of the organization of its exons are immediately given .

We have selected a panel of 50 SNPs aimed to the development of a  SNP based human identification system suitable for forensic purposes. The SNPs have been selected from the dbSNP (http://www  .ncbi .nlm . nih .gov/) . Selection criteria were mainly focused on allelic balance and  specificity. Frequencies of the selected markers are being estimated  on a sample of 700 European (Italian) individuals, 200 Africans  and 200 Asiatic, the most of them already typed by traditional STR  based profiling kit, and compared to the frequencies reported by the HapMap project (http://www  .hapmap .org/) . All the samples are being  typed using the Real Time PCR technology (Applied Biosystems),  and results confirmed by direct sequencing. Interestingly, some of  the frequencies in the Italian population showed discrepancies from  those reported by HapMap as demonstrated by the SNP rs675236  which showed a highly significant difference in allelic and genotypic  frequencies ( p value of 0 .0007) .

However, this  technique has a major drawback, since heterozygous (multiple) exon deletions and duplications will not be detected . Recently, deletion/ duplication analysis for genes such as BRCA1 , BRCA2  and MECP2   has demonstrated that such changes may be important sources of  pathogenic mutations. Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification  (MLPA) is a recent addition to routine DNA diagnostics allowing  detection of copy gains or losses in an efficient, low cost, robust way,  with a high sensitivity and specificity. MLPA kits have become available  commercially for several genes with known deletions, including those mentioned above . As we expected that exon deletions and duplications  would be an important source of pathogenic changes in other genes as  well, we have developed a system in which we can rapidly implement MLPA analysis for any gene desired by the use of fully synthetic probes .  Briefly, 5 control probes with different lengths have been designed to  be included in all kits. Additional gene specific synthetic probes can  be added to up to 15 fragments in total, each fragment 4 nucleotides longer than the previous one . To date, we have been successful for  the autosomal genes CHD7  , EYA1 , LMX1B , EHMT1,  and SPG4 , and  X linked CHM , and NDP  . Preliminary data indicate that indeed 1 5%  of mutations in the autosomal genes is an exonic deletion or insertion .

Being element of sphingomyelin cycle sphingomyelin synthase 1  (SMS1) encoded the MOB (TMEM 23) major transcript controls the  synthesis of ceramide and diacylglycerol which relative concentrations are responsible for balance between cell death and surviving . It is  established that apoptosis is involved in mechanisms of cerebral ischemia . To investigate the expression of MOB major transcript in the  ischemic brain we took advantage of experimental models of global and focal ischemia in rats . We used semiquantitative reverse transcription  polimerase chain reaction (RT PCR) to assess the mRNA level of MOB  in the forebrain and cerebral cortex of rats in the permanent bilateral  common carotid artery occlusion model of global ischemia and in the  permanent middle cerebral artery occlusion (pMCAO) model of focal ischemia . Glyceraldehyde 3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) was used as the internal control . In the global ischemia model the  expression of MOB major transcript was significantly decreased only  after 24 h in forebrain cortex of ischemic rats compared to sham operated and control animals . In the lesioned cortex of pMCAO animals MOB mRNA level decreased after 24 h compared to control group . At  48 h after pMCAO the expression of MOB major transcript has tend to increase in both lesion cortex and contralateral cortex of ischemic rats .  In addition MOB mRNA level at 48 h after pMCAO was significantly higher compared to 24 h after pMCAO and control animals .Genomics, technology, bioinformatics6",2006

The data covered  a broad spectrum of sequencing chemistries, laboratories, sequencing platforms and read lengths . In bi directional mode, Mutation Surveyorâ¢ is claimed to detect >99%  of mutations, with sensitivity to the mutant allele extending down to  5% of the primary peak provided sequence quality meets a minimum Phred score of 20 . After excluding all possible explanations for false negative results  following visual inspection of the trace data, the bi directional false negative rate ranged from 0 .0 4 .9% depending on data set . Sensitivity  was depressed for mosaic mutations and only 62% (33/53) were detected without visual inspection under default settings . Mutation  Surveyorâ¢ showed decreased sensitivity and an increased false  positive rate on data produced by the Beckman CEQ8000 platform using the CEQ DTCS chemistry  . Mutation Surveyorâ¢ was able to de convolute 89% (155/175) of heterozygote indel mutations into separate alleles . However separation  into the two alleles did not permit the automated detection of mutations  downstream of the indel, moreover the software did have difficulty in naming frameshift mutations sequenced in the reverse orientation . Mutation Surveyorâ¢ can make a significant contribution in helping to ease the burden of sequence data analysis . Although we have  highlighted weaknesses with the program (used in auto run mode  with default settings), the user has the facility to increase sensitivity by altering many of the parameters .",2006
Rapid and sensitive nanoparticle based assay for gene  expression studies,P1209.,"J. Nunes , P. V. Baptista","CIGMH/SABT/FCT/UNL, Caparica, Portugal","Gold nanoparticles have long been used as biological tags, and more  recently, advances in functionalising particles with oligonucleotides  have allowed for the development of a series of new and practical biodetection systems . Gold nanoparticle probes have arisen as novel  tools for specific nucleic acid detection and can be used in biomolecule  detection assays with numerous advantages when compared to more common conventional approaches (1) . In the present work, oligonucleotide gold nanoparticle conjugates  were employed to enable selective colorimetric discrimination of the  Î² globin gene (HBB) expression. The gold nanoparticle surface is  functionalised with thiolated oligonucleotides (Au nanoprobe), and in  solution typically exhibits a red colour due to the optical absorption peak around 526 nm caused by surface plasmon resonance . High salt  concentration induces Au nanoprobe aggregation in the absence of  a complementary sequence and the solution turns purple (absorption  peak shifts towards longer wavelength); if the probe hybridises  specifically to the complementary target sequence, there is no Au nanoprobe aggregation and the solution remains red . The abundance  of the specific mRNA was correlated with values of absorption at  526nm of a solution containing the probes and total RNA extracted from MEL cells previously transfected with the HBB gene . This gold  nanoprobe method proved to be sensitive, selective and extremely  easy to perform, taking less than 15 minutes to develop after total  RNA extraction, without the need for expensive and time consuming experimental set ups .(1) Baptista P  ., et al . 2005 .

Pappaioannou","Kreatech Biotechnology, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","The Universal Linkage System (ULSâ¢) is a (platinum based) labeling  technology to label RNA, DNA and proteins Since ULS labeling is  a chemical labeling technology, complete control over the labeling process has been achieved . The âno need for enzymesâ approach  together with a controlled labeling makes the ULS labeling procedure very reproducible and robust . The ULS labeling technologyâs key advantage is the ability to directly label nucleic acids in their natural form . For example, ULS is very  efficient at directly labeling naturally occurring small RNA/miRNA in a one step 15 min reaction . Other labeling technologies encounter  issues trying to label these small (20 23 nts) non coding RNAs, thus  making ULS a very attractive labeling technology in this field. For gene expression DNA microarray applications, the available amount  of mRNA can be limiting. For this reason, linear target amplification to generate aRNA is typically required . Traditionally, labeling of aRNA  is achieved by introducing modified nucleotides during the linear  amplification step. This is not ideal since it can reduce the efficiency of the enzyme and introduce bias . ULS offers the possibility to label aRNA  generated with unmodified nucleotides, allowing the enzyme to work to  its maximum efficiency. Avoiding the use of modified nucleotides gives much higher yields and better size distribution of aRNA . Here data will be presented where the ULS labeling technology was evaluated on several gene expression microarrays platforms .

Because of its dual genetic control, defects in OXPHOS can be due to mutations in either the mitochondrial (mtDNA) or nuclear DNA .  Although OXPHOS disorders have common characteristics, there is  considerable clinical variability among patients, even in those having the same genetic defect . Also, clinically indiscernible conditions can be caused by different mutations in a number of genes . Therefore,  we applied a new CHIP based platform for rapid resequencing of the mtDNA . We found a complete match with classical resequencing in 3  samples. Two samples were mixed to generate artificially heteroplasmy at 11 positions in the mtDNA sequence . Ten were detectable as such and one gave a no call . Analysis of mixed amounts of different  mtDNAs indicated that a mutation load of â¥10% should be detectable.  Although the platform is not optimal for the detection of small deletions  or insertions, we were able to identify two samples with a single nucleotide insertion as a heterozygote call . Screening of 20 patients  suspected for mitochondrial disease revealed 171 different mutations:  90 SNPs, 5 known pathogenic mutations and 71 unknown variants (5 of which were heteroplasmic) . Our conclusion is that the resequencing  CHIPs are a very promising tool for rapid and comprehensive mtDNA screening . Especially for genomes like the mtDNA, where it is possible  to generate the template with a single PCR, and in which the vast  majority of the point mutations are nucleotide substitutions, it will become the method of choice .",2006

Peroxisomes are ubiquitously distributed organelles, exclusive  from eukaryotic cells and organisms, essential for lipid metabolism  and free  radical detoxification. Loss or malfunction of peroxisomes  causes dramatic inherited conditions such as Zellweger syndrome or X linked Adrenoleukodystrophy  . We have created a peroxisomal  database http://www  .peroxisomedb .org with the purpose of gathering  and clarifying all relevant information on peroxisomal genes, proteins,  metabolic pathways and diseases, combining molecular biology and genetics, genomics, metabolism and clinical points of view  . Using  annotated data derived from online resources and the literature the  peroxisomeDB includes the complete peroxisomal proteome of Homo  sapiens  (82 genes) and Saccharomyces cerevisiae (56 genes) . The  database is structured in interrelated sections âGenesâ, âFunctionsâ  âMetabolic pathwaysâ and âDiseasesâ and includes hyperlinks to other  databases (NCBI, ENSEMBL, UCSC, SNPs â¦) .

The peroxisome is an essential eukaryotic organelle, crucial for lipid  metabolism and free radical detoxification, development, differentiation and morphogenesis from yeasts to humans . Loss of peroxisomes  invariably leads to fatal peroxisome biogenesis disorders in man  (PBD). The evolutionary origin of peroxisomes remains unsolved;  proposals for either a symbiogenetic or cellular membrane invagination events are unconclusive . To address this question, we have probed  with a peroxisomal proteome, an ensemble  of 19 representative  eukaryotic complete genomes . Molecular phylogenetic and sequence  comparison tools allowed us to identify 4 proteins as peroxisomal  markers for unequivocal in silico  peroxisome detection . We have  then detected the Apicomplexa phylum as a first group of organisms devoid of peroxisomes, in the presence of mitochondria . Finally, we  deliver evidence against a prokaryotic ancestor of peroxisomes: a)  The peroxisomal membrane is composed of purely eukaryotic bricks  and is thus useful to trace the eukaryotes in their evolutionary paths;  b) The peroxisomal matrix protein import system shares mechanistic  similarities with the endoplasmic reticulum/proteasome degradation process (ERAD), indicating a common evolutionary history  .",2006

Until  now this conclusion was based upon published data concerning only a small number of SNPs . In the current study we prepared DNA pools from the parents and from  the offspring of the 30 parent child trios that have been extensively genotyped by the HapMap project . We analysed the two pools with Affymertix 10K Xba 142 2 .0 Arrays . The availability of the HapMap  data allowed us to validate the performance of 6843 SNPs for which we had both complete individual and pooled genotyping data . Pooled analysis averaged over 5 6 microarrays resulted in highly reproducible results . The average error of predicting the differences in allele frequency between the two pools was 1 .37%, and 95% of SNPs  showed an error of < 3.2%.

Molecular genetic testing is important  to confirm the clinical diagnosis and to predict the familial recurrence  risk which depends on the underlying molecular mechanism [deletion  (in 75% of PWS and AS cases), uniparental disomy (UPD), an imprinting error or point mutations] . In most diagnostic laboratories methylation specific PCR or Southern blot analysis is used . Additional testing (FISH, UPD analysis) is required to reveal the underlying molecular mechanism . An ideal molecular test  should provide information about both parent specific methylation imprinting on 15q11 q13 and the underlying genetic mechanism .  Recently, methylation specific multiplex ligation dependent probe  amplification (MS MLPA) became commercially available. This  technique allows detection of changes in CpG methylation and copy number of chromosomal sequences in a single reaction . We evaluated this technique for diagnostic applications in a clinical setting . Using MS MLPA we tested a group of 16 patients with  previously confirmed PWS (7) and AS (9) respectively. The molecular  diagnosis and underlying molecular mechanism were confirmed in all cases . A comparison was made between MS MLPA and Southern blot results . We conclude that MS MLPA is a powerful technique, suitable for molecular diagnostics of PWS/AS in a clinical context .  MS MLPA has important advantages compared to other techniques  as starting from genomic DNA, information about methylation status  and underlying molecular mechanism is provided within in a single experiment, resulting in a shorter turnover time .",2006

The technique was successfully  applied for identification of 41 new polymorphic human Alu Ya5 and Ya8  insertions. Among them, 18 individual Alu elements first sequenced in  this work were found to be absent from the available human genome  databases. This result suggests that significant part of polymorphic  REs were not identified during genome sequencing and remain to be detected and characterized . The proposed method does not depend  on preliminary knowledge of evolutionary history of retroelements  and can be applied for identification of insertion/deletion polymorphic markers in genomes of different species .",2006

Consistent high quality data reduces repeat rates and improves the  accuracy of automated base calling. We have developed a flexible and  unique QC system that is integrated into our Assign ATF software that provides an effective and informative QC analysis of sequence data .  Assign ATF calculates a quantitative base call score (BSC) for each base call within a sequence generated by automated DNA sequencers .  The BCS is influenced by sequence peak shape, the level of background and the degree of which a peak overlaps with neighbouring peaks . The  mean BCS can be calculated for an entire sequence from a single  sequencing primer resulting in a single quantitative quality value for a sequence . Similarly a BCS can be calculated for all sequences from a  specific sample producing a quantitative quality value for a sequence.  Assign ATF can automatically produce longitudinal plots of BCS for all samples . Such a graphs produce quality control information essential for the maintenance of a clinical laboratory test . Such data includes 1 Sample to sample and sequence run to run variability of sequence  quality 2 Rapid identification of changes systematic changes in quality 3 Setting of performance criteria for the evaluation of new reagents  and protocols 4 Identification of factors that affect DNA quality 5 Assessment of interlaboratory concordance and agreement of  appropriate sequence quality",2006

SMA is classified  in three clinical types, SMA I, SMA II and SMA III, based on the severity of the symptoms and the age of onset . About 95% of SMA cases are  caused by homozygous deletion of the SMN1 gene (5q13), or to its conversion to SMN2 . The molecular diagnosis of this disease is usually  carried out by a PCR RFLP approach able to evidence the absence of both SMN1 copies . However, this approach is not able to identify  heterozygous healthy carriers, which show a very high frequency in general population (1:50) . In this study, we used the Multiple Ligation  dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) approach for the molecular  diagnosis of SMA in 19 affected patient and in 57 individuals at risk to be healthy carriers . This analysis detected the homozygous SMN1  absence in all the investigated cases, and allowed to discriminate between SMN1 deletion and conversion to SMN2 . Moreover, MLPA  analysis evidenced a condition of heterozygous SMN1 absence in 33 out of the 57 subjetcs at risk to be healthy carriers .

We presumed  these TFs can be found by searching for their functional binding sites in promoters of genes differentially regulated during myogenesis .  In silico identification of TF binding sites (TFBSs) is difficult due to  their small size (e .g . 6 8 bp) and variation among consensus binding sites, resulting in many false positives . To reduce the number of  false positives we only considered homologs with similar regulation  in different species and looked for evolutionary conserved regulatory sequences . Micro array data sets from differentiating human and  mouse myoblasts, generated in our and other labs, were queried with Perl scripts and the UniGene and HomoloGene databases . We  found 14 homologs down regulated and 30 homologs up regulated in both species . The promoters of these human and mouse genes were obtained from the CSHLmpd2 database . These were aligned to recognition sequences of vertebrate TFBSs . With this procedure, we  identified TFBSs that were found at significantly higher frequencies in  promoters of genes differentially expressed during myogenesis than in genes with constant expression . We are now experimentally verifying  these in silico  findings using ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation)  on chip with various arrays . The combination of in silico  and empirical  approaches will assist in the identification of TFs with a role in the regulation of myogenic differentiation . Po09.

An inaccurate message addressed to  the population on the disadvantages of consanguinity could lead to family and social disruption . The aim of this study is to elucidate the  relationship of consanguinity to the variable etiological categories of  genetic disorders among 550 families seen at the genetic clinic of the  National Center for Diabetes, Endocrinology and Genetics in Amman over a period of 30 months . Results: Autosomal recessive and dominant inheritances were the underlying etiology in 35% and 15% of cases respectively  . A proportion  of 33% of all cases remained undiagnosed, 82% of which were sporadic . First cousin marriage rates among parents of probands with  autosomal recessive, autosomal dominant, X linked , chromosomal  and undiagnosed disorders were 67%, 26%, 28%, 31% and 49% respectively  . Conclusion: The rate of first cousin marriages was higher among  families with autosomal recessive conditions and non diagnosed  conditions than the rate among the general population in the same area . In a community where selective termination of an affected fetus  has its religious restrictions , prospective genetic counseling to families  with segregating recessive genes and premarital testing and screening  whenever feasible remain important measures for prevention and control of genetic diseases . On the other hand, consanguinity was not associated with other etiological categories .

According to epidemiologic / genetic studies the incidence of CF in  our country is 1:2700 newborns . Thus, given the current birthrate ~35 new cases of CF should annually be detected . However, registry data  demonstrated that 1/3 of CF patients remains clinically undiagnosed  and that the age at diagnosis has markedly increased (prior to 1998  median: 0.58; between 1999 2005: 1.2 years). Therefore, in II/2006 we  started two tier (IRT/DNA) pilot CF neonatal screening project (NSCF) comprising Bohemian regions, representing ~2/3 of our population .  Altogether 45,453 newborns were examined during the initial 9 month period . In 545 cases (1 .2%), who had IRT concentration above the  continuously adjusted cut off level, we examined the most common  CFTR  mutations . The diagnosis of CF was established in 5 newborns  (2x F508del/F508del; 2x F508del/G551D; 1x F508del/R117H 7T   mild CF) and these children were subsequently referred to CF Centres .  Furthermore, we detected 42 newborns with 1 CFTR allele (35x F508del, 2x CFTRdele2 .3/21kb/, 2x N1303K, 1x G551D, 1x I507del and 1x I148T) . Until now 27 follow up sweat tests (ST) were performed (26x <30mmol/L, 1x 30 40mmol/L) . IRT recall was carried out in 14  children with IRT >200ng/mL and with a detectable CFTR allele   11 children had negative IRT recall and 1 child was positive (ST negative) .  From these results the incidence of CF can preliminarily be adjusted to 1:9090 newborns . However, these results can be skewed due to lower  number of newborns tested, effect of prenatal diagnosis and/or false negativity of NSCF  . Supported by MZCR 8236 3, 00000064203 .",2006

In order to assure high quality  and accuracy of laboratory testing, appropriate control materials are essential . Laboratories mainly use commercially available cell lines and patient samples as controls . For many genetic tests, however,  control materials are difficult to find. Based on this unmet need, synthetic quality control (QC) samples are being developed . Such  synthetic samples can contain rare mutations, allow many mutations  to be detected in one multiplex test and can be designed to function in distinct extraction methods . MMQCI has constructed synthetic quality control blood samples for  Cystic Fibrosis (CF), containing 27 CFTR  exons including intronic  borders, and carrying different mutations . A thorough evaluation of this  sample was performed in house by MMQCI for several DNA extraction  and PCR based amplification methods, as well as different mutation analysis methods . In order to assess the value of this synthetic blood  sample on a large scale, the European Thematic CF network enclosed  it as an additional sample in their External Quality Assessment scheme of 2005 . More than 150 laboratories, in 46 countries registered to participate in the validation study of this QC sample . The outcome of this study will  identify correlations between the detection of mutations and specific analysis methods used in routine practice . Furthermore, this validation  should enable assessment of the usefulness and effectiveness of synthetic quality controls for CF testing .",2006

They participate from 1999 in a  Down Club organized by young volunteers from our organizations . Results: Children with Down syndrome have interacted with volunteers  and benefited by becoming more assertive and by achieving more developmental milestones . Assessment of their progress might establish the exact role of communication among the Down Club . The  parents have witnessed important cognitive and behavioral changes  in their children, facts that at this moment are our only method of evaluating their progress . Conclusions: The health of people with disability and the social  integration can be improved if they have every opportunity to enjoy  family life, education, friendship, access to public facilities and freedom of movement . Action should be aimed at counteracting helplessness and stigmatization . Developing awareness about the needs of children with Down  syndrome and engaging public in a shared strategy for the development  of genetic services, based on WHO principles ,,health for all in the 21st  centuryâ will ensure a collaborative international approach in sharing of expertise and experience .",2006

Although they arrived from the Ukraine, their origins were in the Tyrol region of Austria . All 30 000 Hutterites originate from less than 100 founders . Features of this population including founder effect, large  families, meticulous records and high uptake of health care contribute to its suitability for genetic research . Over 30 autosomal recessive  (AR) disorders have been described in this population (Innes et al,  1999). These include âcommonâ conditions such as cystic fibrosis  (CF), limb girdle muscular dystrophy 2I (LGMD2I) and spinal muscular atrophy  . A large number of provisionally unique AR conditions have  been identified. In many cases the responsible genes have been  mapped or identified in collaboration with Hutterite families. Examples  include VLDLR  associated cerebellar hypoplasia, AR Barth syndrome  (DNAJC19 ), LGMD2H ( TRIM32 ), Usher 1F ( PCDH15 ) and Bowen  Conradi syndrome (12p13 .3) .One Hutterite CF mutation, M1101K, is rare worldwide, but has been reported in Tyrolean patients with CF  .  We anticipate that there should be evidence of other alleles that are enriched in the Hutterite Brethren in patients living in Central Europe .  For example, a severe form of Joubert syndrome has recently been Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy reported independently in the Hutterites (Boycott et al, 2005) and in a  Tyrolean family (Janecke et al, 2004) .

Determinants of the intention to follow a salt restricted  diet in case of genetic vulnerability,P1264.,"Ausems , I. Mesters, I. van de Boogaart","Caphri, Maastricht, The Netherlands","An important risk factor of heart diseases is hypertension . About 10% of the Dutch population suffers from hypertension . Due to genetic  variation in salt sensitivity, the blood pressure between individuals varies as a result of salt intake . The aim of this study is to gain insights  in the factors which determine the intention to follow a salt restricted diet in case of genetic vulnerability  . Sixty seven participants completed a written questionnaire, measuring  demographics, social influences, attitudes, stages of change, risk  perception, fear and danger control processes, and intention to follow a salt restricted diet . Half of the respondents had the intention to follow a salt restricted diet  in case of genetic vulnerability. Self efficacy expectations and severity  of the symptoms were highly related with the intention to follow a salt restricted diet . About half of the respondents would engage in danger control processes (actions to prevent danger) . Compared with âfear  controllersâ, âdanger controllersâ had a higher intention to follow the salt restricted diet, and were more often in the action phase . âDanger  controllersâ were more convinced that salt restricted diets might prevent  hypertension, more often discussed genetic diseases with their friends,  had higher self efficacy expectations, were more convinced that  knowing about their salt sensitivity would help them getting medical  assistance, and that knowing about salt sensitivity was in the interest of their children . Finally, âdanger controllersâ were more normotensive .  The results of this study show that health education should focus on  improving self efficacy expectations and skills when promoting a salt restricted diet in case of genetic vulnerability  .",2006

Using a qualitative  approach we explored how genetics is incorporated into the current and  anticipated role of midwives by conducting focus group discussions and semi structured interviews . A total of nine focus groups were conducted  with midwives (n=50) and 11 interviews with organisational managers and educators from seven maternity hospitals across Victoria . Two  focus groups were also held with prenatal and neonatal genetic experts (n=10) . Midwives discussed their experiences in dealing with  genetic issues, while managers and experts were asked about their  opinions on midwivesâ practice, and what they anticipate their role to entail . Transcripts of focus groups and interviews were analysed and  major themes identified. Both managers and midwives recognised that midwives care primarily for normal or low risk pregnancies . Experts  supported autonomy in regards to discussing prenatal and neonatal  screening tests, whilst managers saw midwives essentially as resource and information providers . Midwives reported that their role in regards  to genetics includes information provider, counsellor, and support person . Perceived boundaries with other health professionals was also discussed . Genetics appears to be a component of the midwife  role through the whole continuum of pregnancy, with their role defined  by organisational practice, patient demographics as well as personal experience and knowledge .",2006

In the general population about 1,5 % is  a heterozygous MutYH  mutation carrier  . Children of MutYH  mutation  carriers have an increased risk of inheriting two MutYH  mutations as  compared to the general population and thereby an increased risk for colorectal carcinoma . Methods: Using data from literature review and our own group of MAP  patients (n=40) we constructed a Markov model to perform a societal  cost utility analysis of family screening (testing children after the spouse has been tested positive) . Results: In absence of FOBT population screening, the cost utility  ratio of testing families of MAP patients, as compared to no genetic  screening, was estimated at â¬19,000 per quality adjusted life year (QALY) . The presence of FOBT population screening only slightly  increased this cost utility ratio to â¬20,000 per QALY. For testing  families of heterozygote MutYH  carriers, cost utility ratios were about  twice as high . Conclusions: The costs per QALY for testing families of MAP patients are acceptable according to international standards . The conclusions  of our analysis were sensitive to several of the parameters in the  model, including the assumed â¬640 per genetic assessment.",2006

Marini","NIH/NICHD/Bone and Extracellular Matrix Branch, Bethesda, MD, United  States","The biochemical test for osteogenesis imperfecta detects structural  abnormalities in the helical region of type I collagen as delayed  electrophoretic migration of alpha chains synthesized by cultured  fibroblasts on SDS Urea PAGE. The sensitivity of this test is based  on overmodification of alpha chains in helices with a substitution of an invariant glycine residue in a Gly X Y triplet . Biochemical testing  is most sensitive for structural changes in the carboxyl end of a chain because helices fold in the carboxyl to amino direction . Although the  biochemical test has been used for 2 decades, the limits of detectability are unreported . We compared the electrophoretic migration of normal  type I collagen with collagen from 30 OI patients (types III or IV)  and known mutations in the amino half of the Î±1(I) and Î±2(I) chains.  Sensitivity differed for each chain, was greater on 5% than 6% PAGE,  and in intracellular than secreted collagen. In Î±1(I), substitutions in  the first 100 residues were undetectable; 7% of cases in the current  Mutation Consortium database are in this region. Î±1(I) substitutions  between residues 100 230 were variably detectable while those after  residue 232 were all detected. In Î±2(I), variability of detection extended through residue 436 . About a third of cases in the Consortium database are located in the combined variable detection region . There was no correlation of substituting residues and biochemical sensitivity  .

About 1% to 2% of couples experience three or more  consecutive spontaneous pregnancy loss, suggesting some underlying operative mechanisms . Among them genetic factors can include single  gene defects as well as parental chromosome abnormalities and polygenic or multifactorial disorders . Material and methods: 200 consecutive cases were studied by genetical analysis . Genetic counseling, clinical, paraclinical, and cytogenetic studies were done for each couple . Results: There was positive familial pedigree of pregnancy loss in 176 couples (88%) . They were divided by pedigree patterns in 4 groups:1  RPL in 2 3 generations (12%) 2  â¥ 2 familial marriages with RPL (15%) 3  â¥1 other dispersed pregnancy loss in pedigree (61%) 4  Negative pedigree for pregnancy loss (12%)There were other cases of RPL in 109 pedigrees (54 .5%) from 1  7 . High rate of familial marriage was seen in involved couples (59%) . Chromosomal abnormality was found in 15 .8% of among 120 couples . Conclusion: Previous investigations have demonstrated that the  aberrant regulation of cellular process such as immunological,  metabolic, vascular and endocrine may lead to PL and can be  influenced by genetic factors. The presence of inherited disorders with low viability within a family can also be associated with RPL . Familial  pedigree and inheritance pattern have a key role in genetic evaluation of couples with RPL .",2006

This study investigates predictors of accuracy in genetic  risk recall with the objective of informing future counseling strategies .  It is based on genetic counseling for cancer in two Cancer Society  offices from April 2000 to February 2002. The counselor notified about  the inherited cancer risk according to predefined categories of ânot increasedâ, âmoderately increasedâ, and âmarkedly increasedâ risk . Notified versus recalled genetic cancer risk was studied in a survey  pre counseling (T0), and 2 (T1) and 12 weeks (T2) post counseling  (n=46) . In addition to perceived/recalled risk, knowledge, perceptions,  social support, mood, anxiety, dispositional optimism, health behavior,  perceived health, sociodemographics, and family history plus other experience of cancer were measured . Five clients got not increased/ low risk notification at counseling; 21 moderately increased risk; and 20 markedly increased/high genetic risk . Based on recalled risk the  subjects were divided into three groups: accurate recall (T1:n=26 / T2:n=20), under (n=16/19) and overstated risk (n=4/6) .

Sanfilippo B syndrome (mucopolysaccharidosis IIIB, MPS IIIB) is  caused by deficiency of Î± N acetylglucosaminidase, a lysosomal enzyme involved in the degradation of heparan sulfate . Accumulation  of the substrate in lysosomes lead to neurologic degeneration, behavioural problems, and mental decline . Compared to other types  of MPS, somatic features are relatively mild in Sanfilippo B. It is the  most common subtype of MPS in the Netherlands and probably underdiagnosed in adult persons with mental retardation . We report the clinical data of 16 patients with Sanfilippo B. 13 of  them derived from 2 large families and could be followed for several  decades, and 3 were sporadic adult patients followed for a period of 10 years . 7 of 16 patients had died at ages 15 to 69 years, mainly from pneumonia and cachexia . The others were 37 62 years of age and all lived in institutions . Apart from the youngest, they had lost ambulancy, Genetic counselling, education, genetic services, and public policy1 at 36 to 62 years .

Nowadays, many children with childhood onset diseases and/or genetic syndromes and/or mental retardation survive into adulthood .  These children are at risk not being provided with coordinated and adequate healthcare as they reach adulthood . With respect to healthcare transition, the paediatrician may hand over the care for the patient to a general practitioner  . Hence, in case of  any healthcare problems, the general practitioner usually will refer the patient to a (sub)specialist . This may result in many hospital visits to many different doctors . Fragmentation of the patientsâ healthcare may develop due to a lack of central coordination of care . For mentally  retarded patients living in institutions, good coordinative healthcare is provided for these patients by a doctor for mentally retarded patients .In Maastricht, the Netherlands, we developed an outpatientsâ ward .  This ward is primarily aimed at providing healthcare coordination, when  needed, for adult patients with an intellectual disability and/or a genetic syndrome . The prime goals of this outpatientsâ ward are coordination  of healthcare, continuation of healthcare, providing good quality  of healthcare and providing age  and developmentally appropriate healthcare .

initiatives to enhance the role of Public Health care and  Genetics on disease control,P1283.,Fishta,"International Humanitarian Assistance, Jena, Germany","Introduction: Public Health (PH) and Genetics are often considered as two independent subjects of health care . PH looks simultaneously at  the control of epidemiological diseases and malnutrition in community  based populations which is a problem predominantly in developing countries . Meanwhile, in developed countries the increasing incidence of diseases such as cancer, diabetes etc . is considered a critical problem . While Genetics deals with the micro level of health, PH looks at populations at a macro level . However, both aim improving the quality of health and decreasing the morbidity and mortality  . Methods: Public Health Genetics (PHG) programs should be proposed and applied for each country  . Analysing of PH and Geneticsâ data,  identifies the diseases with highest incidence, possible causal  or contributing factors, the aetiology and history of the diseases, relevant treatment protocols as well as cost of tests and therapies .  Evidence based results will suggest innovative preventive programs  based on recent genetic findings. Important is the costs analyse each  disease management, whereby the country specific legal and ethical  influences should not be overlooked. Country based PHG strategies with innovative disease management protocols should be proposed . Discussion: PHG will propose innovative disease management  schemata. Application of cost effective mechanisms will be possible;  consequently, the population at risk will be identified and offered to undergo genetic screening tests, vaccination or therapy  . Educational  programs about PHG for the public and health professionals will  change the health behaviour of people at risk and will provide them latest treatment by health professionals . Therefore, more diseases will be prevented and lower global mortality will be achieved .",2006

The treated cells exhibited varying levels  of restoration with synthesis of corresponding dystrophin fragments  of 52 .9 kDa, 12 .5 kDa and 52 kDa in relation to each of the three premature stop codons . These fragments correspond to the normal  protein synthesized from the cDNA segments carrying the PTCs in exons 30, 37 and 60 respectively  . Partial restoration of dystrophin  translation was thus demonstrated from the in vitro  studies in our DMD  patients . It is believed that aminoglycosides can correct translation  from nonsense codons by ribosomal interference and the complexity  of readthrough regulation warrants further investigation since varying  results have been previously reported from different studies using gentamycin to correct PTCs .",2006

Objective : Investigations were conducted to estimate life expectancy  at birth of patients with type 1 (non neuronopathic) Gaucher disease (GD), the most frequent lysosomal storage disease . methods : The GD  population included all patients with type 1 GD registered in the ICGG Gaucher Registry, who were diagnosed after 1991 . Life expectancy  was calculated according to the standard life table method by Palmore  and Gardner, 1996 (method 1); and by using the assumption that risk  of death prior to Gaucher diagnosis was the same as the reference population (method 2) . The reference population (World Population  Prospects, 2002, UN) was and approximately 40% of GD patients came from the U .S . The life expectancy of the reference population  was similar to that for developed nations (as defined by the UN).  The gender distribution in GD was similar to that of the general population .  Results : The type 1 Gaucher population of 2,201 patients  had 90 reported deaths . The average life expectancy of the Type 1 GD population was 66 .6 years for method 1, and 67 .3 years for method 2 . The life expectancy of the reference population was 77 .1 years . Discussion and conclusion : The ICGG Gaucher Registry  represents the largest dataset on GD patients worldwide . The current  life expectancy at birth of people with type 1 GD is about 10 years less  than the reference population, confirming that type 1 GD is not a benign disorder  .

Marteau2","1National Human Genome Research Institute, Bethesda, MD, United States,  2Kings College, London, United Kingdom","A central goal of prenatal genetic counseling is for clients to make optimal decisions about invasive testing . An optimal decision can  be operationalized as an informed choice; understanding relevant  information, choosing a course of action consistent with oneâs  attitudes, and resulting in minimal decisional conflict or regret. Dual  processing theories offer a robust framework for studies into prenatal  testing decision making by addressing two types of information processing, rational and experiential . Experiential processing has been largely ignored in studies of prenatal decision making . We  hypothesize that since decisions about prenatal testing involve new  and unfamiliar choices with significant potential gains and losses,  experiential processing may explain a greater degree of the variance in predictors of decisions . Attitudes toward testing have been shown  to be strong predictors of decisions. When attitudes are in conflict,  ambivalence toward prenatal testing exists and unveils an opportunity  for interventions aimed at prioritizing conflicting values or beliefs. We  demonstrate ambivalence in a qualitative study of 36 women facing decisions about prenatal testing . Quantitative data from a larger cohort  of women ascertained from five US clinics also reveals ambivalence.  Given the prevalence of ambivalence felt by women facing prenatal  decisions, interventions aimed at engaging experiential processing can be tested for their promise in making optimal decisions .",2006

Data were used of women who received a false positive screening  result in the context of a larger study in which women were offered  a prenatal screening test and filled in several questionnaires during and after pregnancy  . At random, 13 of the 25 women who received a  positive screening outcome, were selected to be interviewed, a year after delivery  . Data of both questionnaires and interviews were used . Before they had the screening test done, hardly any of the women had  thought about what they would do when the screening outcome would be bad . They all assumed that the outcome would be that the child  was fine. In the period between receiving the increased test result and  the negative diagnostic test outcome, women took more distance from their pregnancies . After they received the negative (good) diagnostic test outcome, most women were relieved . However, in some women  doubts remained, because they still attached meaning to the outcome of the screening test which had shown something was wrong . Despite the negative experience, most women were positive about the fact that they had been offered a prenatal screening test .",2006

The purpose of the following study was to investigate attitudes towards these issues among the general public . It was  hypothesized that willingness to be informed would be influenced by characteristics of the disease and the individual .Three survey studies where undertaken in Norway and Sweden .  Surveys were administered to a Norwegian random sample (N=2400)  to a Swedish random sample (N=1200), and to a Norwegian student sample (n=607) . Participants were asked to imagine that they had a EMPAG Plenary Lecures relative with an unspecified hereditary disease. Eight different disease  scenarios were constructed, systematically varying three disease  characteristics: fatality, penetrance and availability of treatment .  Individual characteristics were measured by the following scales:  General Self efficacy, Attitude toward Uncertainty, Penn State Worry Questionnaire . Results show that a majority of participants wishes to be informed about the existence of a hereditary disease within their family  .  Significantly more participants want to be informed for treatable compared to non treatable diseases . Neither fatality nor penetrance  did by themselves influence wishes to be informed. However the  number of participants accepting breaches of confidentiality is greatest for the disease that is treatable, highly penetrant, and fatal . Regarding  individual characteristics results show that wishes to be informed and  acceptance of breaches of confidentiality are predicted by uncertainty  avoidance and age, but not by self efficacy or worry.",2006

Hereditary cancer distress over the study period was associated with  inhibited communication about hereditary cancer in the nuclear family and the family of origin . A minority reported unwanted changes in family  relationships (19%), problematic situations in the family (13%) or family  conflicts (4%). Adverse effects consisted of feelings of guilt towards  children and carrier siblings, imposed secrecy and communication problems . Predictors of adverse consequences on family relationships  were inhibited communication about hereditary cancer with relatives, and disengaged rigid or enmeshed chaotic nuclear family functioning .

Non maternity: issues for the family and the genetic  counsellor,EPL07.,Wiles,"Department of Clinical Genetics, Cambridge University Hospitals NHS Founda   tion Trust","Non maternity is a rare occurrence in clinical genetics, compared to the  not uncommon experience of non paternity. Most people are confident  about who their mother is or isnât, but for women, concealing the true biological maternity of the child they raise, is fraught with pitfalls . Three cases of reported non maternity are explored and the complex issues raised examined . In one family the âchildâ had lived their life  under the mistaken belief that the woman who brought them up was their birth mother  . Subsequent genetic investigations led to a disclosure  of the truth by the âmotherâ with traumatic results for the family  .In other  families the truth is known within the family and not disclosed to those outside unless there is a need to do so . Adoption laws have changed and the process of legally raising anotherâs biological child is now more transparent; framed by legal processes, rights and guidelines . This encourages more open communication within the family and with the outside world . Contraception and the  availability of social abortion have made hidden pregnancies less common . However egg donation raises differing issues for families at risk of genetic conditions . Recent changes in the law in the UK,  allow children born using eggs donated after April 2005 to trace their biological mother when they reach 18 years . As geneticists and genetic  counsellors we need to be mindful that for some families the taking of  a family history and the offering of genetic testing may have far wider implications than was predicted .",2006

In most  cases there is no family history of CF, hence the importance of a CF carrier screening program . Evidence from national and international  groups demonstrates that both providers and consumers have positive  attitudes regarding genetic carrier screening for cystic fibrosis. This study explores the attitudes of stakeholders to a cystic fibrosis genetic carrier screening program in Victoria, Australia . Non random, purposive sampling was used to recruit participants  for focus groups of key stakeholders: preconception individuals,  pregnant women, health professionals and cystic fibrosis experts. The  discussions were audio taped and transcribed and thematic analysis was facilitated by the qualitative data management software, ânVivoâ . Participants expressed mixed attitudes towards genetic carrier  screening for cystic fibrosis. Consumersâ attitudes were influenced by  an awareness of family history, the opinions of health professionals and their partners and, their own values and beliefs . Providersâ attitudes  were influenced by time constraints in practice and concerns for the psychosocial outcomes of patients . Participants discussed the different settings in which screening may be  offered and were most strongly in support of preconception screening  however, the practical barriers to offering screening at this time were recognised . Participants proposed that screening be offered when  people are âreadyâ to be screened, ie offering screening at different life stages . Whilst attitudes to a genetic carrier screening program for CF are mixed, community interest is growing . Consultation with stakeholders  is vital to inform the development and implementation of successful genetic carrier screening programs .",2006
comparison of the psychosocial support offered to  breast cancer patients and healthy family members.,EPL09.,"G. Van Spijker , T. Brouwer",Dept,"Psychosocial support for genetic testing in the Netherlands is offered  by social workers in medical genetics departments in the university hospitals . Initially, this support in relation to DNA testing in hereditary  breast cancer focused on healthy family members at risk, but it soon became clear that breast cancer patients are also a vulnerable group .  They, too, are confronted with the consequences of the genetic  diagnosis: knowing the risks of a second breast cancer, of ovarian cancer and for their children and close relatives . It is now recognised  that a diagnosis of hereditary breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC) has many consequences, for both patients and healthy family members . We present an overview of the need for professional psychosocial support in HBOC patients and healthy family members .

In this study, the impact  of a comprehensive counselling protocol is explored, with regard to  counselleesâ psychological distress, beliefs specific to HNPCC and family communication . Since little information is available about  affected cancer patientsâ psychosocial status with regard to HNPCC,  the response to genetic counselling of affected and unaffected participants is compared .methods : Multidisciplinary counselling consists of three consecutive  sessions, provided by a geneticist, a visceral surgeon and a psychotherapist . Risk assessment based on clinical criteria (i .e .Amsterdam/Bethesda) is conveyed to participants . Distress and  beliefs specific to HNPCC were assessed using standardised as well  as investigator derived measures, completed before and 8 weeks after  counselling. The final sample size comprises 379 participants (141 affected, 238 unaffected) . Results : After counselling, a significant reduction in general anxiety  (HADS) and distress specific to HNPCC (IES, DHD) was demonstrated, in both affected and unaffected subjects . Distress declined regardless of what clinical risk they were assigned . Their perceptions of cancer  related threat declined while confidence in effective surveillance increased . Enhanced family communication with regard to HNPCC was reported by one third of the counsellees . Affected patientsâ distress exceeded that of unaffected subjects at both time points .conclusion : The results are suggestive of a beneficial effect of  comprehensive genetic counselling, even when high risk information is conveyed . Clinically relevant distress in a substantial minority of affected patients is indicating the need for appropriate counselling .",2006

To date, much research investigating outcomes has focussed  on the benefits of genetic counselling. The outcome attributes used  were commonly developed by providers of the service or adapted from measures used in other areas of healthcare . However, unlike other  areas of medicine the âpatientsâ in clinical genetics are usually healthy;  often no specific pharmacological or surgical treatment is offered. There  is an argument that services should be evaluated on the basis of how well they alleviate the effects of disease, from a patient perspective .  The first step, therefore, is to identify what those effects are. This  presentation will describe findings from focus groups and interviews conducted with clinicians, patients and patient representatives . The  approach differs from previous outcome research in clinical genetics,  by using combined methods to identify firstly what the effects of genetic  diseases on individuals and families are, and then to assess what genetics services can do to modify these effects .

However, few data are available on the  psychological impact of this common type of result . Moreover, the clinical heterogeneity within this group has not yet been considered .  The current study provides prospective data about the course of cancer  specific worry and distress for different groups of test applicants.methods  All DNA test applicants (n=238) completed three  questionnaires: before, and respectively one and seven months after disclosure of a DNA mutation test . With repeated measures analysis  of variance, differences were assessed between BRCA1/2 positive  women (n=42), BRCA1/2 true negative women (n=43), and women with an uninformative result (n=153) . Results On group level women with an uninformative result seemed  to be reassured after disclosure ( P< .001), but to a lesser extent than  those women who received a true negative result . However, not all  women with an uninformative result reacted similarly: Higher levels  of worry and distress could be explained by relatively straightforward  clinical variables, namely a personal history of cancer ( P< .001) and  a higher pedigree based risk ( P< .005) . Furthermore, these clinical  variables determined whether these women were either comparable  to women who received a true negative result or to BRCA mutation carriers .conclusion  Women with an inconclusive result form a heterogeneous  group of test applicants .

Drawing on data from a prospective study of 49 pregnancies  at high genetic risk, we present qualitative data from 10 individuals (5  women and their 5 male partners) whose pregnancy was at risk from a known parental translocation . Prospective data was collected at 3 points: by interview soon after  a pregnancy was confirmed, 6 months later by questionnaire and by interview after a further 6 months . This unique data set allowed the impact of genetic risk and testing during pregnancy to be examined from gender and time perspectives .  Interviews were taped and transcribed, and analyzed using qualitative techniques . Key themes identified include timing of emotional attachment to pregnancies, guilt and blame, and pregnancy related support . For  example, attachment developed later for the men than the women, with some men reporting attachment only after a child was born .  Draperâs concepts of âbiological exclusionâ and âblurred boundariesâ inform our discussion of this . Issues of guilt and blame were raised  independently by the three male carriers of a translocation, but not by the two men whose partner was the carrier  . While some men  illustrated their own need for support, all adhered to normative roles  of the âprovider of supportâ during a pregnancy.

Semi structured interviews were used to explore the process of  reproductive decision making in seven women with a clinical diagnosis of Marfan syndrome . The women tended to minimise the impact of  the condition on themselves; even so, their perceptions of the severity  of Marfan syndrome were influenced by family membersâ experiences which contributed to a belief that the condition would worsen over time .  Having Marfan syndrome had not stopped any of the women having  children, although in most cases conception of the first child had either  been unplanned or had occurred when the women were in a state of  denial or avoidance of the condition. The birth of their first child led to  women moving from a state of denial or avoidance of the condition  to one of taking control, by becoming informed and participating in  medical surveillance. A number of factors were influential when the  women were considering whether to have further children: their concern  about their future health, mortality and morbidity; their feelings about  passing on Marfan syndrome to their children; their current health; and, the concerns and/or opinions of other family members .

Providers from several disciplines were asked, individually and in focus  group discussion, about their experiences with various testing results in general, and problematic results in particular  . Clients were asked  about their expectations and experiences regarding the same matter  .  Providersâ and clientsâ experiences were compared and analysed to search for themes related to problematic testing results . Problematic results arise because providers, wishing to avoid  underreporting, also report results of mild or unknown clinical  significance. In a context where only two choices, i.e. continuing or  terminating the pregnancy, are available, these results may lead to big dilemmas . Because in the end, the decision about pregnancy is  considered the clientsâ responsibility, clients are more troubled by problematic results than providers . The burden for clients would be diminished in a targeted testing  scenario where providers decide which problematic results would be excluded, more than in a scenario where clients would decide about this .  From the perspective of a fair distribution of responsibilities between  providers and clients, targeted testing would be the obvious way to  deal with problematic findings in prenatal diagnosis. Consequently, the  providers would need to answer the morally laden question of which testing results should be excluded from prenatal diagnosis .",2006

We  compare characteristics and outcomes of theses subjects with previous  reported data about Huntingtonâs disease and autosomal dominant  cerebellar ataxias. This is the first detailed report and the largest series  reported concerning candidates for presymptomatic testing in DM1 and FSH, whatever their attitude towards the testing procedure . The characteristics of applicants were similar in DM1 and FSH, revealing  a predominance of women, a high rate of favorable results (64% for DM1  and 62% for FSH), and family planning as the most frequent reason for seeking presymptomatic testing (31% for DM1 and 28% for FSH) . For  FSH, we observed a low rate of completing the presymptomatic testing program (58%) . For DM1, the rate of completing the presymptomatic  testing program was higher than in others previously studied diseases (87%) . Despite equivalent socioeconomic characteristic DM1 cannot  be compared to others diseases in term of comportment face to the presymptomatic testing protocol . Problems of congenital form, cardiac  risk and anticipation lead to a feeling of emergency and an incentive to do PT with familial and medical pressure over at risk subjects .

The  most devastating possible consequence of these diseases is sudden death, sometimes in minors . Carriers can reduce their risk by the use of medication and adaptation of life style . The latter may involve diet  restrictions or avoidance of triggering situations such as competitive sports, stress or loud noises . In the case of minors, the decision to undergo genetic testing lies with the parents . However, testing of minors is a point of (ethical) debate .  An issue in this debate is how knowledge of their carrier status might  benefit or harm minors. So far, childrenâs experiences in this regard are unknown . Therefore, a qualitative study was initiated to explore  the cognitive, behavioral and emotional impact of carriership on minors (aged between 8 and 18 years) . We interviewed 35 minors with a positive carrier status from 30 families . Semi structured interviews were conducted at the familiesâ homes . Minors were interviewed separately from their parents . All interviews were transcribed verbatim . Two researchers labeled these transcriptions independently  . Discrepancies between coders were  negotiated until consensus was reached . This presentation will focus on minorsâ perception of the identity,  causes, consequences, controllability and timeline of their condition  and how this perception might relate to medication use, adaptations in lifestyle and worries . Clear differences in perceived controllability emerged and these appear to be associated with worries .",2006

Genetic risk and gender: current understanding and  clinical implications,EPL24.,D. Taylor,"Central Queensland University, Rockhampton, Australia","There is increasing evidence that men and women experience genetic risk and engage with predictive genetic testing differentially  . Current  research literature suggests that at risk women are significantly more  likely than their male counterparts to undertake predictive testing  with regard to inherited neurological conditions such as Huntingtonâs disease, as well as inherited cancers and other genetic conditions .  What factors might account for this and what are the implications  of this phenomenon for clinical practice? Drawing on a range of  theoretical literature and social science and clinical genetics research,  this paper examines the concept of gender and how it may influence  the perception and experience of genetic risk and engagement with genetic testing technology  . Gender based analysis of selected data  from two Australian based studies will be presented to further our  understanding of this issue: firstly, from the Genetic Discrimination  Project in Australia which investigated the experiences and perceptions  of 904 asymptomatic individuals who had undertaken predictive genetic  testing for inherited neurological disorders (n=332), familial cancers  (n=481), haemochromatosis (n=45) and other genetic conditions  (n=46); and secondly, from an in depth interview study that investigated  the post genetic test experiences of at risk men and women who undertook predictive testing for a range of genetic conditions . Gender  based analyses of both quantitative and qualitative data from these  studies will be presented and discussed in light of current literature and  research. The potential implications of these findings within the clinical genetics context will be discussed .EMPAG Plenary Lecures0",2006

Middleton Price2",1St,"Maryâs Hospital, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2North West Genetics  Knowledge Park (Nowgen), Manchester, United Kingdom. Currently, some groups undergo or are offered carrier testing for  recessive conditions, e .g . beta thalassaemia, that are common in their populations/ethnic groups . This can enable couples to make informed  reproductive choices, and may also reduce the number of affected individuals in subsequent generations . Genetic testing to identify beta  thalassaemia carriers in the Turkish Cypriot community in Cyprus has been carried out for the past 25 years . It is mandatory for couples to be  tested before a marriage certificate can be issued, though the results  of the test have no bearing on whether the certificate is issued or not.  No previous research has investigated individualsâ attitudes towards  and views about compulsory carrier testing in populations where this happen . Semi structured interviews with 19 Turkish Cypriots, 11 women and  eight men, who had undergone mandatory testing were carried out to gain an insight into their views about this . Ten of the interviewees are carriers and nine are non carriers . There were six couples, two of whom were carrier couples . A number of themes have emerged from this .  The interviewees identified that more education about the condition itself and about testing would be helpful . They felt it would have been  important to have had more counselling before and after they were tested . Also, even though carrier testing was seen as important by most interviewees, some felt it had been imposed on them . Finally,  a number of interviewees felt carrier testing should have been done earlier, and not around the time of their wedding .",2006

With the growing concern  for supporting informed prenatal testing decisions it is surprising  that there has been little examination of how attitudes towards this  condition influence these decisions. This study used Q methodology  to identify how different understandings of Downâs syndrome might relate to attitudes towards the use of prenatal testing and termination for the condition . Seventy six people were selected as being likely  to represent a diverse range of views about Downâs syndrome,  approximately half of whom had some known experience or expertise related either to the condition or to prenatal testing . The participants  Q sorted 50 propositions about Downâs syndrome selected to reflect  different views about the condition in terms of its impact on the affected person, on families with an affected child, and on society  . Six  statistically independent accounts of the condition reflecting a range of  attitudes towards, and experiences of, people with Downâs syndrome were extracted using Principal Components Analysis . The study  demonstrated that people hold complex and sometimes seemingly  contradictory views about Downâs syndrome, and that these are likely  to influence their prenatal testing decisions. The current antenatal  setting provides little opportunity for people to discuss and explore their views on disability  . It is argued that this may affect the ability of  some individuals to make decisions that are informed by their own views and values .",2006

Methods: We have been interviewed 40 adult patients and their relatives  from 25 unrelated families with Long QT syndrome and Brugada syndrome . For all individuals genetic counseling were recommended  because of clinical diagnosis of primary channelopathies or of relations to affected patients . All individuals were asked about their clinical and  family histories, pedigrees, causes of the death in relatives, requests for genetic testing and attitude to predictive genetic testing . Results: We have been subdivided tested persons into two groups: (1)  patients survived through cardiac arrest or had SCD victims among  near relatives and (2) patients had mild clinical course of the disease and hadnât dramatic experience of SCD in their families . About 80%  patients from group (1) noted molecular genetic testing as important  point of examination and strongly intended to use the results in the next family planning for themselves and for their issue . In the group  (2) the individuals pointed to lower interest in DNA testing and prenatal diagnostics . Conclusion: Personal and family experience of SCD is the most  important factor influencing on decision making in the inherited arrhythmias patients .

Examining the rate of psychiatric disturbances in pre symptomatic  individuals may help to determine whether such symptoms represent  a prodromal manifestation of the disease, or whether they occur as a  result of social and psychological adversity associated with a family history of HD . To date, the few prospective studies investigating  psychiatric symptoms in pre symptomatic at risk individuals have  only involved small samples of patients or have not used appropriate control groups . The present study compared the prevalence of psychiatric symptoms  in two groups of at risk asymptomatic individuals (gene positive and  gene negative) requesting predictive testing for HD between 1987 and 1999 . Lifetime psychiatric histories of 204 at risk individuals (89  gene carriers, 115 non carriers) were obtained using the Composite International Diagnostic Interview (WHO, 1987) . Lifetime and 12 month  diagnoses were determined according to the DSM III R criteria of the American Psychiatric Association . Neither participants nor examiners were aware of gene status at the time of testing . A preliminary analysis revealed no difference between gene positive  and gene negative groups in the lifetime frequency of clinical  psychiatric disorders. However, gene carriers did report a significantly higher 12 month prevalence of sub clinical depressive symptoms .  We will present the results of a further analysis currently in progress  to investigate the relationship between psychiatric symptoms and  proximity to onset of HD in pre symptomatic individuals carrying the HD  mutation.

The interviews were  transcribed verbatim and analysed using the qualitative method Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis (IPA) . Results: One of the main themes emerging from the analysis of the  interviews was the isolation that families felt, which appeared to be  due to an engagement in social comparison with a number of different groups (e .g ., adult onset Huntingtonâs Disease) and a sense of JHD as being different . This meant that the child with JHD and their parents were unable to normalise their experiences . This sense of isolation was exacerbated by a general lack of knowledge and understanding .  Other themes describe how parents perceived the natural history  of JHD. For example, parents found specific symptoms, such as  challenging behaviour, particular difficult to cope with. Other themes  presented included a definition of what families perceived to be helpful and unhelpful support .

Kerzin Storrar3","1IBMC, Univ","Porto, Porto, Portugal, 2ISCS N, Paredes, Portugal, 3Academic  Unit of Medical Genetics and Regional Genetic Service, Manchester, United  Kingdom. Most definitions of genetic counselling include the aim of helping counselees adjust to their genetic situation . There is some research  evidence to suggest that it is the personal meaning constructed by patients that is important in understanding adaptation . This workshop will draw on the cognitive narrative model as a way of  exploring how patientâs stories can be utilised more fully in the context of genetic counselling . The theoretical assumptions underpinning the model will be outlined . We will consider what can be learnt from the  way patients construct and give meaning to their episodes and how  patients can be guided to explore and create new meanings for genetic information . Case examples will include narrative techniques used by one of the  authors (JR) to support women in their adjustment process following termination of pregnancy  . There will be the opportunity for participants  to try some of the techniques that may be particularly useful in genetic  counselling practice including metaphor generation; a creative way  of providing awareness of meaning content and alternative versions of a particular event or episode . This exercise is guided through a  structured manual and the authors will address any specific difficulty raised from ongoing exercise . The relevance and applicability of this framework is discussed in what concerns limitations and adequacy  .",2006

Individuals from  high risk FAP families are offered genetic testing from the age of 10 years onward . Purpose: To investigate the long term psychosocial impact of FAP on  individuals from high risk families and on the family  . Patients and methods: This nationwide cross sectional study will invite  all individuals from FAP families to complete a self report questionnaire  (estimated n=750), followed by a semi structured interview with a subsample of respondents (n=60) . The questionnaire assesses  surveillance behavior, experiences with genetic testing and preventive  surgery, physical symptoms, a range of psychosocial measures and the perceived need for professional psychosocial support . Additional  questions assess attitudes toward prenatal diagnosis and pre implantation techniques . Partners of individuals with a clinical or genetic diagnosis will complete a subset of these questions . Data from  a pilot study highlighted problems with relationships, sexuality, fatigue,  feelings of guilt and psychical complications and long term effects of surgery affecting daily life . Relevance: This study will contribute to our understanding of the  long term psychosocial impact of being a member of a family at high  risk for FAP, and will provide insight into (not) undergoing genetic  testing, surveillance, and risk reducing surgery among FAP family members . This information can be used by health care providers for  counseling and psycho education programs for individuals at high risk of developing FAP  .",2006
Prenatal testing   Can we predict or influence on womenâs  choices?,EP03.,"Mishori Dery1, I. Shoham Vardi1, R. Carmi2",1Dept,"of Epidemiology and Health Services Evaluation, Ben Gurion University  of the Negev, Beer Sheva, Israel, 2Ben Gurion University of the Negev, Beer  Sheva, Israel. Introduction: Utilization rates of prenatal tests vary with the type of test .  Compared to ultrasound scans and maternal serum screening, uptake  rates of amniocentesis and carrier screening for genetic diseases are generally lower  . Objectives: To identify factors associated with utilization of amniocentesis and carrier screening . Methods: The study was conducted in southern Israel in which 596  Jewish women, who had given birth at Soroka University Medical  Center, were interviewed by phone using a structured questionnaire, at 5 8 weeks postpartum . Of them, 464 (77 .8%) agreed to answer a knowledge questionnaire .Results: Rates of test uptake were 22 .2% and 20 .8% for amniocentesis and genetic tests, respectively  . In a multivariate logistic regression Reproductive decision makingperformed on the 464 women who answered the knowledge  questionnaire, factors associated with carrier screening were  secularism (OR = 3 .032), high levels of knowledge regarding prenatal tests (OR = 3 .917) and satisfaction with pretest counseling (OR = 7 .177) . The same factors were associated with uptake of amniocentesis (ORs  = 3.834, 2.301, 6.484, respectively), with the addition of age â¥35 years (OR = 2 .674), medical recommendation for the test (OR = 2 .822), and previous termination of pregnancy (OR = 6 .087) . Conclusions: Accepting a prenatal test is associated with religious  and cultural beliefs, but also with a more informed decision than the declining of one . While religious and cultural aspects of prenatal  decisions should be respected by health providers, strengthening  lay knowledge regarding prenatal tests and improving professional  counseling will allow more informed choices, which might result in higher uptake of prenatal testing .",2006

A limited number of studies  have focused on men, and few have involved men affected by an inherited condition . Semi structured interviews with ten men affected  by Becker Muscular Dystrophy (BMD) were undertaken to gain an  insight into their views about women undergoing carrier testing and  prenatal diagnosis for the condition, and on pre symptomatic testing of at risk boys . They were also asked about their thoughts about having children themselves . The key themes that emerged with regard to their attitudes to carrier  testing and prenatal diagnosis were that they identified the importance  of women being able to make informed reproductive decisions, and  an understanding that women might feel guilt about passing on the condition . Perceived severity of BMD, capacity to cope and individual choice were seen as important factors in reproductive decision making .  Their opinions about the appropriateness of prenatal diagnosis and termination for BMD varied, and were influenced by beliefs about the  value of life, attitudes to disability, and reflecting on their personal  experiences; whatever their beliefs and experiences, all the men valued their own lives . Issues of concern around pre symptomatic testing  included timing, benefits and disadvantages of testing and potential differences between the parentsâ and childâs outlook . Factors that  influenced their own reproductive decisions included their daughters  having to make difficult reproductive choices, the chance of affected  boys in future generations, the physical limitations of the condition, and the possibility of advancement in medical research .",2006

Victoria, Australia, 3Murdoch Childrens Research  Institute and The University of Melbourne, Melbourne. Victoria, Australia. Many pregnant women in Victoria, Australia have a Maternal Serum  Screening (MSS) test either in the first or second trimester of pregnancy.  These screening tests can indicate an individualâs risk of having a baby with a chromosomal anomaly or a neural tube defect . Women who receive an âincreased riskâ result are generally offered  genetic counselling in order to provide information about their test result  and the options available for diagnostic testing such as amniocentesis or CVS . In these circumstances genetic counselling aims to facilitate  informed and autonomous decision making (Hodgson & Spriggs 2005)  but due to a lack of process studies there is currently little known  about how women experience this phenomena or indeed how genetic counselling might achieve this aim . As part of a PhD project entitled âWomenâs experiences of prenatal  genetic counsellingâ 21 âincreased riskâ genetic counselling sessions and 15 follow up interviews were audio taped and transcribed .  Thematic and content analysis provided:  a) an insight into what actually happens in prenatal genetic counselling b) rich descriptions of how pregnant women in this cohort experience being at increased risk for a chromosome anomaly  . Using contrasting individual accounts this presentation explores selected womenâs experiences of prenatal genetic counselling .

However, familial cases may occur as the result of mutations in the UBE3A gene or of the Imprinting Center  . We describe the case  of a pregnant woman having two nephews with Angelman syndrome  caused by a UBE3A mutation; due to poor communication within  the family, she was completely unaware of this diagnosis and of the subsequent risk of recurrence until 15 weeks of gestation . Mutation analysis in the woman revealed she carried the familial mutation .  Amniocentesis and prenatal genetic test were then performed, demonstrating that the fetus had inherited the disease . The pregnancy was terminated at week 21 . The unexpected diagnosis and the  subsequent pregnancy termination caused the woman a severe  psychological distress showing relevant psychopatological symptoms and psychological support was immediately offered . At two year follow up she showed a better adaptation to grief . The unawareness of  the Angelman Syndrome risk appeared to have significantly influenced her adverse psychological reaction . Considering this factor, it could be  useful prompting future researches toward a deep comprehension of  the relation between risk awareness and psychological impact of fetal anomalies communication . Furthermore, medical and psychosocial  support received from professional caregivers were of great value  for the woman and helpful in her grieving process according to her reports .

The study of these  birth defects is particularly difficult given that many pregnancies are terminated shortly after diagnosis . As such, one proposed method  involves utilizing genetic counseling resources to enroll patients into  a study within days after diagnosis, which is critical to minimize recall bias of exposures and to obtain tissue samples for genetic analysis .  One ethical concern of using this method is that participation may  pose a significant emotional burden for the parents. Potential benefit to  parent participation might include an opportunity to discuss concerns  in a supportive environment, emotional support and a decreased  sense of isolation, and a feeling of altruism in contributing to scientific research . Although it is possible to extrapolate from studies addressing  the ethical and psychological impact of research participation within  bereavement and trauma based settings, there is no literature on the  emotional repercussions of parental participation in studies focusing on lethal birth defects . There is also a paucity of literature that examines  the psychosocial implications of surveying an individual directly after a sensitive event has occurred .

Predictive genetic diagnosis for cancer has evolved  during the last decade and is enforced since control programs for at  risk individuals detect tumors earlier and thus reduce mortality, but  knowledge about how this new information affects the life situation is limited . We performed oral, tape recorded interviews with 10 Swedish carriers of high risk alleles for HNPCC . The interviews were analysed through inductive content analysis and the results demonstrate the impact of  the communication processes and the importance of the individualâs  previous experiences from cancer . Individuals in HNPCC families  have often experienced early onset cancer in close relatives . The  responsibility for informing family members about the hereditary cancer  within the family is perceived as a burden, but is facilitated by an open communication and good contact within the family  . Experiential  knowledge influences coping possibilities and may strengthen as well  as weaken these; most individuals who have previously reflected about  the possibility of hereditary cancer perceive the information about a  genetic change as a confirmation of their suspicion, whereas those for whom the knowledge is unexpected seem to need more support .

Results : From the 28 interviews, themes central to communicating  with children about genetics were identified. Facilitating autonomy was viewed as fundamental in counselling children . Additionally,  personalisation of information and turning abstract concepts  into concrete knowledge were important strategies to enhance comprehension . Counsellors spontaneously identified barriers to communication, of which the taciturn child was the most common . Poor family  communication and lack of materials for children were also named as barriers . Maturity, illness experience, and good family communication were perceived as facilitating counselling . Likewise, school education  and the presence of supportive parents were cited as having positive effects .conclusions : The results illustrate that although genetic counselling  of children is possible, a number of factors affect its success . Most are  amenable to intervention, although their relationship to comprehension may be complex .

None of the respondents  indicated negative initial experiences with the family cancer clinic as a reason for discontinuing the counseling .  .conclusion:  During the  initial contact with a family cancer clinic, sufficient attention should be  paid to inquiring about clientsâ worries and concerns, and to informing  them about ways that are available to cope effectively with test results, both positive and negative .",2006
Genetic counseling during pregnancy: causes and  consequences,EP19.,M. Aalfs,"Department of Clinical Genetics, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Reproductive genetic counselling preferably takes place prior to conception . In the Netherlands, however, an estimated 15 % of the  people attend a department of clinical genetics for the first time while already pregnant . If we want to stimulate preconception genetic  counselling for familial conditions, it is important to gain insight in reasons for the timing of referral . The main aim of our study, therefore, was to explore factors that may affect this timing . A second aim was to  address some consequences of the timing of referral for the quality of the initial clinical genetic consultation . Pregnant (n=100) and non pregnant (n=100) women who visited our  department of clinical genetics completed a questionnaire before and after the initial consultation . The counsellors completed a post visit questionnaire . The consultations were tape recorded and analysed . In  addition, a questionnaire was sent to the general practitioners of the pregnant women . We found pregnant women to be less inclined to initiate genetic counselling themselves, probably because they estimated their genetic risk as lower and worried less . Most general practitioners were unaware of a genetic risk factor in their patient before the pregnancy  .  Finally, we found no important adverse effects of the timing of genetic  counselling on the content and affective tone of the counselee  counsellor interaction during the initial consultation, nor on womenâs satisfaction . Based on our findings, an active role of general practitioners and  the implementation of a routine preconception consultation for every woman with reproductive plans are advocated .",2006

","Nowadays, the frequency of children identified as being biologically  fathered by someone other than the man who believes he is the father  is such that, in the field of genetic counseling, is likely to encounter cases of false paternity  . In the field of counselling, information is dealt with which is not requested by patients nor expected by them . This information, which seems to  regard only the âfatherâ of the family, actually has repercussions for the entire family  . By now, it has been accepted that genetic information is  by its nature both individual and familial . When dealing with false paternity, as revealed through genetic  counseling, what should the geneticistâs course of conduct be? In  accordance with the ethical principles and directives contained in  the Oviedo Convention, must he/she reveal information in keeping  with his/her duty to inform patients about the state of their health?  Otherwise, must he/she refuse to supply such information in light of  the negative repercussions and difficulties in managing them within the  limited scope of genetic counseling? Should the principle be valued  that a person has the right to such knowledge or should family unity  and the serenity of its internal relationships be safeguarded instead? If  a geneticist were allowed to make his/her own decisions in individual  cases, which criteria should guide him/her? Does the danger of  geneticistsâ paternalism exist?

Analysis of transcribed focus groups revealed that participants had the  following understanding of non directiveness: Not influencing clients  and letting them make their own decisions by; presenting all aspects  of a scenario, not giving an opinion, not being overtly influenced by  ones own values, internally monitoring choice of words and non verbal signals and responding to clientsâ cues on a case by case basis .

The same sources of information are present when the parents  have had the procedure and are expecting and receiving results of amniocentesis . The news that the fetus is affected with a disorder has  even more profound consequences as the couple grapples with the issue of whether or not to continue the pregnancy  . In this paper, we intend to address the issue of genetic counseling after a positive diagnosis of Down syndrome from two aspects . The  first aspect is narrow counseling, which includes information about  physical and psychological characteristics the child is expected to have, as a person affected with Downâs syndrome . The second aspect  is wider counseling, which, along with the medical information, includes experience of parents already raising children with Downâs syndrome .

Psychosocial barriers to uptake of clinical services for  hypertrophic cardiomyopathy; implications for service design,EP24.,"R. Honeywell , H. Watkins, E. Blair, C. Fraser Jones","University of Oxford, Oxford, United Kingdom","The provision of services for families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  (HCM) has been evolving with the advances in detection, management and genetic analysis of this condition . The advent of genetic analysis, in  particular, brings with it the potential to clarify risk status for first degree relatives and to offer a health economic advantage . However, uptake  of clinical screening with or without genetic testing is not one hundred  percent amongst at risk family members. Psychosocial influences  such as chronic anxiety, positive or negative family role models, and  readiness to confront risk status may extend this process over months or years . We present three cases illustrating how psychosocial issues  prolonged uptake of clinical services and required flexibility on the part of clinic providers . These issues are more the exception than the rule  and are more likely to occur in families who have suffered bereavement due to HCM . Our experience supports the presence of a healthcare  provider designated to handle and keep track of psychosocial issues arising in families with HCM, minimising the chance that individuals requiring more time are lost to follow up . We describe the Oxford  Genetics Knowledge Park model of service involving a genetic counsellor which has been implemented over three years . Features  of this service include particular attention to counselling pre clinical  assessment, and strategies to help families with cascade information and screening .

The literature indicated that the multidisciplinary clinic may be beneficial  for patients and health care professionals in terms of efficiency of service and the pooling of resources . Little data exists on patient satisfaction in different models of care . Patient satisfaction was measured using an audit tool for genetics service (Skirton et al, 2005) . 25 patients responded to the postal questionnaire, giving a response rate of 49% . There was a statistically  significant correlation between overall satisfaction and the outcome  measure, greater peace of mind (Pearsonâs correlation coefficient 0 .007) . Patients in Clinic 1 ranked outcome measures related to a diagnosis being made or refuted higher than Clinic 2 patients . Clinic  2 patients ranked outcome measures related to understanding the condition higher than Clinic 1 patients . It may be suggested that patients in Clinic 1 achieve âgreater peace of  mindâ because more of them are told in one clinic appointment whether they have Marfan syndrome or not .

Guidelines for  counselling can be considered to reflect these ideals. Objective: To review how genetic counselling is defined in international  guidelines and to examine what kinds of expectations and ideals are  concentrated on it, after which the ideology behind the ideal counselling can be investigated . Methods: Guidelines for genetic counselling that have been produced  by international and European political bodies, regional professional  organisations, ethical boards and patient associations were collected  and classified using the computer aided analysis programme  QSRNudist. The classifications were analysed with discourse analysis that focuses on the uniform mechanisms of meanings . The  objective was to find the collectively accepted conceptions of genetic counselling . Results: In the guidelines, counselling is seen as a unique process of providing very special information . The speciality of genetic information is a core issue, which creates the basis of ideal counselling . The  information is expected to be too complex for ordinary people to  understand without the help of specially trained professionals and particular methods . The ideal counselling concentrates on individual  choices, whereas family is seen as a problem that endangers the  values of individuality and confidentiality.

Among these, 7 couples asked for termination of pregnancy, 3 were lost at follow up, 16 accepted to be included in our study  . The protocol  included clinical genetic evaluation with auxological measurements and detailed personal history  . With parentâs consent, pictures of the  child were taken to document dysmorphisms and familial traits . A questionnaire including an assessment of motor, language, behavioral and cognitive skills was then administered . Information  about the relationship with the pedaitrician and other family members were collected as well . Preliminary results did not show any relevant physical or congnitive  delay. In three cases language delay was identified. A general high  level of anxiety in the relationship between parents and daughter was observed . This observation prompted us to apply evaluation  instruments specific for language area and, for age four and above, a Separation Anxiety Test (SAT) for both children and parents .

Genetic testing in children is recommended only under circumstances  where a clear medical and psychological benefit to the child can be demonstrated . Pre symptomatic genetic testing in minors is  recommended for disorders for which medical intervention exists, and for which early detection improves future medical health . However, in  daily health care practice it may be difficult to apply these guidelines. Aim: The aim of this study is to see whether non genetic health  care providers in five different EU countries would act similar once  confronted with parents request of pre symptomatic testing on their minor children for a treatable disease . Methods: Structured questionnaires were sent out in five different EU  countries (Germany, France, Sweden, The UK and The Netherlands) to  GPs and paediatricians, presenting them with an imaginary scenario,  in addition of which questions were asked about whether or not they  felt that the children presented in the scenario should undergo pre symptomatic genetic testing . Results: There was agreement between countries on testing the oldest child, aged 12, and not testing the youngest child, Tom (6 months) .  But there were large differences between countries in recommending a genetic test for the child at the age of 8 years . Physicians in France  and Germany would recommend a test, whereas physicians in The UK, Sweden and The Netherlands would not .

Objective: The short term impact of the pre symptomatic genetic test  (PT) for Machado Joseph disease (MJD) in the Azores (Portuguese  Islands) was assessed in 46 individuals at risk who completed the PT Program . Methods: Scores for depression and anxiety were used as  indicators of the subjectsâ emotional status immediately before the PT and 1 year after disclosure of the results . Results: Global levels of participation in the Azorean PT Program for MJD were high (20 .7%),  particularly in Flores Island (35 .8%) . For the total sample, mean scores  of depression and anxiety before and after the PT presented without  clinical significance. No differences were found for depression and  anxiety scores before and after the PT  . Furthermore, when grouped by  test results (carriers/non carriers), there were no differences between pre  and post test levels . Conclusions: Results indicate that the test  result did not cause a decrease in the psychological well being of the individuals tested . The high number of participants performing the  PT in the small and isolated community of Flores Island, where MJD  represents a source of stigma, was interpreted as an indication that  in this particular population the PT offers the individuals at risk the possibility of liberating from a stigma, and, hence, from exclusion .",2006

Having as a starting point the proposal of a comprehensive  psychological framework, we developed this exploratory study in order  to investigate the relationship between selected psychosocial variables and acceptance of presymptomatic testing . All participants were persons at risk, tested for familial amyloid  polyneuropathy type I or ATTRV30M (FAP I, n=80), Huntington disease  (HD, n=15), Machado Joseph disease (MJD, n=17), hereditary breast  and ovarian cancer (HBOC, n=18) and hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC, n=19) . All were interviewed before disclosure of the test results . Participants who had reported higher acceptance of presymptomatic  testing believed that test uptaking had more advantages than  disadvantages, relied more heavily on behavioural (problem solving) or  cognitive (logical analysis) approach coping strategies, and had more positive attitudes towards doctors and medicine . On the other hand,  participants who had reported lower acceptance of presymptomatic  testing showed greater decisional conflict: they were more uncertain  about their decision to be tested and felt uninformed, unclear about  values (pros and cons of each option), unsupported in decision  making and unsatisfied with their decision; moreover, they perceived  more disadvantages in presymptomatic testing, and scored higher on neuroticism . These results suggest that tested individuals may represent a very  heterogeneous group, at the affective, cognitive and motivational dimensions . To the extent we can delineate the role of these dimensions  in the uptake of presymptomatic testing, we may target pre test psychological evaluation and genetic counselling more effectively  .Predictive testing 0",2006

All were interviewed before disclosure of the test results . Individuals at risk for HBOC were older, more educated and considered  themselves to be at a higher genetic risk than those at risk for the  other diseases. Subjects at risk for FAP I reported significantly higher satisfaction with life than those at risk for MJD . At risk individuals  for HNPCC reported significantly higher levels of neuroticism than  the other groups, and perceived a higher emotional burden than those at risk for FAP I . Moreover, individuals at risk for MJD showed  significantly lower adherence to presymptomatic testing than the other groups .Given that FAP I is a treatable condition and MJD is not, it is not surprising that the former reported higher subjective well being .  It may be that those undergoing HNPCC testing are a less selected  and, therefore, a less psychologically robust group than the other groups . Acknowledgement of these differences can be applied to  improve psychological evaluation and genetic counselling of at risk individuals who participate in presymptomatic testing programs . Pre  test assessment of psychological well being and personality could be  used as a basis for targeting those most likely to experience adverse reactions to the test outcome .",2006
Beyond consent: ordinary abuses in HD presymptomatic genetic testing in italy.,EP40.,"Zinzi1, G. Jacopini1, M.

Although the procedure does not offer specific clinical benefits,  genetic testing has been implemented as a mean to promote at risk individualsâ autonomy and emotional well being . In order to pursue  this aim, the International Guidelines recommend HD genetic testing  being managed in a protocol including the provision of pre and post  test counselling in order to reduce the risks of catastrophic reaction to a positive result . However, during the last years we have seen a diffuse trend to  perform genetic test for HD as a ânormalâ laboratory analysis taking  blood samples from people at risk without any specific counselling and we were able to collect and document some of these âabusesâ .  This practice fails to protect people at risk as it does not provide them  with the opportunity to evaluate the pros and cons of knowing own genetic condition and to give a really informed consent to the test . Our  data suggest that most of these tests have been performed in order to obtain blood samples for research purposes .

Nevertheless, it was only in 2005 (upon definitive publication of the new Portuguese law on  genetic testing) that we begun following a structured protocol which includes the psychological evaluation of all at risk individuals . Although both HD and FAP are late onset neurological diseases,  psychological disorders/psychiatric complaints are exclusive to HD  patients, in whom they may represent the first disease symptoms. The purpose of this work is to characterise the psychological profile  of healthy at risk subjects and to examine any differences between HD and FAP groups . These issues are particularly important when  anticipating the impact of predictive results, and instrumental when developing an adequate early intervention psychological program .8 HD and 19 FAP subjects, were evaluated so far  .Besides an interview,  we tested each individual using: Acceptance of the Predictive Testing  Scale, State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI), MMPI (revised), Risk Perception of being a carrier  . We have found no statistical differences between HD and FAP groups  for demographic data, test acceptance, State and Trait anxiety, risk perception, and personality traits .

Familial history of cancer could lead to psychological vulnerability that  could interfere with genetic counselling and adjustment after result  announcement. Our aim is first to evaluate psychological vulnerability  of 127 subjects (61 unaffected, 66 affected) who have undergone  mutation searching for colonic cancer and secondly to describe  personal representations and beliefs, prior to the first counselling. The questionnaires Center for Epidemiological Scale for Depression  (CES D) and the State Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI) were employed  to assess distress and open ended questions were proposed to access to beliefs about genetic predisposition . RESULTS: subjects who have undergone genetic testing were more  depressed than non clinical population (Ï2 =77.84; p=.000). Compared  with unaffected individuals, affected subjects were more depressed (t=  2.05;p=.04), more anxious (t= 2.89;p=.005) but were not concerned by trait anxiety  . Surprisingly, 30 .7% had estimated their own risk as null or  weak and 69 .3% had considered they were at high or higher risk . Half  of the subjects had a bias perception of their own genetic susceptibility,  which they defined as higher like others family members, invoking 1)  physical and/or psychological similarity with an affected close relative,  2) the number of cancer , 3) or depressed cognitions like fatalism and hopelessness . CONCLUSIONS: These results highlight the particular vulnerability of subjects participating to genetic testing for colonic cancer  . Some  subjects have biases, naives representations which could be a barrier  to medical information, preventive strategies and emotional well being, following the genetic results . Implications and consequences for future adjustment are discussed .",2006

Sixteen carrier couples and 17 non carrier couples participated in the study  . Self report questionnaires were  used, assessing depression level, anxiety, intrusive and avoidance thoughts and coping strategies .Beliefs and cultural aspects 0 Results: Partners of carriers have as much distress as carriers, and  for some distress variables even more (p<0 .05 to 0 .001) . They clearly  experience more psychological distress than non carriersâ partners, as expected (p<0 .05 to 0 .001) . Regarding coping strategies, carriersâ  partners adopt more passive strategies (passive regressive and  avoiding reactions; p<0.05) and less active strategies (social support  seeking and problem solving; p<0.05 to 0.001), compared to carriers.  For both carriers and partners, the adoption of more passive strategies  was associated with more distress and the use of more active strategies  with less distress (for carriers: p<0.05 to 0.001; for partners: p<0.05).  The presence of children before predictive testing was an additional  result specific distress factor. Conclusion: Carriersâ partners have at least as much psychological distress as carriers, but partners have the tendency to draw back .  The results suggest that the grief of carriersâ partners may be  âdisenfranchisedâ, or not socially recognised, as if they have no right to mourn . We moreover interpreted the results referring to psychological defences and imbalanced partner relationship . Finally, we formulate some implications for genetic counselling .",2006
What representations lie behind presymptomatic testing?  A psychodynamic perspective of a case study.,EP44.,S. Leonardo,"Hospital Santa Maria, Lisboa, Portugal","The aim of this presentation is to think about psychodynamic concepts behind genetic counselling for presymptomatic testing . We all went through an identification process with the primary objects   mother/father   to construct our own identity  . The individuals that  approach genetic services are no different . We will try to understand  how the process of identification with a sick caregiver can interfere  with the subjectâs thoughts and behaviour concerning presymptomatic testing . As an example of the impact of  identification by introjection , we  will discuss the case of a woman with a difficult relationship with her  sick mother, who believed to be positive for Machado Joseph Disease, even though she had not been tested yet . We will see that this strong  belief is the result of a fusion of her own Self with her motherâs Self . We propose that the representations of at risk individuals about their  sick caregivers and the quality of their relationships (secure/insecure)  with them are important issues to consider and a key to understanding their attitude towards presymptomatic testing . The psychologist must be aware of these representations of the  Self and realise that they are unique for each case . This is also the  reason why an interview can be the most important instrument in the psychological evaluation . Key   words: presymptomatic testing, mechanisms of identification,  secure/insecure relationships, Self .",2006

METHODS: Before counselling, 620 women filled out a first questionnaire assessing their comparative risk estimates . RESULTS: Results showed that these women consider their risk higher than that of a woman from the general population (i .e ., a pessimistic response), but equal to the risk of another counselee . The latter  comparative risk measure was also more normally distributed implying that comparing to a similar other person is a more relevant comparison .  Women were more pessimistic comparing to another counselee if they  had had breast cancer, and more optimistic if they had no first degree  relatives with breast cancer, perceived a low absolute risk, and had stronger dispositional optimistic tendencies .

Background: From a clinical perspective it is regarded common sense  that prior experiences (PE) with illness and death shape current perceptions of a hereditary disease and oneâs own risk . The impact of  PE on counselees perceptions has been rarely explored in empirical studies . In this study, the impact of PE with cancer was explored in persons at risk of hereditary bowel cancer (HNPCC) . Methods: Using a prospective design and consecutive accrual, 183 unaffected individuals at risk of HNPCC were assessed . PE with  regard to cancer in the family of origin were elicited by interview during comprehensive genetic counselling . Perceptions and distress specific to HNPCC were assessed through standardised and study  specific measures (1) before and (2) 8 weeks after genetic counselling.  Regression analyses were performed to determine the impact of  various characteristics of the illness experience on cognitions and  distress specific to HNPCC. Results: The perception of cancer related threat was shown to decrease  with the number of relatives affected by cancer, and to increase when counselees had experienced the death of close relatives . No  direct effect of PE was found on perceptions of risk; while an indirect effect was mediated by cancer related threat . None of the various  characteristics of PE was related to distress specific to HNPCC. Conclusion: Differential effects of PE were shown to shape counseleesâ  perceptions specific to HNPCC. Since PE are likely to influence  counseleesâ response to clinical risk assignment, they should be taken into account during genetic counselling .",2006

The results presented highlight the psychosocial impact XLRP can have both on an individual and their extended family  . Among the  most challenging burdens emphasized were the continuous need for  readjustment to deteriorating levels of vision, the uncertainty about prognosis and a lack of understanding in the wider community  . The Living with a genetic disease 06 diagnosis evoked very powerful feelings of guilt and resentment within  this family; with damaging consequences for family communication  and isolation of an affected relative . The experience of linkage analysis  underlined how individual family members can operate using different  primary defences and coping strategies, and that such differences can be a source of tension and friction . Experiences of carrier testing  and presymptomatic testing revealed psychosocial and emotional  consequences and emphasized a requirement for careful pre  and  post test counselling. The findings of this study raise implications for both future practice and research .",2006

However, self reports may reflect opposite conditions1,2 .  Coherence of speech, the ability to talk about a subject in a truthful,  consistent manner, is used as a measure to identify such opposite conditions . Objectives: to examine changes in coherence over time, and to explore if coherence was correlated with distress . Methods: three structured interviews were held in a random subgroup of 43 women . Two were held after a surveillance appointment (m1, m3), and one halfway two appointments (m2) . Raters gave the  interviews a numerical (1 9; â¥ 5 = coherent) and a categorical score (free, entangled or dismissive) . Self reported psychic distress was  measured with the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and the Impact of Event Scale . Results: mean levels of coherence were at m1: 4.6; at m2: 4.2; at m3: 4 .9 (p< 0 .03) . Intra individually these scores differed > 2Â½ points in 28%  of the participating women. Percentages of women classified as âfreeâ  were: at m1: 33%; at m3: 29%; at m4: 56%. At m3 (the home situation),  the majority of the women were classified as âentangledâ (63%). Higher  levels of coherence of speech (numerical) were correlated with lower levels of intrusion (m1), avoidance (m3, m4) and depression (m3) .

This  paper will describe an innovative project aimed at enhancing public  education about genetics and raising awareness of key psychosocial issues for families and society  . The project team consisted of a genetic counsellor and two artists, one a visual artist and the other a poet . The artists conducted a series of  workshops with six people who had experience of a genetic condition in the family  . The conditions included Down syndrome, Huntington  disease, familial cancer and skeletal dysplasia . Following the  workshops and discussion with the genetic counsellor on the nature  of her work, the artists created an exhibition of work using multiple  photographic images, an installation focussing on the work of Mendel,  and poetry to convey the complexity of experience and emotion associated with genetic disorders . An exhibition was initially held in a Public Library  . The images and poetry have also been used in a  number of presentations and workshops and are on semi permanent display in a public hospital corridor  . Evaluation of the project was undertaken via analysis of freehand  comments recorded by attendees, interviews with six persons who attended the exhibition and a written questionnaire to stakeholders .  Feedback indicated that the exhibition had raised awareness of the scientific and psychosocial aspects of genetics. The greatest impact  occurred through the poetry, with many people reporting that they were emotionally moved by the messages conveyed .",2006

Particular attention was given to the Personal Adjustment composite  of the BASC SR and to its contributors . Participants and Method:   Eighteen MPS IH patients post BMT participated in this investigation, along with their biological mothers . The childrenâs ages ranged from 8 to 25 years . Semi structured interviews with the childrenâs mothers  were utilised, and the children and young people were administered tests of cognitive function and the BASC: Self Report of Personality  .  Results: Hierarchical multiple regression on the Personal Adjustment  composite of the BASC demonstrated that 95% of the variance could be explained (F = 18 .741 3,2, p =  .051) by child health and disability  factors, and factors associated with the mother and the family environment . In terms of the clinical and adaptive scales of the BASC,  no overt behavioural difficulties were observed. However, possible  trends emerged, which highlighted adjustment difficulties with school  and feelings of inadequacy for the 8 11 year age group; and a tendency towards inhibition and withdrawal for the 12 years and over age group .  Conclusion:  The findings illustrate how aspects of parenting and the  family, as well as aspects of the MPS disease, require attention when providing support to patients . They also highlight the importance of  appropriate, consistent classroom support, and question whether  psychosocial support should be considered within the school environment .",2006
social characterization of consultands requesting  presymptomatic testing and examples of social intervention,EP61.,"M. M. Oliveira , J.

These incapacitating diseases  have several implications at the social and psychological level: structural, cognitive and emotional changes . In presymptomatic testing, evaluation by the social worker has the aim  to assess an adjusted (resilient) or unadjusted answer of the persons  at risk, when informed about their status of being or not a mutant gene âcarrierâ for one of these diseases . Resilience is their ability to  answer appropriately to difficult situations (biological or social and  psychological conditions), using their internal (intra psychological) and external (social and affective environment) resources . This ability should allow a good adjustment and social insertion . Our genetic counselling protocol includes a social evaluation of the  following factors of risk: (1) factors connected with familial configuration  (separation of the couple, longstanding misunderstanding, violence,  alcoholism, chronic disease or death of a close relative, etc.); and (2)  factors of their social environment (poverty or economical fragility,  unemployment, unfavourable housing characteristics, relational isolation, etc .) . After this assessment, a social intervention will take place if the  individual at risk does not have abilities or competences to cope with  their reality, which is changed by disclosure of the results (either if carrier or not) .Living with a genetic disease 0",2006

Participants were given a choice of how they wished to communicate in the interviews, i .e . light writer, lip reading etc and the  approach to conducting research interviews for deafened people with poor morbidity will be discussed . Interviews were fully transcribed and participantâs accounts were  analysed for emerging themes using the constant comparison method (Glaser and Strauss, 1967) . Although the study was designed to look at the impact of hearing loss  in NF2, all the participants spoke of the combined interaction of hearing  loss with the other physical effects of the condition including tinnitus, problems with balance and chronic tiredness . In addition to the physical  difficulties, all had experienced emotional and social consequences  including feelings of isolation and problems communicating with friends, families and health professionals .

These include decisions  about whether/when to pass on to the child information about the  potentially inherited disorder in the family, and the possibility of genetic testing to clarify the genetic status of a child . Parents may acknowledge that they should discuss their familyâs  genetic condition with their child, and the issue becomes one of finding  the right time . Parents recount their own experiences of finding out  that they had inherited the condition to account for their decisions whether to pass on information to their children . They can draw upon  âbad experiencesâ EITHER to explain why they wish to do better (be  more open with their child) OR to justify/explain why they are unable to do this . Suggesting that a genetic test be performed on a young child can be  proposed as a way out of such difficulties EITHER because the child  may not have the faulty gene OR because it would ensure that the  parent can transmit the genetic test result to the child whether or not the child, when older, would choose to be tested . In this way the parent  hopes to pass on to their child their moral responsibility as well as their genes . We discuss the variety of accounts given by parents of their decisions  and what we can learn about how they envisage their child becoming an autonomous individual .",2006

Timmermans1,2","1VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2EMGO Institute,  Amsterdam, The Netherlands","A family history of diabetes type 2 (DM2) is one of the strongest risk  factors for DM2, reflecting the consequences of genetic predisposition, shared environment, and common behaviour  . Despite the prevalence  of DM2, little is known about the perceptions of (risk of) DM2 among high risk populations . Using semi structured interviews, causal beliefs  of DM2, perceived DM2 risk and feelings of controllability were explored  among high risk individuals aged 56 75 years with (n=9) and without (n=14) a family history of DM2 . Most participants perceived DM2 as multifactorial disease, and could often name several causes including âgenetic factorsâ . Although the  majority of people with positive family history was inclined to mention  âgenetic predispositionâ as a cause, this was not always brought up in explaining why family members were affected . The role of âgeneticsâ  was seen as more pronounced when more than one relative was affected (âit runs in the familyâ) . Overall, DM2 risk was perceived low in both groups . Only four individuals with positive family history perceived a (slightly) higher risk compared to other people of the same age . The  absence of DM2 in the family was often used as a reason to perceive a low DM2 risk . Ways to prevent DM2 were mostly unknown or were  not seen as very effective, especially when genetic predisposition was seen as major cause for DM2, suggesting a sense of fatalism . This  research indicates the need for more public health communications on  the role of a positive family history in causing DM2, and on possible preventive measures .",2006

Sutton1","1Department of Public Health & Primary Care, University of Cambridge, United  Kingdom, 2Department of General Practice, University of Western Australia,  Australia","Background: Taking a family history is increasingly becoming  part of the risk assessment and management of common chronic disease in primary care .  Patientsâ understanding of their family history  may influence perceptions of both their risk of the disease and its management . Objective: To identify which factors best predict familial risk perception  among primary care patients with a family history of one or more common chronic diseases . Design & Methods: A survey of UK patients identified in general  practice, having a family history of either cancer, heart disease or diabetes . The FRisk questionnaire was developed using both  established measures and items drawing on our recent qualitative work . Results: The 754 respondents (response rate 62 .0%), were mainly  female (61 .1%) white British (92 .3%), with mean age 48 .6 (SD 11 .9) .  Multiple regression analyses revealed that believing that the disease  âruns in the familyâ, is a serious condition, and has a genetic cause,  were the most significant predictors of familial risk perception. Younger  age, being of non white British ethnic origin, feeling âlikeâ the affected  relative, and with vulnerability at a similar age, were also significantly related to higher risk perceptions . Conclusions: Predictors of familial risk perceptions among a primary  care population may differ from the biomedical model of identifying  the number of relatives with the disease and age at which they were  affected. The findings will inform the development of a family history  screening instrument to facilitate both management of familial risk of chronic diseases, and behaviour change to reduce the disease risk .",2006

Tim   mermans1","1EMGO Institute, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Psychology & Genetics Re   search Group, Kingâs College, London, United Kingdom","Providing people with genetic risk information may induce preventive behaviour if a person beliefs that this can reduce the risk . However if  a person assigns excessive causation to genes, he or she may either  adopt a fatalistic attitude towards the risk and/or accept only medical approaches . Perceptions of controllability of genetic risk may be linked  with the way people see themselves; the self concept. People with  a static self concept (SSC) consider fixed traits as primary causes  of behaviour and process self relevant information in a way that is consistent with this deterministic perspective . People with a dynamic  self concept (DSC) understand themselves in terms of goals, needs  and states of mind and put more emphasis on situational influences. It  is likely, that when faced with a health threat, people with SSC are more  susceptible to feelings of fatalism and show less preventive behaviour, especially when the threat is associated with a genetic susceptibility  .  To test this, a static dynamic self concept questionnaire was validated .  The final (7 item) questionnaire displayed some predictive validity.  When asked to imagine themselves in different health scenarios  (representing a lifestyle risk for cardiovascular diseases (CVD), a  risk based on a positive family history of CVD, and a genetic risk for  CVD), people with SSC  compared, to people with DSC , perceived less  control and showed a stronger preference for cholesterol lowering  drugs over lifestyle changes, especially when the risk was presented  as genetic. The findings suggest that the questionnaire can be used to help explain differences in responses to genetic risk information .",2006
Professionalsâ opinions on population cholesterol  screening to detect inherited high cholesterol,EP69.,van den Nieuwenhoff,"Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands","To detect Inherited High Cholesterol in an asymptomatic stage, a Dutch  patient organisation offered cholesterol tests via mass media invitation to persons with a family history of cardiovascular diseases .

We conducted individual semi structured interviews with 13  professionals (in the fields of cardiology, genetics, ethics, psychology,  justice, policy and patient interests) to explore opinions about the  media campaign (including the cholesterol test offer) in population screening . Ethical concepts and WHO criteria for genetic screening were used for analysis . While almost all professionals classified the cholesterol tests  offered as population screening, many did not perceive it as genetic  screening, because no DNA was examined (ignoring the Dutch Health  Council definition). Four professionals were generally positive about  the campaign, as it âincreased peopleâs autonomy and beneficence (i .e ., enabled informed choice for preventive measures) and increased  justice (i.e., notified all persons irrespective of family communication)â.  Two professionals were generally negative, as the campaign âdecreased the autonomy (i .e ., by pressure to test and to enrol in follow  up), decreased the perceived importance of environmental risks, and increased medicalisation and blaming the victimâ . Seven professionals  perceived benefits of the campaign, but had as well doubts: insufficient  public information on follow up, insurance discrimination, and lack of adequate care for persons tested positive . To conclude, the professionals did not speak the same language and  did not agree about the acceptability of mass media approaches to detect familial predispositions . A debate among stakeholders may improve communication and forming of more united opinions .",2006

" The COVID 19 host genetics initiative an international, open science effort to identify genetic risk factors for COVID19 severity and susceptibility Andrea Ganna Finnish Institute for Molecular Medicine, Helsinki, Finland",PL1.2,A. Ganna: None.,PL2 What ’s New? Highlight Session," The genetic makeup of an individual contributes to susceptibility and response to infectious viruses. While environmental, clinical and social factors play a role in exposure to SARS CoV 2 andCOVID 19 disease severity, host genetics may also be important.Identifying host speci ﬁc genetic factors indicate biological mechanisms of therapeutic relevance and clarify causal relation ships of modi ﬁable environmental risk factors for SARS CoV 2 infection and outcomes. We formed a global network ofresearchers to investigate the role of human genetics in SARS COV 2 infection and COVID 19 severity. We describe the results of three genome wide association meta analyses comprising 49,562COVID 19 patients from 46 studies across 19 countries worldwide. We reported 15 genome wide signi ﬁcant loci that are associated with SARS CoV 2 infection or severe manifestations of COVID 19.Several of these loci correspond to previously documentedassociations to lung or autoimmune and in ﬂammatory diseases. They also represent potentially actionable mechanisms in response to infection. We further identi ﬁed smoking and body mass index as causal risk factors for severe COVID 19. The identi ﬁcation of novel host genetic factors associated with COVID 19, with unprecedentedspeed, was enabled by prioritization of shared resources and analytical frameworks. This working model of international colla boration a blue print for future genetic discoveries in the event of pandemics or for any complex human disease.",2021
" Clinical implementation of RNA sequencing for Men delian disease diagnostics Vicente Yepez 1, Mirjana Gusic2, Julien Gagneur1, Holger Prokisch2 1Technical University of Munich, Munich, Germany,2Helmholtz Zentrum, Munich, Germany",PL2.1,V. Yepez: None. M. Gusic: None. J. Gagneur: None. H.,Prokisch: None.," Introduction: Whole exome (WES) and whole genome sequen cing remain unsuccessful in providing a ﬁrm diagnosis for about half of the individuals with a suspected Mendelian disorder. RNA sequencing (RNA seq), which directly probes gene expressiondefects, has emerged as a promising complementary tool increasing the diagnosis rate. Materials and Methods: We performed RNA seq on ﬁbroblasts from 305 individuals affected with a mitochondrial disease whohad previously undergone WES, which represents one of the largest RNA seq compendium for rare disease diagnostics. To detect the genetic cause, we prioritize genes harbouring aberrantexpression (using OUTRIDER), aberrant splicing (using FRASER), ormono allelic expression of a rare allele, compiled with our recently developed computational work ﬂow DROP, which is further extended with an RNA seq based variant calling module.www.nature.com/ejhg 1234567890();,:Results: We provided a diagnosis for 16% (33 out of 205) of WES unsolved cases. By associating transcriptome aberrations with rare variants, we found a major role of nonsense mediated decay in underexpression outliers and of coding and intronicvariants in splicing outliers. We also assessed the importance ofRNA source material and showed that the majority of OMIM disease genes are expressed in clinically accessible tissues, with the highest number in ﬁbroblasts. Finally, we have gathered a reference dataset containing gene and junction level counts thatcan be integrated as controls for studies with small sample sizes. Conclusion: Our study demonstrates the routine implementa tion of RNA seq as a complementary tool to DNA sequencing forthe diagnosis of rare diseases, paving the path towards morecomprehensive OMICS based diagnostics.",2021
" Local gene co expression measurements in single cells highlight inter individual speci ﬁcity Diogo Ribeiro 1,2, Olivier Delaneau1,2 1University of Lausanne, Lausanne, Switzerland,2Swiss Institute of Bioinformatics (SIB), Lausanne, Switzerland",PL2.2,D. Ribeiro: None. O. Delaneau: None.,nan," Nearby genes are often expressed as a group. Recent studies highlight the existence of regulatory domains (e.g. groups ofenhancers) orchestrating the organised expression of nearby genes (Delaneau et al. 2019 Science 364(6439)). Yet, the prevalence and genetic control of local gene co expression arefar from being understood. By leveraging gene expressionmeasurements across 49 human tissues and hundreds of individuals, we found local gene co expression to be highly prevalent, occurring in 13% to 53% genes per tissue. Notably, weidenti ﬁed >30.000 expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs) which associate with co expressed gene pairs and often overlap enhancer regions. Due to affecting several genes, these eQTLsare more often associated with multiple human traits than eQTLsassociated with only one gene. Next, to understand how the observed local gene co expression and its regulation manifests at the single cell level, we analysed a dataset of single cell RNA seqacross 60 genotyped individuals in a homogeneous cell type(iPSC). By taking advantage of co expression measurements for >50 cells per individual, we identi ﬁed 100 550 locally co expressed gene pairs per individual. Interestingly, while many co expressedgene pairs are speci ﬁc to certain individuals, we discovered that those present across >50% of the individuals often participate in the same biological pathway (OR ,16.5, P value ,1e 9). Finally, in a bid to comprehend disease comorbidity and providefunctional interpretation of QTL and GWAS ﬁndings, we identify eQTLs affecting co expressed gene pairs in individuals suffering from various disease comorbidities in the UK Biobank.

Rare copy number variants (rCNVs) contribute to a broad spectrum of human diseases. Most disease association studies ofrCNVs have focused on haploinsuf ﬁciency caused by deletions, while our understanding of triplosensitivity caused by duplications remains rudimentary. We meta analyzed rCNVs from 753,994individuals across 30 primarily neurological disease phenotypes todiscover 114 rCNV disease associations at 52 distinct loci surpassing genome wide signi ﬁcance ( P,3.72x10 −6), 42% of which involve duplications. Further, we statistically ﬁne mapped 38 novel triplosensitive disease genes ( e.g.,GMEB2 ), including three known haploinsuf ﬁcient genes that we now reveal as bidirectionally dosage sensitive ( e.g.,ANKRD11 ). We found that disease associated rCNV segments were enriched for genesconstrained against damaging coding variation and identi ﬁed likely dominant driver genes for about one third (32%) of rCNV segments based on de novo mutations from exome sequencing studies of developmental disorders. However, most of the rCNVsshowing genome wide signi ﬁcant association were incompletely penetrant (mean odds ratio ,11.6) and we also identi ﬁed two examples of noncoding disease associated rCNVs ( e.g., intronic CADM2 deletions). Finally, we developed a statistical model to predict dosage sensitivity for all genes, which de ﬁned 3,006 haploinsuf ﬁcient and 295 triplosensitive genes where the effect sizes of rCNVs were comparable to deletions of genes constrainedagainst truncating mutations. These dosage sensitivity scores classi ﬁed disease genes across molecular mechanisms, prioritized pathogenic de novo rCNVs in children with autism, and revealed features that distinguished haploinsuf ﬁcient and triplosensitive genes. Collectively, the cross disorder rCNV maps and metrics derived here set the foundation for future studies of dosage sensitivity throughout the human genome.",2021

Introduction: IPO8 encodes importin 8, a ubiquitously expressed nuclear transport receptor belonging to the importin βprotein family that translocates cargo molecules such as proteins, RNAs and ribonucleoprotein complexes to the nucleus in a RanGTP dependent manner. Important cargoes of importin 8 are sug gested to be TGF βsignaling components such as SMAD1 4. Materials and methods: Exome or genome sequencing are used to identify variants in IPO8 . A C57Bl/6N Ipo8 knock out mouse model is phenotypically characterized and studied usingtransthoracic echocardiography, immunohistological investiga tion, compliance assays to study biomechanical properties of the ascending aorta and RT qPCR assays. Results: Four bi allelic loss of function variants in IPO8 were discovered in unrelated families causing a novel syndromic formof thoracic aortic aneurysm (TAA) with clinical overlap with Loeys Dietz and Shprintzen Goldberg syndrome. Patients are young children clinically characterized by early onset TAA, motordevelopmental delay, craniofacial dysmorphic features and con nective tissue ﬁndings. The Ipo8 knock out mouse model showed a TAA development from 8 12weeks onwards in both sexes, butmost prominently shows ascending aorta dilatation with apropensity for dissection in males. Immunohistological investiga tion and RT qPCR assays of the aortic wall revealed elastic ﬁber5 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87disorganization and fragmentation and nuclear pSmad2 accumu lation, respectively a decreased Smad6/7 and increased Mmp2 expression, reinforcing a role for dysregulation of the TGF β signaling pathway in TAA development. Conclusions: We report the ﬁrst importin β related human disease caused by bi allelic loss of function variants in IPO8 presenting a novel aortopathy syndrome.",2021
 Epilepsy polygenic risk scores in > 269k individuals with and without epilepsy Henrike O,PL2.6,nan,nan," Heyne1, FinnGen, Reetta Kälviäinen2, Mark J. Daly1 1Institute for Molecular Medicine Finnland: FIMM, Helsinki, Finland, 2Epilepsy Center, Kuopio University Hospital, Kuopio, Finland. Epilepsy affects approximately 1% of individuals worldwide. Making an epilepsy diagnosis is often dif ﬁcult with estimates that up to 25% of epilepsy could initially be misdiagnosed. The SNP heritability of genetic generalized epilepsy is high (32%) and it has recently been shown that individuals with epilepsy also haveelevated epilepsy polygenic risk scores (PRS). However, systematic investigation of PRS for distinct epilepsy diagnoses has so far been lacking. Here, we studied epilepsy PRS in detailed longitudinalelectronic health records of > 269k Finns including ICD codes anddrug purchases of over 50 years. Our dataset included 9660 individuals with epilepsy related diagnoses. We could con ﬁrm an elevated PRS for generalized epilepsy (PRS gen) in individuals with generalized epilepsy. This was particularly high for adolescentmyoclonic epilepsy, which could be because it represented the largest diagnosis group of the GWAS that was used to construct the PRS. We also made multiple surprising discoveries e.g. one ICDdiagnosis",2021

 Mendel Lecture Cell free DNA in Plasma: Coming in Different Sizes and Shapes Yuk M,PL4.1,"Y.M.D. Lo: B. Research Grant (principal investigator, collabora",tor or consultant and pending grants as well as grants already," D. LoThe Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong, China. My group ﬁrst reported the presence of cell free fetal DNA in maternal plasma in 1997. This phenomenon has contributed tothe development of non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT). Circulat ing DNA in plasma exists in the form of short DNA fragments. Circulating fetal DNA molecules are generally shorter than those derived from the mother. Recently, I have been particularlyinterested in the fragmentation process of such DNA molecules,now referred to as fragmentomics. Through the use of mouse models in which different nuclease genes have been inactivated, different steps of the fragmentation process has been worked out.Nucleases that participate in this process include DNASE1L3,DNASE1 and DNA fragmentation factor beta (DFFB). The end motif sequences of circulating DNA molecules carry cleavage signatures from these nucleases. My group has also demonstrated thatcirculating DNA molecules consist of a predominance of molecules carrying jagged ends. More recently, circular DNA species have been found in plasma. Interestingly, the sizes andtopology of circulating DNA species have been found to becorrelated to their tissues of origin. Apart from shedding light on the mechanism of cell free DNA generation, these observations may also contribute towards the development of novel biomar kers for prenatal and cancer liquid biopsies.",2021
" Leveraging public epigenomic datasets to examine the role of regulatory variation in complex traits Sushmita Roy University of Wisconsin Madison, Madison, WI, USA",S01.2,S. Roy: None.,S02 Spatial omics," Many variants identi ﬁed by genome wide association studies (GWAS) occur in non coding sequences. Understanding theimpact of such variants on complex phenotypes is a signi ﬁcant challenge. This is because such regulatory variants can affect the expression of gene hundreds of kilobases away, and the targetgenes themselves are part of a larger unknown biological pathway. High throughput Chromosome Conformation Capture (3C) technologies that measure the three dimensional proximityof genomic loci at high resolution (e.g. 5kb) can be used to linkgenes to regulatory variants over long distances, but they exist only for a handful of model cell lines due to high sequencing costs. We have developed a computational framework forpredicting such data, comprising (1) a Random Forest basedregression model to predict in silico contact counts of pairs of genomic loci, and (2) a multi task subnetwork identi ﬁcation approach to identify potential pathways targeted by a set ofvariants from a GWAS study. Our count prediction approach takes as input one dimensional signals such as histone modi ﬁcations, chromatin accessibility and accessible sequence motifs ofarchitectural proteins such as CTCF and predicts the contactcount for pairs of regions. We trained our approach on ﬁve high resolution Hi C datasets and applied the trained models to 55 human cell lines and tissues from the Roadmap Epigenomics6 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87project using both measured and imputed features. Our predic tions, when aggregated to a lower resolution (e.g. 40kb), accurately recapitulate the measured low resolution contact count, as well as identify larger units of 3D chromosomeorganization. Signi ﬁcant interactions from our predicted counts are associated with increased gene expression and enriched for interactions from ChIA PET experiments. We used our compen dium of signi ﬁcant interactions to predict target genes of regulatory SNPs associated with traits from the NHGRI GWAScatalog. We applied our multi task graph clustering approach to identify subsets of cell types associated with a phenotype of interest, e.g., autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and schizophrenia.We found that the subnetworks are enriched for processes thatare relevant to the phenotype of interest (e.g. SNPs associated with ASD and schizophrenia are enriched for cognition, associative and visual learning and regulation of nerve impulse in fetal brainand fetal spinal cord tissue). Taken together, our analysis pipeline offers a powerful resource to study three dimensional genome organization in a large number of cell lines and interpret the roleof regulatory variation in complex phenotypes.",2021
 Imaging the Accessible Genome at Nanometer Scale Zhe J,S02.1,Z.J. Liu: None.,nan," Liu Janelia Research Campus HHMI, Ashburn, VA, USA. To image active chromatin at nanometer scale in situ, we developed 3D ATAC PALM that integrates the assay for transposase accessible chromatin (ATAC), PALM super resolutionimaging and lattice light sheet microscopy. Multiplexed witholigopaint DNA FISH, RNA FISH and protein ﬂuorescence, 3D ATAC PALM connected microscopy and genomic data, revealing spatially segregated accessible chromatin domains (ACDs) thatenclose active chromatin and transcribed genes. Using thesemethods to analyze genetically perturbed cells, we identify the BET family scaffold protein BRD2 as a key factor responsible for compartmentalization of the accessible genome. Speci ﬁcally, BRD2 mixes and compacts active compartments in the absence of Cohesin. This activity is independent of transcription but requires BRD2 to recognize acetylated nucleosomes through itsdouble bromodomain. We also show that BRD2 safeguardscompartmental boundaries by preventing intermingling between active and inactive chromatin. Notably, genome organization mediated by BRD2 is antagonized on one hand by Cohesin and onthe other by the BET homolog protein BRD4, both of which inhibitBRD2 binding to chromatin. Polymer simulation of the data supports a BRD2 Cohesin ‘tug of war ’model of nuclear topology, where genome compartmentalization results from a competitionbetween loop extrusion and chromatin state speci ﬁca fﬁnity interactions.",2021

Research Grant (principal investigator,",collaborator or consultant and pending grants as well as grants," Advances in the ﬁeld of transcriptomics have deepened our understanding of tissue organization by integrating global gene expression in a spatial context. Among these approaches, in situ capturing technologies produce whole transcriptome spatial geneexpression by tagging spatial barcodes to transcripts after poly(A) capture. Current protocols for in situ capturing, using barcoded surfaces, are based on short read sequencing and fresh frozen samples. In this presentation we will provide insights to newdevelopments expanding the analysis into FFPE material as well asspatial full length information.

 Retrotransposition in brain: does LINE activity in the central nervous system matter? Jose L,S03.2,J.L. Garcia Perez: None.,nan," Garcia Perez HGU MRC, Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom. Transposable Elements (TEs) are stretches of DNA that can move within genomes. As pieces of mobile DNA, TE activity can changethe genome of any species. Indeed, germline TE activity over evolution has signi ﬁcantly shaped the structure and function of the genome of all living organisms, including humans. Currently,active TEs in our germline genome (termed LINEs for LongInterspersed Elements) continue to generate genomic variability among humans. As a result, LINE activity continues to impact the functioning and regulation of our genome. As a type of sel ﬁsh DNA, LINE activity is prominent in cellular niches that transmitgenetic information to the next generation (i.e., germ cells and during early human embryogenesis). However, due to its mutagenic potential, the activity of LINE elements is tightlyregulated, ensuring an equilibrium with the host. My laboratoryaims to understand how active LINEs are regulated at the molecular level, and to infer the impact of their activity in relevant cellular models and model of disease. Surprisingly, it was recentlydemonstrated that active LINEs also move in neuronal cells of our brain (and of model organisms). These discoveries were unex pected, and suggest that the same mechanisms used to evolvegermline genomes can act in our brain, but without leavingheritable traces. An emerging hypothesis suggests that TEs affect brain functionality, and my lab is using zebra ﬁsh to dissect how active TEs affect the vertebrate brain.",2021
" Activation of transposons in neurological disorders Johan Jakobsson Lund University, Lund, Sweden",S03.3,J. Jakobsson: None.,S04 Impact of GDPR on genomic data sharing," The underlying cause for most neurological disorders is poorly understood and current treatments are largely ineffective. New ideas and concepts are therefore vitally important for futureresearch in this area. In this talk I will discuss the concept that dysregulation of transposable elements (TEs) contributes to the appearance and pathology of neurodevelopmental and neurode generative disorders. Despite TEs making up at least half of thehuman genome, they are vastly understudied in relation to brain disorders. However, recent advances in sequencing and gene editing are now starting to unravel the pathological role of TEs.7 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Aberrant activation of TEs has been found in many neurological disorders and the resulting pathogenic effects, which includes alterations of gene expression, neuroin ﬂammation, and direct neurotoxicity, are currently being investigated. In summary, ourwork is based on the idea that an increased understanding of therelationship between TEs and pathological processes in the brain will result in novel diagnostic tool and therapeutic approaches for brain disorders.",2021
" How to transfer genomic data internationally in com pliance with the GDPR Heidi Beate Bentzen University of Oslo, Oslo, Norway",S04.1,H. Bentzen: None.,nan," Legal challenges currently impede personal data transfers to outside the European Economic Area (EEA), gravely affecting medical research globally.

" 1 +Million Genomes Initiative and the GDPR Regina Becker ELIXIR Luxembourg, University of Luxembourg, Esch sur Alzete, Luxembourg",S04.3,R. Becker: None.,S05 Endogenous and exogenous mutagenesis in cancer," The 1+Million Genome Initiative was initiated at the European Digital Day in 2018 by a core group of 13 EU Member States. Bynow, 24 European countries signed the joint declaration to make more than 1 million genomes with accompanying phenotypic data available cross border for research and healthcare purposes.The aim is namely to “provide cross border, data driven health and care solutions to bene ﬁt citizens of the Union ”. Scope of the activities to achieve this goal are research for a better under standing of diseases, secondary use of data for healthcareapplications and policy development with the aim to providebetter healthcare to a collective of patients. The ambitious goal is to go beyond a general availability of genomes for healthcare and research and create a virtualEuropean genome cohort across the participating countries. This implies a much stronger harmonisation of procedures and a joint governance to allow research, policy and healthcare users feasibleand straight forward access procedures. However, such harmoni sation will have to face the differences in legislation across Europe, most notably in the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). While being a Regulation, the GDPRforesees a number of opening clauses and scope for EU Member State legislation. This will affect the 1 +Million Genome initiative in particular as the processing of health and genetic data based on Art. 9(4) GDPR and the processing of personal data for scienti ﬁc research in general based on Art. 89(1) GDPR are subject toMember State legislation. In addition, different practices on a preferred or even legally prescribed legal basis for the processing inﬂuences the overall processing considerations. The applicability of national provisions needs to be investigated, which dependslargely but not entirely on the assignment of responsibilities as controller under the GDPR. Additional challenges are provided by divergent interpretations of the GDPR, which leads to furtherdifferences in national or local interpretations and implementa tions of the GDPR. The consequences such differences will be reviewed and potential approaches to ﬁnd solutions for a European implementation of the 1 +Million Genome initiative discussed.",2021
" Oncometabolites, DNA repair, and Cancer Peter Glazer Yale University, New Haven, CT, USA",S05.2,"P. Glazer: E. Ownership Interest (stock, stock options, patent or","other intellectual property); Modest; Cybrexa Therapeutics, Gen"," Abnormally elevated levels of the metabolites, 2 hydroxyglutarate (2HG), succinate, and fumarate, can occur in human malignan cies due to somatic mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase 1/2 (IDH1/2) genes or germline mutations in the fumaratehydratase (FH) and succinate dehydrogenase (SDH) genes, respectively. These structurally related metabolites inhibit alpha ketoglutarate dependent enzymes, including dioxy genases that modify chromatin. Mutations in IDH1 and IDH2 are found most frequently in gliomas and acute myelogenous leukemias, along with cholangiocarcinomas, chondrosarcomas, and melanomas. Inherited mutations in FH and SDH are linkedto the familial cancer predisposition syndromes, Hereditary Leiomyomatosis and Renal Cell Cancer (HLRCC) and Hereditary Paraganglioma and Pheochromocytoma (SDH PGL/PCC), respec tively. Our prior work has made an unexpected connectionbetween elevated levels of these metabolites and DNA repair by showing that they suppress the pathway of homology d e p e n d e n tr e p a i r( H D R )a n dc o n f e ra ne x q u i s i t es e n s i t i v i t yt opoly (ADP ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors that is beingtested in clinical trials. In this presentation, we will discuss our recent work elucidating the mech anistic basis for this suppres sion of DNA repair. Rather than acting indirectly throughepigenetic regulation of gene expression, we ﬁnd that these metabolites act directly by inhibiting HDR factor recruitment to DNA double strand breaks (DSBs). We have determined thatoncometabolite mediated inhibi tion of the lysine demethylase, KDM4B, results in aberrant hypermethylation of histone 3 lysine 9 (H3K9) at loci surrounding DNA double strand breaks, which effectively prevents a local H3K9 trimethylation signalthat is essential for the proper execution of HDR at the break.As a consequence, the recruitment of Tip60 and ATM, two proximal HDR factors, is signi ﬁcantly impaired at DNA breaks, w i t hr e d u c e de n d r e s e c t i o na n dd i m i n i s h e dr e c r u i t m e n to fdownstream repair factors.

The regulatory landscape around genes included both tissue shared and tissue speci ﬁc regulatory regions, where tissue speci ﬁc promoters and enhancers evolved most rapidly. Genomic regions switching between promoters and enhancers were more common across species, and less common across tissues within a single species. LINE L1s were associatedwith tissue speci ﬁc regulatory regions, whereas more ancient LINE L2s were associated with tissue shared regulatory regions and with those switching between promoter and enhancer signaturesacross species.

Lejeune: None. C. Robert Viard: None. A. Soilly: None. H.,Achit: None. F. Guillemin: None. V. Seror: None.," Context . Genomic sequencing has seen an increase in use in most developed countries, as illustrated by the implementation of national programs. For optimized routine use, data must becollected regarding stakeholders ’viewpoints and the risks and advantages for individuals (for patients, families and health professionals) but also on a collective level (health system, payers). To explore these trade offs, multidisciplinary studies are particu larly useful. This type of approach takes equally into account the medical, economic, organizational, sociological, and psychological dimensions of genomics. None of these ﬁelds are considered as exclusive or having priority over the others. Material and Methods: The DEFIDIAG project is one of the pilot studies of the French Plan for Genomic Medicine 2025. It illustrates the complementarity of various methodologies from the ﬁeld of humanities and social sciences (HSS). DEFIDIAG is a prospectivenational multicenter study in which patients children or adults with intellectual disability (ID) of unknown etiology are their own controls. The main goal of the study is to compare the diagnosticperformance ( viathe percentage of genetic causal diagnoses identi ﬁed in ID patients) of trio whole genome sequencing analysis (WGS T) compared to the French reference strategy (CGH array, X fra and genes panel). In addition to this clinical goal, acost effectiveness evaluation is planned as well as two impact studies: the ﬁrst will estimate the cost of the diagnosis odyssey among previously investigated patients that could be avoided,9 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87whereas the second one aims to assess the frequency and nature of changes in medical, medico social and psychological follow up in the ﬁrst year after WGS results are disclosed. A qualitative study based on face to face interviews among parents will also exploretheir expectations, their emotional adjustment to the test results,and their perception of the future. Conclusion: DEFIDIAG is a major opportunity for all branches of the scienti ﬁc community to contribute their skills. This study is expected to participate to the implementation of genomicsequencing in France, while providing all the information needed to optimize the decision making process, ﬁnancing and how to best support patients and their families.",2021
" Early cancer development from a single cell perspective: limitations, challenges and opportunities Renee Beekman CRG, Barcelona, Spain",S08.2,R. Beekman: None.,S09 Biobanks in under represented populations," Due to the evolving single cell technologies, the opportunities to study biological processes at the single cell level are expanding rapidly. Those opportunities comprise among others, the identi ﬁcation of rare cell populations, detection of rare events and mapping heterogeneity in cell populations. At the same time, these technologies have their limitations, due for example to poorsensitivity, lack of information of multiple layers at the single celllevel, as well as the limited opportunities for the analysis of clonal expansion in non engineered systems, such as human primary samples. I will address these advantages and disadvantages in thecontext of studying early cancer development. Tumor formation is the result of stepwise accumulation of genetic and epigenetic lesions. In our lab, we speci ﬁcally study the process of Non Hodgkin lymphoma formation, which is a tumorarising from normal B lymphocytes. I will explain how we aim to study this process at the single cell level using different layers of information: single cell transcriptomics, chromatin accessibilityand DNA methylation. I will address how increased sensitivity canbe achieved and/or how studying heterogeneity of signatures rather than analysis of single genes or genomic regions can circumvent this limiting factor and lead to meaningful results.Furthermore, I aim to address which technologies are currentlyavailable to integrate different layers of information, focusing on the layers mentioned above, together with somatic mutations and cell surface marker expression. Overall, in my talk I will present an overview of the opportunities we see and the challenges we face to study oncogenesis from the single cell perspective and the solutionsthat single cell technology and data analysis tool developmentprovide to better understand this complex process.",2021
" Ethics and inclusivity when working with Indigenous populations Emma Kowal Deakin University, Melbourne, Australia",S09.3,E. Kowal: None.,S10 Gene based therapy for inherited liver diseases," As precision medicine increasingly becomes part of routine health care, many countries are concerned about equity. It is wellrecognized that our existing health systems are less accessible, appropriate and effective for many disadvantaged populations. The transformation of our health systems by precision medicine provides an opportunity to address these disparities and enablethe health bene ﬁts of precision medicine to be fairly distributed between population groups. Currently, the lack of participation in genomic research among non European populations means that precision medicine is more likely to increase rather than narrowhealth disparities (Popejoy and Fullerton 2016), although variousinitiatives seek to change this (Bentley, Callier and Rotimi 2017). Indigenous/First Nations groups are the least represented in genomic research, and often suffer the most health disadvantage,particularly within settler colonial societies including the UnitedStates, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Scholarship, commen tary and guidelines produced by Indigenous scholars over the last decade or so make the following points: 1) Indigenous peopleexperience ongoing dispossession, oppression and discrimination; 2) Indigenous people seek the restoration sovereignty over their lands, and sovereignty over their cultural and intellectual property;3) Many Indigenous people have had negative experiences withscienti ﬁc and medical research and genetic research in particular where they have been harmed rather than bene ﬁted from their participation; 4) Efforts to include Indigenous people in genomicresearch need to be controlled by Indigenous people themselves.These principles have important implications for establishing a research project and research questions; ethical review; negotiat ing consent; ownership, control and access to data; bene ﬁt sharing arrangements; and acknowledging contributions in publications.

 AAV gene therapy for glycogen storage diseases Dwight D,S10.1,"D.D. Koeberl: B. Research Grant (principal investigator,",collaborator or consultant and pending grants as well as grants," Koeberl Duke University School of Medicine, Durham, NC, USA. Glycogen storage disease (GSD) is caused by the de ﬁ ciency of speci ﬁc enzymes involved in the storage and retrieval of glucose, including glucose 6 phosphatase (G6Pase) in GSD type Ia. G6Pase deﬁciency in GSD Ia affects primarily liver and kidney, and causes severe hypoglycemia and related biochemical abnormalities. Wedeveloped gene therapy with adeno associated virus (AAV)vectors to deliver G6Pase. AAV vectors were pseudotyped with novel AAV serotypes, such as AAV8, and demonstrated enhanced tropism for the liver. We demonstrated ef ﬁcacy through reduc tions in glycogen storage and correction of associated biomarkers in G6Pase knockout mice and GSD Ia dogs. The biochemical abnormalities in these models of GSD Ia provided robustendpoints for demonstrating ef ﬁcacy following AAV vector administration, including the correction of hypoglycemia and hyperlipidemia, lactic aciduria, G6Pase de ﬁciency, and glycogen accumulations in the liver and kidney. We demonstrated that anAAV vector encoding human G6Pase reversed these biochemicalabnormalities and prolonged long term survival in mice and dogs with GSD Ia. We have identi ﬁed abnormalities of autophagy that drive the pathobiology of GSD Ia, and showed that new smallmolecule therapies to reverse these abnormalities. Currently we are evaluating small molecule therapy and AAV vector mediated genome editing for GSD Ia. GSD type II (Pompe disease) results from the de ﬁciency of acid αlpha glucosidase (GAA) and causes primarily muscle disease. Enzyme replacement therapy (ERT) has become available for several lysosomal storage disorders over the past two decades;10 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87however, the limitations of ERT have become increasingly evident, especially in Pompe disease. Pompe disease is characterized by the massive accumulation of lysosomal glycogen in striated muscle with an accompanying disruption of cellular functions.While ERT has prolonged the survival of infantile onset Pompedisease patients, no curative therapy is available. Important limitations of ERT include the formation of anti GAA antibodies, and poor uptake of GAA in muscle. We demonstrated that AAVvector mediated gene therapy will likely overcome limitations ofERT, including formation of anti GAA antibodies and the need for frequent infusions. Currently we are evaluating liver depot gene therapy in a clinical trial enrolling adults with late onset Pompedisease.",2021

Messenger RNA, as a therapeutic agent, is becoming a promising paradigm to address several different diseases includ ing infectious diseases with the now approved vaccines for Covid19 as well as demonstrated in several animal models of diseases, in other therapeutic areas such as oncology, cardiovascular, rare genetic liver metabolic disorders. While in vaccines, the immunerecognition of exogenously injected mRNA seems to be anadvantage, in rare genetic and metabolic disorders, modi ﬁcation of the mRNA are needed to render it less responsive to the immune system. At Moderna, our efforts have been focused onspeci ﬁc modi ﬁcation of the mRNA to bypass the immune system and to favor translation of an active protein to replace the defective one. Moreover, lipid nanoparticles, used to protect and deliver mRNA in vivo, have been modi ﬁed for maximum ef ﬁciency in transducing the target organs. mRNA also offers the ﬂexibility of combination of different mRNA sequences simultaneously, which will translate in vivo, multiple proteins creating, in some instances,very stable complexes.

Her lab found that human oocyte spindles are surprisingly unstable, and identi ﬁed functions for actin and a liquid like meiotic spindle domain for spindleassembly in mammalian oocytes. In the main part of her talk, shewill present recent work from her lab that sheds light on the origin of high aneuploidy rates in mammalian embryos. The vast majority of human embryos are aneuploid. Aneuploidy frequentlyarises during the early mitotic divisions of the embryo, but theorigin of this remains elusive. Using bovine embryos as a model for human embryos, we identify an error prone mechanism of parental genome uni ﬁcation which often results in aneuploidy. Surprisingly, genome uni ﬁcation initiates hours before breakdown of the two pronuclei that encapsulate the parental genomes. While still within intact pronuclei, the parental genomes polarizetowards each other, in a process driven by centrosomes, dynein,and microtubules. The maternal and paternal chromosomes eventually cluster at the pronuclear interface, in direct proximity to each other. Parental genome clustering often fails however,11 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87leading to severe chromosome segregation errors, incompatible with healthy embryo development. Nucleoli, which associate with chromatin, also cluster at the pronuclear interface in human zygotes.

Despite their essential role in ensuring proper chromosome segregation during cell division, the millions of bases that de ﬁne endogenous human centromeres remain absent from mostreference assemblies and are detached from high resolution sequence based studies aiming to understand their function. Here we present a highly accurate genetic and epigeneticreference of all human centromeric regions, representing 188.2 Mb, or 6.1% of the CHM13 genome, and the ﬁrst comprehensive characterization of peri/centromeric satellite arrays, novel trans posable elements, and centromere associated genes. In doing so,we are able to reveal new patterns of satellite array organization, homogenization, and complex inversions. Centromeric sequences are expected to vary in repeat composition and copy numberbetween individuals in the population. To study the extent of thisvariation, we report an initial variation map of centromeric regions, including array speci ﬁc structural variants, repeat copy number estimates, and centromere spanning linkage maps. Thishigh resolution genetic reference provides an unparalleledopportunity to study sites of transcription, spatial organization, and sequences that are coincident with centromere formation, deﬁned as the interface with centromere speci ﬁc chromatin (CENP A, B, C).

" De novo assembly of human genomes Adam Ameur SciLifeLab, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden",S14.2,A. Ameur: None.,nan," Due to advances in long read sequencing, de novo assembly of high quality human genomes has gone from being a hugetechnical challenge to a routine exercise. From the resulting assemblies, we gain new insights about the genomic architecture in an individual human DNA sample without being restricted to areference sequence. On a population scale, we assembled the genomes of two human individuals representing the Swedish population and demonstrated that the resulting de novoassemblies can be used to improve the analysis of Swedish1000 genomes reference dataset. On an individual level, the latest long read technologies have enabled us to assemble near complete personal genome sequences at a relatively modestcost, something that opens up for new applications in clinical diagnostics and precision medicine. Most recently, we demon strated the ﬁrst de novo genome assemblies of single human cells. To achieve this, we constructed a new work ﬂow for whole genome ampli ﬁcation and coupled this with downstream long read sequencing. This method was applied to CD8 +T cells from a human donor, and resulted in an assembly size of up to 600Mb with 12.8% of human genes completely resolved. Further, we wereable to assemble complete mitochondrial genome sequences andeven to identify mitochondrial heteroplasmy between T cells originating from different clones. In conclusion, we demonstrate that long read genome assembly can be performed not only at aspecies, population, or individual level, but also for singlehuman cells.",2021

" Mechanisms of cell competition in pluripotent stem cells Miguel Torres , Jose A",S15.2,M. Torres: None. J.A. Valverde López: None. L. Li Bao: None.,S16 ESHG ASHG Building Bridges: Global genetics towards a," Valverde López, Lin Li Bao Centro Nacional de Investigaciones Cardiovasculares (CNIC), Madrid, Spain. Cell Competition promotes the active elimination of otherwise viable cells when confronted with cells with a ﬁtness advantage. Cell Competition is envisioned as a conserved and widespread cell quality control mechanism that eliminates less ﬁ t or misplaced cells during embryonic development and tissue homeostasis.During tumour progression, depending on the context, cellcompetition may protect the organism by eliminating cells with oncogenic mutations, or promote the expansion of the oncogenic cells by elimination of the surrounding normal cells. Mammalianpluripotent cells in the early embryo or in culture undergo natural Cell Competition according to Myc levels. In this model, Cell Competition surveils the maintenance of pluripotency at thepopulation level by elimination of Myc low differentiation primedcells (losers) through confrontation with Myc high naive pluripo tent cells (winners). Molecular analysis of this model of Cell Competition identi ﬁes a p53 regulated pathway essential for the12 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87ﬁtness comparison between winner and loser cells. We ﬁnd that the expression of BH3 family proteins NoxA and Puma, controlled by P53, regulate competitive ﬁtness in mouse ES cells. We propose a model that integrates the p53 pathway and Myc in the de ﬁnition of the loser cell ﬁtness “status ”and suggests that a reduction in mitochondrial OXPHOS function regulated by P53 mitochondrial Puma underlies competitive ﬁtness in pluripotent cells. In addition, to understand how Myc levels are regulated during cellcompetition, we identi ﬁed the genomic regions involved in regulation of Myc transcription in pluripotent cells. Currently, we are investigating whether the enhancer activity of the identi ﬁed regions is relevant in Cell Competition and during oncogenic Mycactivation in adult tissues.",2021

" Biases in GWAS and where to ﬁnd them: detecting and accounting for biases in GWAS studies beyond populationstructure Nicola Pirastu Usher Institute, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United King dom",S17.1,N. Pirastu: None.,nan," In the last 15 years, genome wide association studies (GWAS) have enabled scientists to better understand the role of genetics in determining complex traits while illuminating their underlying biology.The fact that individual genetic variants mostly have verysmall effects has resulted in the use of ever larger sample sizes,with the biggest studies including millions of participants.The massive increase in power has resulted in the increase of the number of discovered associated variants from tens to thousands,and biobanks with hundreds of thousands of participants such asUK biobank or MVP have become fundamental tools in any geneticist toolbox.For a long time, we have worried mostly about the biases arising from cryptic population structure and manymethods have been developed to account for it.However, with the increase in sensitivity, we have found that false associations due to other types of biases have started to appear. Generally, the effectsof biases in GWAS are relatively small, however, they are similar insize to the smallest real effects we are able to detect, making the interpretation of the results more complex. This has even more important consequences and implications for methods where theeffects sizes considered are even smaller than in GWAS, such as genetic correlations or Mendelian Randomization studies. In my talk, I will examine some of the possible sources and types of biases that have been described in literature beyondpopulation structure, such as collider bias, participation bias andreporting bias.

 Estimating direct and indirect genetic effects on birth weight Nicole M,S17.2,N.M. Warrington: None.,nan," Warrington University of Queensland, Brisbane, Australia. Estimation of the direct genetic effect of an individuals ’own genotype on their phenotype, independent of any contaminatingindirect parental genetic effects, is becoming increasinglyimportant. These conditional estimates are of interest in their own right, but are also useful for downstream analyses such as intergenerational Mendelian randomization or genetic correlationanalyses. Until recently, such downstream methodologies have been hampered by the paucity of epidemiological cohorts with large numbers of genotyped parent offspring pairs. We havedeveloped a suite of methods to estimate asymptotically unbiaseddirect and indirect genetic effects on offspring outcomes, using individual level data, summary results data and ‘virtual ’parents. These methods can account for sample overlap, even when theoverlap is unknown. Estimates obtained from these methods cansubsequently be used in large scale two sample Mendelian randomization studies, such as those investigating the causal effect of maternal environmental exposures on offspring out comes. An illustration of our methods will be presented, estimating the direct genetic effect on an individuals ’own birth weight and the indirect parental genetic effects on offspring birthweight. These estimated conditional genetic effects are subse quently used in genetic correlation and Mendelian randomization analyses to investigate the relationship between birth weight and later life cardiometabolic disease. We show that without takingboth the indirect and direct genetic effects into account in suchMendelian randomization analyses, the resulting causal estimate is biased in favour of a causal relationship.",2021
" The nature of nurture Patrick Turley University of Southern California, Los Angeles, CA, USA",S17.3,P.

For example, if heritable child rearing behaviors inﬂuence the children ’s behavior or health, SNPs associated with child rearing will also be associated with these outcomes inchildren. Furthermore, when parents sort on heritable phenotypes, this can in ﬂate genetic relationships and generate misleading results. We illustrate these sorts of confounds in severalapplications. First, we show that the predictive power of apolygenic score (PGS) for educational attainment (EA) is less predictive of a variety of health outcomes using a sibling design than in a population design with unrelated individuals. Second,we estimate the genetic correlation between family based andpopulation based GWAS estimates and ﬁnd that it is often13 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87signi ﬁcantly smaller than one, especially for behavioral pheno types. Third, we show that assortative mating in ﬂates the genetic correlation between EA and several health phenotypes.

Weksberg: None.,nan," Every cell in our body has the same DNA. Yet different cell types in the body are able to develop because epigenetic marks, placed on top of the DNA, direct each cell type to read only speci ﬁc sections of the DNA. There are several types of epigenetic marks includingDNA methylation (DNAm), and histone modi ﬁcations. These marks orchestrate normal developmental processes via the expression of several hundred epigenes (genes that function in epigeneticregulation). Rapid advances in genomic research have led to the identi ﬁcation of over 60 epigenes which are associated with Mendelian disorders, many of which are characterized byovergrowth and dysregulation of neurodevelopment. We andothers have identi ﬁed highly speci ﬁc and highly sensitive genome wide DNAm signatures for several of these epigenes including DNMT3A, NSD1, EZH2/EED, and CHD8; mutations inthese genes are associated with Tatton Brown Rahman, Sotos,Weaver, and Autism syndromes, respectively. These DNAm signatures can be used as a “second tier ”analysis to improve molecular diagnostics by classifying sequence variants of uncer tain signi ﬁcance (VUS) as either benign or pathogenic with efﬁcacy far superior to most in silico programs. They can also be used for ﬁrst tier diagnostics when sequencing is uninformative. However, given the fact that DNAm signatures are still indevelopment, DNAm based disorder classi ﬁcation in this situation must be con ﬁrmed by sequencing to authenticate a molecular diagnosis. In addition to the utility of DNAm signatures formolecular diagnostics, we have also shown that gene speci ﬁc DNAm signatures re ﬂect the functional pathophysiology of the associated genetic disorders providing opportunities to identify potential novel therapeutic targets.",2021

Other Research Support (supplies, equip","ment, receipt of drugs or other in kind support); Modest; Arqule"," Biesecker NIH, NHGRI, Bethesda, MD, USA. Regional overgrowth associated with somatic mosaic variants raises a host of challenges for the managing clinician, including clinical diagnosis, molecular testing, clinic molecular diagnosis,symptomatic management, and targeted therapy. Clinical diag nosis, the mainstay of the practicing clinician has not fundamen tally changed. The objective is to match the pattern presented bythe patient to a recognized entity through the differentialdiagnosis process. The dif ﬁculty is that mosaicism leads to an enormous range of expressivity that taxes the process. This can be mitigated with molecular testing, yet this process as well ischallenging, due to ambiguities in patient sampling, potentially low rates of variant allele fraction (VAF), and test sensitivity and breadth. Integrating clinical and molecular ﬁndings into a ﬁnal clinico molecular diagnosis is challenging but can be made moretractable and rational by adopting a dyadic approach to diagnosis–recognizing that the molecular ﬁndings and clinical presentation are of equal weight and must be melded into a unitary diagnosis. Finally, management is challenging again due to the enormousinter patient variability due to distinct affected genes, sometimesvariable damaging or activating variants, and dissimilar distribu tions of VAF across tissues with wildly varying pathologic effects. The risks and bene ﬁts of treatment must be weighed against all these factors with shockingly little clinical trials data upon whichto base such decisions. Yet, the clinician and patient must decide and act and these decisions require not only technical acumen, but wisdom. These larger issues surrounding mosaic overgrowthdisorders will be reviewed with selected examples and illustrations to guide the practitioner challenged by these remarkable and often devastating disorders.",2021

Mutations (mostly deletions of one or more exons) that disrupt the reading frame of thedystrophin encoding DMD gene lead to non functional dystrophin proteins and a severely progressive diseases, Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD). By contrast mutationsthat maintain the reading frame allow the production ofinternally deleted but partly functional dystrophins and are associated with the milder Becker muscular dystrophy. The aim of the exon skipping therapy is to enable DMD patients toproduce Becker like dystrophins. This is achieved by modula tion of pre mRNA splicing, where an antisense oligonucleotide (AON) hides an exon from the splicing machinery so it isskipped. This will enlarge the deletion, but restore thereading frame thus allowing dystrophin production. AON mediated exon skipping and dystrophin restoration has been shown in DMD patient derived cell cultures over 20 years agoand is currently an approved therapy for DMD in the USA and Japan.

Research Grant (principal investigator,",collaborator or consultant and pending grants as well as grantsalready received); Signi ﬁcant; Alnylam Inc. D. Speakers Bureau/," Gillmore University College London, London, United Kingdom. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to determine the effect of patisiran on the cardiac amyloid load as measured by cardiacmagnetic resonance and extracellular volume (ECV) mapping incases of transthyretin cardiomyopathy (ATTR CM). Background: Administration of patisiran, a TTR speci ﬁc small interfering RNA (siRNA), has been shown to bene ﬁt neuropathy in patients with hereditary ATTR amyloidosis, but its effect on ATTR CM remains uncertain. Methods: Patisiran was administered to 16 patients with hereditary ATTR CM who underwent assessment protocols at theUK National Amyloidosis Centre. Twelve of those patients concomitantly received di ﬂunisal as a ""TTR stabilizing"" drug. Patients underwent serial monitoring using cardiac magneticresonance, echocardiography, cardiac biomarkers, bone scintigra phy, and 6 min walk tests (6MWTs). Findings of amyloid types and extracellular volumes were compared with those of 16 patients who were retrospectively matched based on cardiac magnetic resonance results. Results: Patisiran was well tolerated. Median serum TTR knockdown among treated patients was 86% (interquartile range[IQR]: 82% to 90%). A total of 82% of cases showed >80%knockdown. Patisiran therapy was typically associated with a reduction in ECV (adjusted mean difference between groups: 6.2% [95% con ﬁdence interval [CI]: 9.5% to 3.0%]; p ,0.001) accompanied by a fall in N terminal pro B type natriuretic peptideconcentrations (adjusted mean difference between groups: 1,342 ng/l [95% CI: 2,364 to 322]; p ,0.012); an increase in 6MWT distances (adjusted mean differences between groups: 169 m[95% CI: 57 to 2,80]; p ,0.004) after 12 months of therapy; and a median reduction in cardiac uptake by bone scintigraphy of 19.6% (IQR: 9.8% to 27.1%). Conclusions: Reductions in ECV by cardiac magnetic resonance provided evidence for ATTR cardiac amyloid regression in a proportion of patients receiving patisiran.",2021
 Primary cilia in health and disease Lotte B,S22.1,L.B. Pedersen: None.,EDUCATIONAL SESSIONS," Bang Pedersen University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark. Primary cilia are dynamic microtubule based organelles that project from the surface of most vertebrate cell types. Longthought to be evolutionary remnants of limited physiologicalrelevance, it is now clear that primary cilia function as essential cellular signalling hubs during development and in tissue home ostasis. Well studied examples of signalling pathways operatingvia primary cilia include the Sonic hedgehog (Shh) pathway and signalling mediated by polycystin 1 and 2 (PC1 and PC2), which regulate development and function of the brain, kidney and otherorgans and tissues. In addition, specialised primary cilia present onour photoreceptors, inner ear hair cells, and the olfactory epithelium are required for vision, hearing and smell, respectively. Not surprisingly, mutations affecting the assembly or function ofcilia are associated with a growing number of diseases andsyndromes, known as ciliopathies, which can affect most organs and tissues in the body. The assembly of primary cilia occurs in tight coordination with the cell cycle. Speci ﬁcally, ciliogenesis is initiated in G1/G0 as the centrosome migrates towards the plasma membrane where the mother centriole docks and templates extension of the ciliary microtubule axoneme. The ciliary axonemeis surrounded by a membrane that is continuous with the plasmamembrane, but contains distinct lipids and receptors involved in signalling. Establishment and maintenance of the cilium as a specialised signalling compartment depends on the intra ﬂagellar transport (IFT) machinery as well as the transition zone (TZ), whichseparates the basal body from the cilium itself and controls ciliary protein entry and exit. Notably, many ciliopathies are caused by mutations in genes coding for TZ components, but disease causing mutations have also been identi ﬁed in other genes such as those coding for components of the IFT machinery or speci ﬁc centrosomal proteins. For example, several studies have shown that inactivating variants of the gene coding for centrosomalprotein CEP78 are associated with cone rod dystrophy with hearing loss (CRDHL), a particular phenotype distinct from Usher syndrome. However, the molecular mechanism underlying thisphenotype is unclear. I will ﬁrst provide an overview of primary cilia and associated signalling processes, with focus on the molecular mechanisms that regulate ciliogenesis. Next, I will present new results from my labthat dissects the mechanism by which CEP78 regulates ciliaassembly and length, in turn providing molecular insight into how inactivating mutations in CEP78 lead to CRDHL. Our work also uncovers a new interaction between CEP78 and CEP350, therebyidentifying the latter as a putative novel candidate for CRDHL.",2021
 Detection of structural variation and haplotype aware genome assembly through Strand Seq Ashley D,E01.2,A.D. Sanders: None.,nan," SandersMDC BIMSB/BIH/Charité, Berlin, Germany. Our genomes are constantly mutating. During normal develop ment and ageing, genetic mutations can arise in our somatic cells,which are then propagated and clonally selected over time. Howsomatic mutations impact the function of our tissues and emerge in the context of disease are important questions in human health. Structural variants (SV) are a major source of somatic mutation they are the most common cancer driver mutation type, they canarise in bursts mediating large scale genomic rearrangements, and they can disrupt key molecular and cancer related pathways. How somatic SV contribute to cellular heterogeneity and other complexdiseases is still unclear, largely because detecting somatic SVs ischallenging. Indeed, subclonal copy neutral and complex rearran gements remain largely intractable to genetic variation studies. We overcome this by developing novel methods that harness thepower of single cell and single strand sequencing (i.e. Strand seq) to measure somatic mutational landscapes in human cells. By integrating complementary data layers, including read depth,template strand and haplotype phase, we can now reliablydiscover SV in a cell by cell basis and explore their functional impact in mutated cells. This advance has lead us to uncover somatic SV types that previously escaped detection and directlymeasure complex rearrangement processes, such as breakage fusion bridge cycles and subclonal chromothripsis events. Our ability to now map SV landscapes with single cell resolution positions us to study dynamic clonal expansions, geneticmosaicism and structural rearrangement processes with a new lens, all of which can provide a clearer picture of the processes behind development, ageing, and disease.",2021

However, how the remaining parts of the genome are exactly radially organized inthe nucleus remains largely unknown. Here, I will describe a method named Genomic loci Positioning by Sequencing (GPSeq), which allows genome wide measurements of the distance to the nuclearlamina. Using GPSeq, we generated reproducible maps of the radialorganization of the genome in human cells, at various resolutions, that revealed radial gradients of genomic and epigenomic features, gene expression, as well as A/B compartments and chromatin loops.We assessed the contribution of various features in predictingradiality, and found GC content to have the strongest predictive power at all resolutions. Finally, we show that, by combining GPSeq radial information with Hi C intra and trans chromosomal contacts,we are able to build whole genome structure predictions muchmore accurately than possible thus far. We conclude that GPSeq is able to reveal fundamental aspects of genome architecture.",2021

Background: Identifying individuals with inherited genetic cancer susceptibility prevents cancer and saves lives through effectivetargeting of resource for enhanced screening and/or preventionto those at highest a priori risk. Recent advances in sequencing technology have catalysed dramatic expansion in genetic cancer susceptibility testing, with imminent roll out of population levelscreening for cancer susceptibility. Vast amounts of data are being generated from individuals with different prior risks of inherited cancer susceptibility. It has become increasingly challenging howbest we make value of the clinical data generated interpret andcommunicate the signi ﬁcance of variants (mutations) and associated genetic risk, and ensure the interventions offered are commensurate to risk, consistent and evidence based.

" Boosting hereditary cancer research with the European Reference Network GENTURIS Nicoline Hoogerbrugge Radboud university medical center, Nijmegen, Netherlands",E03.2,N. Hoogerbrugge: None.,E04 Dealing with uncertainty in genomic medicine," Approximately 27 36 million patients in Europe have one of the ~ 5.000 8.000 known rare diseases.

Currently twenty four European Reference Networks (ERNs) are active with the aim to improve care and research for thesepatients. Our aim is that through the ERNs, European patients witha rare disease get access to expert care more often and more quickly, and that research will be accelerated resulting in improved diagnostics and therapies. The ERN on Genetic Tumour Risk Syndromes (ERN GENTURIS) aims to improve research on identi ﬁcation, genetic diagnostics, prevention of cancer, and treatment of European patients with agenetic predisposition for cancer.

 Managing uncertainty in clinical genomics: toward a systematic approach Paul K,E04.1,P.K.J. Han: None.,nan," J. Han National Cancer Institute, Bethesda, MD, USA. Uncertainty is a pervasive and important problem in clinical genomics and all of medicine, and managing uncertainty is one of the most challenging tasks for both the providers and recipients of health care. The objective of this presentation is to outline asystematic approach to this task that may help clinicians andpatients manage uncertainty more effectively. This approach begins with understanding the nature, causes, and psychological effects of the uncertainties that arise in clinical genomics, and thevarious strategies people use to manage these uncertainties. It ultimately requires promoting uncertainty tolerance —which I deﬁne as the capacity to achieve an optimal balance of responses to uncertainty. I discuss key aspects of this capacity and explorepotential ways of promoting uncertainty tolerance amongclinicians and patients.",2021
 Coping with uncertainty of genomic testing in a non genetic setting Anthony S,E04.3,A.S. Wierzbicki: None.,E05 Update on imprinting disorders," Wierzbicki Guy ’s & St Thomas Hospitals, London, United Kingdom. The identi ﬁcation of genetic disorders forms part of the work of lipid and cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk clinics. However, it forms only part of their workload which also comprises diagnosis and management of patients deemed at high CVD risk, those withnon alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) or intolerance to lipid lowering drugs (commonly statins). In the UK the National Health Service (NHS) plan has prioritised the detection and management of monogenic familial hypercholesterolaemia (FH) with the aimbeing to diagnose 25% of cases by 2025. Classically FH presents with high cholesterol and an autosomal dominant family history of either hypercholesterolaemia or premature CVD. Genetic testingfor FH includes screening for a panel of common genes and in thefuture polygenic risk scores. A number of strategies have been devised to try to identify potential index cases. Clinical scoring methods such as the Simon Broome criteria, Dutch Lipid score orthe new FAMCAT calculator are useful but often confounded byother common conditions such as NAFLD, post menopause lipid changes, familial combined hyperlipidaemia and extreme diets. Pedigree data is often dif ﬁcult to acquire or vague which limits the utility of electronic health record searches. One way to clarify which patients to select for genetic testing is the use of imaging as FH is distinguished by an excess atheroma burden for age andgender. Alternatively, screening can be conducted in childrenwhere the clearest differentiation between monogenic and polygenic hyperlipidaemia occurs. Imaging is also useful to differentiate whether to treat patients with variants of unknownsigni ﬁcance or those with elevated polygenic risk scores or other accelerants of atherosclerosis such as elevated lipoprotein (a). These approaches demonstrate that accurate phenotyping of patients is necessary to deal with the uncertainty associated withgenetic testing in non specialist settings.",2021
" Genetic basis of imprinting disordes Thomas Eggermann RWTH Aachen, Aachen, Germany",E05.1,T. Eggermann: None.,nan," Imprinting disorders comprise thirteen congenital disorders which are molecularly characterised by similar molecular alterations affecting the ﬁne tuned expression of genomically imprinted genes. Clinically, they share features from the same spectrum (growth, metabolism, pubertal timing, cognitive impairment, tumour predisposition). Their clinical overlap is mirrored bysimilar, in some disorders opposite molecular ﬁndings, affecting even the same imprinted loci. Four types of molecular alterations can affect the expression of imprinted genes, i.e. uniparental disomy, copy number variants and monogenic point mutations on18 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87DNA level, and aberrant methylation (epimutations) at differentially methylated regions. Due to this heterogeneity, genetic testing of imprinting disorders is challenging, and the decision on the molecular testing strategy might be hindered. With the recentimplementation of comprehensive molecular assays, the knowledgeon the contribution of genetic and epigenetic alterations to the etiology of inherited growth disorders has massively expanded, making the interpretation of diagnostic data increasingly complex.These complex results lead to the discovery of unexpected and newmolecular subgroups, as well as of genetic predispositions for epimutations. In the presentation, the different types of molecular alterations in patients with imprinting disorders and differentialdiagnosis will be reviewed, and genetic testing strategies will beillustrated. It will be emphasized that the early diagnosis of a genetically based endocrine disorder contributes to a precise management and helps the patients and their families in theirself determined planning of life. Furthermore, the identi ﬁcation of a causative (epi)genetic alteration allows an accurate prognosis of recurrence risks for family planning as the basis of geneticcounselling. Asymptomatic carriers of pathogenic variants can beidenti ﬁed, and prenatal testing might be offered, where appropriate.",2021
" Diagnosis and treatment of imprinting disorders Karen Temple University of Southampton, Southampton, United Kingdom",E05.2,K. Temple: None.,E06 Pharmacogenomics in the clinic," Imprinting is a natural, genomic regulatory process in humans that controls growth and development in utero. Epigenetic marks arelaid down in the parental germline and maintained on the offspring ’s genome, affecting 35 clusters of imprinted genes throughout the genome. Consequently, these imprinted genesfunction differently on the maternal and paternal allele. ‘Imprint ing Disorders ’, which arise from dysregulation of imprinted genes, are a group of serious congenital conditions that affectmetabolism, growth, development and behaviour, and predisposeto cancer, signi ﬁcant short stature, obesity and the adult metabolic syndrome. 10 widely recognised imprinting disorders cluster around 5/6 key imprinted regions, but there is considerablevariability in the clinical history, depending on the imprinted gene(s), mutations and parental alleles involved. •Prader Willi syndrome (PWS), Angelman syndrome (AS) chromosome 15 •Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS), Silver Russell syndrome (SRS) chromosome 11 (also chromosome 7) •Temple syndrome (TS), Kagami Ogata syndrome (KOS) chromosome 14 •Transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM1), Maternal UPD 6 chromo some 6 •Pseudohypoparathyroidism type 1b (PHP1b), Mulchani Bhoj Conlin syndrome (MCBS) chromosome 20 Early treatment and active health surveillance improves prog nosis in these conditions that affect the lifecourse and yet there area number of factors that contribute to late or missed diagnosis: i) many of the non speci ﬁc clinical features of imprinting disorders change with age making diagnosis dif ﬁcult ii) hetero geneity and clinical overlap between conditions requires a broaddiagnostic approach across many imprinted loci iii) standarddiagnostic pathways that focus on genomic sequencing do not identify a signi ﬁcant proportion of molecular mechanisms under lying imprinting disorder siv) multi locus imprinting disturbance(MLID) may affect the phenotype which can range from early miscarriage to less classical non speci ﬁc developmental delay and yet is not tested for routinely in most labs v) diagnostic genomicsequencing focuses on the patient and not the mother.

Rehm: None.19,European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87E08.2 Towards better interpretation of variants in non coding," Rehm Massachusetts General Hospital and Broad Institute, Boston, MA, USA. Over 800 million human genomic variants have been identi ﬁed to date and we are far from discovering the full spectrum of human variation. Of those variants clinically interpreted and submitted to ClinVar, 75% have only been submitted by only one sourceunderscoring the rarity of most human variation of potentialclinical signi ﬁcance. As such, it is imperative that we work as a global community to aid the interpretation of genes and variants and their role in human health and disease. Before one canaccurately interpret the pathogenicity of a variant, one must ﬁrst curate the aggregate evidence to de ﬁne a gene ’s role in disease. Multiple organizations, both public and private, have curated gene disease relationships and these resources have recentlybeen brought together for free and public access (search.thegencc.org) by the Gene Curation Coalition (GeneCC). Centra lization of these curations allows comparison of claims and ultimately a more accurate resource to de ﬁne valid relationships between genes and disease. Once the validity of a gene disease relationship has been demonstrated, one can move on to curate individual variants in these genes to support or refute pathogeni city. Accurate variant classi ﬁcation is best facilitated through a multi pronged strategy including 1) disseminating and applying consistent standards for variant classi ﬁcation, 2) submitting variant classi ﬁcations and supporting evidence through a centralized database for sharing and comparing (e.g. ClinVar), 3) working toresolve discrepancies in variant classi ﬁcation between submitters, and 4) elevating the most challenging variants to international panels of experts with disease and gene speci ﬁc expertise.

" Status of PGT and embryo selection in the era of NGS Antonio Capalbo Igenomix, Rome, Italy",E09.1,A. Capalbo: A. Employment (full or part time); Modest;,Igenomix.," Aneuploidy is extremely common in human embryos and is one of the main causes of unsuccessful in vitro fertilization (IVF) cycles. In particular, advanced maternal age patients experience high ratesof implantation failure and miscarriages. Aneuploidy in embryosmostly originates from oocyte meiotic segregation errors. Preimplantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT A) is a screening strategy employed in IVF cycles that is aimed atimproving implantation and ongoing pregnancy rates per transferthrough the identi ﬁcation and de selection of aneuploid embryos. PGT A implementation has rapidly grown in recent years and it is currently performed in over 20% of US IVF cycles. Two maintechnical developments contributed to this expansion: a) theimplementation and standardization of an effective and generally safe trophectoderm (TE) biopsy approach at the blastocyst stage, b) the development of comprehensive testing platforms for theanalysis of all 24 chromosomes in single cell samples ( ≃the typical TE biopsy consisting of 2 10 cells). In particular, the establishment of high throughput, automated NGS protocols forPGT A resulted in an unprecedented reduction of costs, allowingan increasing number of couples undergoing IVF to bene ﬁt from embryo aneuploidy testing. Although not universally applicable, comprehensive 24 chromosomes screening and single genedisorder detection can be combined in a single NGS run.Furthermore, NGS analytical capabilities were also extended to the detection of ploidy level alterations (i.e., haploid or polyploid conﬁgurations), which occur in about 1% of human blastocysts and are missed by standard NGS analysis. Remarkably, NGS has been suggested as improved technology for the diagnosis of chromosomal mosaicism in TE biopsies. When applied oncontrolled mixtures of ﬁbroblast cell lines mimicking different rates of mosaicism, NGS showed increased analytical sensitivity toward intermediate chromosomal copy number values (CNV). However, the translation of algorithms developed on these stableand reproducible experimental models has not been as effective and straightforward for deriving clear diagnostic criteria when applied to embryo biopsy specimens. The use of subjective thresholds for mosaicism diagnosis has generated a criticalinconsistency in detection rates reported across laboratories, withvalues ranging from 2 to 40%. Furthermore, the positive predictive value of a mosaicism diagnosis in PGT A is extremely low. Among all putative mosaic embryos transferred worldwide to date(>2000), the same mosaicism ﬁnding identi ﬁed at the preimplan tation stage was con ﬁrmed through prenatal diagnosis (PND) only in one case. On the contrary, the high rate at which mosaicism is currently reported has shown undeniable issues in the clinicalmanagement of PGT A cycles. These include extra costs associatedwith genetic counseling, anxiety, and confusion in patients and doctors due to diagnostic uncertainty, new and probably unnecessary indications for invasive PND, and more dramatically,a signi ﬁcant abandonment of viable embryos. Considering that all data currently available on the reproductive competence of putative mosaic embryos are retrospective and present biases atseveral levels (i.e., population selection), there is an urgent needfor prospective non selection studies. These trials will provide evidence based estimates of the clinical utility of reporting intermediate chromosome CNV in NGS based PGT A.",2021

Escott Price: None.20,European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87E12 Bayesian methods applied in clinical settings," Polygenic risk score (PRS) is used as a global term for a risk score including any number of genetic variants (SNPs). A major problem with disorders of aging when using PRS to categorise people at risk is the age of the study participants. In other polygenicdiseases like schizophrenia, penetrance of the phenotype is mostlycomplete at 40 years of age, while for e.g. Alzheimer ’s disease (AD), even at 80 there are still individuals at risk but who have not yet developed AD. In addition, about 35% of life time risk ofdementia is modi ﬁable by factors such as education, vascular aspects, nutrition, health care and social deprivation, etc., which has potentially led to the decrease in incidence of dementia overthe last decades. The most common type of dementia, Alzheimer ’s disease, mainly affects the elderly population. As a consequence, comparative control samples are likely to be enriched with future AD cases who are yet to show symptoms. AD, like many otherdisorders of ageing, is a progressive condition which means thatclinical features develop gradually over many years before diagnosis. The ability to predict disease risk before disease onset is of great importance for stratifying people for clinical trials or theselection of candidates for functional experimental studies. For AD, with the exception of APOE ε4, the common genome wide signi ﬁcant variants which have been discovered though GWAS have only small individual effects. Although it is clear that manygenes are involved in disease development and progression, there is no agreement in the ﬁeld as to whether AD is a polygenic or oligogenic disorder. We investigate various methodologies andSNP selection approaches for risk prediction. We highlight anddiscuss the best strategies for polygenic pro ﬁling when assessing individuals for AD risk.",2021

" Deciphering liver regeneration cell by cell Dominic Grün Julius Maximilians University, Würzburg, Germany",E13.1,D. Grün: None.,nan," The human liver is an essential multifunctional organ, and liver diseases are rising with limited treatment options. To bettercharacterize the cell type architecture of the human liver, we applied single cell RNA seq to normal human liver specimens and established a liver cell type atlas covering all known human livercell populations.

We discovered heterogeneity of the EPCAM +population, which comprises hepatocyte biased and cholangiocyte populations aswell as a TROP2intprogenitor population with strong potential to form bipotent liver organoids. As proof of principle, we utilized our atlas to unravel phenotypic changes in hepatocellularcarcinoma cells and in human hepatocytes and liver endothelial cells engrafted into a mouse liver. To better understand the plasticity and differentiation pathways of liver cell populationsduring regeneration, and to elucidate the role of inter cellularcrosstalk in this process, we complement our human liver studies with the analysis of mouse liver damage models.

Despite this evidence, screening for epivariations is rarely performed, andvery few studies have attempted to pro ﬁle the contribution of epivariations to the burden of genetic disease. Our lab has recently undertaken the ﬁrst large scale studies of epivariations in humans, and has investigated the methylomes of >25,000individuals to date. Importantly, these studies show that (i) epivariations occur relatively frequently in the human genome, (ii) represent a subset of pathogenic alleles at known disease associated genes, and (iii) would be missed by purely sequence based approaches. I will give an overview of the current state of knowledge of the involvement of epivariations in human disease, including their potential underlying molecular causes, and insightsthat epivariations can provide into the regulatory architecture ofthe genome.",2021

However, we can show that these areinsuf ﬁcient in at least two domains. The ﬁrst is in meta analysis, where population structure information contained in the full dataset is lost in individual meta analysis cohorts. The second is in complex trait analysis, where the out of Africa bottleneck hassystematically changed the frequency of variants in studypopulations, which is key a component of estimating selection on traits. We describe tools which make very simple changes to GWAS providing additional meta data which improve theirperformance. We further describe models for complex traits that show that correcting for genetic drift may change our under standing of the history of complex traits.",2021
" Using Mendelian randomization to assess molecular mediators in causal pathways Rebecca Richmond University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom",E16.1,R. Richmond: None.,E17 Chromosomal instability across lifetime," Understanding mediation is useful for identifying intermediates lying between an exposure and an outcome which, when intervened upon, will block (some or all of) the causal pathway21 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87between the exposure and outcome. Mediation approaches have been adapted to understanding the role of molecular intermedi ates in situations of high dimensional omics data with varying degrees of success. One approach which is increasingly beingadapted to evaluate molecular mediation is Mendelian randomi zation (MR). MR uses genetic variants associated with a trait of interest to estimate the causal effect of that trait on a particular outcome. Within the context of mediation, MR can be used todecompose the effect of an exposure on an outcome which actsdirectly, and that which acts via mediating variables. This presentation will cover existing methods for applying MR to assess molecular mediation, including the use of multivariable andtwo step MR, and approaches for estimating the mediated effects,including the “difference ”and “product of coef ﬁcients ”methods. The use of quantitative trait loci (QTL) as causal anchors in the context of molecular traits will be elaborated on, as well as theexisting resources which can be drawn upon to acquire these data and integrate them in relation to the exposure and outcome of interest. The relative advantages and limitations of using MR toconduct mediation analysis and to evaluate molecular pathwayswill be outlined. To date, the approach has been applied to understanding the role of the DNA methylome, metabolome and proteome in relation to disease risk. A series of examples willillustrate the application of the methods and summarise theresults obtained. Finally, the importance of corroborating ﬁndings from MR with other experimental, data based and statistical approaches, each with orthogonal sources of bias, will behighlighted in order to best triangulate evidence for the role of molecular mediation.",2021
" Genomic instability in early embryonic development Ewart W Kuijk Center for Molecular Medicine and Oncode Institute, University Medical Center Utrecht, Utrecht, Netherlands",E17.2,E. Kuijk: None.,E18 Introduction to statistical analysis of genome wide," A major challenge in mammalian development is to maintain genomic integrity of the rapidly dividing cells. A failure tomaintain genomic integrity can lead to widespread genetic mosaicism, the presence of multiple genetic lineages within an individual. Genetic mosaicism may impact on human healthcausing for example neurodevelopmental disorders or increasedcancer risk. Recent advances in whole genome sequencing of individual cells and small tissue samples have provided insights into the prevalence and the underlying mutational mechanismsthat drive mosaicism in embryo and fetal development.

Kaakinen: None.,E19 Precision medicine in underserved populations," Genome wide association studies (GWAS) were introduced almost two decades ago now and their continued application to date keeps advancing our understanding of the underlying geneticarchitecture of many complex traits. For example, they have enabled the discovery of more than 400 genomic loci for the complex disease of type 2 diabetes, providing such clues to its pathophysiology that could not have been achieved withcandidate gene studies that were dominating, along with linkagestudies, in the pre GWAS era. While GWAS were ﬁrst applied predominantly to samples from individuals of European ancestry, scientists have recently understood the importance of studyinggenetics in diverse ancestral backgrounds. Hence, new GWAScontinue to be set up in previously underrepresented populations and learning about GWAS continues to be as topical as it was at their introduction in the beginning of the 2000s. In thiseducational talk I will discuss things that led to the need ofGWAS and the pivotal projects, such as the HapMap project, and the necessary technological advances, that ﬁnally enabled GWAS. I will then follow to outline the steps in a usual GWAS, starting fromquality control and ﬁnishing in reporting the results in a meaningful way.

Wiafe:"," Despite lower incidence rates compared to European populations, African women are more likely to die from breast cancer, which is multifaceted, and its incidence is rising. Breast cancer and its clinical complications may be preventable by mitigating factorsthat trigger the disease process (primary prevention), the use oftherapies that reduce the risk of disease before the clinical onset (secondary prevention) or more effective treatment of the disease subtype once diagnosed (Tertiary prevention/Precision medicine).Recent technological advances in genetics, genomics, metabolo mics, proteomics, and bioinformatics now offer exciting opportu nities for biomarker discovery in order to accurately predict risk,prognosis and response to treatment by informing clinical decision making. A disproportionate number of poor prognosis tumours, including hormone receptor negative tumours which have fewer targeted treatments, has been observed in certainpopulations in Africa, particularly those of West African ancestry.Coupling this with the paucity of treatment facilities and resources, primary and secondary means of prevention are needed, particularly since the early ages at onset of many breastcancers result in high associated disability and years of life lost. In this seminar, I will review molecular epidemiology studies of breast cancer including biomarker studies of molecular subtypes,incidence rates and exciting data on liquid biopsies.

Introduction: The structure of proline prevents it from adopting an optimal conformation for rapid protein synthesis. Polyproline tract (PPT) associated ribosomal stalling is resolved by the highly conserved eIF5A, the only protein to contain the amino acid,hypusine, a post translational modi ﬁcation essential for eIF5A function. Methods and Results: We describe a novel disorder caused by de novo heterozygous EIF5A variants in 7 unrelated individuals resulting in variable combinations of developmental delay, microcephaly, micrognathia and dysmorphism. To investigate the mechanism, we studied EIF5A mRNA expression in patient cells and expressed mutated EIF5A proteins in yeast cells deleted for yeast eIF5A to perform yeast growth assays, polysome proﬁling, assessed total/hypusinated eIF5A levels and assessed PPT reporter protein synthesis. These studies revealed that thevariants either resulted in haploinsuf ﬁciency, or impaired hypusi nation or perhaps reduced protein stability. All variants ultimately resulted in reduced eIF5A ribosome interaction and impaired thesynthesis of PPT containing proteins. We also demonstrated thatgenes associated with microcephaly in humans are signi ﬁcantly enriched in PPTs. To explore potential treatment, we generated morpholino knockdown of eif5a in developing zebra ﬁsh that partly recapitulated the human phenotype. Both yeast andzebra ﬁsh defects caused by eIF5A variants were partially rescued by spermidine supplementation. Conclusions: We describe a potentially treatable novel human disorder caused by EIF5A mutations that cause reduced eIF5A ribosome interactions via mutation speci ﬁc mechanisms. The phenotypes are likely explained by impaired synthesis of speci ﬁc PPT rich proteins. These ﬁndings uncover the role of eIF5A, and proteins with PPTs, in human brain and craniofacial development.V. Faundes: None. M.D. Jennings: None. S. Crilly: None. S. Legraie: None. S.E.

Objective: The purpose of this study is to elucidate genetic variants contributing to nonsyndromic craniosynostosis (CS) by comparing samples from abnormally fused bones, unaffected bones, andparent saliva, to those from patient peripheral whole blood (PWB). Methods: We applied whole genome sequencing, then performed best practice genomic alignment and variant calling, trio joint genotyping for germline genomic variants, consensussomatic variant calling for PWB bone comparisons, and variantannotation. Alternative allele frequencies, variant damaging predictions, and inheritance models were used to ﬁlter variants. Results: The study included 109 DNA samples from 26 trios, in which 17 families have affected bone tissue DNA. Patients ’affected bone samples were sequenced to an average depth of 112.7X with the rest biospecimens to 35.7X. On average, 2629 somatic variantswere identi ﬁed in the affected bones. After ﬁltering, we identi ﬁed 40 genes with somatic pathogenic/likely pathogenic (P/LP) variants. We also detected germline P/LP variants, mostly from de novo events. We con ﬁrmed known CS genes FGFR3 and IHH (both with germline de novo variants), and FREM1 (with a somatic variant in affectedbone). From a single patient, we also discovered a germline de novo CHPF variant and a somatic CHPF variant in affected bone. Conclusions: We identi ﬁed a novel candidate CS gene CHPF in the same pathway as those required for bone development and digit patterning, which shows promise for further investigation.",2021

To date, dominant mutations in sonic hedgehog (SHH) pathwaygenes are the predominant Mendelian causes and have markedinter and intrafamilial phenotypic variability. Here, we describe two families in which offspring had holoprosencephaly spectrum and homozygous predicted deleterious variants in PLCH1 . Immu nocytochemistry was used to examine the expression pattern ofPLCH1 in human embryos. We used SHH as a marker of developmental stage and of early embryonic anatomy. In the ﬁrst family, two siblings had congenital hydrocephalus, signi ﬁcant developmental delay, and a mono ventricle or fused thalami witha homozygous PLCH1 c.2065C>T, p.(Arg689 ) variant. In the second family two siblings had alobar holoprosencephaly and cyclopia with a homozygous PLCH1 c.4235delA, p.(Cys1079Valf sTer16) variant. All parents were healthy carriers, with no holoprosencephaly spectrum features. We found that the sub cellular localisation of PLCH1 is cytoplasmic, but the p.(Cys1079ValfsTer16) variant was predominantly nuclear. Humanembryo immunohistochemistry showed PLCH1 to be expressed in the notorcord, developing spinal cord, dorsal root ganglia, cerebellum, and dermatomyosome. Furthermore, the embryonicsub cellular localisation of PLCH1 was exclusively cytoplasmic,supporting protein mis localisation contributing to the pathogeni city of the p.(Cys1079ValfsTer16) variant. Our data supports the contention that PLCH1 has a role in prenatal mammalianneurodevelopment, and deleterious variants cause a clinically variable holoprosencephaly spectrum phenotype.

Introduction: Kabuki syndrome is one of the most recognisable multi system congenital disorder. Type 2 Kabuki syndrome (KS2) is a highly variable X linked condition caused by KDM6A variants, and is thought to be responsible for ~5% of KS cases. Its mutationspectrum and the genotype phenotype correlations are poorly understood. Methods: Genetic and clinical details of new and published individuals with pathogenic KDM6A variants were compiled and analysed. Results: 61 distinct pathogenic KDM6A variants (50 truncating, 11 missense) from 80 patients (34 males, 46 females) wereidenti ﬁed. Missense variants clustered in the TRP #2, #3, #7 and Jmj C domains. Truncating variants were signi ﬁcantly more likely to be de novo . Thirteen individuals had maternally inherited variants and one had a paternally inherited variant. Neonatalfeeding dif ﬁculties, hypoglycaemia, post natal growth retardation, poor weight gain, motor delay, intellectual disability (ID), microcephaly, congenital heart anomalies, palate defects, renal malformations, strabismus, hearing loss, recurrent infections,hyperinsulinism, seizures, joint hypermobility and gastroesopha geal re ﬂux were frequent clinical ﬁndings. Facial features of >1/3 rd patients were atypical for KS. Males were signi ﬁcantly more likely to be born prematurely, have shorter stature and severedevelopmental delay/ID. We also highlight the overlaps and differences between the phenotypes of KS2 and KS1. Conclusion: This largest ever KS2 series expands the KDM6A mutation spectrum, delineates the KS2 phenotype and demon strates its sex and variant dependent variability. These results will improve diagnosis for patients with KS2, especially those with inherited missense variants. In future these results will inform thedevelopment of evidence driven management guidelines in KS.",2021

Introduction: FOXG1 syndrome, previously described as the congenital form of Rett syndrome (RTT) due to overlappingclinical features, is a distinct neurodevelopmental disorder causedby pathogenic FOXG1 variants. Forkhead box protein g1 (FOXG1) is a transcription factor important for brain development and function and is expressed in the nucleus and the mitochondria. Inrodents, nuclear FOXG1 enhances mitochondrial membranepotential and induces mitochondrial ﬁssion, while mitochondrial FOXG1 promotes mitochondrial fusion. As mitochondrial dysfunc tion contributes to RTT pathogenesis and as FOXG1 regulatesmitochondrial dynamics and bioenergetics in rodents, we hypothesized that defective FOXG1 may affect mitochondrial function in human. Materials Methods: Fibroblasts were obtained from ﬁve patients with different FOXG1 truncating or missense variants andﬁve control individuals. Mass, membrane potential and ROS of mitochondria were quanti ﬁed using high throughput microscopy, and ATP content with luciferase assay. Mitochondrial morphologywas investigated by confocal microscopy and machine learning (skeletonization). Gene and protein expression were determined with TaqMan assay and western blot, respectively. Results: We observed morphological changes in mitochondrial network complexity and a signi ﬁcant reduction in the mitochon drial content in patient ﬁbroblasts compared to controls. Mitochondrial depletion was further re ﬂected as a decrease in the respiratory capacity evident by a reduction in ATP production. While biogenesis and mitophagy appeared normal, mitochondrial fusion activity was lower in the patient ﬁbroblasts. Conclusion: Our thorough assessment of mitochondrial func tion suggests involvement of mitochondrial dysfunction in the pathogenesis of FOXG1 syndrome in human for the ﬁrst time. Further investigations are necessary to elucidate how FOXG1deﬁciency impairs mitochondrial homeostasis.",2021

Introduction: Deletion 1p36 (del1p36) syndrome is the most common human disorder resulting from a terminal autosomal deletion. This condition is molecularly and clinically heteroge neous. Deletions involving two non overlapping regions, knownas the distal (telomeric) and proximal (centromeric) critical regions, are suf ﬁcient to cause the majority of the recurrent clinical features, although with different facial features and dysmorph isms. SPEN encodes a transcriptional repressor commonly deleted in proximal del1p36 syndrome and is located centromeric to the proximal 1p36 critical region.25 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Materials and Methods: We used clinical data from 34 individuals with truncating variants in SPEN to de ﬁne a neurodevelopmental disorder presenting with features that over lap considerably with those of proximal del1p36 syndrome. Results: The clinical pro ﬁle of this disease includes develop mental delay/intellectual disability, autism spectrum disorder, anxiety, aggressive behavior, attention de ﬁcit disorder, hypotonia, brain and spine anomalies, congenital heart defects, high/narrowpalate, facial dysmorphisms, and obesity/increased BMI, especiallyin females. SPEN also emerges as a relevant gene for del1p36 syndrome by co expression analyses. Finally, we show that haploinsuf ﬁciency of SPEN is associated with a distinctive DNA methylation episignature of the X chromosome in affectedfemales, providing further evidence of a speci ﬁc contribution of the protein to the epigenetic control of this chromosome, and a paradigm of an X chromosome speci ﬁc episignature that classi ﬁes syndromic traits. Conclusions: We conclude that SPEN is required for multiple developmental processes and SPEN haploinsuf ﬁciency is a major contributor to a disorder associated with deletions centromeric tothe previously established 1p36 critical regions.",2021

Delgado Vega: None. J. Klar: None. V. Kommata: None. A.,Wisten: None. N. Dahl: None. M. Börjesson: None. E.," Background: The genetic investigation of sudden cardiac death (SCD) is often limited by access to DNA from the proband. We evaluated the feasibility of WES on DNA from archived dried blood spots (DBS) collected at the time of newborn screening. Methods: Through National Health Registries, we identi ﬁed all Swedish cases of SCD in the young (<35 y.o.a.) with a post mortem diagnosis of ARVC between 2000 and 2010 ( n,22). Medical records, family history, and autopsy ﬁndings were collected. DNAwas extracted from samples in National Biobanks including DBS collected at birth ( n,19), post mortem formalin ﬁxed paraf ﬁn embedded (FFPE) heart ( n,8), and frozen blood samples (n,3). Patient and parental DNA samples (when available) underwent WES. Results: Lower yield of DNA (7.3 140 ng) was obtained from DBS compared to FFPE (515 3065 ng). However, 100% of DBS vs. 62,5% of FFPE libraries passed QC. Average mean target depth ofDBS samples (160X) was similar to blood (155X) and higher thanFFPE (82X); and >97% of target regions were covered. Analysis uncovered clinically relevant variants in 12 out of 19 families (63%), of which four were located in ARVC genes and six inanother arrhythmogenic syndrome gene. Additionally, we identi ﬁed one case with hemochromatosis and one with myotonic dystrophy.

Introduction: The CHKB gene encodes choline kinase beta, which catalyzes the ﬁrst step in the pathway for the major phospholipid phosphatidylcholine (PC). Homozygous loss of function variants in CHKB are associated with a congenital muscular dystrophy. Variable cardiac phenotypes are reported in half of known casesand are a major reason of early death. The precise role of CHKB in cardiac function is not known. Methods: Heart function of 20 week old heterozygous and homozygous (Chkb+/−and Chkb−/−) mice was assessed using echocardiography. The mice werestudied for potential susceptibility towards ventricular arrhythmias using ECG recordings. Lipid pro ﬁle of the cardiac muscle, mitochondrial oxygen consumption rate, and gene expression ofrelevant genes were determined. Results: Unlike wild type mice, 60 percent of the Chkb +/−and all Chkb−/−mice displayed arrhythmic events when challenged with isoproterenol. Lipidomic analysis revealed that Chkb de ﬁ ciency altered the pro ﬁle of lipids in the heart. A major change was an increase in acylcarnitines in Chkb+/−and Chkb−/−hearts (1.68 fold and 3 fold respectively), and this was accompanied by a decreased capacity to utilize fatty acids for oxygen production.There was a reduction in the expression of ANP and ANP receptor genes as well as ventricular conduction system markers (HCN4 and Cx40) in both Chkb+/−and Chkb−/−mice. Conclusions: Here we report for the ﬁrst time that Chkb deﬁciencies result in altered cardiac lipid metabolism, decreased oxygen consumption, defects in the ventricular conduction system development, and increased susceptibility to ventriculararrhythmias.

Majoor Krakauer2 1KU Leuven, Leuven, Belgium,2Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Nether lands. Abdominal aortic aneurysms are common and occurrence increases with age, resulting in 5 8% of men and 1 2% of women above 65 years being affected. Age related extracellular matrix remodeling and weakening of the aortic wall is caused by geneticpredispositions and risks factors like hypertension and smoking.Although familial segregation studies have identi ﬁed over 40 aneurysm genes, (likely)pathogenic variants only explain ~4% of cases. In this study we have performed whole exome sequencingof 677 abdominal aorta aneurysm patients and identi ﬁed 24 (3.5%) unrelated patients with 13 different rare heterozygous variants in FURIN , encoding the proprotein convertase FURIN. Of these 24 patients, 14 had multiple aneurysms and 7 a rupture ordissection. Thoracic aneurysm was observed in 6. More than halfof the patients showed a range of extravascular connective tissue features, like atrophic scarring, hypermobility, scoliosis or a pectus excavatum. The steady state protein levels, protease activity andshedding of recombinant FURIN variants were affected. The consequences for maturation of pro TGF β1 by FURIN mediated cleavage for downstream SMAD (SMAD2) and non SMAD (MAPK)signaling, and expression of TGF β1 responsive ACTA2 and COL4A1 , were variably impaired in patient ﬁbroblasts, indicating that TGF β/ BMP family actions are dysregulated in these aneurysms. The range of effects of the recurrent missense pR745Q FURIN inﬁbroblasts of different patients re ﬂects the in ﬂuence of individual genetic backgrounds in aorta aneurysms. Conclusion: Using WES of a large cohort of unrelated patients we identi ﬁed rare variants of FURIN with high prevalence in aortic aneurysm. This study is funded by Stichting Lijf en Leven.",2021

Introduction: Williams Syndrome (WS) is caused by a 1.5 1.8 MB deletion on 7q11.23. About 15 20% of people with WS havesevere supravalvar aortic stenosis (SVAS) requiring surgicalintervention. In contrast, ~40% with WS have no SVAS. Little is known about the genetic features impacting SVAS severity. Conventional statistical approaches for modi ﬁer evaluation would require thousands of cases, making it infeasible for the study ofrare diseases. Here we propose an alternative approach to identify disease modi ﬁers in smaller cohorts. Methods: We sequenced 450 geno mes from individuals w i t hW S ,i n c l u d i n gt h o s ew i t hs e v e r e( n,75) and no ( n,186) SVAS. Variants were jointly called using GATK procedures, identifying ~132,000 non syno nymous variants. CADD phred scores were used to ﬁlter out variants with little potential pathogenicity as well as those with minimal frequency difference between severity groups. Geneset enrichment,followed by burden testing of candidate pathway was then performed. Results: We identi ﬁed 901 genes with 1032 non synonymous variants with a difference in allele frequency between severe SVASand no SVAS > 5% and CADD phred scores > 10. Among the topcanonical pathways enriched, we identi ﬁed the extracellular matrix (FDR q,7.19 x 10 −15, with particular enrichment of collagens and glycoproteins), and cell matrix interactions (FDR q ,4.58 x 10−5). Genes related to G protein coupled receptor signaling (FDR q,9.02 x 10−11) and those implicated in the response to viral infection (FDR q,1.39 x 10−5) are also notable. Conclusions: Variants in key pathways separate people with WS with severe vs. no SVAS. These pathways can be targeted to understand mechanism of disease and develop future therapies.",2021
" Improved prediction of complex traits from individual level data and summary statistics Doug Speed Department of Quantitative Genetics and Genomics, Aarhus, Den mark",C03.1,D. Speed: None.,nan," Most existing tools for constructing genetic prediction models (polygenic risk scores) begin with the assumption that all geneticvariants contribute equally towards the phenotype. However, this represents a suboptimal model for how heritability is distributed across the genome. To address this problem, we develop eight newprediction tools, each of which allows the user to specify theheritability model. Four of our new tools use individual level data, while four use summary statistics. We compare individual level data prediction tools by analyzing 14 phenotypes from the UK Biobank(200k individuals per phenotype). Our new tool LDAK Bolt Predictperforms best, outperforming the existing tools Lasso, BLUP, Bolt LMM and BayesR for each of the 14 phenotypes. We compare summary statistic prediction tools by analyzing 225 phenotypesfrom the UK Biobank (average sample size 285k). Our new tool LDAK BayesR SS performs best, outperforming the existing tools lassosum, sBLUP, LDpred and SBayesR for 223 of the 225phenotypes. The increase in prediction accuracy from improvingthe heritability model tends to be substantial. For example, when using LDAK Bolt Predict, changing the heritability model increases the proportion of phenotypic variance explained by on average 14%(s.d. 2%), equivalent to increasing the sample size by about aquarter. Moreover, the advantage of our new prediction tools will increase further as more realistic heritability models are developed.",2021

N.,"28 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Introduction: The next generation phenotyping technology for syndromology, such as GestaltMatcher, has enabled matching patients with ultra rare phenotypes by the facial representations learned from thousands of patient photos. However, the currentavailable patient photos are unbalanced in ethnicity and age. Forexample, most of the photos are from Caucasians and taken at an early age. It results in biased models when training on an unbalanced dataset. The model might learn the ethnicity insteadof facial dysmorphic features to classify the disorders. Wetherefore demonstrate how to remove these biases when train on an unbalanced dataset. Methods: We compiled an unbiased dataset consisting of 1,500 patients with ten different rare disorders with equal ethnicitydistribution. For each individual, a frontal photo and the molecularly con ﬁrmed diagnosis were available. We utilized deep convolutional neural networks for training a model on patients ’ frontal photos, and the joint learning and unlearning (JLU) technique proposed by Alvi et al. was used to remove age and ethnicity bias during the model training. Results: We ﬁrst showed that training on a dataset with unbalanced ethnicity distribution resulted in a model predicting ethnicity instead of disorder. We then proved that the JLU removed the bias. Furthermore, we benchmarked on the balanceddataset on both the network with and without JLU. Conclusion: This study proved that the adversarial networks such as JLU unlearned the bias and generalized better on facial dysmorphic features. With this method, we could improve thedisease classi ﬁcation on the patients of minority class in this society.",2021

Wagner: None. M. Çelik: None. J. Gagneur: None.,nan," Introduction: Aberrant splicing is a major cause of genetic disorders. However, the affected tissues are often not easilyaccessible, preventing direct detection of many relevant aberrant splicing events in clinical diagnostics. Deep learning models like SpliceAI and MMSplice have improved prioritizations of rarevariants found by whole genome sequencing (WGS). However, their performance on predicting aberrant splicing in any given tissue has not been assessed so far. Materials and Methods: Here, we developed the ﬁrst benchmark dataset for aberrant s plicing prediction by applying the aberrant splicing caller FRASER on 6931 RNA seq samples from 48 GTEx tissues. We constructed a tissue speci ﬁc splicing map (SpliceMap) improving annotations of the GENCODEannotation by excluding unexpressed splice sites and quantify ing tissue speci ﬁc reference levels of alternative splicing. Next, we built new models combining i) st ate of the art deep learning models together with SpliceMap for WGS only diagnosticsand ii) furthermore including RN A seq from clinically accessible tissues (CATs) for integrated WGS and RNA seq based diagnostics. Results: At 20% recall, out of the box application of existing deep learning models, yield a precision less than 2%. However, when combined with SpliceMap, we reached 20% precision.Integrating furthermore RNA seq of CATs (blood and skin) led to50% precision. These results replicated in an independentmitochondriopathy cohorts of WGS with matched RNA seq samples. Conclusions: Altogether, our approach signi ﬁcantly increases performances of predicting aberrant splicing events in clinicallynon accessible tissues, reaching a suf ﬁciently high precision to guide non invasive genetic diagnostics.",2021

Introduction: Family history, sex and age at diagnosis are informative variables that are often overlooked in genetic analysissuch as GWAS, which typically restricts the analysis to the case control binary phenotype. We aim to develop new method that provides a re ﬁned phenotype to improve power in GWAS by including information on these variables. Materials and Methods : Here we present LT FH ++,aﬂexible method for estimating a re ﬁned phenotype for GWAS that accounts for family history, age at diagnosis and sex. We applyLT FH++ to the iPSYCH and UK Biobank cohorts by using extra information from Danish health registers for iPSYCH, and data from the British Of ﬁce for National Statistics for studying mortality in the UK Biobank. Results from the LT FH ++ model are compared with the liability threshold conditional on family history(LT FH) model and case control status. Results: In simulations, LT FH ++ showed a power increase of up to 17.8% over LT FH and 60.6% over case control status. Wefurther applied LT FH ++ to mortality in the UK biobank and four common psychiatric disorders (ADHD, autism, schizophrenia, and depression) available in the IPSYCH cohort. Across all analyzedtraits, we found 20 independent genome wide signi ﬁcant associations for LT FH ++, 10 for LT FH and 8 for case control status across all traits. Conclusion: Linking genetic data with information on family history, sex and age at diagnosis can signi ﬁcantly increase power in GWAS. As more genetic data is linked with electronic health records, we expect methods such as LT FH ++ to become more bene ﬁcial and widely used.",2021

Kutalik: None.," Copy number variations (CNVs) are potent phenotypic modi ﬁers associated with several rare genomic syndromes, but their role in complex traits remains understudied. To ﬁll this gap, we called CNVs in 331 ’522 UK Biobank participants. Association studies between the copy number (CN) of CNV proxy probes and 57 traitsrevealed 134 independent signals across 47 phenotypes. Some CNVs exhibited pleiotropy, with 26 and 19 traits associating with 16p11.2 BP4 BP5 and 22q11.2, respectively. Besides recapitulatingwell established associations (e.g. 16p11.2 weight), we identi ﬁed new ones. For instance, deletion of PDZK1 , which encodes a urate transporter scaffold protein, decreased urate levels ( β deletion , 48.3 µmol/L, p ,5.8e 13), with a 2.6 fold stronger effect in males (p diff,2.1e 3). Furthermore, many associations mapped to rare disease regions, suggesting variable expressivity and a broad impact of these loci in the general population: SHOX and its regulatory region are implicated in Leri Weill dyschondrosteosis,which is characterized by short stature, con ﬁrming the positive effect of the region ’s CN on height ( β,2.3 cm, p ,7.2e 16); Heterozygous deletion of the region encoding the hepatictransporters OATP1B1/3 is associated with increased total bilirubin (β deletion,3.1 µmol/L, p ,2.2e 13), whereas homozygous carriers affected with Rotor syndrome present with hyperbilirubinemia.Finally, our approach highlights new functionalities: The CN ofthe interval encompassing MARF1 , a gene essential to murine oogenesis, correlated negatively with age at menarche (β, 0.6 years, p,8.5e 15) and menopause ( β duplication , 1.8 years, p ,1.7e 6), suggesting a conserved role in female reproductive timing. Together, the numerous identi ﬁed associa tions suggest that CNVs play an important role in shaping complex traits and that their study can reveal new genefunctionalities.",2021

L.," Introduction: Cell free DNA (cfDNA) allows non invasive diagnosis of cancer patients. Most of the work on cfDNA focused on the detection of tumor speci ﬁc mutations. The targeted nature only provides partial view and requires knowledge of known tumormutations. In contrast, shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS)of cfDNA allows to interrogate copy number aberrations (CNAs) in an unbiased way. We present here a cfDNA data mining approach that enables identi ﬁcation of cancer speci ﬁc signals in sWGS, irrespective of the detection of CNAs. Methods: We collected cfDNA samples from 307 healthy controls and varying stages of hematological (178) and solid(331) tumors, including breast, colorectal, gastrointestinal andovarian samples. sWGS was carried out and genome wide read depth pro ﬁles were assessed. Principal component analysistransformed features were utilized for clustering. A machine learning model that incorporated the pro ﬁle features was trained for cancer classi ﬁcation. Results: Upon clustering analysis, different cfDNA pro ﬁles grouped into cancer type speci ﬁc clusters that differentiated from the pro ﬁles of healthy controls. Using the trained classi ﬁer, the overall accuracy to discriminate cancer from healthy samples was 63.8%, resulting in sensitivities ranging from 20.75% to 91.01% at95% speci ﬁcity among different cancer types and stages. This feature based classi ﬁcation outperformed CNAs only based analysis. Conclusion: We developed a novel machine learning method based on large sWGS cfDNA datasets for unbiased classi ﬁcation of cfDNA pro ﬁles, enabling tumor detection and typing. The method could open new opportunities for cancer management. Grants: This work was funded by FWO Vlaanderen (G080217N) and Vlaio (HBC.2018.2018).",2021

Fitzgerald: None. L. Fahey: None. L. Holleran: None. P. Ó,Broin: None. G. Donohoe: None. D.W. Morris: None.30," Morris National University of Ireland Galway, Galway, Ireland. Cognitive resilience is the ability to withstand the negative effects of stress on cognitive functioning and is important for maintaining quality of life while aging. UK Biobank (UKB) does not have directmeasurements of cognitive ability at distal timepoints. Therefore,we used number of years in education (EY) as a proxy phenotype for past cognitive performance. Current cognitive performance was determined based on processing speed. This approachcaptured an average time span of 40 years between past and current cognitive performance in 330,097 individuals. A confound ing factor was that EY is highly polygenic and masked the geneticsof resilience. To overcome this, we employed Genomics StructuralEquation Modelling (GenomicSEM) to perform a GWAS by subtraction using two GWAS, one GWAS of EY and resilience and a second GWAS of EY but not resilience. Subtracting one fromthe other generated a GWAS of resilience. Replication of thisapproach was shown using independent discovery and replication samples and the full GWAS results were examined further using functional genomics analysis. We found 13 independent geneticloci for resilience. Functional analyses showed enrichment in several brain regions and involvement of speci ﬁc cell types, including GABAergic neurons ( P,6.59x10 −8) and glutamatergic neurons ( P,6.98x10−6) in the cortex. Gene set analyses impli cated the biological process “neuron differentiation ”(P, 9.7x10−7) and the cellular component “synaptic part ” (P,2.14x10−6). Mendelian randomization analysis showed a causative effect of white matter volume on cognitive resilience.To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst GWAS of cognitive resilience in a large dataset.

Introduction: We wanted to investigate the cell speci ﬁc mole cular mechanisms linked to PD, to contribute to the molecularcharacterization of its etiology, especially in its early stages. Materials and Methods: We used paired bulk and single nuclei RNA seq data from human post mortem substantia nigrapars compacta tissue of 27 donors (30 99 years, 14 cases, 13controls) to create a bulk GCN and a GCN for each cell type. In addition, we employed a new strategy to account for the sparsity of the single nuclei matrix: we collapse pairs of cellsfrom the same individual in an additive manner, create the corresponding GCN and repeat the process while the number of cells is over 100. Results: We detected two bulk GCN modules (M1, M2) with signi ﬁcant overlap with Mendelian PD genes (4.282E 5 and 0.002849 Fisher test p values). M1 is enriched for PD (KEGG:05012, P,3.145e 22), oxidation reduction process (GO:0055114, P, 1.169e 17), seizure (HP:0001250, P,1.068e 06), dopaminergic neurons (1.697e 07) and interneurons (4.429e 04). M2 is enriched for synaptic vesicle cycle (KEGG:04721, P,7.986e 09), neuron differentiation (GO:0030182, P,7.423e 09), rigidity (HP:0002063, P,1.836e 08), dopaminergic neurons SN ( P,4.853e 11) and interneurons ( P,2.308e 08). On the other hand, the multi GCN approach proved to be useful as we discovered new interestingterms such as substantia nigra development in the 1 stoligodendrocytes GCN (GO:0021762, P,5.916e 06) and Lewy body core in the 4 th dopaminergic neuron GCN (GO:1990037, P,6.751e 04). Conclusions: our results provide an important framework, made up of a bulk GCN and combinated pseudo cells GCNs of each subcluster, for detecting potential genes involved in cell type speci ﬁc mechanisms in PD.

We analyzed 42 multi genic pathogenic CNVs, including reciprocal deletions and duplications, for associa tion with different psychiatric disorders. Disorders clustered according to period of onset with pediatric disorders (ASD and CLIN) being highly correlated and adult onset disorders (BP and SZ) being correlated. Groups ofCNVs tend to cluster based on phenotype associations, with themost distinct CNV cluster showing larger effects in ADHD, BD and SZ. Overall, reciprocal deletions and duplications had divergent effects across diagnostic categories, suggesting thatCNVs have “mirror ”effects on psychiatric traits, such as CLIN and SZ. Polygenic risk scores (P RS) and CNV genotype (16p11.2 locus) showed combined effect s on dimensional traits.Speci ﬁc CNV alleles have distinct psychiatric risk pro ﬁles and that may be attributable to function or expr ession of underlying genes in the brain.

L.," The role of CNVs is well established in children with neurodevelop mental disorders (NDDs). However, more research is neededtowards systematic understanding on how: i) CNVs affect health inthe adult population and ii) to responsibly disclose ﬁndings to CNV carriers at high genetic risk for complex disorders. We screened the cohort of Estonian Biobank (EstBB; n,134,546) for 41 recurrent CNV regions associated with susceptibility to NDDs. In the ﬁrst stage, we used the ‘genotype ﬁrst’approach to fetch health data from the EstBB, linked electronic health registries (EHRs) and mapped each ND CNV with their co occurring disease traits. In the second stage,we selected 10 ND CNVs as a paradigm to return of genetic risk data and analysis of at risk individuals ’experience and the impact of disclosed genetic ﬁnding on their health support. Our results show that the prevalence of CNVs associated with susceptibility to NDDsin the EstBB is 2.5% ( n,3,399). Further prioritization of CNVs listed in the DECIPHER database suggested a population prevalence of 0.36% ( n,485) for clinically well established CNV syndromes. According to EHRs, nearly half of them have previously documentedneurological or mental and behavioural problems. Notably, only 2.7% ( n,13) of them are aware of their genetic diagnosis. Our results along with reports by others are showing that CNVsassociated with NDDs are cumulatively common, but still under studied health problem in general population.

Belgium was the ﬁrst country to implement and fully reimburse NIPS as a ﬁrst tier screening test offered to all pregnant women. A consortium consisting of allBelgian genetic centers report the outcome of two years genome wide NIPS implementation. Methods: The performance for the common trisomies and for secondary ﬁndings was evaluated based on 153,575 genome wide NIP tests. Furthermore, the evolution of the number of invasivetests and the incidence of Down syndrome live births was registered. Results: Trisomies 21, 18, and 13 were detected in respectively 0.32%, 0.07%, and 0.06% of cases, with overall positive predictivevalues (PPVs) of 92.4%, 84.6%, and 43.9%. Rare autosomal trisomies and fetal segmental imbalances were detected in respectively 0.23% and 0.07% of cases with PPVs of 4.1% and47%. The number of invasive obstetric procedures decreased by 52%. The number of trisomy 21 live births dropped to 0.04%. Conclusion: Expanding the scope of NIPS beyond trisomy 21 fetal screening allows the implementation of personalizedgenomic medicine for the obstetric population. This genome wide NIPS approach has been embedded successfully in prenatal genetic care in Belgium and might serve as a framework for othercountries offering NIPS.",2021

S.," Introduction: In Luxembourg, the non invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) is nationally implemented at a single center and reim bursed by the compulsory public health insurance for every pregnant woman. We report on our obtained insights of extendedNIPT for the general population. Method We utilize the VeriSeq NIPT Solution v2 (Illumina) for routine NIPT. This WGS based methodology allows for the detection of common fetal aneuploidies, but also rare autosomaltrisomies (RATs) and copy number variations (CNVs) ≥7 Mb. Positive ﬁndings trigger a comprehensive workup, including genetic counseling, pre and postnatal follow ups and if appro priate, placental testing. Results: From August 2019 to December 2020 we performed NIPT in 9,796 pregnancies, corresponding to >95% of all pregnancies in the county. We detected 60 common trisomies(0.61%), 29 RATs (0.29%) and 13 CNVs (0.13%). Positive NIPT resultswere con ﬁrmed by prenatal invasive testing in 87% (46/53) of common trisomy, 6% (1/16) of RAT and 20% (2/10) of CNV cases.33 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Postnatal placental testing was performed in 35% (10/29) of RAT cases, con ﬁrming a con ﬁned placental mosaicism (CPM) in nine cases (90%). We observed adverse pregnancy outcomes in four RAT cases (2xT16, T9 and true fetal mosaic T15). Conclusion: The expanded use of NIPT leads to the detection of medically relevant common and atypical chromosomal anomalies, but also CPM involving recurrent RATs, which are not associated with adverse outcomes. We propose the restrained reporting ofestablished RATs without clinical consequences, for the bene ﬁto f reducing the number of invasive testing and avoiding psycholo gical distress in expecting parents.",2021

During development, gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons are born in the nasal placode and migrate to the hypothalamus, where they position to regulate sexual reproduc tion. Defective GnRH neuron development may lead to GnRH deﬁciency (GD) which is characterized by absent or delayed puberty. Several GD causative genes have been identi ﬁed so far, but half of the cases are still idiopathic. The employment ofcomplementary research approaches may be useful to identify additional genes implicated in GD pathogenesis. Here we combined for the ﬁrst time in the ﬁeld the transcriptomic analysis of GnRH neurons with exome sequencing data from GD patientsto identify novel candidate genes. As a proof of principle, we identi ﬁed a pathogenic variant in the autism linked Neuroligin 3 (NLGN3 ) gene in a patient with severe delayed puberty and autistic traits. We demonstrated that NLGN3 is enriched in GnRH neurons at late developmental stages. Further we found that NLGN3 overexpression in an immature model of immortalizedGnRH neurons promoted neurite extension whereas the novelNLGN3 mutation formed a truncated protein, thus supporting its pathogenic potential. Overall, our results highlighted how the combination of gene expression and exome sequencing data is areliable approach to identify novel candidate gene for GD such aNLGN3, an autism linked gene that we found for the ﬁrst time associated to GD.",2021

In France, the bioethics law regulates the practice of both PGD and PND, the costs of which are coveredby the national health insurance. PGD is carried out in authorized centres, which provide an annual report to the French Biomedi cine Agency; annual reports are also drawn up by the prenatalmolecular genetics laboratories. We present the data collected bythe French Biomedicine Agency and compare the evolution over 13 years of PGD and PND uptake for monogenic diseases. Over the period, the number of PGD centres increased from 3 to 5. Thenumber of molecular PND laboratories varied between 47 and 51. PGD was available for 46 diseases in 2006 and 314 diseases (345 genes) in 2018. In 2006, 134 applications were accepted (38diseases) and 462 in 2018. Ten diseases accounted for 69.4% and47.6% of the applications accepted in 2006 and 2018 respectively. For the more common indications, the relative proportion of PGD increased compared to PND. To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst attempt to analyse the evolution of PND and PGD practices at thelevel of a country in a regulated context.

Background: Understanding the effectiveness of infection control methods in reducing and preventing SARS CoV 2 transmission in healthcare settings is of high importance. Infection control ischallenging in these environments due to regular contactbetween healthcare workers (HCWs) and patients. This is ampli ﬁed by increased frequency of severe adverse responses to SARS CoV 2 in patients with underlying health conditions. Methods: We sequenced SARS CoV 2 genomes for patients and HCWs across multiple geographically distinct UK hospitals. All hospitals were actively enforcing zoning approaches (SARS CoV 2 negative and SARS CoV 2 positive areas) as an infection controlmeasure. We integrated patient movement and staff location data into the analysis of viral genome data in order to understand geographical and temporal dynamics of SARS CoV 2 transmission. Findings: We obtained 173 high quality SARS CoV 2 genomes from patients ( n,134) and HCWs ( n,39). The median number of genomic variants per sample was 11 (range ,0 16), with a 61.5% average pairwise similarity in the variants (range ,0 100%). Integration of patient movement identi ﬁed eight patient contact clusters (PCC) with signi ﬁcantly increased similarity in genomic variants compared to non clustered samples ( p<0.001). Incorpora tion of HCW location further increased the number of individualswithin PCCs. Patients within PCCs carried viruses more geneticallyidentical to HCWs in the same ward location ( p<0.001).35 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Interpretation: SARS CoV 2 genome sequencing integrated with patient and HCW movement data increases identi ﬁcation of outbreak clusters and improved understanding of the role of patient HCW interactions.

SARS CoV 2 and SARS CoV share the same cell membrane entry receptor, angiotensin converti ng enzyme 2 (ACE2), which is thus key to COVID 19 virus infection, treatment, and potentially vaccine development. The genetic basis of ACE2 protein levels is not well understood, nor is its genetic link to COVID 19. Weconducted a genome wide associ ation meta analysis of plasma ACE2 levels in over 28,000 individuals and identi ﬁed ten loci capturing 30% of the protein ’s heritability. We detected a positive genetic correlation (0.48; 95% con ﬁdence interval (CI), 0.12 to 0.84; P ,0.009) between soluble ACE2 and severe COVID 19 across the autosomes.

We studied how different polygenic scores (PGS) are correlated to >100 response items and observed highly signi ﬁcant relation ships for PGS for educational attainment, neuroticism and risk seeking behaviour.

For instance, the negative association between the PGS for neuroticism and “perceived quality of life ”was measured at 17 different timepoints and became signi ﬁcantly stronger over time (Pearson correlation R2,0.69, P ,1.9 x 10−5), whereas on average the quality of life measurement showed a different, seasonal characteristic.

Introduction: Clinical whole genome sequencing (WGS) pro mises unprecedented diagnost ic rates. However, standard approaches in clinical laboratories cannot harness the fullpower of WGS data over clinical exomes. A broader approach is especially needed in Primary M itochondrial Diseases (PMDs), where phenotypes are non speci ﬁc. Methods and Materials: Eighty three probands attending an NHS England Highly Specialised Service for PMDs underwent WGS (Illumina TruSeq, HiSeq 2500) via the 100,000 Genomes project following exclusion of common molecular causes of PMD.Standard virtual panel analysis was undertaken and cases were subsequently reviewed by a clinician on a clinical interpretation platform. Re analyses included expansion of gene panels appliedif appropriate, and analysis for cryptic in trans variants in strongcandidate genes (assisted by splice prediction scores and copy37 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87number variant analysis). Additionally, a somatic variant caller was used to identify heteroplasmic variants in mtDNA. Results: The standard bioinformatic pipeline with clinical scientist driven interpretation yielded diagnoses in 14.3% (12/83)and a partial diagnosis in 4.7% (4/83). Expanded analysis resultedin a diagnostic uplift in 16.8% (15/83) of cases; heteroplasmic mtDNA variants were identi ﬁed in an additional 3/83 patients; nDNA diagnoses were con ﬁrmed in 8/83 patients; and likely pathogenic variants in novel genes in 3/83 patients.

To better understand the human38 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87RCDP1 spectrum, we characterized a series of Pex7 de ﬁcient mice with graded reduction in Pex7 transcript and PEX7 protein levels, resulting in stepwise reductions in PL and docosahexaenoic acid, and increases in C26:0 lysophosphatidylcholine and PA inerythrocytes, plasma and brain. Clinically, body size and survivalwere reduced in accordance to genotype severity. Neurohistolo gical examination revealed graded reduction in myelin basic protein and quantity of cerebellar Purkinje cells. Pex7 de ﬁcient mice exhibited a hyperactive behavior in the open ﬁeld environment. There was signi ﬁcant reduction in the levels of brain neurotransmitters dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and GABA that were strongly correlated with the hyperactivityphenotype. In conclusion, we identi ﬁed several quantitative parameters that could be used to evaluate therapeutic interven tions in RCDP1. Furthermore, as even relatively low PA levels were associated with Purkinje cell loss over time, we suggestmonitoring PA in PEX7 de ﬁcient patients. Lastly, our data suggest the interplay between PL, brain neurotransmitter levels and hyperactivity, which could be further investigated in RCDPpatients.

Introduction: The alpha ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (α KGDH) is a critical citric acid cycle enzyme which catalyses the conversion α ketoglutarate to succinyl coenzyme A in mitochon dria. The α KGDH complex is comprised of three subunits: OGDH (E1), DLST (E2) and DLD (E3). Recently, a biallelic variant (p.N320S) in OGDH was reported in two siblings with global developmental delay, elevated lactate, hypotonia and dystonia, linking for the ﬁrst time recessive variants in OGDH with α KGDH de ﬁciency. Here, we report an additional four unrelated individuals with similar clinical presentation and homozygous missense variants in OGDH,conﬁrming OGDH as a novel disease gene for childhood onset neurological disease.Methods and Results: We present three novel missense OGDH variants in four unrelated individuals identi ﬁed using whole exome sequencing: p.P189L, p.R204Q and p.S297Y. Individuals were homozygous for rare variants (absent or MAF <0.001 ingnomAD) with high CADD Phred scores (>20). Patients presentedwith neurological disease characterised by hypotonia, develop mental delay, movement disorder, metabolic abnormalities and abnormal MRI ﬁndings. Measurement of urine organic acids was performed for two individuals (p.P189L and p.R204Q) and revealedincreased levels of α ketoglutarate. Evidence of pathogenicity of variants was supported by in silico homology modelling, over expression of mutants in HEK293 cells, α KGDH activity measure ments in patient ﬁbroblasts and evaluation of variants in a Drosophila model. Conclusions: In summary, we have established OGDH as a cause of childhood onset neurological disease. Disease mechan ism remains unknown, however, OGDH protein instability and reduction in protein abundancy has been demonstrated in vitro.

Introduction: Gout is a form of in ﬂammatory arthritis affecting millions of people worldwide. It is caused primarily due to renal underexcretion of uric acid. We have previously demonstrated that in humans, Gout can be caused by an inactivating mutation inLDHD encoding D lactate dehydrogenase (D LDH), leading to excessive renal excretion of D lactate in exchange to uric acid reabsorption. To study the metabolic effect of D LDH inactivation we created Ldhd knockout mice using CRISPR Cas9. We then used metabolome analyses to compare metabolic changes character istic of sporadic gout patients to patients with mutant LDHD and toLdhd knockout mice. Materials and Methods: chromatography mass spectrometry (LC MS), targeted metabolomics, MetaboAnalyst, CRISPR Cas9, knockout mouse model Results: Targeted metabolomics and metabolite pro ﬁling using LC MS were performed on blood samples obtained from sporadic Gout patients and healthycontrols. After identifying all signi ﬁcant changes in metabolite levels, we created a metabolomic ﬁngerprint characteristic of Gout, demonstrating typical alterations in purine, glucose, andamino acid metabolism. Metabolome analysis of mutant LDHD Gout patients as well as of CRISPR Cas9 Ldhd knockout mice was then performed to comprehensively phenotype the metabolic changes that result from D LDH inactivation and to determine ifthey also carry the metabolomic ﬁngerprint of Gout. Conclusion: Ldhd knockout mice share the same metabolomic ﬁngerprint as sporadic human Gout patients, demonstrating similar alterations in key metabolites, suggesting these miceconstitute a novel disease model for Gout.39 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Grant information: Supported in part by grants from the Kahn Foundation and the Ministry of Science and Technology Center for Rare Diseases",2021

Introduction: The TGF β/BMP cytokine family exerts pleiotropic functions during embryonic development, tissue homeostasis andrepair as well as within the immune system. Accordingly, dysregulation of TGF βsignaling is the cause of severe congenital disorders characterized by developmental defects with or withoutimpaired immune regulation. This is notably the case in the Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS), caused by heterozygous loss of function (LoF) variants in TGFBR1 ,TGFBR2 ,TGFB2 orTGFB3 ,SMAD2 or SMAD3 , and of the Shprintzen Goldberg syndrome (SGS) that results from heterozygous variants in in the TGF βrepressor SKI. Importin 8 belongs to the karyopherin family of nuclear transport receptors and was previously shown to mediate TGF β−depen dent SMADs traf ﬁcking to the nucleus in vitro. Materials and Methods: We used next generation sequencing (NGS) to study twelve individuals from nine unrelated families presenting with a novel syndromic association characterized by cardio vascular anomalies, joint hyperlaxity, various degree ofdysmorphic features and developmental delay as well as immunedysregulation. CRISPR/Cas9 inactivation in zebra ﬁsh was used to model the genetic defect. Results: NGS identi ﬁed bi allelic LoF mutations in IPO8 all the tested individuals. Consistent with IPO8 role in BMP/TGF β signaling, ipo8−/−zebra ﬁsh presented mild to severe dorso ventral patterning defects during early embryonic development.Moreover, ipo8−/−zebra ﬁsh displayed severe cardiovascular and skeletal defects that mirrored the human phenotype. Conclusion: Our results provides the ﬁrst evidence that IPO8 plays a critical and non redundant role in TGF βsignaling during development and reinforces the existing link between TGF β signaling and connective tissue defects.",2021

Lethal short limb skeletal dysplasia, Al Gazali type (OMIM % 601356) is an ultrarare disorder which has only been previously reported in three unrelated individuals without a known genetic cause. Through international collaborative efforts we havecollected a cohort of seven patients with clinical and radiographicfeatures consistent with Al Gazali skeletal dysplasia. The affected individuals present with moderate intrauterine growth retardation, relative macrocephaly, hypertrichosis, large fontanelle, short neck,short and stiff limbs with small hands and feet, severebrachydactyly, and generalized bone sclerosis with mild platy spondyly. Disease causing variants in ADAMTSL2 were detected combining WGS and Sanger sequencing. Six individuals werecompound heterozygous and one individual was homozygous forpathogenic variants in ADATMSL2 . Three patients had variants in the pseudogene region of ADAMTSL2 , which is poorly covered by short read sequencing. Mutations in ADAMTSL2 have previously been described in geleophysic dysplasia type 1 (OMIM#231050). Bioinformatic analysis of the detected variants suggests a destabilizing effect on the ADAMTSL2 protein. Protein predictionanalysis indicates the existence of intrinsically disordered region inADAMTSL2 between amino acids 341 557. Our preliminary functional data using primary dermal ﬁbroblasts from one41 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87individual suggests abnormal micro ﬁbrillar network organization involving FBN1, supporting the known role of ADAMTSL2 in regulating the micro ﬁbrillar network of extracellular matrix. Overall, this study sheds light on the previously unknown geneticcause of Al Gazali skeletal dysplasia and identi ﬁes it as a lethal part of the spectrum of ADAMTSL2 related disorders. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of meticulous analysis of the pseudo gene part of the ADAMTSL2 , where disease causing variants might be located.",2021

We previously identi ﬁed the molecular basis of GD as mutations in Fibrillin 1 (FBN1 ) for the autosomal dominant form. All FBN1 mutations in GD patients are localized in TB5 domain (TGF βbinding protein like domain). Moreover, the skeletal phenotype observed in GD suggests thatthe TB5 domain might play a role in endochondral ossi ﬁcation process. Material and method: To address this hypothesis, we generated a knock in mouse model Fbn1 TB5+/−, by introducing the mutation p.Tyr1696Cys of a GD patient in order to understand the role of i) FBN1 in GD pathophysiology and ii) TB5 domain inskeletal development. Results : We demonstrated that the Fbn1TB5+/−and Fbn1TB5−/− mice presented a reduced stature. The point mutation of Fbn1 affected the growth plate formation with abnormal differentiationof chondrocytes. Mainly the mutant chondrocytes failed toestablish a network composed by ﬁbrillin 1 ﬁbrils. This novel mouse model does not present aortic disease as observed in Marfan mouse models with Fbn1 mutations. Interestingly, the TGFβsignaling pathway was not impaired supporting that the TGFβsignaling may be not a direct pathogenic driver of GD. Conclusions: This new model is an original mouse model with Fbn1 mutation leading to GD like phenotype. Our ﬁndings suggest that the underlying mechanism of GD involves the dysregulation ofﬁbrillin micro ﬁbril deposition possibly due to the improper interactions between the TB5 domain and heparan sulfates.

The ADAMTS family comprises 19 metalloproteases involved in the modulation of the extracellular matrix. Genes for 8 membersare linked to different autosomal recessive disorders. Using exomesequencing, we detected biallelic variants in ADAMTS15 in four affected individuals from three unrelated consanguineous families with a distinctive, overlapping phenotype. The two affectedmembers of the index family 1 carrying a homozygous early premature termination codon, c.123C>G; (p.Tyr41 ), showed congenital stiffness of the ﬁnger and toe joints, absent palmar creases, especially in the interphalangeal region, spinal stiffnessand scoliosis as well as foot malformations. The proband of family 2 harbors a biallelic splice site mutation, c.1903 2A>G, leading to skipping of exon 7 and thereby to a C terminal truncation ofessential domains. She developed contractures of the ﬁngers and toes combined with absence of the palmar creases and spinal stiffness at the age of 5 years. Family 3 proband has a homozygous missense variant, c.2281G>A; p.(Gly761Ser). He haddigit contractures of ﬁngers 3 5 with missing palmar creases, stiffness of toes 2 3 and suffered two pathological fractures. Remarkably, the nonsense variant leads to the strongestphenotype, possibly indicating a null allele genotype phenotypeassociation. Radiographic investigations excluded a primary involvement of the interphalangeal joints. Homozygous Adamts15 knockout mice show a reduced grip strength implicatingmusculotendinous alterations as a possible disease mechanism.In aggregate, our ﬁndings show that pathogenic variants in ADAMTS15 cause a novel autosomal recessive condition of the arthrogryposis spectrum characterized by joint stiffness andmissing palmar creases.",2021

Inherited retinal dystrophies (IRDs) are a group of diseases associated with mutations in more than 330 genes. NR2E3 encodes an orphan nuclear receptor with a dual function as transcriptional activator and repressor, necessary for retinal development and homeostasis. Mutations in NR2E3 cause two different retinal diseases: enhanced S cone syndrome and retinitispigmentosa. However, there is no clear phenotype genotype correlation for most NR2E3 mutations. This gene produces a large protein isoform encoded in 8 exons. In addition, we found apreviously unreported isoform of 7 exons. We dissected the Nr2e3 function by performing CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing of the last exon and generated two different mouse models. Depending on the deleted domain, these models show two different phenotypesthat correspond with the two known diseases caused by mutations in NR2E3 . We performed single cell RNA seq in our models to further investigate the gene regulatory networksguiding differentiation of rods and cone photoreceptors in ourtwo phenotypes. Our results provide insight into the molecular mechanisms of the two rare diseases caused by mutations in NR2E3 and set the basis for further epigenetic studies on the NR2E3 network imbalances that give rise to IRDs.

Introduction: Monoallelic and biallelic variants in MAB21L2 cause anophthalmia, microphthalmia and coloboma (AMC), variably associated with skeletal anomalies and intellectual delay. While the function of MAB21L2 is poorly described, its ﬂanking regions contain tissue speci ﬁc enhancers. We report two likely pathogenic MAB21L2 variants in unrelated AMC individuals; the missense p. (Trp113Ser), and an upstream homozygous deletion encompass ing two tissue speci ﬁc enhancers, with evidence for additional regulatory elements in the region. Methods: MAB21L2 screening of AMC individuals was per formed using Sanger and whole exome sequencing (single nucleotide variants), and SNP array genotyping (copy numbervariants [CNVs]). Conserved non exonic elements were investi gated using CRISPR/Cas9 in zebra ﬁsh and Xenopus tropicalis . Results: We identi ﬁed a monoallelic MAB21L2 p.(Trp113Ser) variant in two brothers with colobomatous microphthalmia andtheir mother with unilateral peripapillary coloboma. Moreover, we detected a 113,580bp homozygous deletion in a girl with bilateral microphthalmia, microcephaly, micrognathia and intrauterinegrowth restriction. This CNV removes two regulatory sequencescontrolling tissue speci ﬁcMab21l2 expression in mice, in addition to six other conserved elements. Recapitulation of the CNV in zebra ﬁsh resulted in transient retinal and lens developmental defects. In addition, in Xenopus CRISPR/Cas9 mediated disruption of a putative OTX2 transcription factor binding site contained within the deleted region induced mild coloboma in developingtadpoles. Conclusions: We report two likely pathogenic MAB21L2 variants in AMC individuals, including the ﬁrst case of a homozygous deletion within the control region with support from animalmodels for its impact on gene regulation. This highlights theimportance of including regulatory regions in AMC clinical genetic testing.",2021

Introduction: Despite the advent of massively parallel sequen cing, many repetitive/low complexity regions remain intractableto short, paired end sequencing technologies. One clinicallysigni ﬁcant example is ORF15, a 1734bp AG rich repetitive exon ofRPGR , in which variants cause approximately 50% of X linked retinopathy. We established a Cas9 targeted long read sequen cing (LRS) assay to effectively read through ORF15 and enable variant detection without the nee d for complicated sequencing strategies. Methods: Seven consecutive males with molecularly con ﬁrmed (Sanger sequencing) pathogenic variants in RPGR ORF15 were recruited for LRS analysis. Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT)44 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87library preparations were targeted to a 45kb region containing the entire RPGR coding region by dephosphorylation and CRISPR guided Cas9 cleavage using multiplex guides ﬂanking RPGR . Libraries were sequenced using a MinION ﬂowcell for approxi mately 12h. Read data was processed using the ONT Guppy,Minimap2 and Medaka packages. Results: Sequencing runs generated a median of 74 reads (min,37, max ,182 [one sample was allowed to run for 24h]) on target reads, with a median read length of 7442bp, (mi n,242, max,59,677). Across the 45Kb region, a median 99.7% (mi n, 89.7%, max ,99.9%), and for ORF15, a median 100% (mi n,99.9%, max,100%) of bases were covered by ≥5 reads. After ﬁltering, 1 3 coding variants (including indels and SNVs) were detected perindividual with 100% sensitivity for pathogenic variants and a single apparently false positive call. Conclusions: This study demonstrates that Cas9 targeted ONT LRS is effective for variant detection within the repetitive region of RPGR . This represents a proof of principle for LRS approaches to study clinically relevant and otherwise intractable genomicregions.",2021

Inactivating variants as well as a missense variant in CEP78 have been identi ﬁed in autosomal recessive Cone Rod Dystrophy with Hearing Loss (CRDHL), a syndromic inherited retinal disease distinct from Usher syndrome. In addition, a complex structural variant (SV) implicating CEP78 has been reported in CRDHL. Here we aimed to expand the genetic architecture of typical CRDHL bythe identi ﬁcation of CEP78 SVs. Approaches used are shallow whole genome sequencing (sWGS) combined with quantitativePCR and long range PCR, or ExomeDepth analysis on whole exome sequencing data. Targeted or whole genome long read sequencing (LRS) was used to delineate breakpoint junctions at the nucleotide level. Two CEP78 SVs were identi ﬁed in three unrelated individuals with CRDHL: a heterozygous total genedeletion (235 kb) and a partial gene deletion (15 kb) in both heterozygous and homozygous state. Assessment of the mole cular consequences of the SVs on patient ’s materials displayed a loss of function effect. Delineation and characterization of the 15kb deletion using targeted LRS revealed the previously described complex CEP78 SV, for which a founder haplotype was demon strated. The novel 235 kb deletion was delineated using wholegenome LRS. Breakpoint analysis showed microhomology sug gesting a replication based mechanism. Moreover, data mining of bulk and single cell transcriptional datasets and immunostaining, linked the CEP78 expression domain with its phenotypicmanifestations. Overall, this study supports that the CEP78 locus is prone to SVs and suggests SV analysis in a genetic work up of CRDHL. Finally, it demonstrates the power of sWGS and LRS inidentifying and characterizing complex SVs.",2021

The lack of molecular diagnoses in rare genetic diseases can be explained by limitations of current standard genomic technolo gies. Upcoming long read techniques have complementarystrengths to overcome these limitations, with a particular strength in identifying structural variants (SVs). By using optical genome mapping (Bionano Genomics) and long read HiFigenome sequencing (Paci ﬁc Biosciences), we aimed to identify the pathogenic variant in a large family with X linked choroider emia, a progressive and rare form of chorioretinal degeneration. In the respective family, aberrant splicing of exon 12 of thechoroideremia gene CHM was detected in 2003, but the underlying genomic defect remained elusive using targeted short read sequencing. Optical genome mapping followed by long read sequencing now revealed an intragenic 1,752 bpinverted duplication including exon 12 and surrounding intronic regions, located downstream of the wild type copy of exon 12 (c.1510 +693_1510 +694ins1414 1244_1510 +402inv). Both breakpoint junctions were con ﬁrmed with Sanger sequencing. The inverted duplication segregates with the X linked inheri tance in the family, and is predicted to result in a hairpin 45 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87formation of the pre mRNA with the wild type exon 12, leading to exon skipping in the mature mRNA. This exempli ﬁes the potential for SVs to unravel novel mutational mechanisms. We believe that the identi ﬁed SV represents the hidden pathogenic cause of disease in this family, that was missed to be identi ﬁed for nearly 20 years. Our study shows that optical genome mapping and long read sequencing have signi ﬁcant potential for the identi ﬁcation of hidden structural variants in rare genetic diseases that escaped molecular diagnoses so far, even for well known disease associated genes.",2021

Hans, Roskilde, Denmark. Genome wide association studies (GWAS) have shown that identical genetic variations can have different effects on a phenotype, depending on their parent of origin (PO). To deter mine the PO of an individual ’s haplotypes, researchers usually rely on the genome of the parents or the close relatives when thegenealogy is known. However, these informations are rarely available in biobanks, preventing the study of PO. Here, we present a novel prob abilistic approach that (i) identi ﬁes surrogate parents rega rdless of genealogy using identity by descent sharing between individuals, (ii) uses a Hidden Markov Model to represent a speci ﬁc haplotype as a mosaic of haplotypes of its close re latives, (iii) a ssigns paternal or maternal origin to these shared haplotype segments, and (iv) extends the PO inference to entire chromosomes. Using the UK Biobank dataset, we inferred the PO for ~25k samples, increasing by 5 times the sample size compared toclassical approaches on this dataset. We assessed the accuracy of our method using a total of 1397 duos and trios, reaching a call rate >80% (% of sites with PO assignment) and an error rate <1%(% heterozygous sites with incorrect PO assignment). Using theresulting callset, we performed association scans for PO effects across hundreds of phenotypes and discovered known and novel imprinted variants, many of which reached genome widesigni ﬁcance thanks to the large sample size offered by our approach. By leveraging relatedness in biobanks, our approach allows studying PO effects on large sample sizes, increasing our ability tofurther characterize the genetic architecture of complex traits.

Introduction: Fibromuscular dysplasia (FMD) is a non atherosclerotic arteriopathy of unknown etiology, affecting mostly middle aged women. It is characterized by stenotic lesions of thevascular wall in middle size arteries, sometimes associated with dissection, aneurysm or tortuosity. Methods: We report results from the ﬁrst genome wide association meta analysis of six studies including 1962 FMD casesand 7100 controls. We integrated genetic association with arterial gene expression using transcriptome wide association (TWAS). To identify FMD associated variants located in regulatory elements,we determined open chromatin regions in artery derived primarycells using ATAC Seq and estimated heritability and genetic correlation of FMD with other vascular traits and diseases using LD Score regression. Results: We found an estimate of SNP based heritability compatible with a polygenic feature for FMD and report four robustly associated loci ( PHACTR1 ,LRP1 ,ATP2B1 , and LIMA1 ). TWAS identi ﬁed one additional locus ( SLC24A3 ). We found that FMD associated variants were located in arterial speci ﬁc regulatory elements. Target genes were broadly involved in mechanisms related to actin cytoskeleton and intracellular calcium home ostasis, central to vascular contraction. We found signi ﬁcant genetic overlap between FMD and hypertension, one of the most frequent consequences of FMD lesions. We also report an important genetic overlap with migraine, intracranial aneurysm,coronary artery disease and LDL cholesterol. Conclusion: We identi ﬁed several loci related to vascular contraction, suggesting that altered vascular tonicity may play a role in the pathogenesis of FMD. We ﬁnd that FMD is genetically close to several vascular diseases where vascular integrity is impaired. This work was funded by ERC grant ERC Stg ROSALIND 716628.",2021

Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex mood disorder characterized by recurrent episodes of mania and depression. Genetic factors contribute substantially to BD (estimated heritability of around 60 85%). Previous genome wide association studies (GWAS) identi ﬁed a number of susceptibility loci for BD. However, the disease relevant genes and molecular mechanisms are still largely unknown. In the present study, the BD Working Group of the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) conducted the largest GWAS of BD to date (Mullins et al., medRxiv, 2020). Our meta analysis included 57 cohorts comprising 41,917 BD patients and 371,549 controls ofEuropean ancestry. For PGC cohorts, quality control, imputationand statistical analyses were performed using RICOPILI. Five external cohorts were processed using comparable procedures. Meta analysis was performed using an inverse variance weightedﬁxed effects model in METAL. We identi ﬁed 64 independent genome wide associated loci. 33 of these were novel including the extended MHC region on chromosome 6. Pathway analysis using MAGMA revealed sig niﬁcant enrichment for four gene sets including synaptic signal ing. In addition, we found signi ﬁcant enrichment in genes encoding targets of psycholeptics, antiepileptics, anesthetics andcalcium channel blockers. Integrative bioinformatic analyses usingeQTL data provided converging evidence for 15 genes whose BD association could be mediated by changes in gene expression (e.g., FURIN ). Subtype analyses identi ﬁed one genome wide signi ﬁcant locus for BD II that did not reach signi ﬁcance in our main BD GWAS. Ourﬁndings advance the understanding of the biological basis of BD, identify novel therapeutic approaches and prioritize genesfor subsequent functional studies.

The vitamin D binding protein (VDBP) is the major blood transport protein for vitamin D and its metabolites. VDBP concentration inﬂuences total 25 hydroxyvitamin D (25OHD) concentrations, which has been linked to a range of adverse health outcomes, including mental disorders. Here we perform a genetic analysis of neonatal VDBP blood level measurements (n ,77,509) that were quanti ﬁed from dried blood spots. We performed a genome wide association study (GWAS) of VDBP levels and identi ﬁed 9 independent genome wide signi ﬁcant associations. The mostsigni ﬁcant association was in the GC gene on chromosome 4, responsible for the VDBP protein itself, where 3 frequent alleles explain about 50% of the phenotypic variance. By conditioning on these haplotypes, we further identify 8 additional loci. A pheWASanalysis of these loci revealed associations with lipid metabolism(mainly cholesterol) and blood protein and cell levels. We then performed a heritability analysis where we estimated the heritability of VDBP to be 67%, and it ’s genetic correlation to vitamin D levels to be 0.4. We also performed Mendelianrandomisation using GSMR (Zhu et al., Nat Comm 2018) to study the causal relationship between VDBP and vitamin D levels, where we found strong evidence for a causal effect of VDBP on 25OHDconcentration, explaining 11% of the variation. Because the SNP heritability of vitamin D levels is also 11%, this result suggests that much of the variance in 25OHD concentration may be explained by VDBP protein concentration.",2021

Introduction : PacBio HiFi reads (99.9% accuracy, 15 25 kb) enable comprehensive variant detection in human genomes, extendingto repetitive regions of the genome not accessible with short read WGS (srWGS). HiFi reads match or surpass srWGS for single nucleotide variant and small indel detection while also improvingdetection of structural variants (SVs), with recall far exceeding thatof srWGS. To support large scale, reproducible application of HiFi WGS, we developed an automated work ﬂow for variant analysis from HiFi reads and applied it to 80 rare disease cases unsolvedby srWGS. Materials and Methods : We used the work ﬂow management system Snakemake to link tools for 1) sequencing quality control, 2) sample quality control, 3) alignment and variant calling, 4)genome assembly, and 5) variant ﬁltering and prioritization. Small variants were called with DeepVariant/GLnexus and phased with WhatsHap, and SVs were detected by PBSV. Variants were annotated with population frequency from gnomAD and otherpublic datasets and with predicted functional consequence based on Ensembl gene models. Results : Across 80 rare disease cases, the work ﬂow identi ﬁed a median of 4,064,900 SNVs, 931,879 indels, and 21,737 SVs. Variantsof interest were identi ﬁed in 30 cases, with con ﬁrmed diagnostic pathogenic variants including a start codon loss, a novel repeat expansion, and compound heterozygous loss of function variants. Conclusions : Our analysis work ﬂows support broad application of HiFi reads, which we expect will continue to identify diagnostic variants in many rare disease cases unsolved by srWGS. The Snakemake work ﬂow and a WDL port for cloud execution are available on GitHub.",2021

Alternative splicing is a characteristic of most multi exonic human genes. However, RNA sequencing data from human tissues,suggests that this process can be inaccurate leading to the presence of reads which cannot be completely mapped to known transcripts. Here, we characterised splicing noise using RNA sequencing data from 42 human tissues, provided by the Genotype Tissue Expression Consortium and processed by recount2. We focused on reads mapping with a gapped alignmentto the genome that could be assigned to a gene through sharingof a known acceptor or donor splice site, termed partially unannotated junctions (PUJs). Using MaxEntScan to score novel splice sites, we veri ﬁed that PUJs contained ﬂanking sequences likely to be recognised by the spliceosome. We assessed theproportion of PUJs resulting from misrecognition of acceptor versus donor sites and found that this was consistently higher across all samples studied (p value<2.2e 16) with signi ﬁcant tissue differences (p value<2.2e 16). Furthermore, we showed that the novel donor and acceptor sites implied by PUJs were located in close proximity to annotated sites. However, whereas mis splicingappeared to be symmetrical around known donor sites (mod e,3bp), there was an asymmetric distribution at known acceptor sites (mode ,20bp/3bp), compatible with the well recognised AG exclusion zone at acceptor sites. These ﬁndings suggested that mis splicing is less tolerated at donor sites, which is consistentwith the signi ﬁcantly higher proportion of donor as compared to acceptor splice site mutations in ClinVar (p value ,1.8e−2). Taken together, our ﬁndings imply that the detection of pathogenic splicing events in patient derived RNA sequencing data could beimproved by modelling splicing noise.",2021

Objectives: Several studies have shown that analysis of the transcriptome by RNA sequencing (RNA seq) can improve our ability to interpret the functional and clinical importance of thegenetic variants identi ﬁed by WES and WGS. Our aim was to develop an RNA seq method that can be used in a clinical diagnostic laboratory and identify clinically relevant RNA isoforms and gene expression. Methods: The NEBNext ®Ultra™II DNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina was used. Sequencing was performed using the NovaSeq Illumina instrument. The cohort consisted of 134 pediatric clinical blood samples collected through the Genome Clinic (Centre forGenomic Medicine) at the Hospital for Sick Children. The sampleswere collected as part of a cohort of patients with a wide spectrum of undiagnosed genetic conditions and had previously been tested with microarray and WGS. Results: Our data shows that >70% of the genes associated with these clinical indications were expressed in blood. Notably, 79.5% of genes involved in neurological disorders ( N,995) were expressed. We developed an approach to identify aberrant geneexpression and clinically relevant splicing variants by comparing patient data to large sets of data from controls. After integrating with WGS results, we show that RNA seq analysis has identi ﬁed several clinically relevant candidate variants even without avail ability of the most appropriate tissue type. Conclusions: We have developed an RNA centric strategy to identify clinically relevant splicing and expression variants in acohort of undiagnosed patients for whom WGS and microarray testing had previously been performed.",2021

Background : Public archives, such as Clinvar, can be used to enhance pathogenic variant prioritisation in rare disease, butrequires consideration of potential annotation inconsistencies,hypomorphic variants and incidental ﬁndings. Materials and Methods : Genomic data from 29,880 families with rare diseases from the 100,000 Genomes Project werescanned for ClinVar variants in phenotypically relevant genepanels. ClinVar variants with star rating 1 4 and at least one50 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87“pathogenic ”or“likely pathogenic ”annotation were reviewed in the context of clinical data. The impact on the number of prioritised variants was modelled using 58 families for whom a large Paediatric Disorders gene panel was applied. Results : We identi ﬁed ClinVar pathogenic variants not pre viously prioritised in the 100,000 Genomes Project in 2,147 families. 55 families carried homozygous recessive variants, of which 17 (30.91%) likely represent a new diagnosis, while 9(16.4%) were already reported as explaining the phenotype. 43further families carried potentially diagnostic autosomal dominant variants and one an X linked variant. Variants not considered to be clinically relevant were primarily monoallelic variants for recessiveconditions, variants with low evidence of pathogenicity orhypomorphic variants. Modelling the prioritisation of ClinVar variants at various levels of stringency results in an increase in prioritised variants between 0.41 (±0.17) and 2.52 (±0.42) perproband when applying a large gene panel. Conclusions : ClinVar is a useful resource for improving variant prioritisation algorithms.

K.," Background: Part of two distinctive genes can be transcribed into a new chimeric transcript due to chromosomal aberrations. Theimportance of chimeric transcript formation remains unknown in constitutional genetic disorder contrast to cancer research. Methods: We screened for chimeric transcripts by re analyzing RNA seq data derived from peripheral blood of 153 patientswhose diagnosis remained undetermined after standard exomeanalysis. When chimeric transcripts were identi ﬁed using dedi cated software ChimPipe, whole genome sequencing for char acterizing structural abnormalities and the entire length of thechimeric transcripts sequenced by nanopore long read sequen cing were performed. Results: Two patients were found to harbor chimeric tran scripts. 1) The RNA seq of the ﬁrst patient revealed reads spanning exon 5 of ZEB2 and exon 7 of GTDC1 . Whole genome sequencing revealed a 436 kb deletion spanning intron 4 of ZEB2 and intron 7 ofGTDC1 and the diagnosis of Mowat Wilson syndrome was made. 2) The RNA seq of the second patient revealed readsspanning exon 21 of TRAPPC9 and exon 1 of KCNK9 . Whole genome sequencing revealed a 186 kb deletion spanning intron 20 of TRAPPC9 and intron 1 of KCNK9 and the diagnosis of Birk Barel syndrome was made. Conclusions: The approach of detecting chimeric transcripts from RNA seq data, is unique in that the approach does not rely on any prior information on the presence of genomic deletion.Chimeric gene formation plays an important role in thepathogenesis of congenital malformation syndromes. RNA seq, when combined with chimera analysis, represents promising modality to decipher genetic etiology of undiagnosed patients.[JP17ek0109151, JP19K17342, JP20ek0109485]",2021

Introduction: Genome sequencing (GS) for diagnosis of rare genetic disease is being introduced into the clinic, but the complexity of the data poses challenges for developing routine pipelines with high diagnostic sensitivity. The UK ’s 100,000 Genomes Project, delivered by NHS England through nationalGenomic Medicine Centres (GMCs) and Genomics England (GE), represents the ﬁrst implementation of GS into a national51 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87diagnostic programme at scale. We evaluated the GE/GMC diagnostic rare disease triaged bi oinformatics pipelines, using craniosynostosis as a test case. Methods: GS data from 114 probands with craniosynostosis or their relatives (314 samples), negative on routine genetictesting, were intensively scrutinised by a specialized research team and compared to diagnoses identi ﬁed through the GE/ GMC pipeline. Results: Fourteen variants classed as likely pathogenic/ pathogenic were identi ﬁed by the GE/GMC pipeline. Eighteen additional likely pathogenic/p athogenic variants were identi ﬁed by the research team, indicating that for craniosynostosis, theGE/GMC pipeline diagnostic sensitivity was only 44%. Measuresthat could have increased diagnostic success include compre hensive analysis of de novo small variants ( +31% sensitivity) and copy number/structural variants ( +12%), improved scrutiny of existing panel genes ( +15%), and review of updated panels (+12% sensitivity). Current consensus NHS practice, which partially incorporates these measures, would have achieved a 78% sensitivity. Conclusion: GS identi ﬁed likely pathogenic/pathogenic variants in 28% of the craniosynostosis cohort, with over half of diagnoses missed by the GE/GMC pipelines. Improved phenotype capture,variant calling, and scrutiny of variants outside restricted genepanels will be essential to leverage the full potential of GS in clinical diagnostics.",2021

Introduction : The number of video consultations (VCs) in genetic counselling have increased signi ﬁcantly since the start of the COVID 19 pandemic. We investigated the perceived quality andsuitability of genetic counselling by VC. Methods : We sent a questionnaire (containing 31 items) to all patients who were counselled via VC between May June of 2020 (n,1188) and a separate questionnaire (containing 45 items) to the genetic counsellors involved ( n,40). Results : Patient response rate was 33% ( n,387). 93% of respondents were positive about the quality of the VC, concerning both technical aspects as well as content, and would recommenda VC to others. Patients aged below 56 years were more positive compared to older patients ( p,0,033). Travel distance did not impact satisfaction consistently with both patients with a short(<30 minutes) and long (90 120 minutes) travel distance beingsigni ﬁcantly less positive about VCs compared to patient with other travel distances ( p,0,008). Educational level did not impact satisfaction ( p,0,086). Genetic counsellor response rate was 90% (n,36), of which the majority was positive (75%) and indicated that the quality of VCs was equally good with respect to content and understanding of the information by patients compared to physical consultations. The disadvantages reported most oftenwere less satisfying doctor patient relationships and limitations inphysical examination (31% experienced this limitation in ≥25% of consultations).

We conducted a survey based discrete choice experiment (DCE) to examine the impact of diagnostic uncertainty on women ’s preferences for advanced tests e.g. fetal exome sequencing. The DCE comprised ﬁve attributes identi ﬁed through literature review and interviews as being important for decision making. Respon ders were given 13 scenarios and chose between Test A, Test B (both invasive tests) or No Test. Women from eight countries who delivered a baby in the previous 24 months were recruitedthrough a market research company to complete the survey.Choices were modelled using conditional logit regression analysis. Surveys from 1239 women (Australia: n,178; China: n,179; Denmark: n,88; Netherlands: n,177; Singapore: n,90; Swe den: n,178; UK: n,174; USA: n,175) were analysed. Partici pants selected an invasive test (Test A or B) in 93% of all choices. The key attribute affecting women ’s preferences was a test with the highest diagnostic yield (p<0.0001). Women preferred testswith short turnaround times and tests where maximum results were reported (including variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VUS) and secondary ﬁndings (SF)). Women from all countries except Denmark preferred VUS to be reported (p<0.004), and womenfrom all countries except the USA preferred receiving SF (p<0.02). Women from China preferred results returned by a genetics specialist, whereas in Denmark they preferred a maternityspecialist. Whilst most women want to receive maximum information, our ﬁndings also highlight country based differences. Therefore, a global consensus on returning results from fetalexome/genome sequencing is not necessarily realistic or desir able.

A.," Introduction: Integration of personality traits (Neuroticism, Extraversion, Openness, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness) inthe genetic counselling of germline cancer testing is key tounderstand personalized medicine as an adaptation to individuals ’ psychosocial needs. Previous studies suggested more uncertainty in carriers of moderate versus high penetrance breast cancer (BC)genes. We aimed to investigate the association betweenpersonality traits and the psychological impact from hereditary germline cancer genetic testing(GCGT); and compare the psycho logical impact between moderate and high penetrance patho genic variant carriers Materials and Methods: Prospective multicentre study includ ing individuals who underwent GCGT. The NEO FFI (personality)and the Cancer Worry (CWS) Scales were analysed at baseline; andthe MICRA (psychological impact) and CWS scales immediately, 3 and 12 months after results disclosure. Multivariate analysis was used to evaluate predictors of psychological impact. Results: Overall, 714 patients were analysed: 532 (74%) female, 394 (55%) diagnosed with cancer, 404 (56%) underwent panel testing, 44% single gene testing, and 187 (26%) resulted positive. Female sex, cancer diagnosis, and high levels of neuroticismcorrelated with higher psychological impact (Table 1). Among mutation carriers, no differences in uncertainty between high and moderate BC risk carriers (p values>0.05). Conclusions: Levels of neuroticism is an independent factor to predict the psychological impact of GCGT. There are no differences in uncertainty levels between high and moderate BC risk carriers.

Introduction: Polygenic risk scores (PRS) for breast cancer risk have emerged as a potential tool for informing disease riskmanagement. However, little is known about women ’s responses to receiving this information. This study aimed to prospectively assess patient reported outcomes and risk management behaviorof women choosing to receive (receivers) or decline (decliners)their breast cancer PRS. Methods: Women either unaffected or affected by breast cancer and from families with no identi ﬁed pathogenic variant in a breast cancer risk gene were invited toreceive their PRS. Genotyping for 62 common variants wasperformed, from which a PRS and relative risk were calculated. All participants completed a questionnaire at study enrollment. Receivers completed questionnaires at two weeks and 12 months after receiving their PRS, and decliners a second questionnaire at 12 months post study enrollment. Results: Of the 208 participants, 165 (79%) received their PRS. Among receivers there were no changes in anxiety or distressfollowing testing. Receiving a low PRS was associated with reduced perceived breast cancer risk at 12 months ( p,0.030). At 12 months, breast screening and uptake of risk reducingstrategies were consistent with current Australian guidelines ofbreast cancer risk management. Compared to receivers, decliners reported signi ﬁcantly higher decisional regret regarding receipt of their PRS (p<0.001). Reasons for declining PRS included beingunable to attend the appointment in person and concerns over potential emotional response. Conclusion: Our ﬁndings provide additional support for the suitability of PRS in clinical practice, while highlighting the issuesthat need to be addressed when providing this information.",2021

Introduction: If undetected, inherited cardiac diseases can lead to sudden cardiac death, while preventive and treatment options are available. Currently, probands are asked to inform relatives, withonly half of relatives attending genetic counselling. Direct contactby the genetic counsellor may enhance uptake, although there are legal, ethical and psychological concerns. Methods: Current practice was compared to a tailored approach, in which probands were asked to decide to (initially)inform relatives themselves or by the counsellor, and family letters were sent directly by the counsellor 1 month after disclosure of the patients ’test result. Outcomes were uptake of counselling in theﬁrst year, impact on psychological and family functioning, and evaluation of the approach (measured with surveys at 3 (T1) and 9 (T2) months after disclosure). Results: 96 probands were included, yielding 549 relatives eligible for counselling and genetic testing. We observed no signi ﬁcant difference in uptake of genetic counselling between the current (38%) and the tailored (37%) approach. Signi ﬁcantly more probands in the tailored group felt satis ﬁed and supported with the used approach, while they also felt more pressure to inform relatives and perceived room for improvement. No differences in psychological and family functioning wereobserved. Conclusions: Surprisingly, the tailored approach showed a similar uptake as the current approach. There were no differencesobserved in impact on psychological/family functioning, butprobands in the tailored group more often felt satis ﬁed and supported. Further research is needed to identify the most optimal approach to reach at risk relatives. Funding: CVON 2015 12eDETECT",2021

Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) is a hematological malignancy that affects 2.7 individuals per 100,000 per year. It is characterized bythe presence of rare, morphologically distinctive tumor cellssurrounded by reactive immune cells. We assessed for rare variants with the potential to confer predisposition to familial HL, in whole exome sequencing (WES) data from a series of 22affected members from 11 families. Genes with rare, predicted pathogenic, disease cosegregating variants in two or more families were considered candidates. Intriguingly, a signi ﬁcant fraction of the 35 genes identi ﬁed act in mitosis, mitotic checkpoints and DNA repair, with a second fraction acting in metabolic processes. CCNF (Cyclin F), a widely expressed cell cycle regulated E3 ubiquitin ligase component, belongs to the ﬁrst category and was prioritized for in vitro functional testing. Theubiquitination targets of the Skp1 Cul1 F box Cyclin F(SCFCyclinF) complex function at precise points during mitosis and are then degraded; inappropriate persistence of these proteins can causegenomic instability, focal DNA damage, micronuclei, and forma tion of multinuclear cells, a hallmark of certain HL tumors. We ﬁnd that both of the variants identi ﬁed in familial HL disrupt binding of CCNF to three different ubiquitination targets tested: RRM2(Ribonucleotide Reductase Regulatory Subunit M2), involved indeoxyribonucleotide production and homeostasis), CDC6 (Cell Division Cycle 6, involved in regulation of DNA replication) and EXO1 (Exonuclease 1, involved in DNA repair, telomere main tenance).

Since 2017, a large gene panel including the TP53 gene has been validated by the French Genetic and Cancer Group to explorepatients suggestive of hereditary breast and ovarian cancerpredisposition (HBOC). As breast cancer belongs to the tumour spectrum of the Li Fraumeni or heritable TP53 related cancer syndrome, we embarked upon a large scale collection andclassi ﬁcation of TP53 variants found in a HBOC context. Sequen cing of 22,500 HBOC panels in France led to the detection, after exclusion of circulating tumour DNA and clonal haematopoiesis of 232 heterozygous TP53 variants (1%). Most of them remained unclassi ﬁed by ClinGen Expert Panel and therefore were classi ﬁed according to TP53 speci ﬁcations adapted from ACMG. Thirty three percent were deleterious (classes 4 and 5) and the rest were VUSrequiring further investigations. Interestingly, 45% of deleteriousvariants have never been described in LFS, suggesting a different mutational spectrum in HBOC patients. Unexpectedly, similar rates of deleterious variants were found between the group of patientsfulﬁlling the Chompret diagnosis criteria for LFS and the group who did not ful ﬁl these criteria (33% and 29% of detected TP53 variants, respectively).

DICER1 syndrome is a rare genetic disorder that predisposes to a wide spectrum of tumors. Developing surveillance protocols for this syndrome is challenging bec ause uncertainty exists about the clinical ef ﬁcacy of surveillance, and appraisal of potential bene ﬁts and harms vary. In addition, there is increasing evidence that germline DICER1 pathogenic variants are asso ciated with lower penetrance for cancer than previously assumed. To address these issues and to harmonizeDICER1 syndrome surveillance programs within Europe, the Host Genome Working Group of the European branch of the International Society of Pedia tric Oncology and Clinical Guide line Working Group of the CanGe ne CanVar project reviewed current surveillance strategies and evaluated literature. Con sensus was achieved for a new surveillance protocol andinformation lea ﬂet that informs patients about potential symptoms of DICER1 associated tumors. The surveillance proto col comprises a minimum program and an extended version for consideration. The key recommendations of the minimumprogram are: annual clinical e xamination from birth to age 20 years, six monthly chest X ray and renal ultrasound from birth to age 6 years, and thyroid ultrasound every 3 years from age 8 to age 40 years. The surveillance program for considerationcomprises additional surveillance procedures, and recommen dations for DICER1 pathogenic variant carriers outside the ages of the surveillance interval. Patients have to be supported in choosing the surveillance program that best meets their needs.Prospective evaluation of the ef ﬁcacy and patient perspectives of proposed surveillance re commendations is required to expand the evidence base for surveillance protocols.

Introduction: Mosaic mutations in the APC gene have been identi ﬁed as a common cause (25%) for unexplained polyposis in patients with >20 adenomas. The frequency of APC mosaicism remains unknown in milder phenotypes. Materials and Methods: To test for APC mosaicism, we analyzed the APC gene in multiple lesions of patients with unexplained colonic polyposis using Next Generation Sequencing.Additionally, patients with milder phenotypes, e.g. >20 adenomasat age >70, were included. Results: The mosaicism detection rate was 12% (27/232) in the entire cohort, 5.7% in patients with <10 adenomas (2/35) and 7.7%in those with 10 20 adenomas (8/104). Strati ﬁed for age, 2.8% (1/ 36) of patients aged >70 showed with a mosaicism. Besides these “true ”mosaicism cases, 21% (50/232) of patients showed a so called hybrid mosaicism, where multiple, but not all lesions sharean identical variant. Interestingly, 46% (23/50) of hybrids have aspeci ﬁcAPC splice variant c.835 8A>G in multiple lesions. Together with 7 other recurring APC variants, this variant was compatible with the recently described mutational signaturecaused by colibactin, a compound produced by pks+E.coli . The possible in ﬂuence of colibactin needs further exploration. There fore, we are now performing additional analyses like WholeGenome Sequencing. Conclusions: Our results indicate that APC mosaicism also plays a role in milder polyposis phenotypes. Furthermore, a substantial56 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87proportion of our cohort had a hybrid mosaicism of which the clinical consequences are not yet clear. In some patients, the presence of pks+E.coli might be the explanation for the development of polyps. Grant: DCS",2021

Many patients with clinical attenuated adenomatous polyposis coli remain undiagnosed after standard genetic testing. Here, we describe a patient with normal results for Sanger sequencing and NGS ﬁnally carrying complex structural rearrangements of the APC locus apparently arisen from rare localized germline chromothripsis. By short read sequencing (Agilent SureSelectXT, Illumina), benign heterozygous variants were identi ﬁed in APC exons 11, 13 and 15, which were used to determine the allelic expression ofAPC mRNA. RT PCR and targeted long read RNA Seq (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT) showed an allelic imbalance with ratios of 20:80 and 30:70, suggesting an allelic reduction of mRNAexpression. A deletion of ~105 kb upstream of APC was found by chromosomal microarray but deemed too distant (~990 kb) to disrupt APC mRNA expression. WGS with ONT identi ﬁed several genomic rearrangements indicative of an insertion of APC from chr.5q22 into chr.10q21.3, which was con ﬁrmed by FISH. Ultimately, optical mapping and de novo assembly (Bionano Genomics) was combined with long read WGS data to reconstruct both APC loci. Whereas one allele was retained in a normal con ﬁguration presumably transcribing physiological levels of APC mRNA, the second allele was deleted from chromosome chr.5q22.1 q22.3 and inserted into chr.10q21(CTNNA3 ). The inserted fragment harbored multiple complex deletions, duplications, and inversions separating the APC promoter/exon 1B from the remaining exons and attenuatingtranscription. Combining Bionano optical mapping, ONT WGS, and RNA seq provides a powerful tool set for the diagnosis of hitherto genetically unresolved patients with rare mutation mechanisms.",2021

Chromatinopathies de ﬁne genetic neurodevelopmental condi tions caused by genetic alterations of components of the epigenetic machinery. Majority of these disorders exhibit highly speci ﬁc genome wide DNA methylation pro ﬁles detectable in peripheral blood, referred to as episignatures or EpiSigns. Here weassessed the DNA methylation episignatures in a cohort of patients with clinical features of a chromatinopathy disorder. The 129 patients were grouped in: i) the discovery cohort includedpatients with a certain clinical diagnosis associated with a pathogenic variant, ii) the validation cohort consisted of patients carrying pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant with no de ﬁnitive clinical diagnosis, iii) the uncertain cohort included patients with aclinical diagnosis carrying VUS, and iv) negative cohort consisted of patients with no de ﬁnitive clinical diagnosis and no genetic ﬁndings. EpiSign analysis was concordant with sequencing ﬁndings in 98/101 samples. For 3 cases without previous genetic ﬁndings, EpiSign analysis identi ﬁed a unique DNA methylation proﬁle, as a sole molecular diagnostic ﬁnding explaining their clinical presentation. In the uncertain cohort, twenty ﬁve samples had no known episignature suggesting that the identi ﬁed VUS has likely no clinical relevance and that those patients need to be clinically and molecularly reconsidered. Two KDM6A VUSs were reclassi ﬁed as likely pathogenic after EpiSign analysis, while in one patient with a Kabuki VUS, an alternate episignature associated with Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome was detected and subsequently conﬁrmed. We demonstrated that DNA methylation episignature provides an effective diagnostic modality in Chromatinopathies,helping establish, improve, and correct molecular diagnosis achieved by standard DNA sequencing.57 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87J.

Results: This integrative approach was successful to reclassify several variants as pathogenic. However, we questioned theinvolvement of some others, such as p.Thr588Asn, yet reported aspathogenic, and showed it does not cause protein impairment or obvious phenotype in mice.

Joubert syndrome (JS) is a recessively inherited ciliopathy characterized by a unique cerebellar and brainstem malformation, the “molar tooth sign ”(MTS), associated to ataxia, oculo motor apraxia (OMA), developmental delay/intellectual disability (DD/ID)and variable multiorgan involvement. Over 40 JS genes are known, accounting for ~60% cases. In 2018, we reported homozygous hypomorphic missense variants of the SUFU gene in 2 families with mild JS and polydactyly. A recent study identi ﬁed heterozygous loss of function (LOF) SUFU variants in families with dominantly inheritedOMA occasionally associated with mild cerebellar hypoplasiaand DD/ID. To test the hypothesis that SUFU haploinsuf ﬁciency may be responsible for a neurodevelopmental disorder at the mildest endof the JS spectrum, we reanalyzed NGS data in a large cohort of442 JS patients, and identi ﬁed SUFU heterozygous LOF variants in 6 patients (1.4%). This frequency is signi ﬁcantly higher than that reported in GnomAD (0.002%, p<0.00001). The phenotype wascharacterized by mild, purely neurological JS, with OMA and mild DD/ID. While most variants were de novo, two variants were inherited inherited from mothers, which reported mild DD, clumsiness and learning dif ﬁculties in childhood. We propose SUFU heterozygous LOF variants as responsible of a spectrum of neurodevelopmental disorders ranging fromisolated OMA to a mild, purely neurological form of JS. Given the overall “benignity ”of the phenotype, this condition can be transmitted from a carrier parent unaware of being affected. Awareness of this genetic condition will increase thediagnostic yield of mild JS, allowing appropriate genetic counsel ling and risk estimates.",2021

Furthermore, in the striatum of Foxp1+/−animals, mitochondrial membrane potential was disrupted, and reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation and cytochrome c release were signi ﬁcantly elevated.

Parkinson ’s disease (PD) is the most common neurodegenerative movement disorder and the fastest growing neurological disease,with a prevalence in the general population aged ≥65 years of 2 3 % already. With no approved curative or disease modifying therapies currently available, PD presents a major unmet clinical need. Overwhelming evidence suggests that the abnormal aggrega tion of the protein α synuclein, encoded by the SNCA gene, is the causative agent of PD, driving the neuronal death and cellular dysfunction characteristic of the disorder. Given that multiplications of the SNCA gene are known to cause familial PD, and that PD risk loci identi ﬁed through genome wide association studies have been shown to regulate SNCA expression, there has been growing interest in novel therapies directly targeting α synuclein. Here, we use novel antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) targeted to human SNCA to reduce α synuclein expression in midbrain dopaminergic (mDA) neurons generated from PD patient derived induced pluripotent stem cells. We demonstrate that an ASO induced reduction in α synuclein expression reverses established α synuclein pathology and rescues cell death in these neurons. We further demonstrate that this improvement in neuronal health may be mediated through an amelioration of mitochondrial function. In summary, our datasupports the continued exploration of ASO technology targeted to SNCA as a novel disease modifying therapy for PD and other related synucleinopathies.",2021

To justify its broad application, any screeningtest must demonstrate suf ﬁcient positive and negative predictive values (PPV/NPV). Predicting the clinical signi ﬁcance of identi ﬁed variants represents a challenge for expanded carrier screening(ECS), since variant pathogenicity interpretation relying on ACMGcriteria is limited in healthy individuals because criteria like “phenotypic match ”or“familial segregation ”are unapplicable. To evaluate PPV and NPV of ECS, we focused on the ciliopathies, awell studied group of recessive disorders with ~130 associated genes causing severe pediatric phenotypes. Performing WES on 397 healthy individuals, we found 37% to be carriers of ≥ 1 “reportable ”ciliopathy variant. In 5/177 couples, both partners carried variants in the same gene. However, classi ﬁcations frequently differed between databases, questioning the patho genicity of identi ﬁed variants and limiting the PPV. Novel missense variants are typically classi ﬁed as VUS and not reported. They represent however putative false negatives, increasing the residual risk of being a carrier after a “negative ”test. How much this decreases the NPV is unclear. Including rare novel missense59 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87variants predicted as deleterious by multiple algorithms, the carrier rate rose to 71% with 11/177 couples at potential risk. Ciliopathies being rare disorders, the majority of variants cannot be disease alleles; To identify disease causing variants, weincluded gene speci ﬁc and structural information to prioritize variants for functional evaluation. In conclusion, current limitations in variant pathogenicity prediction substantially decrease PPV and NPV of ECS. Funding : KFSP UZH Praeclare",2021

R.," Bardet Biedl syndrome (BBS) is a ciliopathy characterized by retinal dystrophy, intellectual disability, polydactyly, obesity and renal anomalies. In photoreceptors (PR), light sensation occurs in outer segments (OSs), which are specialized primary cilia. BBS1 , the major BBS gene, is part of a protein complex called “BBSome ”, which is involved in intracellular protein transport. However, the precise function of BBS1/BBSome in controlling traf ﬁcking of ciliary proteins in PRs remains unclear. In zebra ﬁshbbs1 mutants, we observed impaired visual function starting at 5 days post fertilization (dpf), before appearance of any morphological changes. With time, progressive PR cell layer disorganization and dysmorphic OSs appeared. PRs differentiatednormally, indicating that Bbs1 is predominantly required for their function and/or maintenance. Eye speci ﬁc transcriptomic analyses showed no differentially expressed genes at 5dpf, indicating thatdevelopmental signaling is not affected by Bbs1 loss. At 10dpf,mostly non speci ﬁc degenerative signatures were present in the transcriptome. Proteomics on isolated adult OSs revealed the loss of the entire BBSome from mutant OSs and an overall accumula tion of non ciliary proteins. Membrane associated proteins wereoverrepresented in our dataset, supporting the role of BBS1/the BBSome in controlling ciliary transport of membrane associated proteins. Interestingly, lipid binding/transport proteins weresigni ﬁcantly enriched in mutant OSs. LC MS lipidomics revealed an increase of unesteri ﬁed cholesterol in mutant OSs. Given the exquisitely controlled lipid composition of OSs, this disruption isexpected to interfere with visual function. In conclusion, we haveidenti ﬁed a novel putative function for Bbs1/BBsome in lipid homeostasis, which suggests a new mechanism underlying decreased visual function. Grant: SNF:_PP00P3_170681",2021

Retrospective clinical data was collected from the medical records. Haplotype reconstruction was per formed in families harboring the same missense variant. Results: 10 individuals (8 unrelated families) with biallelic variants in FDXR were identi ﬁed. In addition to bilateral optic atrophy and variable extra ocular ﬁndings, 7/10 (70%) individuals had retinal dystrophy, not well characterised in previous reports.The previously unreported missense variant (c.1115C>A) was found in 5/8 (62.5%) study families. Haplotype reconstruction using GS data demonstrated a likely ancestral haplotype. Conclusions: FDXR associated disease is a phenotypically heterogeneous disorder with retinal dystrophy as a frequent clinical feature observed in this cohort. In addition, we hypothe sise that multiple factors may drive the pathogenesis of opticatrophy, retinal degeneration and perhaps the systemicmanifestations.

Introduction: The molecular basis of heterotaxy and congenital heart malformations associated with disruption of left right (L R) asymmetry is broad and heterogenous, with over 25 genesimplicated in its pathogenesis thus far. Objective: We sought to elucidate the molecular basis of laterality disorders and associated congenital heart defects in a cohort of 28 unrelated probands of Arab Muslim descent, using next generation sequencing techni ques. Methods: Detailed clinical phenotyping followed by Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was pursued for each of the probandsand their parents (when available). Sanger sequencing was used for segregation analysis of disease causing mutations in the families. Results: Using WES, a molecular diagnosis was reached for 16 of the 28 probands (57%). Genes known to be associated withheterotaxy and/or primary ciliary dyskinesia in which homozygous pathogenic or likely pathogenic variants were detected, included: CFAP53 (CCDC11), CFAP298 (C21orf59 ), CFAP300, LRRC6, GDF1, DNAAF1, DNAH5, CCDC39, CCDC40 and TTC25 . Additionally, we detected a homozygous disease causing mutation in DAND5 ,a sa novel recessive monogenic cause for heterotaxy in humans. Three additional probands were found to harbor variants of uncertainsigni ﬁcance. These included variants in DNAH6, HYDIN, CELSR1 and CFAP46 . Conclusions: Ourﬁndings contribute to the current knowledge regarding monogenic causes of heterotaxy and its associatedcongenital heart defects and underscore the role of next generation sequencing techniques in the diagnostic workup of such patients, and especially among consanguineous families.",2021

Telomere maintenance 2 (TELO2 or Tel2), Tel2 interacting protein 2 (TTI2) andTel2 interacting protein 1 (TTI1) are the three components of the conserved Triple T (TTT) complex that regulates activities of phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase relatedprotein kinases (PIKKs), including mTOR, ATM and ATR, byregulating the assembly of mTOR complex 1 (mTORC1) and is essential for the expression, mat uration and stability of ATM and ATR in response to DNA damage. TELO2 and TTI2 related autosomal recessive encephal opathies have been recently described in 8 and 10 patients respectively, presenting with moderate to severe intellectual disability and postnatal micro cephaly, associated to a movement disorder for TELO2 patients and short stature for TTI1 patients. We present clinical and functional data in a series of seven patients belonging to ﬁve unrelated families. All harbor TTI1 biallelic variants and present with intellectual de ﬁciency, microcephaly, a short stature, and a movement disorder. Functional studies were conducted. We evaluated the activity of TTI1 clinical mutants, Leu767Ser, Ser838Leu and Asp921Asn, and of 3 additional TTI1 variants, Val123Glu, Ser402Pro and Asp8 87Glu in HEK293T cell lines.

TFAP2E encodes the transcription factor AP 2. This transcription factor ’s role in the formation of the central nervous system (CNS) and craniofacial structures in humans has not been investigated. Here, we report 4 individuals wit h novel heterozygous missense variants in TFAP2E , all presenting with CNS malformations and craniofacial anomalies. For one family, parental samples were available to con ﬁrmde novo occurrence of the missense variant. All variants were identi ﬁed by exome sequencing. We initiated functional characterisation in zebra ﬁsh larvae including splice and translational blocking morpholinos (MO) in different transgenic zebra ﬁsh lines. Fluorescent signals of neuronal, glial and neural crest cells at 2 dpf were analysed in vivo using a two ‐ photon point scanning microsc ope and subsequent 3D model ling with IMARIS analysis software. Alcian blue cartilage staining was done at 3 dpf. Shared phenot ypic features among patients comprised malformations of th e CNS (4/4) and craniofacial anomalies (4/4). MO knockdown of tfap2e in zebra ﬁsh larvae recapitulated the human CNS and craniofacial phenotype. Major effects on vasculogenesis wer e excluded after MO injections into vascular reporter lines, suggesting the tissue speci ﬁcity of the observed effects. Immuno histochemistry showed the expression of Tfap2e in th e developing CNS of zebra ﬁsh and mice. Our ﬁndings indicate that TFAP2E plays an important role in CNS and neural crest d evelopment and suggest TFAP2E as a novel candidate gene for human CNS malformations and craniofacial anomalies.

WDR5 is a broadly studied, highly conserved protein involved in a wide array of biological functions. Among these functions, WDR5is a part of several protein complexes that affect gene regulationvia post translational modi ﬁcation of histones. We collected data from ten unrelated individuals with six different rare de novo missense variants in WDR5 ; one identical variant was identi ﬁed in four individuals, and another variant in two individuals. All tenindividuals had neurodevelopmental disorders including speech/ language delays ( N,10), intellectual disability ( N,8), epilepsy ( N ,6) and autism spectrum disorder ( N,4). Additional phenotypic features included abnormal growth parameters ( N,6), heart anomalies ( N,2) and hearing loss ( N,2). All six missense variants occurred in regions of the WDR5 locus known to be extremely intolerant to variation. Three dimensional structureanalyses indicate that all the residues affected by these variants are located at the surface of one side of the WDR5 protein. Five out of the six amino acid substitutions are predicted to disruptinteractions of WDR5 with RbBP5 and/or KMT2A/C, as part of theCOMPASS family complexes. Thus, we de ﬁne a new neurodeve lopmental disorder associated with missense variants in WDR5 characterized by a broad range of associated features includingintellectual disability, speech/language impairments, epilepsy and autism spectrum disorders.

Introduction: Phosphoinositides (PIPs) are lipids that play a critical role in processes such as cellular signalling, ion channel activity and membrane traf ﬁc. When mutated, several genes that encode proteins that participate in the metabolism of these lipidsgive rise to neurological or developmental phenotypes. PI4KA is aPIP kinase that is highly expressed in the brain and is essential for life. Materials and Methods : We used whole exome or genome sequencing to identify biallelic PI4KA variants in 10 independentpatients. Western Blot, Immuno ﬂuorescence and targeted lipido mics to test for PI4KA activity were performed on PBMC ( n,4) andﬁbroblast samples ( n,5). Results : The mutations discovered in PI4KA caused a spectrum of conditions ranging from severe global neurodevelopmental delay with hypomyelination to pure spastic paraplegia. Somepatients presented immunological de ﬁcits or genito urinary abnormalities. Functional analyses showed decreased PI4KA and phosphoinositol 4 phosphate levels in the patients ’ﬁbroblasts and a diminished PI4KA activity was found in ﬁbroblasts and peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Conclusions : We report a novel severe neurometabolic disorder caused by PI4KA malfunction, highlighting the importance of phosphoinositide (PIP) signalling in human brain developmentand the myelin sheath.

Nag: None. A. Harper: None. Q. Wang: None. S. Cameron,Christie: None. K. Carss: None. S.

As such, the population based nature of the UKBiobank (UKB) cohort study reduces this ascertainment bias and could enable better estimates of the population level penetrance for some of the well known gene phenotype relationships. Weestimated penetrance for certain well established gene pheno type relationships using the exome sequence data from ~394K unrelated UKB participants of European ancestry. UKB participants were recruited at age 40 80 years and detailed medical historywas obtained from self report data, general practitioner, hospital and death records. Gene level penetrance was generated by calculating the proportion of carriers of a speci ﬁc class of variant64 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87(e.g., rare [MAF<0.1%] protein truncating variants [PTVs]) in a gene that have a particular disease. For instance, the penetrance of rare PTVs in MYBPC3 , a predominant cause of hypertrophic cardiomyo pathy, is estimated to be 10.5% (11/105 carriers) [95% CI: 5.4% 18%] in the UKB dataset. In comparison, the penetrance for rarePTVs in PKD1 and polycystic kidney disease is 50.4% (61/121 carriers) [95% CI: 41.2% 59.6%], and that for rare PTVs in HBB and thalassemia is 71.1% (59/83 carriers) [95% CI: 60.1% 80.5%]. TheUKB can thus provide a complementary resource to assess thepopulation level penetrance for established gene phenotype relationships, which may be further optimised through careful variant curation and phenotypic re ﬁnement beyond ICD 10 codes. This could also help broaden our understanding of the underlyinggenetic architecture and improve risk prediction for “monogenic ” diseases.",2021

In genome wide association studies attention is typically focused on measures of relative risk that do not inform us of the totalhealth burden associated with carrying risk alleles. We developed a new framework for estimating the attributable disease burden of genetic variants based on disability adjusted life years (DALYs)from the Global Burden of Disease 2019 Study, which depict theamount of healthy life years lost due to premature death and living with disability. We use information from the FinnGen study (n ,260 391) and UK Biobank (n ,426 464). We meta analyze hazard ratio estimates from the cohorts, apply a Bayesian spike and slab type prior, and estimate the attributable DALYs for each variant or polygenicscore. We consider 2580 ﬁne mapped disease or risk factor associated variants. Additionally, we consider 80 HLA region variants and 57 selected polygenic scores in FinnGen. We estimate the DALYs attributable for 72 major diseases from the GlobalBurden of Disease 2019 Study. Rs3798220 ( LPA) had the highest effect on loss of healthy life years quanti ﬁed as DALYs at 1.249 (95% CI: 1.090 1.407) through increasing risk of ischemic heart disease (1.151 DALYs),valvular heart disease (0.047 DA LYs), aortic aneurysm (0.035 DALYs), and peripheral artery disease (0.016 DALYs).

Comparing transcript levels between cases and controls allows the identi ﬁcation of differentially expressed genes, which may be causes, consequences or mere correlates of the disease under scrutiny. Whereas we have previously integrated summary leveldata from GWAS and eQTLs in a Transcriptome Wide Mendelian Randomization (TWMR) approach to elucidate gene expression to trait causal effects, here we propose a reverse TWMR (revTMWR) toshed light on causal imprints of complex traits on transcript levels.Combining TWMR and revTWMR results revealed that whole blood gene expression trait correlation is mainly driven by causal effect from the phenotype on the expression rather than thereverse. For example, BMI and triglycerides gene expressioncorrelation coef ﬁcients robustly correlate with trait to expression causal effects ( r,0.09, P,1.54x10 −39and r,0.09, P,1.19x10−34, respectively), but not detectably with expression to trait effects.Genes implicated by revTWMR con ﬁrmed known associations, such as rheumatoid arthritis and Crohn ’s disease induced changes in expression of TRBV and GBP2 , respectively. They also revealed intricate feedback loops controlling the levels of clinical biomar kers. For instance, we observed that high levels of HDL cholesterol lower the expression of genes involved in cholesterol biosynthesis (SQLE, FDFT1 ) and increase the expression of genes responsible for cholesterol ef ﬂux (ABCA1, ABCG1 ), two key molecular pathways in determining HDL levels. In conclusion, our method disentangles the gene expression phenotype relationship and reveals that complex traits have more pronounced impact on gene expressionthan the reverse, demonstrating that studies comparing thetranscriptome of cases and controls are more prone to reveal disease induced gene expression changes rather than disease causing ones.",2021

Aim: Accurate penetrance of monogenic disorders is often unknown due to a phenotype ﬁrst approach to genetic testing. We use a genotype ﬁrst approach in large scale exome sequenced cohorts to accurately estimate penetrance of monogenic diabetes variants. We contrast the two commonest causes of monogenicdiabetes, HNF1A MODY which causes an age related progressive diabetes and GCK MODY, which causes life long mild hyperglycaemia. Method: We identi ﬁedHNF1A and GCK pathogenic variants in clinically selected probands ( N,1742) and three clinically unselected cohorts with different background rates of diabetes: family members of the proband ( N,2192;51% diabetes), a hospital based Geisinger cohort, ( N,132,194;24% diabetes) and a population based UK Biobank cohort ( N,198,748;6% diabetes). We used age of diabetes onset as disease outcome for HNF1A MODY and raised glucose (HbA1c ≥6%/fasting glucose ≥6 mmol/L) forGCK MODY. Results: ForHNF1A MODY , the penetrance of diabetes was 98% in the probands at age 40. This reduced to 86% in family members, 49% in the Geisinger study, and 32% in the UK Biobank(allP<3x10 −9vs. proband). The consistency of hazard ratios across studies suggested that the variation in background rate of diabetes could explain the variation in penetrance (family members: 11 [95%CI:8 14]; Geisinger: 7.6 [4 16]; UK Biobank 15.6[8 24,], P,0.4). In contrast, for GCK MODY, penetrance of mild hyperglycaemia was similar in all four cohorts (94%, 93%, 86%, 89% respectively, P>0.05) and showed remarkably similar HbA1c (6.4% [95%CI:6.3 6.4], 6.6 [6.5 6.7], 6.6 [6.2 6.9], 6.5 [6.4 6.6]respectively) despite the substantial variation in background rate of diabetes and HbA1c across cohorts. Conclusion: Ascertainment context is crucial when interpreting the consequences of monogenic disorders variants for age relatedvariably penetrant disorders.",2021

Cordioli: None. S. Jukarainen: None. T. Kiiskinen: None. S.,Ripatti: None. A.

Many demographic and socioeconomic factors may playa role in determining adherence, however, there have been fewinvestigations on the potential effects of genetic variation on drug adherence. By leveraging genetic data from the FinnGen study ( N ,260,405), data from Finnish nation wide health registries and the drug purchase registry (59,605,493 total purchases), weprovide a systematic investigation of adherence determinants across multiple medications. For each individual drug trajectory, we de ﬁned adherence as the ratio between the total purchased quantity and the total days of purchasing. For each medication, we run a GWAS of adherence and estimated its genetic correlation (rg) with 27 publicly availabletraits. Overall, these results suggest that adherence is related tobehavioural aspects. For example, higher adherence to statins resulted in association with a higher educational attainment level(rg,0.23, P,1.6x10 3) and a lower risk tolerance (rg , 0.41, P, 1x10 4), while self rated health showed a positive correlation with adherence to blood pressure medications (rg ,0.24, P,3.7x10 3). This study provides better insights into the factors affecting adherence and allows for a better identi ﬁcation of patients at high risk of non adherence in drug taking.",2021
 Revealing the recent demographic history of Europe via haplotype sharing in the UK Biobank Edmund H,C17.6,E.H. Gilbert: None. G.L.

Haplotype sharing has recently been successfully leveraged to interrogate ﬁne scale genetic structure revealing the impact of speci ﬁc historical events on the human genetic landscape, particularly in Europe. However, the study of population structure in Europe has been largely limited to western Europe restricting our understanding of the genetic landscape and demographichistory of the wider European continent. Utilising haplotypes from ~5,000 individuals within the UK Biobank with selected European birthplace and ancestry phenotypes, we sought to applyhaplotype and Identity by Descent (IBD) analyses to investigatethe landscape of recent demographic history across Europe, from Portugal in the west, to Russia in the east. We report analysis of the broad genetic structure of Europe using haplotype based methods. We highlight novel results fromeastern Europe, the Balkans, and Malta ﬁnding eastern Europe a crossroads of different European ancestry clines, and footprints of genetic isolation in Malta. Obtaining genetically homogenousgroups with clustering analysis, we detected IBD segment sharing within and between genetic regions of Europe. We demonstrate region speci ﬁc demographic trajectories captured by IBD sharing, showing a demographically heterogenous landscape acrossEurope. Finally, we further investigate the ancestry of previously under reported populations using haplotype based modelling methodology, further quantifying ancestral components withIBD sharing patterns to investigate demographic histories. Our work aids the understanding of the general haplotypic landscape of Europe, identifying regions with sharing patterns of interest to gene mapping efforts, describing the varied demo graphic history across the continent, and ﬁnally highlighting the potential use of the UK Biobank as a reference of European variation beyond Britain.",2021

To promote the development of novel, ef ﬁcient therapeutic approaches, it is ﬁrst necessary to unravel the genomic architecture of osteoar thritis. Here, we investigate genome wide DNA methylation from macroscopically intact (low grade) and degraded (high grade) osteoarthritis cartilage, as well as synovium tissue from a total of98 knee osteoarthritis patients undergoing joint replacementsurgery. We conducted an epigenome wide association study (EWAS) comparing matched low grade and high grade osteoar thritis cartilage within the same individual to identify methylationmarkers of cartilage degeneration. We further constructed random forest based classi ﬁers of cartilage degeneration. We generated genome wide cis methylation QTL (mQTL) maps in synovium, low grade, and high grade osteoarthritis cartilage. We used Mendelianrandomization (MR) and colocalisation to identify epigenetic mechanisms mediating the effects of genotype on disease risk. The EWAS discovered 15,328 differentially methylated sites and2,477 regions linked to cartilage degeneration. These regions weremapped to genes enriched in 76 Gene Ontology terms including a potential novel process linked to epithelium development. Machine learning models distinguished low grade from high grade osteoarthritis cartilage with high accuracy (90%). The mQTL analysis revealed widespread associations between genetic variants and methylation in all three examined tissues. Further more, mQTLs colocalised with 20 osteoarthritis associated geneticloci, potentially elucidating their regulatory targets. Applying MR identi ﬁed 19 methylation loci with a putative causal in ﬂuence on osteoarthritis. This study presents the largest EWAS for kneecartilage degeneration, the ﬁrst genome wide mQTL map in knee OA affected tissues, and evidence for a role of epigenetic mechanisms in osteoarthritis.",2021

The human genome can be partitioned into domains of regulatory elements necessary to control gene expression. Previously, weidenti ﬁed cis regulatory domains based on coordinated chromatin activity, offering a great insight into the regulatory organization of the human genome. However, chromatin data are not availablefor most human genetics ’datasets. Therefore, to characterize cis regulatory organization based on gene expression and genotypes, we used whole blood RNA seq from 335 twins (MultiMuTHER study, TwinsUK). The longitudinal study design also permitsexploration of the temporal dynamics of cis coordinated expres sion patterns. We identi ﬁed 3,979 dynamic co expressed cis gene pairs (COPs) in whole blood with a signi ﬁcant longitudinal change in correlation. The majority of pairs (51%) shows decreasingpositive correlation and only 6% decreasing negative correlation over time, while 32% show longitudinal increase in negative and 11% in positive correlation. Dynamic COPs involved 3,335 uniquegenes, of which one third were differentially expressed (DE) overtime. However, 45% of dynamic COPs do not contain any DE gene, suggesting that their correlation dynamics is due to change of variance rather than of mean gene expression. We observed thatdecreasing/increasing correlation often coincides with decreasing/increasing variance of expression over time, respectively. More over, we assessed the temporal changes in genetic regulation by identifying longitudinal eQTLs, i.e., SNPs associated with geneexpression change. The longitudinal eQTL genes were signi ﬁ cantly enriched in dynamic COPs, identifying genetic regulatory elements modulating dynamics of coordinated cis regulation. We plan to assess the genetic correlation of our dynamic COPs using the twin relatedness to disentangle genetic from environ mental regulatory factors.",2021

Introduction: Repeated genomic elements (RGE) make up more than half of the human genome, yet the understanding of theirbiological function and behavior is still elusive. Some of them however have been shown to play major roles in coding genes regulation, especially during development and cell typedifferentiation. Material and methods : We used single cell or single nuclei sequencing, followed by our in house protocol for RGE quanti ﬁca tion, to characterize their expression in a developmental atlas thatincludes multiple time points from E10 to P6 in the mouse forebrain and hindbrain, as well as several human fetal samples. Results : Our approach allowed us to identify repeats families with de ﬁned expression dynamics in some cell types and developmental windows. For example, Long Interspersed Nuclear Elements 1 (LINE1) retrotransposons show a consistent increase of67 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87expression along differentiation of neuronal lineages. This dynamic is speci ﬁc, since Short Interspersed Nuclear Elements, which are comparable from the technical point of view, display a rather constant pro ﬁle of expression. Conclusions : Our pipeline for RGE quanti ﬁcation allows us to reliably detect repeat families in single cell data across develop ment. Our results are consistent with the known role of some RGE in cell type differentiation. We will discuss potential biologicalprocess that may be driving the dynamics we observe and explorethe technical feasibility of pinpointing speci ﬁc roles for given elements. Our strategy builds up promising avenues towards a better understanding of the functional consequences of this large,unexplored fraction of the genome at the single cell level.

Background: The 100,000 Genomes Project (100kGP) delivered whole genome sequencing (WGS) for rare disease and cancer in ahybrid research clinical setting. In this mixed methods long itudinal study, we assessed the attitudes, understanding and experiences of participants consenting for WGS for rare diseasediagnosis. Methods: Participants (patients, parents, relatives) taking part in the 100kGP at six hospitals were recruited. A survey at time 1measured participants ’(n,504) knowledge, attitude and decisio nal con ﬂict about WGS. At time 2 (at least 12 months later), a survey measured knowledge, attitude, decisional regret and psychological outcomes. Participants who received a main ﬁnding were invited to a qualitative interview. Results : Of 296 survey participants, attitudes remained positive and knowledge remained stable over time. Few reported decisional regret and 26% had received main ﬁndings with minimal negative psychological impacts. Interviews from 38 participants further substantiated this, though distress was greater for parents than patients. Results could bring relief and gratitudeas well as disappointment and worry, and though a diagnosis didnot impact clinical care for many, social, practical, and emotional bene ﬁts were observed.

As part of the Dutch DNA dialogues, weorganized two dialogues to enable formation and assembly ofchildren ’s opinions on HGGE.70 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Methods: Twenty two healthy, and 12 children affected by (hereditary) disease took part in two dialogues (age 8 12 years). Psychological safety was established by involving play and including attachment ﬁgures, such as peers. Furthermore, connection with the children was established by an introductiongame. The adult moderator pretended not to know anything about the particular subject and adopted an interested and curious attitude, to stimulate children ’s critical thinking. Dialogue was fueled by age appropriate scenarios, ﬁtting the concept of ‘let’s pretend ’play. Results: Children highly appreciated the acknowledgement that their opinions mattered and stated perceiving themselves asessential stakeholders of this topic. Whereas parents oftenstressed feeling responsible for giving their child the best possible health, children put more emphasis on their right to self determination. Most children expressed that HGGE was accep table only for severe genetic disease. Most children also expressed resistance against the idea of parents having altered their DNA. Discussion: Children are essential yet often overlooked stakeholders in many facets of the HGE debate. Despite therelatively small groups, we found that child perspectives differ from adult perspectives, thus contributing important insights for societal alignment of HGGE.",2021

Introduction: Organoids are a valuable model for cancer research and drug screening since they incorporate environmental condi tions (hypoxia and lack of nutrients in the tumor core respect toareas close to blood vessels) and comprise a heterogeneous cell population differently responding to the tumor micro niche. To study this complex model, the Single Cell Analysis (SCA) approachfor transcriptomic pro ﬁling has become mandatory. Materials and Methods: Organoids were obtained from 4 breast tumor cases by partial mechanic/enzymatic tissue dissocia tion, resulting in small portions recapitulating the parental organstructure. Organoids were separated from original tissue byﬁltration, dissociated into single cells and processed for SCA using 10X Genomics technology. SC data were analysed with 10xGe nomics CellRanger, Seurat, Monocle and our developed toolscMUFFIN, which includes CNV estimation. Results: SCA approach sorted out the cellular complexity of the breast cancer organoids revea ling the existence of different populations related to speci ﬁc cell sub types of the normal mammary gland (basal, secretory luminal and hormone responsive luminal cells) and tumor peculiar populations, showing distinct CNV proﬁle. We performed differential expression analysis comparing thesame cell types in tumor and normal breast organoids and identi ﬁed cell type speci ﬁc genes and pathways involved in tumorigenesis. Pseudotemporal algorithms revealed trajectories and lineage hierarchy among populations, thus allowing to identify precursorcells and their speci ﬁce x p r e s s i o np r o ﬁle. Conclusions: Single cell transcriptomics of breast cancer organoids revealed pathways active in speci ﬁc cancer cells that play pivotal roles in tumor progression, providing candidatetargets for more accurate therapeutic approaches.

Al Jazrawe:71," Introduction: Desmoid tumors are soft tissue neoplasms strictly driven by Wnt signaling network hyperactivation and can occur sporadic (harboring activating missense mutations in the CTNNB1 gene), or can be associated with Gardner ’s syndrome due to germline loss of function mutations in the tumor suppressor gene APC. Despite the clearly de ﬁned genetic etiology and the strict and unique implication of the Wnt/ β catenin pathway, no systemic speci ﬁc molecular therapy for the tumors exists. Materials and Methods: We developed a fast and semi high throughput genetic Xenopus tropicalis model for identifying and/ or characterizing drug targets for desmoid tumors. The platformalso permits pre clinical assessment of candidate therapeutic compounds. The methodology uses multiplexed CRISPR/Cas9 based genome editing by simultaneously targeting a tumorsuppressor gene ( apc ) and a candidate dependency gene. It thereby exploits the fact that for a genetic dependency biallelic frameshift mutations in this gene will never be recovered from sampled tumors. Results: Using an in vivo negative selection screen we identi ﬁed the epigenetic regulator EZH2 and the transcription factor CREB3L1 as genetic dependencies for desmoid tumors. Interestingly, inhibition of the enzymatic activity of EZH2 by the compoundTazemetostat (Tazverik) reduced the size of established desmoidtumors in the Xenopus model as monitored by MRI. Using in vitro models of patient derived desmoid cells, the mode of action of Tazemetostat was further investigated, indicating a direct effect onWnt pathway activity. Since Tazemetostat is well tolerated and FDA approved for treatment of epithelioid carcinomas, it could offer prospects for treating patients with desmoid tumors.Research support: DTRF and SOS Desmoïde.",2021

M.," The ever growing interest towards noncoding cis regulatory variants as cancer drivers is currently hampered by numerous challenges and limitations of variant prioritization and interpreta tion methods and tools. To overcome these limitations, we focused on active cis regulatory elements (aCREs) to design a customized panel for deep sequencing of 56 neuroblastomatumor and normal DNA sample pairs. CREs were de ﬁned by a reanalysis of H3K27ac ChiP seq peaks of 25 neuroblastoma cell lines. This provided a small subset of genomic regions with evident regulatory functions in which to search for drivermutations. We tested these regions for an excess of somaticmutations and assessed the statistical signi ﬁcance with a global approach accounting for chromatin accessibility and replication timing. Additional validation was provided by analyzing wholegenome sequences of 151 neuroblastomas. For the mutated regions, we determined their candidate target genes through HiC data analysis. We identi ﬁed a signi ﬁcant excess of somatic mutations in aCREs of diverse genes including IPO7 ,HAND2 , and ARID3A . A gene expression signature built on basis of these three, and nearby, interacting genes strongly correlated with negative prognostic markers and low survival rates of patients affected byneuroblastoma. Moreover, we observed a convergence ofbiological functions of the target genes of mutated aCREs and transcription factors with binding motifs altered by mutations towards processes related to embryonic development andimmune system response. Our strategy led us to identify somatic mutations in regulatory elements that collectively can drive neuroblastoma onset.",2021

Chromosome 8p (chr8p) is frequently deleted in a variety of cancer entities and correlates with poor patient survival inhepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). The extent and complexity of chr8p loss of heterozygosity (8pLOH) suggests that multiple genes with tumor suppressive properties can be affected by this large scale deletion. Co suppression of multiple genes might synergis tically promote tumor growth. Exploiting the CRISPR Cas9technology, we introduced genomic deletions of chr8p into HCC cells resulting in distinct 8pLOH clones. Successful chromosome editing was con ﬁrmed by PCR, Sanger sequencing and ﬂuores cence in situ hybridization. The gene expression in wildtype and8pLOH cells was determined by RT qPCR and RNA seq. A genome wide CRISPR Cas9 knockout screen substantiated gene depen dencies speci ﬁc for 8pLOH harboring tumors. Gene set enrich ment analysis of differentially expressed genes in RNA seq as wellas TCGA data identi ﬁed major deregulations in migration and extracellular matrix signaling upon chr8p loss. Subsequent functional assays revealed increased metastasizing potential in8pLOH cells which may account for poor prognosis. Investigation of gene dependencies speci ﬁc for 8pLOH tumors unveiled the tight junction aPKC PAR3 PAR6 complex as novel syntheticlethality making 8p deleted tumors strongly susceptible forinhibition of these proteins. We established a model system to study large scale genomic deletions and loss of heterozygosity in liver cancer. By integrating RNA seq and CRISPR Cas9 screeningdata, we showed that 8pLOH may increase patient mortality andinhibition of the aPKC PAR3 PAR6 complex may be a new therapeutic option in patients with 8pLOH.

Introduction: tRNA deregulation causes Protein Synthesis Errors (PSEs) and is associated to worse patient prognosis. In yeast, PSE levels, driven by tRNA deregulation increase genomic alterations. PSE are naturally increased in tumors and can foster tumor growth.Therefore, we hypothesized that tRNA deregulation may contribute to the increased genome instability observed in tumors. Materials and Methods: H460 cells with tRNASeroverexpres sion (tRNASerOE) and Mock (control) were inoculated nude mice as described in the following table to study the effect of tRNASerOE alone and in the presence of a trigger: Time point 1Time point 2Time point 3 Naive Vehicle Cisplatin Vehicle CisplatinMock tRNA SerOE Mock tRNASer OEtRNASer OEMock Mock tRNASer OEMock tRNASer OE 5 5 5 5 5 555 5 5 DNA and protein were extracted for WES and proteomics. Results: The tumor mutation burden remained unchanged along time, however, tumors with tRNASerOE treated twice with cisplatin, showed a higher mutation burden. Although in Time point1 tumors have a similar number of variants, in Timepoints2&3, tRNA SerOE tumors display two times more variants than Mock tumors regardless of treatment. These variants are mostly low impact variants but they are predicted to have impact in distinct72 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87pathways. For instance, tRNASerOE exclusive variants will favor proliferation and therapy resistance, which is in line with the phenotypes observed and the proteomics data. Conclusion: tRNASerOE increases the tumor mutation burden and the variants detected favor tumor growth, proving tRNAderegulation is enough to induce adaptive mutations in the genome.

Gene fusions arising from chromoso mal rearrangements represent more than 50% of common driverevents in cALL. As recently discovered, these fusion genes can generate linear RNA or fusion circularRNAs (f circRNAs) via back splicing of exons. These f circRNAs are implicated in malignanttransformation, cell survival, and therapeutic resistance. Apartfrom their relevance for cancer biology, f circRNAs are also promising biomarkers for liquid biopsies due to their increased stability relative to linear transcripts. Therefore, we propose tocharacterize f circRNAs in cALL, which might allow a more precisediagnosis and prognosis. Here, we identi ﬁed a novel f circRNA generated from the MLL AF4 fusion gene ( f circMLL AF4 ) by screening leukemia cell lines carrying common rearrangements using primers diverging fromthe breakpoint of translocations. Functional studies through gain of function strategy showed that f circMLL AF4 promotes cell migration in leukemia cells, but has little effect on cellproliferation. We also found that it confers resistance to chemotherapeutic drugs commonly used to treat leukemia. Using a bead based multiplexed immunoassay system, we determinedthat f circMLL AF4 overexpression decreased phosphorylation of p38 protein, involved in apoptosis Interestingly, we also demon strate the presence of f circMLL AF4 in extracellular vesicles, pointing to a biomarker potential. In conclusion, our study not only expand the current knowledge of molecular mechanisms underlying leukemia progression, but also provides potential diagnostic and therapeutic new targets.

Wehave recently developed a gene therapy approach for STGD1which relies on the use of two adeno associated viral vectors (AAV) each encoding for one of the two halves of the ABCA473 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87protein ﬂanked by split inteins, which catalyze trans splicing of the two ABCA4 half proteins following AAV administration. We have shown that subretinal administration of the AAV intein vectors results in precise reconstitution of the full length ABCA4protein and in therapeutic ef ﬁcacy in Abca4−/−mice. However, the mouse retina largely differs from that of humans both in terms of size and retinal architecture. Given the similarity between the swine and human retina, we have recently generated pigs throughsomatic cell nuclear transfer from primary ﬁbroblasts in which ABCA4 has been knock out (KO) using CRISPR/Cas9. We have found that ABCA4 KO pigs have increased lipofuscin accumulation in the retinal pigmented epithelium region, as it also occurs inSTGD1 patients macula, up to 36 months, the longest time pointevaluated. In addition, subretinal delivery of AAV ABCA4 intein vectors in ABCA4 KO pigs results in ef ﬁcient reconstitution of the ABCA4 protein at 2 months post injection.

" Tasimelteon Safely and Effectively Improves Sleep in Smith Magenis Syndrome: a Double Blind Randomized Trial Followed by an Open Label Extension Christos Polymeropoulos Vanda Pharmaceuticals, Washington DC, DC, USA",C21.3,C. Polymeropoulos: A. Employment (full or part time); Modest;,Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc..," Smith Magenis Syndrome (SMS; OMIM #182290) is a rare genetic disorder that results from an interstitial deletion of 17p11.2 and, in rare cases, from a retinoic acid induced 1 ( RAI1) gene variant (Slager et al 2003). Individuals with SMS present with a distinctpattern of mild to moderate intellectual disability, delayed speechand language skills and, almost uniformly, signi ﬁcant sleep disturbances. Patients exhibit low overall melatonin concentra tions and abnormal timing of peak plasma melatonin concentra tions. To assess the ef ﬁcacy of tasimelteon, a melatonin receptor agonist, to improve sleep in SMS, a 9 week, double blind, randomized, two period crossover study was conducted at four clinical centers. Genetically con ﬁrmed SMS patients, aged 3 to 39, with sleep complaints participated in the study. Over three years, ﬁfty two patients were screened and twenty ﬁve patients completed the randomized portion of the study. Improvementof sleep quality (DDSQ50) signi ﬁcantly improved over placebo (0.4, p,0.0139) and total sleep time (DDTST50) also improved (18.5 min, p,0.0556). Average sleep quality (0.3, p,0.0155) and actigraphy based total sleep time (21.1 min, p,0.0134) improved signi ﬁcantly. Patients treated for ≥ 90 days in the open label study showed persistent ef ﬁcacy. Tasimelteon safely and effectively improved sleep in SMS. The 17p11.2 deletion encompasses RAI1, leading to haploinsuf ﬁciency, which is considered the primary cause for most features of SMS, includingdysregulation of the molecular clock via its effect on CLOCK expression. The results of this study suggest that treatment with a circadian regulator can, in part, ameliorate the circadian de ﬁcien cies caused by RAI1 haploinsuf ﬁciency.",2021

Aim: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a hereditary ectopic calciﬁcation disorder characterized by deposition of calcium crystals in skin, eyes and blood vessels. Recently, the DNA damage response (DDR), in particular poly(ADP ribose) polymerase 1(PARP1) activation, was shown to be involved in aberrantmineralization raising the hypothesis that dysfunctional DDR/ PARP1 signaling contributes to PXE pathogenesis. Methods: Expression analysis of DDR targets, PARP1 effectors and calci ﬁca tion markers was performed on PXE patient derived and healthycontrol ﬁbroblasts using qPCR, western blot and enzyme activity assays; before and after treatment with the PARP1 inhibitor minocycline. Effect of minocycline treatment on calcium deposi tion was evaluated in vitro and in abcc6a−/−zebra ﬁsh. Results: DDR targets PARP1, p21, p53 and ATM were signi ﬁcantly upregulated in PXE while the DDR inhibitor SIRT1 was suppressed. PARP1 effectors STAT1/3, IL 6, TET1 and RUNX2were also upregulated with decreased expression of the RUNX2 antagonist microRNA 204. Minocycline signi ﬁcantly attenuated p21, p53, ATM and the PARP1 STAT1/3 TET1 RUNX2 axis leadingto reduced levels of ALPL, MSX2, CTGF, MMP2 and BMP2 andpreventing aberrant mineralization in vitro. Minocycline treated abcc6a−/−zebra ﬁsh showed a 60% reduction in ectopic calciﬁcation compared to untreated controls. Conclusion: We demonstrated for the ﬁrst time the involve ment of dysfunctional DDR and PARP1 signaling in PXE showing that excessive activation of DDR/PARP1 evokes a STAT driven cascade with upregulation of the epigenetic modi ﬁer TET1 and pro calcifying transcription factor RUNX2.

Introduction: Patients affected by the rare connective tissue disorder vascular Ehlers Danlos syndrome (vEDS) are at increasedrisk for fatal aortic ruptures. Recently, we have established an objective read out system for measuring the biomechanical integrity of the murine thoracic aorta, allowing us to identifynew uses for market approved drugs (cheap with high level ofknowledge) in the medical treatment of vEDS. Materials and Methods: Mice modelling vEDS were treated with the beta blockers celiprolol or bisoprolol, the angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker losartan, or the HMG CoA reductase inhibitor pravastatin for 4 weeks. 1.5 mm long sections of the74 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87ascending and descending murine thoracic aorta were mounted on a tissue puller and uniaxially stretched until rupture. For the tested drugs, we considered pharmacogenetic information from the PharmGKB website and DPWG/CPIC guidelines. Results: The rupture force (mN) was signi ﬁcantly lower in untreated heterozygous compared to wild type mice, while celiprolol and pravastatin but neither bisoprolol nor losartan increased the thoracic aortic rupture force in heterozygous mice.While losartan and bisoprolol undergo cytochrome P450 mediated metabolism and the plasma concentration of pravasta tin may be affected by SLCO1B1 , celiprolol is secreted unmetabolized. Conclusions: Unlike losartan and bisoprolol, celiprolol and pravastatin have added value regarding the strengthening of the weakened murine vEDS aorta. Despite this potential added value of pravastatin, celiprolol prevails due to its favourable pharmaco kinetic pro ﬁle and, hence, should currently be the medical therapy of choice for vEDS, until further evidence emerges. Our results exemplify that drug repositioning/repurposing can be a powerfulsource to identify old drugs for potential new therapeuticapplications in rare diseases.",2021

Clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential (CHIP), the age related acquisition and expansion ofhematopoietic stem cells due to leukemogenic driver mutations,increases risk for both hematologic malignancy and coronary artery disease (CAD). Since increased in ﬂammation is hypothe sized to be both a cause and consequence of CHIP, wehypothesized that PLWH have a greater prevalence of CHIP.Here, we searched for CHIP in multi ethnic cases from the Swiss HIV Cohort Study (SHCS, n,600) and controls from the Atherosclerosis Risk in the Communities study (ARIC, n, 8,111) from blood DNA derived exome sequences. First, weobserved that HIV is associated wi th increased CHIP prevalence, both in the whole study populat ion and in a subset of 230 cases and 1002 controls with similar s equence coverage and matched by age, sex and ethnicity (SHCS 7%, ARIC 3%, p,0.005). Second, unlike in controls, ASXL1 was th e most commonly mutated CHIP gene among PLWH. Third, we observed a positive association ofduration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) with CHIP prevalence.Among people with HIV, the rate of somatic mutagenesis may be increased, the ﬁtness landscape of hematopoietic stem cells changed or the effective pop ulation size of blood cells decreased. Whether other mechanisms are responsible forincreased CHIP prevalence among PLWH requires further study. Altogether, we propose that CHIP may be one mechanism through which PLWH are at incre ased biological aging and risk for CAD.",2021

Furthermore, we identify transcription factor binding sites within the 56bp of theTXNL4A promoter affected by the type 1 and type 2 Δ34, and luciferase assays identi ﬁed a 22bp repeated motif essential for TXNL4A expression within this region. We propose that additional variants affecting critical transcription factor binding nucleotideswithin the 22bp repeated motif could be relevant to BMKSetiology. Overall, we have expanded the genotypic spectrum of BMKS and highlighted the importance of considering non coding variation in analysis of whole genome sequencing data toimprove diagnostic yield.

C.," Introduction: Loss of function variants in MYCN have been associated to the Feingold syndrome characterized by, amongstother signs: microcephaly and absent/hypoplastic middle phalanx. MYCN function relies on two sequential phosphoryla tions, in position 62 (Serine) and then 58 (Threonine). Depho sphorylation of Ser62 and subseq uent phosphorylation of Thr58 leads to proteasomal degradation. We report two patients with de novo missense variants in MYCN and ventriculomegaly, macrocephaly and postaxial polydactyly. Materials and methods: We performed trio exome sequencing and data sharing. Western Blot and phosphorylation assay were performed on HEK293 cells transfected with plasmids, after site directed mutagenesis of the patientsvariants. A knock in mouse was generated to assess andcompare the phenotype. Results: Trio exome sequencing combined with data sharing allowed the identi ﬁcation of 2 patients harboring rare de novo missense variant in MYCN . The core phenotype included: ventriculomegaly, macrocephaly and postaxial polydactyly. In cellular analysis, the level of phosphorylation of Thr58 wasdrastically reduced compared to wild type and the level of MYCNwas increased in both mutant MYCN proteins. The knock in mouse also displayed the same biological anomalies. In addition, the knock in mouse presented with postaxial polydactyly as with thecase of two patients. Conclusions: We report 2 patients with ventriculomegaly, macrocephaly, postaxial polydactyly and a concordant knock in mouse model. The molecular mechanism is underlined by a Thr58phosphorylation defect leading to an accumulation of MYCN. Thisnovel phenotype, caused by GoF variants in MYCN , leads to a mirror syndrome (at the phenotypic and molecular level) of the Feingold syndrome.",2021

M.,"Introduction: Primary or idiopathic Osteoporosis (IO) is a rare bone disease with an increased risk of fractures. Several genes were identi ﬁed as involved in IO, but many cases are still unexplained. Therefore, our aim is to identify new genes related toIO and to analyze the function of the variants. Materials and Methods: A CRISPR/Cas9 approach was used to generate mutated osteosarcoma cells (U2OS) for functional analysis. Results: Exome sequencing revealed variants in WNT11 in two IO patients with fractures. Heterozygous variants were found in a 4 year old boy with a loss of function de novo mutation (NM_004626.2:c.677_678dup p.Leu227Glyfs 22) and in a 48 year old woman with a missense mutation (NM_004626.2:c.217G>A p.Ala73Thr). Heterozygous WNT11 mutant (32bp deletion) osteosar coma cells, expressing both the wild type and the mutant protein, showed a ~30% decrease in proliferation and a ~80% decrease inosteoblast differentiation. The mutant cells displayed reduced expression of genes within the Wnt non canonical and canonical pathways. When mutated cells were treated with the WNT11recombinant protein, we obtained a recovery in the proliferationand in several target gene ’s expressions. Results from RNAseq using the patient ’s primary ﬁbroblast allowed us to identify new WNT11 targets involved in bone remodeling. Among those, weidenti ﬁed genes involved in the extracellular matrix synthesis (MMPs), osteoblast function (SNX10, RSPOs, SOST, MEOX1, SMOC1) and activation (FGFR2 and FGF10). Conclusions: this is the ﬁrst time that variants in WNT11 are described as related to any disease, most specially osteoporosis, by inhibiting the canonical and non canonical pathways.

Most of these disorders have been linked to pathogenic variants in genesencoding proteins required for glycosaminoglycan (GAG)biosynthesis. We identi ﬁed homozygous mutations in SLC10A7 in six individuals with a skeletal dysplasia with dislocations and amelogenesis imperfecta. The aim of the project is to clarify theimpact of the GAG biosynthesis impairment on the endochon dral ossi ﬁcation process using a Slc10a7 deﬁcient mouse model that mimics the human bone ph enotype. Methods: Exome sequencing, PCR, immunohistology. Results: Analyzing mouse femurs, we showed a signi ﬁcant reduction of the growth plate length associated with a reduced Safranin O staining in embryonic and juvenile null mice compared to controls. In particular, null mice showed a signi ﬁcant and progressive reduction of the hypertrophic zone during develop ment and a signi ﬁcantly reduced type X collagen expression, speci ﬁc for mature chondrocytes. Type II collagen expression was unchanged throughout the growth plate of null mice at all ages,but was reduced, as type I collagen expression, in the trabecular77 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87bone. We did not ﬁnd any signi ﬁcant difference in chondrocyte proliferation but the apoptosis was signi ﬁcantly increased in null hypertrophic chondrocytes compared to controls.

Orsola Malpighi Hospital, Bologna, Ireland,10University of Leipzig Medical Center, Leipzig, Germany. Introduction: Autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) is caused primarily by variants in PKD1 , and PKD2 . Disease severity ranges from in utero onset to preserved kidney function into old age. It is well established that the type of diagnostic ADPKD variant can in ﬂuence disease severity and variants have been identi ﬁed which modify disease severity or can cause autosomal recessive disease. Here we demonstrate, using robust statistical analyses, that rare variant burden in the gene PKD1 contributes to ADPKD phenotypic variability. Methods: Patients ( n,449) with an established genetic diagnosis of ADPKD due to a pathogenic variant in PKD1 or PKD2 were recruited from ﬁve international centres (Dublin Ireland, Genomics England/ Royal Free Hospital London UK,Leipzig Germany, Bologna Spain, Sydney Australia). The associa tion between the presence of rare, additional PKD1 variants and age at end stage renal disease (ESRD) was tested using a Cox mixed effect regression model. Results: The presence of rare, additional bioinformatically inferred damaging PKD1 variants was associated with a lower age at ESRD, in patients with an established genetic diagnosis (hazardratio: 1.61 (1.14 2.27), p,5.9x10 −3). Conclusions: Rare, additional bioinformatically inferred dama ging PKD1 variants impact disease severity in ADPKD. Further work is required to evaluate the impact of rare variation in other PKD related genes. These ﬁndings have important implications for patient counselling and the assessment of variant pathogenicity in clinical genetics services.

R.,"Introduction: Hirschsprung disease (HSCR) is a congenital defect characterized by the absence of the enteric nervous system (ENS) in the distal colon. The ENS was long believed to be solely derived from the vagal neural crest, however trunk crest derived Schwanncell progenitors (SCPs) were found to have enteric neurogenicpotential as well. The role of SCPs in HSCR remains unexplored, therefore we aimed to determine the effect of mutations in ret, the major gene involved in HSCR, on the ENS. Methods: We optimized and performed single cell (sc)RNA sequencing on intestines isolated from 5 day old wildtype and ret mutant zebra ﬁsh to analyze their ENS. We validated our ﬁndings by live imaging in zebra ﬁsh and by immunohistochemistry using human intestinal material. Results: Based on the scRNA sequencing data, we were able to identify clusters with “differentiated neurons ”, clusters of cells that undergo neuronal commitment or differentiation and clusters of“progenitor cells ”, including SCPs. As expected, we found that ret mutant larvae lack the majority of these clusters. However, the SCP cluster was selectively persevered. We are currently investigatingwhether SCPs remain present in the aganglionic bowel of HSCRpatients. Conclusion: Our data show that SCPs in the intestine, develop independently of Ret expression. Therefore, the presence of thesecells brings new insights that could be used to develop novelintervention options for enteric neuropathies, such as HSCR.

The loss of gut homeostasis caused by an impairedimmune system hypothesised for HAEC and the susceptibility to HAEC in HSCR patients suggest a genetic background. Yet, no gene has been claimed to contribute to HAEC. We investigatedthe genetics of HAEC by omics approaches: Whole ExomeSequencing (WES) and proteomics analysis. WES on 12 HSCR patients with enterocolitis (HAEC) and 12 without (HSCR only) and replication in a panel of 65 HAEC and 105 HSCR only patients,identi ﬁed a susceptibility variant in the Oncostatin M receptor (OSMR) gene, ﬁnding allelic frequencies of 14.6% in HAEC and 5.1% in HSCR only patients, p,0.0024. The Transmission Dis equilibrium Test on 38 HAEC and 26 HSCR only trios supported anovertransmission of the variant allele to the affected patients, p, 0.01255.

PLAAT3 represents an important potential drug target as its deﬁciency in mice protects against picornavirus infection and diet induced obesity. The consequences of PLAAT3 de ﬁciency in humans are not known. Methods: Unbiased genome wide approaches including homo zygosity mapping, whole exome and genome sequencing wereapplied to identify the causal mutation in 4 patients from twoconsanguineous families with unexplained partial lipodystrophy. Lipidomics and histopathological analysis of patient WAT were performed. Results: In the ﬁrst family we identi ﬁed a homozygous 5092 bp deletion encompassing exon 2 of the PLAAT3 gene (c.16 4823_118 +167del, p.Pro6ValfsTer15) within a shared ~43 Mb homozygous region at 11q12.3. In the second family a homozygous duplicationof a single base leading to a frameshift in exon 3 of PLAAT3 (c.286dupG, p.Ala96GlyfsTer16) was observed. The patientspresented clinically with partial lipodystrophy, severe insulin resistance and hyperlipidemia. Demyelinating neuropathy and chronic pain were additional disabling features. PLAAT3 de ﬁcient WAT showed in ﬂammation, irregular adipocyte morphology and an abnormal lipidomic pro ﬁle indicative of a failure to liberate arachidonic acid (AA) from membrane phosphatidylcholines (PC) resulting in increased levels of AA containing lyso PCs (LPC).

Short read Whole Genome sequencing (WGS) affords the ef ﬁcient and accurate characterization of balanced chromosomal rearran gement (BCR) breakpoints. However, in 9 to 11% of cases, the rearrangement cannot be detected by this strategy. Among the117 BCR we studied in patients with abnormal phenotype, fourteen (11.9%) could not be detected by our current strategy that includes short read WGS, alignment against GRCh38 genome80 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87and SV detection using Breakdan cer v1.4.5. These BCRs were all reciprocal translocations, 10 of which implicated constitutive heterochromatin of chromosomes 1, 9 or 16, acrocentric short arms or pericentromeric regions. The data of these BCRs were re analyzed using 3 others bio in formatic tools (GRIDDS, LUMPY and SvABA). In parallel, eleven BCRs were further characterized using different techniques, either isolated or combined, includ ing FISH, linked read sequencing (10X Genomics), long readsequencing (PacBio, Nanopore s equencing) or optical mapping (Bionano). We were able to characterize the breakpoints at the base pair level for 11 translocations. For 10 translocations, at least one breakpoint involved highly repetitive elements such asalpha satellites, segmental duplications, satellite repeats orother poorly mapped regions. For 5/11 patients, one of the breakpoints could explain the phenotype either by gene disruption ( NLGN4 ,DYRK1A ,CAMTA1 ) or position effect ( BMP2 , SIX3). In conclusion, failure of the short read strategy is due to the implication of highly repet itive genomic regions, either absent from the reference geno me or not attributed to a unique position. The resolution of these cases are of essential forpatients ’care since we concluded to a pathogenic variant in 45% of the patients.",2021

In particular, their impact on codon usage and protein translation remains unelucidated. Inthis work, we explore the clinical signi ﬁcance of sSNVs in the Sonic Hedgehog gene ( SHH) identi ﬁed in patients affected by holopro sencephaly a developmental defect resulting from incomplete forebrain cleavage. Genetic screening was performed in 931patients and revealed 8 different SHH sSNVs, selectively enriched in our cohort as compared to healthy individuals, suggesting their role in disease etiology. We systematically assessed their deleterious impact at both transcriptional and translational levelsusing a series of in silico and in vitro approaches. Although noevidence of impact of these sSNVs on splicing, mRNA structure or miRNA regulation was found, ﬁve sSNVs were predicted to impact protein translation by introducing signi ﬁcant changes in codon usage. Cell assays demonstrated that these ﬁve sSNVs result in a signi ﬁcantly reduced expression of the SHH protein (up to 23%, p<1e^ 9). Inhibition of the proteasome rescued the protein levelsfor four out of ﬁve sSNVs, con ﬁrming their impact on protein stability and folding. Remarkably, we found a signi ﬁcantcorrelation between experimental values of protein reduction and computational measures of codon usage, indicating the relevance of our in silico predictions.

Human centromeres are composed of alpha satellite DNA hierarchically organized as highe r order repeats and epigeneti cally speci ﬁed by CENP A binding. Current evolutionary models assert that new centromeres are ﬁrst epigenetically established and subsequently acquire an al phoid array. Differently, we identi ﬁed during routine aneuploidy FISH testing a de novo insertion of alpha satellite DNA array (~100 200 kbp) from thecentromere of chromosome 18 (D18Z1) into chromosome 15q26 euchromatin. Although bound by CENP B, this locus did not acquire centromeric functionality as demonstrated by lack ofconstriction and absence of CENP A binding. We characterizedthe rearrangement by FISH and sequencing using Illumina, PacBio, and Nanopore adaptive sampling which revealed that the insertion was associated with a 2.8 kbp deletion andoccurred in the paternal germline. Notably, the site was located ~10 Mbp distal from the location where an ancestral centromere was seeded ~25 million years ago in the common ancestor ofOld World monkeys and apes. Long reads spanning eitherjunction showed that the D18Z1 higher order repeat structure was more homogeneous at the proximal end and more divergent at the distal one. The rearrangement did not disruptany gene or regulatory element and did not alter the epigeneticstatus of the surrounding region , consistent with the absence of phenotypic consequences in the carrier. This case demonstrates a likely rare but new class of structural variation that we namealpha satellite insertion. It also expands our knowledge aboutthe evolutionary life cycle of centromeres, suggesting that alphoid arrays can relocate near vestigial centromeric sites. SNSF_31003A_182632, NIH_HG010169G.

Chromothripsis commonly observed in cancer may also occur as a rare event in the germline. An important step towards a more thorough understanding, which rearrangements have a patho genic effect, is the precise mapping of breakpoints and thereconstruction of the shattered chromosomes. Here, we investigated 12 cases with complex genomic rearrangements in the germline, including chromothripsis, bycombining short read and long read PacBio WGS with Hi C.Large scale genomic rearrangements were readily identi ﬁed in Hi C interactions maps, allowing for an independent assessment of breakpoint calls from the WGS methods. This resulted in thedetection of >300 large scale genomic junctions in total (4 to 62per sample). Additionally, Hi C was effective in guiding the reconstruction of rearranged chromosomes telomere to telo mere. The Hi C derived 3D chromatin structure of the mutantchromosomes showed in more than 2/3 of the instances a reshuf ﬂing of topologically associated domains (TADs). To investigate the effect of these rearrangements on generegulation, we used phased RNA seq data generated frompatients ’lymphoblastoid cells. For most of the cases, less than 1/ 4 of the detectable genes + 500kb around breakpoints showsigni ﬁcant expression differences between the alleles, which are partly associated with gene disr uptions. The fraction of genes with expression differences dec reases quickly with increasing distance to the breakpoint. This indicates that the genome canbe relatively resistant against the effects of SVs and that even large scale genomic rearrangements appear to be tolerated to a surprising extend.

Introduction: The 22q11.2 Deletion Syndrome (22q11.2DS), the most common genomic disorder, is thought to be caused by non allelic homologous recombination between low copy repeats on chromosome 22 (LCR22s). Due to their complexity, LCR22s haveremained elusive for sequencing and as a consequence, the mechanistic origin has never been charted. The identi ﬁcation of a mosaic 22q11.2DS individual provides a unique opportunity toinfer the deletion origin since both non rearranged and rear ranged alleles are present. Materials and Methods: cfDNA analysis, arrayCGH, SNParray, and 22q11.2del FISH un covered an aberrant maternal proﬁle in the 22q11.2 locus. An LCR22 speci ﬁcﬁber FISH test was performed to assemble the haplotypes and results were validated by Bionano optical mapping and targeted interphase F I S H .F a m i l ym e m b e r sw e r et e s t e df o rt h ep r e s e n c eo frearrangements. Nanopore sequencing is used to map the (rearranged) LCR22s. Results: Genetic testing detected a LCR22 A/B deletion (1.5Mb) in 50% of the white blood cells. Haplotype assemblyand interphase FISH uncovered an inversion between LCR22 A/ B in the cells without the deletion. The inversion occurred de novo and was not transmitted to the fetus. Long read sequencing is applied to map the LCR22s, currently still gaps inthe human reference genome, and pinpoint the rearrangement breakpoints. Conclusions: Inversions have never been described in 22q11.2DS and somatic mosaicism is rare. This inversion probablyrenders the locus unstable, driving the somatic deletion. Presence of the inversion and deletion allele in the same individual provides a unique opportunity to map the LCR22s and identify the cis acting elements driving 22q11 deletions.

Introduction: Aminoglycosides are ﬁrst choice antibiotics for empirical treatment of neonatal sepsis. The m.1555A>G variant predisposes to profound ototoxicity after aminoglycoside admin istration. Current genotyping takes days, an unacceptable delay inacute settings. We aimed to develop and implement a point of care test (POCT) to genotype the m.1555A>G variant in a clinically relevant timeframe, facilitating tailored prescribing. Methods: A loop mediated isothermal ampli ﬁcation reaction was designed to amplify the target region before genotyping via melt curve analysis. This was packaged into the Genedrive POCT system and integrated into clinical pathways at two major UK neonatalcentres over 11 months. All admissions were eligible for recruitment.The primary outcome was the number of neonates successfully tested for the variant out of all babies prescribed antibiotics. Secondary outcomes include measures of clinical timings to assesswhether implementation negatively impacted normal care. Results: The POCT identi ﬁes the m.1555A>G genotype in 26 minutes with performance comparable to gold standard genotyping. 81% of admissions receiving antibiotics weresuccessfully tested for the variant and other clinical timings, including time to antibiotic, were equivalent to previous practice. Three babies with m.1555A>G were identi ﬁed, all of whom received an alternative antibiotic regimen. A failure rate of 15%persisted throughout the study, however this rate could be almost eliminated after adjustments to assay chemistry. Conclusions: We can identify the m.1555A>G variant in a practice changing timeframe and demonstrate the importance ofimplementation trials in genomics. To our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst example of a pharmacogenetic assay employed in the acute neonatal setting to alter management.",2021
" Family history and polygenic risk scores are not interchangeable measures of genetic susceptibility Nina Mars 1, Pietro della Briotta Parolo1,F i n n G e n ,S a m u l iR i p a t t i1,2,31Institute for Molecular Medicine Finland (FIMM), HiLIFE, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,2Department of Public Health, University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland,3Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, Cambridge, MA, USA",C25.2,nan,nan," Family history (FH) is a risk factor for most common diseases, capturing both genetic and other familial risk. Polygenic risk scores (PRS) identify individuals at substantially increased risk ofdisease, but whether these two measures of genetic susceptibilityare interchangeable remains unclear. We studied the interplay of FH and PRS for 20 common diseases, including common cancers, cardiometabolic diseases, and mental disorders. From FinnGen ( N ,260,405), we identi ﬁed 30,517 individuals with a ﬁrst degree relative in the dataset, and evaluated the effect of FH by linkage to nationwide healthcare registries. For each disease, we system atically constructed genome wide PRSs. For the majority ofdiseases, adjusting the FH effect size with PRS resulted in moderate decreases (mean decrease 10.9%;s.d. 6.7%). Similarly, adjusting the PRS effect with FH had negligible impact on the PRS( 2.9%;1.3%). Examples for three diseases are in the table. None ofthe 20 diseases showed evidence of interaction between FH and PRS (p value range 0.07 0.87). For 5/20 diseases, PRS showed larger improvements in risk prediction than FH. In none did FHand PRS jointly perform better than PRS alone. Results were similarfor parental causes of death ( N,163,973, out of whom 61.3% had a dead parent). For a wide range of diseases, this systematic comparison demonstrates that family history and polygenic riskprovide complementary information in risk assessment, support ing the clinical utility of polygenic risk scores.

Genetic predisposition to breast cancer (BC) has been associated with both high impact monogenic variants across susceptibility genes, and the polygenic risk due to the additive effects of manycommon variants. While the two types of genetic risks are well established, few studies have explored the extent to which polygenic background can modify the risk of high impact monogenic variants in BC. Here, we show that among 96,34483 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87women with 3,654 BC cases (data from UK Biobank), polygenic risk score (PRS) modi ﬁes the penetrance of monogenic variants across 12 BC susceptibility genes ( BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, PALB2, CHEK2, RAD51, TP53, RAD51D, RAD51C, BRIP1, RAD54L, BARD1 ). A polygenic risk score for BC was calculated and used to categoriseindividuals into low, intermediate, and high risk groups. We then compared how the PRS strati ﬁcation among carriers of high impact variants in ﬂuence the BC risk. The prevalence of BC is signi ﬁcantly higher in carriers of high impact variants with a high PRS (>90% percentile) [(Odds ratio (95% CI), 4.41 (3.19 5.97), P, 3.96×10 −21) and (Hazard ratio (95% CI), 3.76 (2.84 4.98), P,2×10 −16)], compared to carriers with low PRS (<10% percentile) [(OR (95% CI), 1.98 (1.05 3.41), P,2×10−2) and (HR (95% CI), 2.23 (1.34 4.00), P,3×10−3)].

Introduction: The American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) identi ﬁed 59 genes in which incidental ﬁndings of medically actionable pathogenic variants is recommended. The prevalenceof these variants from Arab and other Middle Eastern populations is still lacking. The Qatar Genome Program (QGP), which is a large, population based whole genome sequencing project with com prehensive phenotypic information, allowed us to identify andanalyze the medically actionable variants in the Qatari population. Materials and Methods: We used data from 6,045 whole genomes from the QGP and integrated it with phenotypic datacollected by the Qatar Biobank. We identi ﬁed known pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants based on ClinVar and the Human Gene Mutation Database professional entries. Additionally, we identi ﬁed novel variants, assessed their phenotypic associa tions, and functionally characterized two novel variants inzebra ﬁsh model. Results: We identi ﬁed a total of 64 pathogenic and likely pathogenic variants in 27 ACMG genes in 170 individuals. Overall,2.8% of the QGP sequenced participants carried a pathogenic or likely pathogenic variant in one of the 59 ACMG genes. We found 75 novel, potentially pathogenic variants. We prioritized two novelcardiovascular variants, DSP c.1841A>G (p.Asp614Gly) and LMNA c.326T>G (p.Val109Gly) for functional characterization. Our results84 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87showed that both variants resulted in abnormal zebra ﬁsh heart development, heart rate and rhythm.

Introduction: To assess the distribution of genetic epilepsies and accordingly adjusted medical treatment at the only tertiary epilepsy referral centre in Denmark. Material and Methods: The records of children born between 2006 2011 and followed at the centre in 2015 were systematically analysed. Genetic approaches used were karyotyping, array andnext generation sequencing (NGS) approaches such as genepanels and whole exome sequencing. Results: 357 children were identi ﬁed, however 7 % did not have epilepsy, and 11 % had epilepsy due to an acquired brain lesion.These patients were excluded from further analysis. The remaining290 children were most frequently diagnosed with developmental and epileptic encephalopathies (35 %), focal or multifocal epilepsy (41 %), and generalized epilepsy (8 %). 211/290 patientsconsented for genetic testing aiming to ﬁnd a genetic explanation for their illness. A genetic cause was found in half of the consented patients across 36 different genes encompassing 14copy number variants and 86 single nucleotide variants. Com monly affected genes affected were SCN1A and TSC1/2 . Tailored treatment approaches were possible in half of patients with a molecular diagnosis. Exome sequencing led to molecular diag nosis in several genetically unexplained children and identi ﬁed three new candidate genes. Conclusions: Almost 50% reached a genetic diagnose. NGS approaches have much higher yield than an array (detection rateof 40% vs 7%). We shows that 1 out of 4 patients referred to a tertiary epilepsy centre can bene ﬁt from early genetic testing in order to receive tailored treatment and prevent unnecessary andpotentially harmful diagnostic procedures and managements.",2021

The study of hominin history has progressed through both archaeological and genetic insights. However, many archaeologi cal sites lack associated hominin fossils, frustrating genetic analyses. Even when fossils are found, they often do not cover the full time span of a site, or sampling them for DNA may not bepossible. Here we present targeted enrichment and sequencing ofhominin nuclear DNA from sediments, and insights into human history derived from this DNA. We developed methods to capture hominin DNA even in the presence of homologous faunal DNA,and evaluate the extent of microbial and faunal DNA in our data. We applied these methods to sediment samples from Galería de las Estatuas, a site in northern Spain, and Denisova andChagyrskaya caves, in the Altai Mountains in southern Siberia,and identi ﬁed and sequenced Neandertal nuclear DNA in stratigraphic layers spanning 55k 200 thousand years ago. We then placed each sample on the Neandertal phylogenetic tree,inferring the most likely divergence date from a lineage. InEstatuas we demonstrate a population transition, and associate this change with speci ﬁc layers. In Chagyrskaya, all layers are associated with a single Neandertal lineage, suggesting a morehomogenous occupation. This work demonstrates that detailed genetic analyses may be possible from many more archaeological sites than was previously thought, and is particularly encouragingfor time series studies of single sites, or for sites with a sparsefossil record.",2021

Different generic PGT methods,such as Karyomapping, haplarithmisis and OnePGT, cannot be applied for couples where one of the partners is carrying a de novo pathogenic. The absence of affected close relatives entangles the process of constructing accurate haplotype usinglinkage analysis by Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) located upstream and downstream of the pathogenic variant.85 European Journal of Human Genetics (2022) 30:3 – 87Current practices for the handling of couples with de novo variants are mostly targeted, require the combination of direct and indirect approaches and often require multiple biopsies. To overcome this limitation, we developed a new method: long range PCR andsubsequent long read sequencing of the pathogenic variantregion enabled haplotype reconstruction and imputation in the genome wide haplotypes. From January 2017 until December 2019, twenty two couples with one of the partners carrying apathogenic de novo variant causing a Mendelian disorder were enrolled for PGT M in the Centre for Human Genetics, UZ Leuven.

To investigate the interplay between molecular intermediaries that de ﬁne the pathways from genetic variation to disease, we evaluated the shared genetic regulation of mRNA molecules,proteins and metabolites derived from whole blood from 3,029 human donors. We observed extensive allelic heterogeneity, with 94.4% genes, 97.3% proteins and 49.2% metabolites associatedwith two or more variants, and pleiotropy, where variants wereassociated with multiple local (cis) and distal (trans) molecular phenotypes. Estimates of the proportion of shared genetic regulation ranged from 66.6% for expression and proteins,33.3% for expression and metabolites, to 27% for proteins andmetabolites. Compared to gene expression in a diverse set of 44 tissues, the highest proportion of sharing of genetic regulation was observed for gene expression (from 81% in testis to 98% inbrain); followed by plasma proteins (from 20.5% spleen to 100% inliver or skeletal muscle) and plasma metabolites (from 0% brain to 16.88% testis).

M.," Mutation in the germline is the ultimate source of genetic variation, but little is known about the in ﬂuence of germline chromatin structure on mutational processes. Using ATAC seq, we pro ﬁle the open chromatin landscape of human spermato gonia, the most proliferative cell type of the germline, identify ing transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) and PRDM9 binding sites, a subset of which will initiate meiotic recombina tion. As expected we observe an increase in rare structuralvariant (SV) breakpoints at PRDM9 bound sites, implicating meiotic recombination in the generation of structural variation. However, many germline TFBSs, such as NRF1, are alsoassociated with increased rates of SV breakpoints, apparently independent of recombination. In addition, singleton short insertions (> ,5 bp) are highly enriched at TFBSs, particularly at sites bound by testis active TFs, and their rates correlate withthose of structural variant brea kpoints. Short insertions often duplicate the TFBS motif, leading to clustering of motif sites near regulatory regions in this male driven evolutionary process. Increased mutation loads at germline TFBSs disproportionatelyaffect neural enhancers with act ivity in spermatogonia, poten tially altering neurodevelopmental regulatory architecture. Local chromatin structure in spermatogonia is thus pervasive inshaping both evolution and disease.",2021

Background: Deciphering the function of the many genes previously classi ﬁed as uncharacterized “open reading frame ” (orf) completes our understanding of cell function and itspathophysiology. Methods: Whole exome sequencing, yeast 2 hybrid and transcriptome analyses together with molecular characterizationare used here to uncover the function of the C2orf69 gene. Results: We identi ﬁed loss of function mutations in the uncharacterized C2orf69 gene in eight individuals with brain abnormalities involving hypomyelination and microcephaly, liverdysfunction and recurrent autoin ﬂammation. C2orf69 contains an N terminal signal peptide that is required and suf ﬁcient for mitochondrial localization. Consistent with mitochondrial dysfunc tion, patients showed signs of respiratory chain defect and aCRISPR Cas9 knockout cell model of C2orf69 had similar respira tory chain defects. Patient derived cells revealed alterations in immunological signaling pathways. Deposits of PAS positive material in tissues from affected individuals together withdecreased glycogen branching enzyme 1 (GBE1) activity indicated an additional impact of C2orf69 on glycogen metabolism. Conclusion: Our study identi ﬁes C2orf69 as an important regulator of human mitochondrial function and suggests anadditional in ﬂuence on other metabolic pathways.",2021

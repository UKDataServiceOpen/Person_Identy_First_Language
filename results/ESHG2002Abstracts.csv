The Human Genome Sequence: will it come to an  end ?,PS01.,Weissenbach,"Genoscope and CNRS UMR 8030, Evry, France","The International Human Genome Sequencing Consortium has not  curtailed its efforts with the annoucement of the completion of the  draft sequence (June 2000). On the contrary significant progress has  been accomplished since the analysis (February 2001) and the hope  for a complete sequence for 2003 is still realistic. The draft sequence has been improved by doubling the number of  shotgun reads of the BAC clones included in the assembly (about  30,000 clones). This resulted in larger assembled contigs which could  be more frequently ordered and oriented. Finishing is the major focus  at present. To date chromosomes 14, 20, 21, 22 and Y are fully sequenced. The  published draft sequence (assembled September 2000) contained  some 220,000 sequence gaps among which about 2000 were not  bridged by cloned DNA fragments. The sequence gap number has  decreased to 98,000 (assembled August 2001) and the number of  clone gaps has been reduced to 390 (November 2001). Similarly the  global coverage has increased from 2,700 Mb (September 2000)  to 2,900 Mb (August 2001). 2,048 Mb of non redundant sequence  (64%) is in the finished state. Because of the high redundance of the number of BAC clones that  were used for the draft sequence, a large number of sequence  variants could be identified and more than 4,000,000 SNPs are  presently featured in dbSNP. Sequence analysis does not reveal  similar spectacular changes. The gene count remains controversial.  However the number of 25,000 confirmed genes is not going to  increase rapidly since it is dependent on experimental validations.",2002
Gene therapy of inherited disorders. Results and  perspectives,PS02.,Fischer,"UnitÃ© dâImmunologie et dâHÃ©matologie PÃ©diatriques and INSERM U  429   University Hospital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France","Gene therapy is an attractive option for a number of genetic  disorders. Genetic supplementation could in theory lead to long  lasting disease phenotype correction. However, efficient targeting,  induction of long lasting transgene expression and a few other issues  limit present application. Given the status of gene transfer technology,  two settings appear more favourable. The first relies on a growth  advantage conferred to transduced cells by transgene expression  combined with cell longevity. This is best examplified by the severe  combined immunodeficiency (SCID) condition. X linked (SCID) is  caused by mutations of the gene encoding the Î³c receptor subunit.  Induction of expression on lymphocyte progenitors by retroviral  mediated gene transfer leads to tremendous cell proliferation  resulting in the generation of a high number of mature, long lived T  lymphocytes. Based on this strategy, seven out of 8 patients with  typical XL SCID have benefited from gene therapy. They have indeed  recovered a functional immune system with a follow up up to 3 years  without adverse effects. A dozen of other genetic conditions might  therefore also benefited form this approach. The second favourable  setting is based on continuous secretion of a protein in blood  stream by transduced cells of various sources such as hepatocytes,  fibroblaste or muscular cells. AAV vectors appear well suited. As  based on preliminary results, application to the treatment of inherited  hemostasis disorders (hemophilia) or lysosomal storage disorders  can be considered. Broader application of gene therapy is awaiting  progress in gene transfer technology. The advent of lentiviral vectors,  enabling transduction of non cycling cells, if proven safe, might  provide a significant boost to gene therapy.",2002
Patterns of human meoitic recombination,PS03.,"J. Jeffreys , K. Holloway, L. Kauppi, C. May, R. Neumann, T.  Slingsby, T. Taylor","University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom","To analyse the fine scale distribution of meiotic recombination events in human chromosomes, we have developed PCR methods to detect  crossovers in sperm DNA. Linkage disequilibrium (LD) and sperm  analysis within the MHC class II region show that crossovers are  heavily clustered into 1 2 kb wide hotspots that profoundly influence  LD patterns, with blocks of strongly associated markers 10âs of kb  long lying between clusters of hotspots. Current evidence suggests  that this mosaic pattern of recombining and non recombining DNA  is quite common elsewhere in the human genome. Other similar  width hotspots identified by sperm analysis have been found closely  associated with minisatellites, where they appear to drive repeat  DNA instability, and in the recombinationally active pseudoautosomal  pairing region",2002

Neonatal screening for CF: a 13 years experience  in Brittany (France),PS07.,"Ferec , V. Scotet, M. de Braekeleer, M. P. AudrÃ©zet","EMI U 0115   C. H.U., Brest, France. ","Cystic Fibrosis is the most frequent autosomal recessive disease  among Caucasians. The disease, characterized by chronic broncho  pneumopathy and pancreatic insufficiency, is still fatal with a median  life expectancy of about 30 years. Among the possible strategies  for prevention is neonatal screening based on the expectation that  early diagnosis leading to early treatment would result in lower  morbidity and longer life expectancy. Thirteen years ago, we started a  systematic neonatal screening program in Brittany, France, a region  of 2.8 million inhabitants mostly of Celtic origin. The initial program  was based on an IRT/IRT two tier protocol (1989/1992) then we  implemented a two tier IRT/DNA analysis pilot program. During this  13 years period, 454 285 IRT tests were done on children born in  Brittany and 163 were diagnosed with CF. The cumulative incidence  of CF was one in 2787. The number of new cases identified each  year is relatively constant (12/14). All the mutated CFTR alleles  but one were characterized: 41 different mutations were identified  corresponding to 48 different genotypes. During this period, 35%  of these one in four risk couples opted for prenatal diagnosis and Plenary Sessions54 55 during the same period 10% of CF children were diagnosed in utero   due to the discovery of an hyperechogenic bowel during pregnancy .  We evidenced in this population study the spectacular changing  epidemiology of CF The possibility of direct benefits resulting from neonatal screening  (with nutritional and respiratory benefits) raises the question of  whether the time has arrived for routine neonatal screening for  CF. We have shown the efficiency and the feasibility of neonatal  screening for CF in Brittany based on 13 years experience. The  IRT combined with mutation analysis on the same Guthrie cards  can be done in any population in which most of the mutations can  be identified. The implementation of a national neonatal screening  program for CF has been decided by the health care authorities in  France, the program has begun at the beginning of this year.",2002
Lessons from the newborn screening programme  in Wales,PS08.,"J. Clarke , E. Parsons, D. Bradley","Department of Medical Genetics, University of Wales College of  Medicine, Cardiff, Wales, United Kingdom","The newborn screening programme in Wales has incorporated tests  for Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) since 1990 and for cystic  fibrosis (CF) since 1997. Initial concerns that screening for DMD  might lead to family disruption have not been justified, but we have  learned lessons about screening for diseases where the affected  child is not expected to benefit from early diagnosis. 1. The test must be perceived as optional by the midwife and  family. 2. This requires an educational initiative for the community  midwives. 3. Changes to service delivery may make more explicit the optional  character of such non therapeutic screening tests. 4. A protocol for handling positive screening test results must be  developed and monitored. 5. Careful and sustained coordination of communication between  the family, the primary health care team and specialist care is  required. Newborn screening for CF also identifies unaffected carrier infants,  who will not benefit from their early diagnosis â they have elevated  trypsin levels, one recognised CFTR  mutation but normal sweat  electrolytes. The recognition of these infants may be regarded as  a disadvantage of screening, but does result in staging of the âbad  newsâ concerning affected infants. Should only those infants with two  CFTR  gene mutations be regarded as positive on the screening test ? Our experiences have implications for the introduction of screening  for additional disorders, such as MCAD deficiency. We have also  found that a few infants have in the past been missed by the routine  newborn screening programme. Newborn screening is not just a  laboratory process.",2002
Genetic Testing for Hereditary Colorectal Cancer in  Children: Long Term Psychological Effects,PS09.,"M. Codori , K. L. Zawacki, G. M. Petersen, D. L. Miglioretti, J. A.  Bacon, J. D. Trimbath, S. V. Booker, K. Picarello, F. M. Giardiello","Johns Hopkins Hospital, Baltimore, MD","Children who carry a gene mutation for familial adenomatous  polyposis (FAP) need annual screening for precancerous polyps and  eventual cancer preventing colectomy. Predictive genetic testing can  identify children who need regular screening. Testing children for  FAP has clear medical benefits, but the psychological effects have  not been well studied. We evaluated the long term psychological  effects of genetic testing in 48 children and their parents. In each  family, one parent was a known gene mutation carrier. Before genetic  testing, and three times afterward, participants completed measures  of psychological functioning, which, for children, included depression  and anxiety symptoms, and behavior problems and competencies.  Parents completed a measure of depression symptoms. Data were  collected at 3 , 12 , and 23 55 months after disclosure. 22 children  tested positive; 26 children tested negative. Mean length of follow  up was 38 months. There were no clinically significant changes in  mean psychological test scores in children or parents, regardless of  the childrenâs test results. However, children who tested positive and  had a mutation positive sibling showed significant, but subclinical,  increases in depression symptoms. Furthermore, several individual  mutation negative children with a positive sibling had clinical elevations in anxiety symptoms. Behavior problems declined for all  groups, and behavior competence scores remained unchanged.  We conclude that most children do not suffer clinically significant  psychological distress after testing. However, because some  children showed clinically significant anxiety symptoms, long term  psychological support should be available to those families with both  mutation positive and  negative children, and with multiple mutation  positive children. Our findings call for a multidisciplinary approach to  genetic testing for children.",2002
Carrier Testing in Childhood: Conflict or  Compromise?,PS10.,Barnes,"Genetics Centre, Guyâs & St. Thomasâ Hospital Trust, London, United  Kingdom.  ","The advantages of performing a diagnostic genetic test, with proven  medical benefits, on a symptomatic child is seldom questioned.  Equally, there is a general consensus against testing healthy children  for untreatable adult onset genetic disorders. Genetic testing to  determine the âcarrierâ status of a healthy child with a family history  of a recessive or X linked monogenic disorder or a balanced  chromosome rearrangement, however, remains controversial. There  are many views on this issue, and the parentsâ perspective can be  very different from that of medical professionals, amongst whom  opinions and practices vary. Also, the impact of carrier testing on  children themselves remains a relatively unexplored area. After an overview of the relevant literature to date, the response of  one Genetics Centre to requests for the carrier testing of minors will  be described and discussed. A Position Statement on the genetic testing of children was devised  in consultation with laboratory colleagues. This document was  circulated to regional paediatricians, and supplied to other physicians  on request. The document provides basic information about issues to  consider in childhood testing and a summary of current departmental  guidelines on the genetic testing of minors. The document explains  why requests for carrier tests in children are no longer automatically  accepted, and strongly encourages clinicians to refer parents  requesting such tests for genetic counselling. An information leaflet  for parents is also available. It is hoped that such proactive initiatives can increase constructive  dialogue between parents and professionals, and decrease the  conflict that has often arisen in this area. PS 4.

Cardiac development and Cardiovascular  malformation,PS11.,"Goodship , D. Henderson","Institute of Human Genetics, International Centre for Life, Newcastle  upon Tyne, United Kingdom","Understanding normal development is important to improved  understanding of cardiovascular malformation (CVM). Development  of the four chambered heart from a linear tube is a complex process.  I will present current thinking that takes information from older  studies but incorporates newer data using molecular markers and  3D reconstruction. Of particular importance is the ballooning model  of development of the cardiac chambers from the primary heart  tube. I will then illustrate, using three examples, how mutations in  genes expressed at different stages of development lead to CVM.  ZIC3  is a transcription factor with a role in early development.  Mutations in ZIC3  lead to a range of heart defects associated with  laterality disturbance demonstrating the importance of early events  that establish midline and the left right axis to normal cardiac  development.",2002

Baschirotto Lecture: Gene discovery in cancer:  who benefits?,PS14.,"de la Chapelle1,2","1Human Cancer Genetics Program, The Ohio State University,  Columbus, OH, United States, 2FolkhÃ¤lsan Institute of Genetics,  Helsinki, Finland","When new genes with cancer significance are discovered it is  reasonable to ask how and when the discovery can be translated  into cancer therapy and prevention. Unfortunately, the most common  answer is that we do not know. A more suitable question would seem  to be whether novel genes will have any impact at all on cancer  therapy. In the academic world the great incentive that drives researchers is    in addition to curiosity if not passion   career aspects. Researchers  will be credited for discoveries they make no matter whether the  discoveries are ever translated into e.g. new drugs or treatment  modalities. In the commercial world the great incentive is money. Successful  discoveries directly translate into money for all: the company, its  employees, scientists, and shareholders. How about the public, the cancer patient? The patient has more  at stake than the researcher or the company. Luckily, whether a  discovery has an impact on the clinical outcome is the ultimate  measure of its success. Therefore, the efforts of academic  researchers and companies can be said to ultimately focus on the  patient, and almost nothing but the patient. This is fortunate, but  progress has nevertheless been dismally slow. It would appear  that every time a new research area is opened, hopes of ultimate  translational success are high but in reality progress is slow. The  recent breakthroughs in drug development targeting genetically  determined defects have instilled high hopes. Another area showing  promise is the molecular screening for inherited susceptibility to  cancer. Lives can be saved and efforts can be optimized when clinical  surveillance can be focused on those at high risk while those at low  risk can be spared. It should not take many years before we know  whether presently ongoing large investments   both academic and  commercial   will pay off. Symposia S 1. Cognition and Behaviour",2002
The study of behavioural phenotypes : implications  for practice and management,S01.,"Swillen , J. P. Fryns","Center for Human Genetics, University Hospital Gasthuisberg,  Leuven, Belgium","A major challenge in both clinical practice and research in the field  of mental retardation and of learning disorders is to identify the  underlying causes : the genetic, chromosomal and environmental  factors that have an important influence on a personâs development  and behaviour. Advances in clinical genetics have lead to an increased recognition  of specific syndromes. In recent years, cytogenetic and molecular  genetic tools have resulted in the identification of the underlying  genetic defects in a large number of these disorders.For many years, interest has focused on the delineation of the  somatic aspects of the phenotypes and their underlying pathogenetic  mechanisms. However, in the last decade, researchers in this field  paid more attention to the cognitive and behavioural features of  various genetic conditions, the so called âbehavioural phenotypesâ  (B.P.). A behavioural phenotype is âa behavioural pattern, including cognitive  processes and social interaction style, that is consistently associated  with, and specific to, a syndrome which has a chromosomal or  a genetic etiologyâ. This approach has proven to be of practical  importance for the patients both regarding an earlier syndrome  diagnosis, as well as in the multidisciplinary management and follow  up. In addition, the link between a specific behavioural phenotype and  a genetic defect represents an unique opportunity to gain insight in  the complex neurobiological processes underlying human behaviour . In this lecture, focus lies on the clinical goals of research in B.P . , and  this will be illustrated using the Velo Cardio Facial syndrome (VCFS),  the Smith Magenis syndrome and the Prader Willi syndrome (PWS).",2002
The tortuous path from genotype to phenotype:  genes and cognition in mutant mice,S02.,P. Lipp,"Institute of Anatomy, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland","Genetically modified mice are increasingly used to analyze the  relations between genes, brain and behavior. One approach  concentrates on deleting or controlling genes of theoretical  importance for memory and learning, e.g., genes encoding proteins  for intracellular signalling pathways. The other focuses on deleting  genes in the mouse homologous to human mutations causing mental  retardation and cognitive impairment. Both approaches face (i)  problems of elucidating the causal relations between genes, brain  and behavior, and (ii) the difficulties of matching cognitive processes  in mice and men. (i) Phenotypic expression of mutation effects is often masked or  altered by homeostatic regulation at the intracellular level, and by  brain plasticity and environmental effects. This will be illustrated  by examples taken from the analysis of genetically modified mice  carrying different targeted mutations. (ii) A cross species comparison of cognition must take into account  that the associative cortex in mice is small and largely confined to  the hippocampal formation and proximally connected structures. On  the other hand, hallmarks of cognition in men (e.g., general problem  solving abilities and memory), and of other mammals (e.g., spatial  memory and learning of rats) might be of lesser importance for mice.  This will be illustrated by a comparison of cognitive impairments in  the laboratory and under naturalistic conditions. In conclusion, the availability of mutant mouse model represents a  fundamental methodological progress in modeling the genotype to  phenotype pathway characteristic for human mental retardation, but  we must learn to understand the constraints imposed by species  differences.

Fragile X Syndrome â its impact on families,S03.,Carmichael,"Genetic Nurse Specialist, Southend Hospital, Westcliff on Sea,  United Kingdom","Fragile X Syndrome is the commonest inherited cause of learning  difficulty. Although X linked, it affects both girls and boys. While  learning difficulties are a consistent feature, fragile X is also  associated with characteristic behavioural problems in many affected  children. Having a child with a learning difficulty has an impact on any family,  as has the presence of an inherited disorder in a family. Many of the  challenges faced by Fragile X families are no different from those  faced by other families with genetic disorders, or with learning  disabled children. However, there are features of fragile X which  make it unique. Some mothers of fragile X children are themselves affected, making  parenting and behavioural management difficult. Women with  fragile X do not always have good social skills, and this can lead to  estrangement from their families and a lack of peer support. Social  anxiety and lack of confidence can make it hard for some affected  females seek help for themselves or for their children. Finding the underlying genetic mechanism which causes the  condition has made possible reliable diagnosis and carrier detection. Symposia                56 57 However, more than 30 years after the first observation of the  fragile site on the X chromosome, prenatal diagnosis can still be  problematic.

From cancer genomics to new cancer therapeutics,S06.,Workman,"CRC Centre for Cancer Therapeutics, The Institute for Cancer  Research, Sutton, Surrey, United Kingdom","Cancer drug discovery has now firmly entered the postgenome era.  This is characterised by two features: 1) A focus on new therapeutic  targets defined by the molecular pathology of cancer; and 2) Use  of modern technologies, particularly genomics, high throughput  screening, combinatorial chemistry, structural biology, cassette  dosing pharmacology and molecular biomarkers, to increase success  and accelerate the pace of drug development (see Workman P,  Curr Opin Pharmacol 2 342 352 2001; Workman P, Curr Opin Invest  Drugs 2 1180 1135 2001). The expectation is that such molecularly targeted, genome based  drugs will be more effective and less toxic than cytotoxic agents and  will be used chronically in long term disease management. A wide  range of novel genome based agents are in clinical and preclinical  development and some have now received regulatory approval  (see Workman P and Kaye SB, A Trends Guide to Cancer, Trends  in Molecular Medicine, 8 (4) Suppl 2002). Herceptin (trastuzumab)  is approved for treatment of ErbB2 positive breast cancer and  Glivec (imatinib) for use in chronic myelogenous leukaemia and  gastrointestinal stromal tumours (GIST) as a result of its action on the  Bcr Abl and mutant c Kit tyrosine kinases that drive these diseases.  Iressa (ZD1839) shows activity in various cancers through inhibition  of the epidermal growth factor receptor tyrosine kinases. Hsp90  inhibitors, such as 17AAG, are of special interest because of their ability to cause depletion of multiple oncogenic proteins.

Friedriech and other recessive ataxias,S07.,"Koenig , H. Puccio, P. Bomont, M. C. Moreira, D. Simon, S. Klur,  M. Gribaa, C. Lagier Tourenne, M. Schmitt","IGBMC (CNRS INSERM ULP), Illkirch, Strasbourg, France","With the exception of metabolic disorders, only two forms of  recessive ataxia were well characterised some twenty five years  ago : Friedreich ataxia (FRDA) and ataxia telangiectasia (AT). DNA  linkage studies allowed to identify the molecular cause of these  frequent forms of inherited ataxia and to start to unravel the complex  heterogeneity of the remaining cases. In a collaborative endeavour ,  we identified the gene defective in FRDA and its product, frataxin,  a mitochondrial protein whose deficiency results in disturbances  of iron homeostasis and of iron sulfur proteins. The molecular  pathogenesis of FRDA is defined by severely reduced levels, but not  absence, of normal frataxin as a result of the intronic trinucleotide  expansion mutation present in homozygous, and occasionally in  compound heterozygous, patients. We have used conditional and  inducible knock out strategies to artificially recreate this partial  frataxin deficiency in mouse models that present with several clinical,  histological and biochemical features of the human disease, in  different combinations. Idebenone, an antioxidant proposed by P.  Rustin to protect against iron excess toxicity, showed a moderate  but significant effect on survival on the first model that we tested. We  pioneered the use homozygosity mapping for primary localisation of  autosomal recessive conditions and applied it successfully to ataxia  with isolated vitamin E deficiency (AVED), giant axonal neuropathy  (GAN), ataxias with oculomotor apraxia (AOA1 and AOA2), Refsum  disease (RD) and ataxia with visual impairment and deafness (van  Bogaert ataxia). We subsequently identified the defective gene  for the first three conditions and used the genetic knowledge to  clinically delineate the AOA forms.

Friedreichâs Ataxia: Insights into the Mechanism and  Prospects for a Therapy,S08.,"Rustin , V. Geromel, N. Darin, A. Munnich, A. RÃ¶tig","INSERM U 393   Hopital Necker Enfants Malades, Paris, France","In 1996, mutations in the gene encoding frataxin, a mitochondrial  protein of yet unknown function, were shown to cause Friedreichâ s  ataxia, the most common hereditary ataxia with cardiomyopathy.  In more than 97% of the patients, a GAA triplet expansion in the  first intron of the gene results in a lack of function of frataxin, due  to hampered transcription of the gene. Decreased frataxin was  subsequently found to cause a generalized mitochondrial iron sulfur  protein deficiency in the heart from Friedreichâs ataxia patients. Post  mortem sample analysis confirmed the functional impairment of these  proteins in both heart and brain of the patients. The exact function  of frataxin remains a matter of debate, the protein being possibly  involved in either mitochondrial iron export or storage, or in iron sulfur  protein synthesis. Whatever the exact function of the frataxin could  be, the disabled recruitment of early antioxidant defenses recently  reported in patient cell lines should participate to increased sensitivity  to the oxidative insults noticed in Friedreich ataxia patients. Given  the strong evidences for an increased oxidative stress, antioxidant  therapy appeared a reasonable therapeutic option. Patients were  therefore treated with idebenone, a potent antioxidant ubiquinone  analogue. A preliminary study reported a spectacular improvement  of the cardiomyopathy in three patients after 6 months of idebenone  oral supplementation (5 mg/kg/d). These preliminary results were  afterwards confirmed on a larger cohort of patients with a significant  decrease of heart hypertrophy measurable in about half of the  patients after 6 months of treatment. The variable response to the  treatment, and its inability to counteract the ataxia so far, should  prompt identification and development of new molecules possibly  targeting the induction of cells early antioxidant defenses.Symposia56 57",2002

Functions and Biogenesis of Peroxisomes and the  Metabolic and Molecular Basis of Peroximal Disorders,S10.,"A. Wanders , H. R. Waterham","Academic Medical Center, University of Amsterdam, Laboratory  Genetic Metabolic Diseases, Departments of Pediatrics/Emma  Childrenâs Hospital and Clinical Chemistry, Amsterdam, Netherlands","Peroxisomal disorders (PDs) are relative newcomers in the area of  genetic diseases which now comprise over 20 different disorders with  Zellweger syndrome as the prototype. The PDs can be subdivided  into 2 groups including 1. the peroxisome biogenesis disorders  (PBDs) and 2. the single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies. In PBD  patients peroxisomes are strongly deficient resulting in a generalized  loss of peroxisomal functions. Within the PBD group there is not only  profound clinical  heterogeneity ranging from Zellweger syndrome with  early death to infantile Refsum disease with survival into adult life but  also marked genetic  heterogeneity with the involvement of at least  12 different genes. Most of these genes, called PEX genes, have  been identified allowing molecular diagnosis in virtually all patients.  Peroxisomes catalyze a range of important metabolic functions  including fatty acid beta oxidation, etherphospholipid biosynthesis,  fatty acid alpha oxidation and glyoxylate detoxification, a.o. In recent  years many peroxisomal disorders have been identified resulting  from single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies in each of these  pathways with X linked adrenoleukodystrophy as the most frequent  single peroxisomal defect. This advanced knowledge has led to the  development of highly reliable methods for the post  and prenatal  laboratory diagnosis of patients at the metabolite, enzyme and DNA  level.

The search for autism susceptibility genes,S11.,"Monaco1, IMGSAC2, SLIC3","1Wellcome Trust Centre for Human Genetics, University of Oxford,  Oxford, United Kingdom, 2The International Molecular Genetic Study  of Autism Consortium (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/~maestrin/iat.html),  United Kingdom, 3The Specific Language Impairment Consortium  (http://www.well.ox.ac.uk/monaco/dianne/index.shtml), United  Kingdom."," Autism is characterised by impaired social interaction and  communication, and is accompanied by repetitive and stereotyped  behaviours and interests. Autism has an onset in the first three years,  persists throughout life, and is associated with mental handicap  and epilepsy although it can include milder, but related impairments  in individuals of normal intelligence. From family and twin studies  there is substantial evidence that autism has a strong yet complex  genetic component. In order to identify autism susceptibility genes  the IMGSAC has collected approximately 250 families with more than  one child or relative affected. 83 sibling pairs families with autism  were screened for linkage using a whole genome scan and areas  of increased allele sharing were genotyped with 119 markers in a  further 69 sibling pair families. Four regions of linkage were identifi ed  including chromosome 2q (MLS 3.74), 7q (MLS 3.20), 16p (MLS  2.93) and 17q (MLS 2.34), three of which have been replicated by  other groups. Candidate gene and association studies are now in  progress in order to isolate the susceptibility genes at these loci.  On chromosome 7q31, the FOXP2 gene is mutated in a severe  monogenic form of speech and language impairment and encodes a  transcription factor containing a polyglutamine tract and a forkhead  domain. FOXP2 was tested for association and mutation in both  complex language impairments and autism. No association or coding  region variants in FOXP2 were found and the gene is therefore  unlikely to play a major role in autism or more common forms of  language impairment.",2002
C. elegans : an animal model for high throughput  functional genomics,S12.,Baumeister,"ABI/Biochemistry, Laboratory of Molecular Neurogenetics, Ludwig  Maximilians University, Munich, Germany","The different genome projects have resulted in an exponential  increase in sequence information available in the databases. At the  same time, the number of functionally characterized genes is only  increasing linearly. How can we increase the speed of functional  genomics to make full use of the data mining? Model organisms  have helped significantly to understand the roles of particular genes  in an organism. However, the time and effort to perform even single  targeted gene manipulations in mouse or Drosophila melanogaster   is significant, and the complexity of these organisms prevents in  many cases the detailed analyses of the KO consequences. The  nematode C. elegans  offers several advantages: About 60 % of the  human disease genes are represented by homologues in C. elegans .  In addition, the animals are small enough to be kept in large numbers  in a format that allows mass manipulations (microtiter plates) and  knock outs of candidate genes can be obtained in a matter of 4 6  weeks. In addition, C. elegans  is the only multicellular organism for  which the development of each single cell and the entire connectivity  of its nervous system are known.

In  24 color karyotyping (multiplex FISH/M FISH) this increase in  fluorochromes has several advantages including a significant  reduction of probe complexity, facilitation of image analysis,  and most importantly improvement of resolution. We estimate  that interchromosomal rearrangements can be diagnosed if the  translocated or inserted segment has a size in the range of 230 kb to  2.6 Mb. Furthermore, application of the latest software developments  has allowed to simultaneously visualize and analyze multiple small  region specific probes (BACs, PACs, YACs) in an automated fashion.  Thus, sophisticated probe sets can now be tailored for specific  purposes, e.g. a high resolution screen of all subtelomeric regions  in one hybridization.In addition, multicolor FISH is now amenable to  applications in interphase FISH. Our technology of 3D deconvolution  microscopy employs an epifluorescence microscope equipped with  a motorized table to collect a stack of images at defined levels in  z direction. Images are processed by deconvolution to remove out  of focus information. Subsequently, 3D reconstruction algorithms are  applied.

Recent Duplication and the Dynamic Mutation of the  Human Genome.,S21.,E. Eichler,"Department of Genetics and Center for Human Genetics, Case  Western Reserve School of Medicine and University Hospitals of  Cleveland, Cleveland, OH, United States","It has been estimated that 5% of the human genome consists of  interspersed duplicated material that has arisen over the last 30  million years of evolution. Two categories of recent duplicated  segments can be distinguished: segmental duplications between  non homologous chromosomes (transchromosomal duplications)  and duplications largely restricted to a particular chromosome  (chromosome specific duplications). A large proportion of these Symposia58 59 duplications exhibits an extraordinarily high degree of sequence  identity at the nucleotide level (>95%) spanning large (1 100 kb)  genomic distances. Through processes of paralogous recombination,  these same regions are targets for rapid evolutionary turnover among  the genomes of closely related primates. The dynamic nature of these  regions in terms of recurrent chromosomal structural rearrangement  and their ability to generate fusion genes from juxtaposed cassettes  suggests that duplicative transposition has been an important force  in the evolution of our genome. Cycles of segmental duplication over  periods of evolutionary time may provide the underlying mechanism  for domain accretion and the increased modular complexity of the  vertebrate proteome. Further, our data suggest that a small fraction  of important human genes may have emerged recently through  duplication processes and will not possess definitive orthologues in  the genomes of model organisms. I will discuss the organization of  recent segmental duplications within the human genome and their  impact in terms of disease, gene innovation and rapid restructuring of  the primate genome.",2002
The relationship between genome organisation and  gene expression at a human telomeric region,S22.,R. Higgs,"Weatherall Institute of Molecular Medicine, Oxford, United Kingdom","A major challenge in the post genomic era is to understand the  relationship between genome structure and function (transcription,  replication, repair and recombination). Over the past ten years it has  become clear that the interaction of DNA with chromatin and the  associated epigenetic modifications (DNA methylation, changes in  replication timing, histone tail modification, nuclear sublocalisation)  play a major role in elaborating the information encoded in DNA.  However, the hierarchy of these epigenetic phenomena and the order  of events in regulating nuclear processes appear complex and are  largely unknown at present. To learn more about the relationship between chromosome structure  and function we have been characterising the most telomeric 300  kb region of the short arm of human chromosome 16. This is a  GC rich, Alu dense region containing a variety of widely expressed  and tissue specific genes, including the embryonic and adult alpha  like globin genes. We have extensively characterised the structure  and epigenetic modifications of this region enabling us to define a  segment of the chromosome which has been maintained as a well  defined conserved syntenic region throughout evolution. This region  appears to contain most, if not all, of the information required to  fully regulate alpha globin gene expression in experimental assays.

Chromosomal Elements Conferring Epigenetic  Inheritance,S23.,"Maurange, M. Prestel, G. Rank, L. Ringrose, H. Ehret, A. Kuhrs,  R. Paro","ZMBH, UniversitÃ¤t Heidelberg, Heidelberg, Germany","In Drosophila  the proteins of the Polycomb (PcG) and trithorax  group (trxG) are necessary to maintain throughout development  the differential expression patterns of developmental regulators  such as the homeotic genes. PcG and trxG proteins read the  activity state of their target genes, as set during the stages of  determination, and âlockâ the surrounding chromatin either in an  active or repressed state. The control of the chromatin state is  occurring through the binding of PcG and trxG proteins to common  cis elements termed Cellular Memory Module (CMM). In order to  study the mode of CMM action in more detail we have established a  transgene system that allows us to switch CMMs from a repressed  to an activated state that is mitotically heritable. Results from this  system show that transcription through a CMM is necessary for  switching the activity state, which might explain the function of  several non coding RNAs transcribed close to genes potentially  controlled by CMMs. In a complementing approach, we study the  role of CMMs in determination and transdetermination processes in  Drosophila  imaginal discs.The molecular nature of the epigenetic  mark maintaining either silencing or activation of a CMM throughout  development is not known. We are investigating histone modifications  as candidates for such a mark and indeed find a correlation between  H3K9 methylation and PC protein localization. To determine whether this methylation plays a structural role in anchoring the PcG at  CMMs, we challenged PC binding on polytene chromosomes in  permeabilised salivary glands with various competitor peptides.  Strikingly, only a subset of PC bound loci were competable by the  H3K9 methylated peptide, suggesting that other additional histone  modifications may mark the CMM. S 8. Complex Disease",2002

Aside from IDDM1 , the major  disease superlocus located in the HLA region on chromosome 6p21,  low penetrance, compounded by small individual genetic effects  of the other loci create severe difficulties. Interlocus and allelic  heterogeneity might further complicate the analysis. Some of the  aforementioned factors could be alleviated by concentrating on an  isolated and relatively homogenous population such as that from  Sardinia. This island has, together with Finland, the highest incidence  of T1D in the world. Children with Sardinian parents, who live in the  Italian mainland, where the indigenous incidence of T1D is much  lower, have the same incidence of T1D as the Sardinian children  living on the island, thus supporting the role of genetic factors in the  high incidence of the disease. The Sardinians represent a genetic  isolate in which the substantial lack of population sub structure  reduces the risk of artifacts due to population admixture. Finally , the  present time Sardinian population seems to be the result of a fixation  of alleles and haplotypes, rare or absent in other European derived  populations, that are particularly useful for trans ethnic analysis to  fine map the etiological variants. Our results illustrate the advantages deriving from the genetic  analysis of T1D in the Sardinian population.

Multiple interactions between  genetic and environmental factors contribute to the development of  the disease. Presently, we know of six or seven genetic risk factors  for venous thrombosis, that can explain about 60% of families with  thrombophilia. To identify new genetic risk factors for thrombosis  we design the GAIT project (Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic  Thrombosphilia). This project included 397 individuals from 21 Spanish families. In all  of them we measured 43 quantitative phenotypes, and we genotyped  a total of 500 highly informative genetic makers. The statistical  genetic analysis has been performed using a variance component  model included in the software package SOLAR. Our results demonstrate the importance of genetic factors in  determining variation in hemostasis related phenotypes. Most  importantly, over 60% of the variation in susceptibility to thrombosis is  attributable to genetic factors. From the genome wide scan, the first undertaken to identify regions  containing genes influencing variation in susceptibility to thrombotic  disease and its intermediate phenotypes, we demonstrated that the  G20210A mutation is functional in relation to prothrombin plasma  levels and the risk of thrombosis, and the polymorphism responsible  for the ABO blood group is functional in relation to plasma levels of  factor VIII and factor von Willebrand . Moreover, our analyses revealed a strong linkage between a QTL  influencing FXII levels and the FXII gene (specifically the 46C/T FXII  DNA variant; LOD = 10.21). In addition, a region on chromosome 1 Symposia60 61 showed strong evidence of linkage with free PS levels (LOD = 4.07).  Another interesting result suggests that multiple loci are influencing  the normal variation in APCR, and FV DNA variants play a relatively  minor role in this normal variation in APCR.

This research essentially takes into account two  determinant characteristics of all these diseases, that can be  briefly summarised as follows: 1. a neurodegenerative disease is  due to the loss of one or a small number of specific populations  of neurones, allowing in some cases for focal intra cerebral  intervention; 2. this neuronal loss is always progressive, according  however to a schedule which is quite different from one disease to  another, therefore providing a potential âtherapeutic time windowâ  for protective intervention. Without a discrete knowledge of the  physiopathology of the diseases, and of their specific molecular and  cellular mechanisms, one can envision basically two different, and  complementary therapeutic modalities for these diseases. First, one  may consider substituting to the degenerated neurones, homologous  cells that are capable of replacing them anatomically and functionally .  This so called âsubstitutiveâ therapeutics is essentially based, at this  moment, upon the use of neural cells obtained from human foetuses  following elective abortions. Second, proteins have been identifi ed  that are able to protect neurones against various experimental  aggressions in animals and are, therefore, good candidates to rescue  neurones affected, though not yet degenerated, during disease  progression.

Dysfunction of wild type huntingtin in Huntingtonâs  Disease,S28.,Cattaneo,"Department of Pharmacological Sciences and Center of Excellence  on Neurodegenerative Diseases, University of Milano, Milan, Italy","Huntingtin is a cytoskeletal protein which is important for neuronal  survival and activity. Attention onto this protein stems from the  knowledge that an expansion in the variable CAG tract in the  encoding gene causes Huntingtonâs Disease (HD), an inherited,  fatal,autosomal dominant neurodegenerative disorder characterized  by selective loss of the striatal neurons (HDCRG, Cell, 1993). Evidence indicate that HD occurs through a gained toxicity of  mutant huntingtin. More recently, the possibility that loss of normal  huntingtin function may contribute to HD has gained considerable  attention (Rigamonti, J. Neuroscience 2000; Cattaneo, Trends in  Neuroscience, 2001). We indeed report that normal (but not mutant)  huntingtin is able to increase the transcription of Brain Derived  Neurotrophic Factor in cortex, which is then delivered to striatum via  the cortico striatal afferents and thereby acting, within striatum, as a  survival factor (Zuccato, Science, 2001). Loss of this activity occurs  in HD due to huntingtinâs mutation leading to striatal vulnerability.  Strategies aimed at restoring normal huntingtin activities in HD may  therefore be beneficial.",2002
Stem cells and functional neurogenesis in the adult  brain,S29.,M. Cassidy,"Department of Cell and Molecular Biology, Medical Nobel Institute,  Karolinska Institute, Stockholm, Sweden","Over the past decade it has become clear that stem cells in the adult  mammalian brain continuously generate new neurons, predominantly  in the hippocampus and olfactory bulb. Data generated in our  laboratory demonstrate that ependymal cells lining the ventricular  system of the brain and spinal cord function as neural stem cells  in the adult CNS. Ependymal cells divide rarely to give rise to subventricular zone progenitor cells, which generate neuroblasts  that migrate to the olfactory bulb. In response to a spinal cord injury ,  ependymal cells lining the central canal are induced to proliferate  and generate migratory progeny that differentiate into astrocytes and  contribute scar formation. Recent data from our laboratory further demonstrate that these stem  cells also generate neurons in unexpected regions of the brain,  suggesting that adult neurogenesis is even more widespread than  previously thought. Given the expanding implications of adult neurogenesis, the central  issue of whether neurons generated in the adult mammalian brain  actually participate in functional synaptic circuitry has yet to be  resolved. We have used virus based transsynaptic neuronal tracing  to demonstrate that neurons generated in different regions of the  adult brain integrate correctly into the existing synaptic circuitry .  Furthermore, we demonstrate that neurons generated in the adult  brain respond to a physiological stimulus and are thus functional.  Taken together, these findings may have implications for our  understanding of the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders  and further provide a promising foundation for the development of  therapeutic strategies to stimulate neurogenesis in the adult brain.

W e  present the principle for this new assay together with preliminary  experimentation substantiating its practicability and future potential. Maternal blood samples (10 20 ml) are collected in EDTA tubes.  Foetal cells are firstly enriched using a Triple Density Gradient  and then fixed in 3:1 methanol:acetic acid. The cells are spread  on clean glass slides and aged on a hot plate (40 50Â°C) for 2 h.

The enzymatic reaction is  stopped by washing in 2xSSC at room temperature; the slides are  then dehydrated through an ethanol series and air dried. Telomeres  are identified by FISH with a pantelomeric DNA probe. Foetal and  adult cell nuclei are differentiated by their respective telomere  fluorescence: foetal nuclei are expected to be brightly fluorescing  while adult nuclei should contain little or no telomere fluorescence.

We identified a heterozygous nucleotidic variation of one Concurrent Sessions62 63 of the 3 tested genes in 6/30 patients: i) a P1039L mutation of the  RET gene (HS case), ii) a recurrent GDNF gene mutation of the in  2 CCHS patients (R93W), and, iii) 2 heterozygous polyalanine tract  contractions of 5/13 and 8/13 codons as well as a de novo P18T  missense mutation of the HASH1 gene in 2 CCHS and 1 HS cases.  These DNA variations were not found in 180 control chromosomes  and concern amino acids conserved in mammalians. Although  polyalanine expansions are well documented in human, contractions  have not been hitherto reported. In vitro studies will investigate the  putative role of these mutations on HASH1 function. Finally, these  findings support the view of the involvement of genes participating  to the HASH1 / RET / GDNF signalling pathway and an oligogenic  inheritance of CCHS.",2002

Each study highlights regions of  interest, which nevertheless rarely achieve the genome wide level of  significance. However, some studies tend to pinpoint the same broad  area of the genome. A meta analysis method GSMA (Wise et al, 1999) was proposed to  globally interpret full genome scan results. It has then been extended  to take into account replication studies on more restricted genome  regions (Wise, 2001). Briefly, this method is based on the sum of the  ranks of the linkage statistics obtained for a set of chromosome bins. Four genome scans has been carried out by the partners of the  European Cluster on CD, using the same statistic. Each partner also  carried out replication studies on additional sample of families. GSMA was first applied to the genome scans only. Apart from the  well known risk factor in the HLA region on 6q, regions 2q, 5q, 11q  and 14q were significant at the 5% level. Region 5q was pinpointed  in 3 out of the 4 scans, 11q in 2 out of the 4. Region 2q contains the  CTLA4/CD28 cluster whose role in CD has been suggested by other  studies. Accounting for the different replication studies carried out by  the European partners, strengthens the evidence for region 5q.

Freedman, S. S. Rich","Wake Forest University School of Medicine, Winston Salem, NC","Carotid artery intimal medial thickness (IMT) is a strong predictor  of subsequent cardiovascular morbidity. The role of genetic factors  in thickening of the carotid wall remains largely unknown. We  hypothesize that in families with multiple members having diabetes,  carotid IMT is influenced by both inherited and environmental factors.  Familial aggregation of carotid IMT in the presence of type 2 diabetes  was studied in 252 individuals with type 2 diabetes from 122 families  enrolled in the Diabetes Heart Study. Common carotid artery IMT  was measured by high resolution B mode ultrasonography. Other  measured factors included lipid levels, body mass index, fasting  glucose, hemoglobin A1c, albumin creatinine ratio, and self reported  medical history. Heritability estimates were obtained using the  variance component approach implemented in the software SOLAR.  Tests of association between carotid IMT and these variables were  performed using mixed model analysis that accounts for familial  correlation. The sample was 89% Caucasian (11% African American),  59% female and had a meanÂ±SD for age and duration of diabetes of  60.6Â±10.4 and 11.2Â±7.9, respectively. In a multivariate model, carotid  IMT was positively associated with age (p=0.001), male gender  (p=0.001), African American ethnicity (p=0.020), smoking (p=0.001),  hypertension (p=0.040), and total cholesterol (p=0.019). Adjusting  for age, gender and ethnicity, we estimated the heritability (h2Â±SE)  for carotid IMT to be 0.32Â±0.17 (P=0.030). Further adjusting for total  cholesterol, hypertension status and current smoking status yielded  an estimate of 0.41Â±0.16 (P = 0.005).

Comparison of strategies to detect the role of a  candidate gene,C12.,"Jannot1,2, L. Essioux2, M. G. Reese2, F. Clerget Darpoux1","1UnitÃ© INSERM 535, Le Kremlin BicÃªtre, France, 2ValiGen, La  DÃ©fense, France","To detect the effect of a candidate gene in a multifactorial trait, one  acknowledged strategy is to genotype all its known intragenic SNPs  and to test the association between each SNP separately and the  trait. One difficulty is that the model underlying the association of the  gene to the trait can be more complex and involve a combination  of intragenic SNPs. The effect of a gene might not be detected  if each SNP has only small marginal effect on the trait. A second  possible strategy is to test the association of the trait with the  combination formed by the whole set of SNPs. Because only some  of the genotyped SNPs belongs to the functional combination, the  information used for this test is diluted. To overcome this drawback,  a third strategy is to test the association with all the possible  combinations of variable numbers of SNPs. When the functional  combination is tested, the information is not diluted. The gain of  power by using this strategy is balanced by the correction for multiple  testing. Herein, we performed simulation studies based on genotypic  data taken from three genes to compare these three strategies.  Different models of correspondence between a quantitative trait and  the genotype were considered. We found that the strategy that gives  the best power is very model dependent. C 3.

However,  neurological findings of progressive action tremor, ataxia, cognitive  decline, and generalized brain atrophy have recently been described  in some adult males with premutation alleles. Neurohistological  studies on the brains of four adult male carriers (range: 70 135 CGG  repeats) who had the neurological findings reveal ubiquitin positive,  intranuclear inclusions in both neuronal and astrocytic cells, with  highest frequencies (~40% of neuronal nuclei) in the hippocampus.  Intranuclear inclusions were absent from Purkinje cells, although  inclusions were present in a small number of neurons in the dentate  nucleus and diffusely in cerebellar astrocytes. The presence of  intranuclear inclusions in all brains examined to date is strongly  supportive of association with the premutation alleles. Results from  additional brains, including a carrier female with no neurological  findings, will be presented. The mechanistic basis for the inclusions  is not known. FMRP (lymphocyte) levels are generally near normal  in the mid premutation range, although FMR1 mRNA levels are  elevated by 2 to 5 fold in this range. The absence of an abnormal  protein product in fragile X carriers suggests that the ubiquitin  positive inclusions may reflect a general cellular (neuronal) response  in which the cellâs protein degradative capacity is exceeded as a  consequence of altered gene regulation. The intranuclear inclusions  observed with the CAG (polyglutamine) repeat disorders (e.g.,  Huntingtonâs, the SCAs) may reflect a similar (general) mechanism.  These models will be discussed.",2002

At least eight autosomal genes for idiopathic  epilepsy have been identified, and many more for conditions where  epilepsy is a feature. We have identified mutations in a novel human  X chromosome linked, Aristaless related homeobox gene (ARX), in  nine X linked families with mental retardation and epilepsy.

This  mutation results in a glycine being replaced by an arginine (G381R)  and alternative splicing since the GâC transversion occurs at the   1 position of the 5â splice junction of intron 7. Two female relatives  who are heterozygous for the SLC6A8 mutation also exhibit mild  mental retardation with behavior and learning problems. Males with  the mutation have highly elevated creatine in their urine and creatine  uptake by fibroblasts from affected males was impaired reflecting the  deficiency in creatine transport. Based on an observed 30% excess of males in the MR population,  XLMR should result in a frequency of 15% of all cases of MR.  However, many surveys report less than 5% of cases resulting from  XLMR. Numerous factors may be responsible for this discrepancy,  a major one being few XLMR entities have an associated metabolic  abnormality, which might bring them to attention. The ability to  measure elevated creatine in urine or serum makes it possible to  screen for SLC6A8  deficiency in males with MR of unknown etiology. The SLC6A8 finding, in conjunction with the association of MR with  the creatine biosynthesis defects (AGAT and GAMT deficiencies),  clearly indicates the importance of creatine metabolism in brain function.

The extreme genetic heterogeneity of idiopathic MR  and the unavailability of large family pedigrees of nonsyndromic  autosomal recessive MR has limited the use of genetic linkage to  identify the disease causing genes. While a large number of X linked  mental retardation genes have been found, none of the numerous  genes involved in autosomal recessive MR have been hitherto  identified.

","The t(4;8)(p16;p23) translocation, either in the balanced or  unbalanced form, has been reported in more than 14 cases. The  detection of this rearrangement in routine cytogenetics is difficult.  Its incidence, therefore, may be underestimated, and it could  represent the second most frequent translocation in man, after the  t(11q;22q). Der(4) patients have the Wolf Hirschhorn syndrome  whereas the der(8) subjects show a different spectrum of dysmorphic  features. We had recently reported an inversion polymorphism of  two olfactory receptors (OR) gene clusters at 8p23 triggering de  novo chromosomal rearrangements. Two OR gene clusters are also  present at 4p16. We thus investigated whether OR polymorphisms  at 4p16 and 8p23 were involved in the t(4;8)(p16;p23). In one  balanced and six unbalanced cases, we demonstrated that the  translocation breakpoints fall at the OR gene clusters. Heterozygous  submicroscopic inversions at both the 4p OR  and 8p OR gene  clusters were found in all the five mothers at whose meiosis the  translocation occurred. The heterozygous 4p16 inversion was found  in 12% control subjects. We have previously found 8p inversion  heterozygosity in 26% control subjects. In agreement with statistical  expectation, 2.5% of the population was found double heterozygous.  Our results suggest that rearrangements involving non homologous  chromosomes can occur as a consequence of specific genomic  polymorphisms.",2002

Noonan Syndrome (NS) is a multiple congenital abnormality  syndrome characterised by short stature, typical facial appearance,  pulmonary stenosis (PS), hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM),  pectus deformities and cryptorchidism. It has previously been  mapped to 12q24 but NS is known to be genetically heterogeneous. Mutations in the non receptor protein tyrosine phosphatase gene  PTPN11 have recently been shown to cause Noonan Syndrome  in some patients. Molecular analysis may be useful to identify  affected individuals, allowing more accurate genetic counselling  and awareness of potential complications. Presence of the PTPN11  mutation may also predict the likelihood of specific features of NS. Methods. We reviewed the clinical and molecular findings of 127 patients who  fulfilled the diagnostic criteria of NS. The incidence of the mutation  was then compared with the presence of the major clinical features. Results. Mutations were identified in 52 (41%) of the group and were mostly  concentrated in 2 exons. 70% of the mutation group had PS and  4% had HCM compared to 47% and 23% of the non mutation group  (p=0.01 and 0.03) respectively. Frequency of short stature and pectus  deformities was similar in the two groups. 76% of those with the  mutation attended a mainstream school as opposed to 67% of those  without and cryptorchidism was found in 84% and 68% respectively  (not significant). Conclusions. Mutations in PTPN11 have improved the phenotypic recognition of  NS and are associated with a high incidence of PS. HCM appears to  be more common in other genetic forms of the syndrome.",2002

There are  many genes involved in the development of the anterior segment  of the eye and this is reflected in the marked heterogeneity in the  genetic causation of hereditary congenital cataract and anterior  segment dysgenesis. We identified a three generation family with  cataract and Peters anomaly, where there was a chromosomal  rearrangement in balanced and unbalanced forms with breakpoints at 16q23.2 and 5p15.3. Cloning of the 16q23.2 breakpoint identifi ed  a break through the genomic control domain of MAF, a basic region  leucine zipper (bZIP) transcription factor, expressed in mammalian  lens development. This breakpoint transected the common fragile  site, FRA16D. Screening of other families and individuals with  similar ocular phenotypes identified an R288P mutation in the highly  evolutionarily conserved DNA binding domain of MAF, in a three  generation family with cataract, microcornea and iris coloboma.  The mutation co segregated with disease in the family and was  not present in 496 normal control chromosomes. The results in  these two families indicate that the lens development gene, MAF,  is a human disease gene in congenital cataract and anterior  segment abnormality. These findings further implicate MAF in lens  development and emphasise the importance of the lens in formation  of the ocular anterior segment. The presence of iris coloboma in one  of the families broadens the possible role of MAF in development of  the anterior segment.",2002

Mortimer","St Georgeâs Hospital Medical School, London, United Kingdom","Lymphoedema Distichiasis Syndrome (LD)(OMIM 153400) is a rare,  primary lymphoedema of pubertal onset, associated with distichiasis.  Causative mutations have now been described in FOXC2, a forkhead  transcription factor gene. Numerous clinical associations have been  reported with this condition including congenital heart disease, ptosis,  varicose veins, cleft palate and spinal extradural cysts. In this paper  we now report clinical findings in 74 affected individuals, from 18  families and 6 isolated cases. All of these individuals were shown  to have mutations in FOXC2 with the exception of one family who  had two affected individuals with lymphoedema and distichiasis and  linkage consistent with the16q24 locus. The presence of lymphoedema was highly penetrant. Males had  an earlier onset of lymphoedema and a significantly increased  risk of complications. Lymphatic imaging confirmed the earlier  suggestion that LD is associated with hyperplasia of the lymphatics  rather than the hypo or aplasia seen in other forms of primary  lymphoedema. Distichiasis was 94.2% penetrant, but not always  symptomatic. Associated findings included ptosis (31%), congenital  heart disease (6.8%) and cleft palate (4%). Other than distichiasis,  the most commonly occurring anomaly was varicose veins of early  onset (49%). This has not been previously reported and suggests a  possible developmental role for FOXC2 in both venous and lymphatic  systems.

A classification of disorders with abnormal vertebral  segmentation,C30.,"D. Turnpenny1,2, J. Duncan2, S. Ellard2","1Royal Devon & Exeter Hospital, Exeter, United Kingdom, 2University  of Exeter, Exeter, United Kingdom","Abnormal vertebral segmentation (AVS) is an important diagnostic  handle and occurs in a wide variety of syndromes, e.g. Goldenhar/ facio auriculo vertebral spectrum, VATER/VACTERL association,  trisomy 8 mosaicism and maternal diabetes. However, the use of  terminology in clinical practice is not consistent and the literature  is correspondingly confusing for a wide variety of radiological  phenotypes. The identification of a number of murine somitogenesis  genes with important roles in normal development of the axial  skeleton makes it possible to approach this complex field  systematically. In man, mutations in genes of the Notch  signalling  pathway are the first to enable a classification based on genotype  phenotype correlation. Jagged1  is implicated in Alagille syndrome,  which includes butterfly vertebrae, and DLL3  in autosomal recessive  spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD), in which a consistent pattern of  AVS throughout the spine occurs in association with rib fusions.  We propose the designation SCD type 1 for cases due to mutated  DLL3  and SCD type 2 for similar phenotypes not DLL3  linked. There  is no definite evidence as yet that DLL3  is implicated in autosomal  dominant forms of AVS. Mutations in ROR2  cause autosomal  recessive Robinow syndrome, whilst Jarcho Levin syndrome  (spondylo thoracic  dysostosis/dysplasia) has been mapped to  2q32.1. These are specific recognisable entities which are usually  distinguishable from the many sporadic cases of AVS. We propose  a system of classification based on syndromic AVS, âpureâ SCD due  to disrupted somitogenesis, neural tube associated AVS, and a large  group of unknowns which will become the focus of new research from  murine derived candidate genes.",2002

Thomsen and Kemp/Ravn in two classical  papers described two large families with autosomal dominant axial  synpolydactyly (SPD) with remarkable phenotypic differences.  Presently, we have extended these families to 10 and 8 generations  (169 and 366 individuals), and identified the mutations as 9  and  7 residue polyalanine tract expansions of HOXD13, respectively.  The developmental field affected by the shorter expansion involves  digits 1 5 (including syndactyly 1 2 and duplication of the index  finger) whereas the 9 residue polyalanine expansion affects digits  3 4 (synpolydactyly). The large sizes of these two families permits  a detailed genotype phenotype study, which so far confirms an enormous variability of expressivity. In one carrier of the 9 residue  expansion, abnormal flexion creases were the only visible trait  affected, suggesting that inclusion of this trait may increase the  penetrance in other SPD families. The access to a large number of  probands and families with limb defects, which often can be traced  and reinvestigated over many generations, and the nation wide public  health care system with centralized registration of all individuals in  Denmark provides a unique back bone for identifying novel limb  defect genes and phenotypes.

Consistent  with this hypothesis, in two pedigrees segregating three BBS mutant  alleles, we have identified unaffected individuals who carry two  BBS2  mutations but not a BBS6  mutation.

Using PCR based analysis with dHPLC technology, we have  identified a number of new mutations (both dominant and recessive)  and coding polymorphisms in these four connexin genes. These  and previously identified mutations have been further characterised.  GFP tagged connexin fusion proteins have been used to study  mutant connexins particularly with respect to junction assembly and  channel function in keratinocytes and HeLa cells. After transfection,  the wildtype GFP Cx30 fusion protein was localised at the plasma  membrane in a characteristic punctate pattern showing functional gap  junctions between adjoining cells.

Histologically, the distended veins present  smooth muscle like âglomus cellsâ in the media. GVMs are usually  dominantly inherited and, with the more common mucocutaneous  venous malformations, they are among the most frequent lesions in  centers that specialize in treatment of vascular anomalies (Vikkula et  al., 1998). In another abstract submitted to this meeting, we describe  the criteria for clinical differential diagnosis between common VM and  GVM (Boon et al.). Using positional cloning, we recently identified the causative gene  that we named glomulin (Brouillard et al., AJHG in press). As 13  of the 14 mutations identified in 20 families cause premature stop  codons, GVMs are likely to be caused by loss of function of glomulin.  As these inherited vascular lesions are localized, we hypothesized  that haploinsufficiency is not enough for the development of  lesions, but a somatic second hit, leading to complete localized  lack of glomulin, is needed (Knudsonâs double hit hypothesis for  retinoblastoma). We have now screened for somatic mutations in  GVM lesions, and report on the identification of a truncating mutation  that was different from the patientâs inherited genetic alteration and  that was not seen in genomic DNA extracted from blood. Thus, it is  a de novo somatic mutation in DNA of the GVM lesion. Other tissue  samples are being tested to confirm this promising finding. These  data support our hypothesis that GVMs are due to complete localized  loss of glomulin function. (vikkula@bchm.ucl.ac.be)",2002

","It is becoming clear that coding region mutations do not always  exert their effect simply by changing the amino acid sequence of the  encoded protein. In order to examine the frequency and mechanisms  underlying missplicing caused by simple coding region mutations,  we have analyzed cDNA from a large number of alleles with disease  causing mutations in either of three acyl CoA dehydrogenase (MCAD,  VLCAD and SBCAD) genes. In all three genes we have identified  missense mutations that despite the fact that they are located far  from the exon intron junctions lead to exon skipping as the main  molecular defect. These mutations were always located in exons with  suboptimal splice sites indicating a requirement for splice enhancers.  Using transfection studies in CHANG  and COS cells with wild type  and mutant MCAD minigene constructs, we have so far reproduced  the exon skipping caused by one of the missense mutations  (362C>T). Computer analysis indicated that this mutation disrupts  an exonic splice enhancer (ESE) consensus sequence recognized  by SF2/ASF, and this was examined by mutagenesis of neighboring  positions. The missplicing could be corrected by cotransfection of the  splicefactor SF2/ASF, and other SR proteins also had a correcting  effect. Similarly, we are underway with minigene based analysis of  SBCAD and VLCAD missense mutations that are indicated to cause  exon skipping as a result of splice enhancer inactivation. We conclude that it is not uncommon that simple coding region  mutations lead to disruption of ESE sequences, which are necessary  for correct splicing of exons with suboptimal splice consensus  sequences.Concurrent Sessions68 69 C 7.

To systematically map 3q amplicons in  these tumors, we designed a chromosome 3 BAC/PAC array for high  resolution Comparative Genomic Hybridization (or CGH array). We  demonstrated, with cell lines containing constitutional chromosome 3  abnormalities, that CGH array allows the detection of low level DNA   copy number changes. By this method, we found a narrow (less than  6 Mb) high level amplification at 3q25.3 in a head and neck cell line,  Cal 27. Further mapping of the amplification by semi quantitative  PCR showed a core amplicon of 3Mb. We performed the transcriptional comparison of Cal 27 and Hs  677.Tg, a normal head and neck cell line, with cDNA microarrays.  Among 438 genes mapped on chromosome 3, the one showing the  greatest overexpression (10 fold increase) is located in the core  amplicon, and encodes a protein from the cyclin family, named cyclin  L/ania 6a. According to these results, we propose cyclin L/ania 6a as  a new oncogene at 3q25.3. Its involvement in head and neck cancer  is currently evaluated by cyclin L expression measurement in a series  of primary tumors.",2002
Functional analysis of MMR gene mutations linked  to hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer,C40.,"NystrÃ¶m Lahti , R. Kariola, T. Raevaara, K. LÃ¶nnqvist","University of Helsinki, Helsinki, Finland","To date, five mismatch repair (MMR) genes, MLH1, MSH2, MSH6,  MSH3, and PMS2 are known to be involved in human MMR function.  Two of those, MLH1 and MSH2 are further the most common  susceptibility genes in hereditary non polyposis colorectal cancer  (HNPCC), whereas MSH3 and PMS2 is not or only in few cases,  respectively shown to be involved in HNPCC. Although, the ever  increasing number of mutations is reported in the MSH6 gene, the  mutations are mainly linked to putative HNPCC families. Especially ,  the early age at onset and high microsatellite instability (MSI) in  tumors, the main hallmarks in HNPCC, are not typical for MSH6 mutation carriers. Based on the less typical clinical and molecular  features linked to especially MSH6 but also to some MLH1 and  MSH2 mutation carriers and their cancers, there is a cause to ask  what really is HNPCC syndrome. High MSI is a consequence of  MMR defect in the cell and consistently, the pathogenicity of germline  mutations in HNPCC is linked to malfunction of MMR. To address  the question, we studied the functionality of mutated MMR proteins  in an in vitro MMR assay. Our results are clinically relevant since  they demonstrate that in the stable in vitro circumstances, when the  amounts of the proteins are adequate for repair, many mutations  found from putative HNPCC families do not affect the repair function,  whereas all the tested mutations found from typical HNPCC families  impart a MMR deficient phenotype on the altered polypeptide.",2002

We show that CHK2  1100delC,  a truncating variant that abrogates the kinase activity, has a  frequency of 1.1% in healthy controls. This indicates that this variant  cannot be acting as a high penetrance Li Fraumeni predisposition  allele, as previously postulated, because this syndrome is very rare.

Recombinant human alpha  GalA (r h alpha GalA) enzyme replacement therapy was previously  evaluated in a randomized placebo controlled, double blind study  of 58 Fabry patients who received r h alpha GalA or placebo every  2 weeks for 20 weeks. The accumulated GL 3 was cleared in renal  (P<0.001), cardiac (P<0.001) and skin (P<0.001) capillary endothelial  cells of the treated group (N Engl J Med 2001; 345: 9 16). Methods:  Of these patients, 55/58 (95%) have continued treatment  with r h alpha GalA (1 mg/kg q 2wk) for an additional 12 months in an  open label extension study. Results:  The drug was well tolerated except for minor, conservatively  managed infusion reactions, the incidence of which decreased over  time. The infusion reactions were associated with IgG antibody  seroconversion that did not affect therapeutic effect. The IgG titers  in 50% of patients decreased by at least four fold with time. Mean  infusion time decreased to 2.25 hr. Renal function remained stable throughout the study, and subset analysis of high risk populations (age>35 and creatinine clearance<80ml) also revealed  stability at 18 months. The median percent reduction in plasma GL 3 was  100% after 12 months. GL 3 was also cleared/reduced in various  renal and skin cell types. Pain scores measured by the Short Form  McGill Pain questionnaire improved with therapy.

More recently, mutations in a previously undescribed gene  of unknown function (BSCL2) on chromosome 11, termed seipin,  have been found to be responsible for this disorder in a number  of European and Middle Eastern families. We have studied the  genotype/phenotype relationships in 71 affected subjects from 45  apparently unrelated pedigrees. In all subjects, hepatic dysfunction,  hyperlipidaemia, diabetes mellitus and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy  were significant contributors to morbidity with no clear differences  in their prevalence between subjects with BSCL1, BSCL2 and  those with evidence against linkage to either chromosomes 9 or 1 1  (designated BSCLX).

Most patients with  RCDP have mutations in the PEX7 gene encoding peroxin 7, the  cytosolic PTS2 receptor protein required for targeting a subset of  enzymes to peroxisomes. These enzymes are deficient in cells of  RCDP patients due to their mislocalisation to the cytoplasm. Here, we report the mutational spectrum in the PEX7 gene of 78  patients (including 5 pairs of sibs) clinically and biochemically  diagnosed with RCDP type I. We found 22 different mutations  including 18 novel ones. Furthermore, we show by functional  analysis that disease severity correlates with PEX7 allele activity:  expression of 8 different alleles from severe RCDP patients failed  to restore the targeting defect in RCDP fibroblasts, while two alleles  found only in mild patients complemented the targeting defect upon  overexpression. Surprisingly, one of the mild alleles comprises a  duplication of nucleotides 45 52 predicted to lead to a frameshift  at codon 17 and no functional peroxin 7. The ability of this allele to  complement the targeting defect in RCDP cells suggests that frame  restoration occurs resulting in full length functional peroxin 7, which  leads to amelioration of the predicted severe phenotype. This was  confirmed in vitro by expression of the 8nt duplication containing  sequence fused in different reading frames to the coding sequence of  firefly luciferase in COS cells.",2002

SLOS is caused by mutations in the delta 7 sterol reductase  gene (DHCR7; E.C. 1.3.1.21) which impair endogeneous  cholesterol biosynthesis making the growing embryo dependent  from exogeneous (maternal) sources of cholesterol. We here have  investigated whether the apo E gene which is a major component of  the cholesterol transport system in humans is a modifier of the SLOS.  Common apo E genotypes and DHCR7 genotypes were determined  in 103 biochemically characterized SLOS patients and in 47 of  their mothers. The SLOS patients clinical severity score correlated  significantly (p = 0.009) with the maternal but not the patients apo  E genotype. In line with their effects on cholesterol levels the apo  e4 allele was associated with a mild and the e2 allele with a severe  SLOS phenotype (p = 0.023). The correlation of apo E genotype with  disease severity persisted after stratification for DHCR7 genotype  but disappeared when cholesterol concentrations were considered.

One of the  recently identified genes, GD1, encodes aGdi, one of the proteins  controlling the activity of the small GTPases of the Rab family in  vesicle fusion and intracellular trafficking. It was suggested that, in  brain, the main role of aGDI was to interact with Rab3A, the Rab  protein participating in synaptic vesicle fusion and neurotransmitter  release. To establish how lack of aGDI could cause mental retardation, we  generated mice carrying a deletion of Gdi1 resulting in complete loss  of aGDI. The mice were viable and fertile. Histological analysis of  brains revealed trilamination of the infrapyramidal mossy fibers and  disorganized CA3 pyramidal cells in the hippocampus of mutants, as  the only visible defect. The Gdi1 deficient mice were normal in many tasks to assess  learning capacity and emotional behavior. They were impaired in  tasks requiring formation of temporal associations suggesting defects  in short term memory. They also show lowered aggression and  altered social behavior.

","The ATR X ( Î± thalassaemia/mental retardation X linked) and  Rubinstein Taybi syndromes are two examples of mental retardation  and multiple congenital malformation disorders caused by mutations  in transcription regulators (ATRX and CBP, respectively). The  presence of a determinate spectrum of affected tissues indicates  that both the ATRX and CBP mutations modify the expression of a  restricted class of genes, but these genes are as yet unidentified.  A general tool to recognize the target genes of a transcriptional  modulator could be the silencing of the regulator and the subsequent  research of the genes that present altered expression. Since the  main clinical feature of both syndromes is the mental retardation, we  performed the gene silencing experiments in NT2 cells that provide a  model of the human neuronal differentiation. To block ATRX and CBP  gene function, we have chosen the new strategy of RNA interference.  The NT2 cells were separately transfected with two small interfering  RNAs, one for ATRX knock out and one for CBP blocking. The ATRX  expression was specifically reduced of about 90% by the cognate  siRNA, but not by the siRNA directed against CBP. Similarly, a CBP  protein reduction of more than 90% was observed only when the CBP  siRNA was used.

In postnatal life  only trisomies of chromosome 21, 13 or 18 are consistently detected. Each produces a distinct clinical syndrome with considerable  variability in the severity and pattern of associated malformations,  which cannot be accurately predicted by the karyotype. We perform  transcriptome analyses using mRNA extracted from human trisomy  21 and 13 primary amniocytes. These cells are of fetal origin and  easily available following routine diagnostic testing. A commercial  microarray system with ~9000 different human cDNAs was  used. A subset of the microarray derived gene expression ratios  were also confirmed using the LightCycler system. Compared  to normal amniocytes relatively few (0.7 3.2%) genes show  substantial misregulation and these differ between the trisomies.  Remarkably, when all the ratios were averaged by chromosome  (âtranscriptosomeâ) only the relevant trisomic transcriptosome  showed significant differences. The levels of these up regulations  were 1.14 for trisomy 21 and 1.06 for trisomy 13. The majority of  altered expression is, however, secondary and scattered around  the genome. We then used the bioinformatics tool PubGene to  arrange expression data into potentially interacting gene networks.  For example, several different matrix metalloproteinases (MMP10,  MMP7, MMP1, TIMP3) are >1.7 fold upregulated in trisomy 21  whereas several insulin like growth factor binding protein associated  genes (IGFBP4, IGFBP5, SERPINE1, EDN1, CTGF & THBS1) were  >1.7 fold down regulated.

We examined a member  of the non classic type seven pass transmembrane cadherins, the  human homologue of Drosophila  Flamingo gene   Celsr1 . It maps  to chromosome 22q13.31, a region of positive linkage results in  schizophrenia and manic depressive illness. The gene contains  nine cadherin ectodomain repeats seven EGF like repeats, two  laminin A G type repeats coupled to a seven pass transmembrane  domain. Celsr1  is a neural specific gene that plays a role in early  embryogenesis, cell adhesion and signal transduction. The first exon is 3,544nt in length and encodes for the signal peptide  and all nine ectodomains in the protein. We screened this exon in 24  schizophrenic patients with dHPLC followed by sequencing. Three  amino acid changes were identified and submitted to HGBASE:  CTG1665 GTG (L555V, SNP001026397), T CG1989T GG (S663W,  SNP001026398) and CGC3375 TGC (R1125C, SNP001026399).  An R119G SNP from public databases (TSC0242402) was not  polymorphic in this population. The three SNPs were genotyped  using primer extension on ABI373 sequencers on a sample of 243  Bulgarian schizophrenic parent offspring trios from 243 nuclear  families, as well as 179 schizophrenics and 163 matched controls  from UK. The three SNPs were in complete LD. There was no  preferential transmission of alleles from heterozygous parents to  affected offspring when analyzed with TDT.

To study whether there is any  preferential selection of either the wild type or the mutant mtDNA   within individuals over time, an extensive longitudinal analysis of  the segregation of the primary LHON mutations ND1/3460 and  ND4/11778 was accomplished.

The strong genetic association of CD with  HLA heterodimers is well known, but there is evidence for the  involvement of additonal genetic risk factors in the HLA region. Lie  et al (1999) suggested that a gene in the vicinity of D6S2223 could  play a role in the pathogenesis of the disease. The TSSP gene  (Thymus Specific Serine Protease), located in this region, is a good  candidate because it is expected to play a role in antigen processing  and presentation pathway in cortical thymic epithelial cells where it is  specifically expressed. We sequenced the 12 exons of the gene and  we identified 1 exonic polymorphism, a deletion of 15 bp in exon 12,  at 8 bp before the stop codon (1520 1544delAGAGCCAGATTAAGG).

PS is widely regarded  as a complex trait and genome wide scans have mapped a number  of loci (PSORS 1 7) contributing to disease susceptibility. We have  assigned the PSORS4 locus to chromosome 1q21, and have recently  refined the susceptibility interval to 100 kb. This minimal region  contains the gene for loricrin (LOR), a keratinocyte structural protein.  LOR is homologous to corneosdesmosin (CDSN), an extensively  investigated positional candidate for the PSORS1 locus. Interestingly ,  both LOR and CDSN genes show an altered expression in psoriatic  lesions. We performed a genetic analysis of the LOR gene in a sample of  Italian psoriatic trios. We first re sequenced the LOR coding region  and its 5â/3â UTRs in 8 patients and identified 2 novel SNPs and a  6bp in frame duplication. We therefore analysed these variants,  as well as a previously published 12 bp duplication, in 90 trios,  each including an affected offspring and both parents. We tested  for association using the Transmission Disequilibrium Test and by  assessing deviation from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). This  latter test identified a significant heterozygote excess (p = 1.8 x 10 4  ) for a coding SNP in exon 2. The analysis of 40 unrelated healthy  controls confirmed that the SNP is in equilibrium among unaffected,  indicating that the deviation from HWE observed in patients is likely  to be disease related.

The investigations on transcriptional level were carried out using a  competitive RT PCR. For specific detection of LRP protein expression  we applied a macro array analysis. As a reference we used a  commercially available LRP standard protein (Biomac). Results:  We  measured a significantly 1.82 fold higher LRP mRNA expression in  coronary patients in comparison to healthy controls (223ag/cell vs.  122.3ag/cell, p<0.001). However the investigation of LRP protein  expression revealed an inverse pattern: Whereas the expression of  the coronary patients amounted to 1.6pg/cell the controls showed a  significant higher protein expression of 6pg/cell (p<0.001). Obviously  a high LRP mRNA expression was associated with a low protein  expression, and vice versa. These results suggest a complex  regulatory mechanism of the LRP at transcriptional and translational  level. The detected lower protein expression in coronary patients may  be due to a severe unbalanced metabolism in atherosclerosis. This  could lead to a diminished receptor mediated endocytotic pathway in  coronary patients which may then be compensated by increasing the  mRNA expression.

","Anticipation refers to an earlier age at onset and increased severity  of illness in offspring, compared to parents. It is usually caused by  dynamic mutations. Anticipation has been observed in psychiatric disorders. We have collected 608 parent offspring trios where the  proband had a diagnosis of Schizophrenia (SZ), Bipolar Affective  Disorder (BP) or Schizoaffective Disorder (SA). Diagnoses were  made on the basis of clinical records and structured clinical interviews  of probands. In 40 families (6.5%) the proband had a parent who had  one of the above diagnoses. We used age at onset (AO) as the main  variable for assessment of anticipation. A well known bias operates  in such studies, because psychiatric patients are less likely to have  children after they get ill, so that affected parents of probands are  likely to have a later AO. An additional bias operates in our sample,  as all patients were quite young (all their parents were still alive). In  order to reduce the bias, we looked at two subsamples: a) families  where parents became ill before their child was born, and b) families  where the affected offspring has children. The results were analysed  with paired samples T test. The offspring had an earlier AO not only  in the general sample, but also in a) and b) subsamples (Table 1).

Factor VII (FVII) is a vitamin k dependent serine protease enzyme  essential for initiating the coagulation cascade via the extrinsic  pathway. Reduced FVII levels cause bleeding disease, whereas  increased levels are associated with thrombosis. Some mutations  have been described which modulate levels of this protein. We have studied two different assymptomatic patients with FVII  levels lower than 3% of normal values. We have sequenced the  entire FVII gene (promotor, exons, introns and 3â UTR: 15kb) to  identify mutations of this gene in families. A Gln100Arg mutation located in exon 5 was detected in one patient  in the homozygote state. In this patient, we also identified a novel G  to A substitution at nucleotide 3294. In another patient, we identified  two different mutations: Met298Ile and Gly331Ser in exon 8. This  patient was heterozygous for both of these mutations. Moreover,  other FVII genetic variants that influence FVII levels, are co  segregating in these families. Although some of these mutations have been described as closely  related with bleeding disease, the presence of several putative  functional genetic variants could be responsible for the high variability  in phenotype observed in the family members with the same  mutation. These results clearly show the complexity of FVII deficiency  and the importance of a global effect of multiple quantitative trait  locus (QTLs) in determining FVII levels. Further investigation should  help to identify other QTLs that influence variation in FVII levels  and may help to quantify the relative risk for thrombosis or bleeding  disease.Posters   Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 76 77",2002

Eiberg2","1Oxford University, Oxford, United Kingdom, 2Institute of Medical  Biochemistry and Genetics, Copenhagen, Denmark","Penrose introduced sib pair analysis in 1935: an essential feature  was ascertainment for one or more affected sibs providing controls  data against unrelated sib similarity. (www.gene.ucl.ac.uk/anhumgen/ ). Most recent sib pair studies are restricted to affected sib pairs  and assume the parental gametes present at ascertainment are  representative of those present before fertilisation, each allele having  an equal chance of both achieving fertilisation and surviving birth. Such equality is not to be expected in view of the strong preference  for gametic differences in plants, with evolutionary advantages likely  to be exploited in other species, and losses between conception and  birth from embryonic lethals. Both would lead to excess sib similarity  at neighbouring loci. There are few data relating to sib similarity in  normal sibs. The Danish set of normal families, occasionally supplemented by  families with Mendelian disorders, was started in 1972 and has  provided key information on several assignments, including CF  and Battenâs disease. It includes over 6000 typed individuals in 850  families with about a million genotypes. We present estimates of the same:different ratio of paternal and  maternal alleles passed from parents who were heterozygous and  differed in genotype from the other parent.

This is supported by the familiar accumulation of the  disease. It is the most frequent spine deformity of adolescence.  The etiology is unknown, however difference in sex incidence was  observed, the girls being affected 10 times more likely than boys.  The genetic susceptibility loci of IS have not been identified so far.  We accidentally were able to reveal a possible susceptibility allele  for IS, in the bromodomain PHD finger transcription factor (BPTF).  Two alleles with different size could be obtained with a simple PCR  reaction. A 8.3 kb in homo  and heterozygotes and a 3.5 kb long in  heterozygotes. No homozygotes were detected for the shorter allele.  The 3.5 kb allele possibly resulted via a deletion in the last intron of  BPTF and it appears more frequently in IS (p=0.29) than in control  groups (p=0.16). According to a recent publication the BPTF is the Posters   Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 76 77 human ortholog of Drosophila Nurf301, which is the largest subunit of  a chromatin remodeling NURF complex.

PDD  affect around 1:2500 individuals within the first three years of life with  a sex ratio M:F = 4:1. A strong genetic basis has been recognized and several genomic  studies, as well as cytogenetic observations, have identified at least  12 candidate loci for genes predisposing to PDD. Among these  regions, 15q11 q13, 7q31 and, recently, 22q13, have been most  frequently reported in association with PDD. In order to identify the prevalence of 22q13 rearrangements  (deletions) in PDD we have genotyped, by microsatellite markers  analysis, 110 patients selected through a collaboration with various  italian Child Neuropsychiatry centers. We detected a deletion at the  D22S1169 locus in two patients (one paternally and one maternally  derived) and a maternally derived deletion at the D22S1170 locus  in a third patient. These patients presented with an Angelman like  phenotype, characterized by hypotonia, developmental delay and  absent speech. However, they did not show epilepsy. Although  the pathogenicity of these rearrangements needs to be confirmed  by further studies, our results suggest that deletions within the  22q13 region might play a role in determining PDD in 2.7% of  patients. Considering the marked genetic heterogeneity of PDD, this  percentage appears to be relatively high.",2002

Therefore we screened the promoter  region as well as all exons of the ITGb7 gene, including parts of  the neighbouring introns for common polymorphisms in 32 German  probands. Moreover we then tested single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) for linkage/association with asthma and related traits (total  serum IgE level, eosinophil cell count, peak flow and SLOPE of  the dose response curve after bronchial challenge) in a Caucasian  sib pair study (187 families with at least two affected children). We  also analysed one already described SNP in the human VDR gene.  We could identify three new single nucleotide polymorphisms in the  ITGb7 gene. Two of them are non coding (intron 2 and intron 6) while  the SNP in exon 3 causes an substitution of the amino acid GLU to  VAL. None of the SNPs neither of the ITGb7 nor the VDR gene showed  significant linkage/association with asthma or related phenotypes  in this family study.

Because the 7 repeat allele of  the dopamine D4 receptor (DRD4) exon III has been implicated in  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and there is known  comorbidity between ADHD and dyslexia, we investigated DRD4  as a candidate gene for PCD. In our 2 point screen (FASTLINK)  of the 11p15.5 region in 100 families with at least two siblings  affected with PCD, we found highly suggestive evidence of linkage  to markers D11S1363 (LOD=2.31, theta=0.2), DRD4 exon III  repeat (LOD=2.75, theta=0.2), and HRAS (LOD 2.53, theta=0.2) .  Allowing for heterogeneity (HOMOG), the HLOD for DRD4 was 3.10  with alpha=0.85. Using non parametric affected sib pair analysis  (SIBPAL) on 254 nuclear families derived from our dataset, we also  found significant linkage to DRD4 (p=0.0007) and HRAS (p=0.0011)  . With multipoint linkage analysis (GENEHUNTER), we obtained a  maximum between D11S1363 and DRD4 (HLOD=2.14, alpha=0.75,  NPL 2.37, p=0.009).

However, preliminary  analysis using family based association studies (AFBAC and ETDT)  did not show significant association of PCD with the DRD4 7 repeat  allele. It is possible that the DRD4 7 repeat allele is not pathogenic  in dyslexia, but other mutations in the DRD4 gene not in linkage  disequilibrium with the repeat are involved. Alternatively, it is possible  that another gene closely linked to DRD4 in the 11p15.5 region  influences susceptibility to dyslexia.",2002

The pathogenesis of the AITDs involves a complex interaction  between genetic and environmental factors. Recently, five potential  susceptibility loci for AITD have been mapped to chromosomes  14q31, Xq21.33, 20q11.2, 2q33 and 18q21 in different populations.  In this study, we have investigated a large consanguineous Tunisian  family affected with AITDs. The search for susceptibility genes in this  family was undertaken by means of both linkage and association  analyses. To perform linkage study, a genome screening was done  using microsatellite markers. A single marker located on chromosome  2 (D2S171) showed evidence of linkage with a MMLS c score of  3.03.

Rhythms significance  and parameters like Period, acrophase (Peak time) and amplitudes  were analyzed (by Curvefit). Results : Comparison among rhythms  revealed Gender dependent differences which in turn were also  strain dependent. For example, WBC count rhythm acrophases  differed between c57BL/6J genders but not in BALB/c. The periods  of AP activity rhythms differed only among c57BL/6J genders while  acrophases of AP activity rhythms differed only among BALB/c  gender. The amplitude of CPK activity rhythm was significantly higher  in females of BALB/c then in males while the reverse was observed  among c57BL/6J Genders. Gender differences were recorded also  in the F1 groups. Depending on the examined variable, the rhythm  differences between F1 genders may resemble those shown by one  of the strains or exhibited a new difference range which didnât follow  any of the gender differences (or similarity) exhibited in the parental  stains. Conclusions : 1. Gender dependence differences exist in  variable rhythms even under normal identical conditions. 2. The  range of the differences among genders is strain dependent. 3. The  inheritance mode suggests that each rhythm parameter is individually  controlled (inherited).",2002

At least six distinct chromosomal loci  have been associated with this condition, among them RYR1 gene  encoding calcium channel accounts for about 50% of MH cases. In this study we focused on a unique Israeli family, where MH  segregated along three living generations and 8 out of 10 family  members were tested in a skeletal muscle contractility in vitro  assay (IVCT). A comparative genetic analysis of MH susceptible  (MHS and MHE) versus normal (MHN) family members was based  on polymorphic markers from two major loci linked to MH, RYR1  on chromosome 19 and DHPR on chromosome 1. Four markers  within 2Mb interval spanning RYR1 gene, D19S191, D19S224,  D19S228 and D19S897, were conclusive as to the linkage of MH  to chromosome 19 RYR1 gene localization. Sequence analysis of  RYR1 exons 11, 17, 39, 40, 45 and 46, where mutations have been  previously reported in Caucasian MH pedigrees, did not reveal  any variation from wild type. A potential functional polymorphism  comprising non perfect trinucleotide repeat within exon 35 was  detected by sequencing and fragment analyses. Further studies on  a population scale are needed to assess the population frequency  and phenotypic significance of this variation. Moreover, two markers  from chromosome 1, D1S2853 and D1S2683, were consistent with  MH susceptible (MHS) versus MH equivocal (MHE) family members,  suggesting possible involvement of DHPR gene on a refined MH  phenotype. This family might represent a unique case of complex inheritance of  two genetic loci involved in predisposition to MH.",2002

In minority of HCM patients hypertrophy isfor unknown reasons  associated with obstruction of the left ventricular outflow tract. We  have investigated the association of an exon 24 SNP in the Ã myosin heavy chain gene (MYH7) with the LVH phenotype. Pyrosequencing  was used for the analysis. The SNP is a silent T/C transition in codon  989. Allele frequencies in EH (n=43) and HCM patients (n=23) did  not differ significantly (EH: C=0.32, T=0.68; HCM: C=0.26, T=0.74).  The left ventricular mass index (in g/m2) was calculated based on  echocardiographic assessments. The following index values were  obtained for CC and CT: 140 Â±9.5 and 166Â±51 g/m2, resp.; and  for TT: 253Â±58 g/m2 (significant difference by ANOVA: F=4.02,  P=0.02). Outflow obstruction in HCM patients as documented by  Doppler echocardiography was virtually absent in carriers of the  C allele (CC or CT; n=10). However, in carriers homozygous for  T (n=13) both obstruction (n=8) and non obstruction (n=5) were  observed. The difference between CC/CT carriers and TT carriers  was significant as was deduced from crosstabulation tables (Pearson  Ï2=8.06, P=0.0045). Conclusion: we take these results to suggest  that TT homozygosity is in two different clinical conditions a marker  associated with LVH in EH patients, and with obstruction in HCM  patients, respectively. Conversely, the presence of the C allele may  protect against LVH or left ventricular outflow obstruction.",2002

","Autism is a severe developmental disorder characterized by  impairment in social interactions and in language and communication  skills, and by restricted repetitive behaviors and activities.  The etiology of this disorder is poorly understood, although a  variety of etiologic mechanisms have been suggested, including  genetic, immunologic, infectious, neurologic and gastrointestinal  abnormalities. Family and genetic studies support a strong genetic  susceptibility to autistic spectrum disorders and a high incidence  in family members of nonautistic PDD variants. These studies  have been completed using karyotypic analysis which is limited  to detecting chromosomal aberrations greater than ~ 5 Mb (<650  band resolution). With this low resolution scan of the genome,  there is a high likelihood that smaller disease associated deletion  and duplication events are being missed. A modified CGH to BACs  immobilized on a glass slide (instead of metaphase chromosomes)  can provide a much higher resolution, potentially resolving to  the size of individual BACs. We developed a human genomic  array in which BACs are spaced at ~ 1 Mb intervals, on average,  throughout the genome. Clinical specimens and established cell  lines with a broad spectrum of known chromosomal abnormalities  were tested. Test and reference genomic DNAs were differentially  labeled with fluorochromes.

Patients with end stage renal disease (ESRD)  show low levels of vitamin D due to renal dysfunction. Limiting  amounts of vitamin D do not allow a normal regulation of parathyroid  function and predisposes patients to either adynamic bone disease  (ABD) or secondary hyperparathyroidism (2HP). Vitamin D binding  protein (DBP) ( Gc locus ) is the major carrier protein for vitamin D  metabolites. Two variants at codons 416(Asp Glu) and 420(Thr  Lys) of the exon 11 of the Gc gene define the three common  electrophoretic variants of the DBP protein (Gc1F, Gc1S and Gc2).

Alelle  frequencies at both codons do not differ between patients and  controls. Distribution of the genotypes at both codons and the  genotypes defined by the combination of the two codons were  also similar in patients and controls (tables 1&amp;amp;amp;2).

SNP Scanning in Pooled DNA â A Chance for  Rapid Case Control Studies,P0030.,"Werner , J. AltmÃ¼ller, N. Herbon, M. Wjst","GSF National Research Center for Environment and Health,  MÃ¼nchen Neuherberg, Germany","SNP Scanning in Pooled DNA   A Chance for Rapid Case Control  StudiesPosters   Analysis of Disorders and Traits with Complex Inheritance 80 81 Chromosome 6p21 22 is a commonly discussed region for candidate  genes concerning autoimmune diseases. One possibility to find the  responsible genes is to compare SNP frequencies in case control  studies. In a âproof of principleâ approach we tested 550 SNPs in a region  of 20 Mbp on chromosome 6p. All SNPs were selected from public  available databases (NCBI dbSNP, TSC Consortium). SNP allele  frequencies were determined by a previously validated MALDI TOF  MS based pooling approach. Our first sample comprised 288 individuals from the Southern  German population. Only SNPs with a frequency between 5% and  50% were tested. The estimated frequencies f were distributed as  follows: 7,8% of all SNPs (f<10%), 21,4% (10%<f<20%), 22,4%  (20%<f<30%), 26,3% (30%<f<40%) and 22% (40%<f<50%). In a second sample of 122 German/Swedish DNAs the same 550  SNPs were tested and differences between SNP frequencies were  calculated. The mean difference was 5,4%. Only 5% of all tested  SNPs differed more than 15% in both samples. The distribution of the mean allele difference will allow the  assignment of possible disease associated loci. Based on this  experience, we would suggest that SNP frequency differences  between two samples of a case control study should not exceed  5 7%. This may be a strict threshold but seems practicable as large  study sizes are common practice in studies of complex diseases.",2002

Prototypic genetic markers are the different  alleles and loci of the HLA system. We estimated heritability  and different sources of variation (genetic, environmental) of the  immune response to Hepatitis B and A vaccination and assessed its  association with several HLA DRB1*alleles. Methods: 96 monozygotic (MZ) and 95 dizygotic (DZ) antibody  negative twin pairs were vaccinated with a combined HAV/HBsAg  vaccine. Anti HAV and anti HBs were measured 4 weeks after the  last vaccination. All twins were typed for HLA DRB1*alleles using  sequence specific PCR amplification. Heritability was estimated based on intrapair variances. Generalized  estimating equations were calculated to assess the impact of BMI,  age, gender, smoking , alcohol, and HLA DRB1*alleles. A sex  limitation structural equation model was fitted to evaluate different  sources of variation. Results: HBsAg vaccine response was weaker with increasing  age, body mass index and among male subjects. Several HLA  DRB1*alleles showed a positive correlation with the response.  Heritability was 0.61. A model of additive genetic and environmental  components best explained the observed variances. Anti HAV  response was weaker among male subjects and heritability was  lower (0.35). Conclusion: Our data suggest a major genetic contribution to  the immune response to the Hepatitis B, and a minor one to the  Hepatitis A vaccination. The appropriate statistical assessment of the  contribution of the HLA DRB1*alleles will be discussed.",2002

The CD14 gene maps on chromosome 5q31, a region that has been linked to asthma and atopic responses.  We investigated whether 1 polymorphism located in the promoter  of the CD14 gene ( 159C/T) was associated to allergic asthma or  intermediate phenotypes such as skin prick test positivity to common  allergens (SPT), bronchial hyperresponsiveness to methacholine  challenge (BHR), and total serum elevated IgE (IgE), in a sample of  182 asthmatic families.

Susceptibility to CD is strongly associated  with particular HLA class II alleles, while genetic factors other than  HLA remain to be determined. The cytotoxic T lymphocyte antigen  4 (CTLA 4), a downregulator of T cell activation, has been reported  both in linkage and association with CD in French and Scandinavian  populations. We performed case control and family based  association studies to investigate if the polymorphism at position 49  of the CTLA 4 exon 1 was associated with the development of CD  in the Italian population. The +49 A/G dimorphism was analysed in  195 CD patients, 318 relatives and 144 ethnically matched controls  by PCR RFLP method. The A allele frequency resulted increased in  patients compared with healthy controls (75.6% vs. 65.6%; p=2.9x10  3), mostly in the homozygous form (57% vs. 45.8%; p=2.8x10 2).  The segregation analysis showed a preferential transmission of the  A allele to the probands (61%; Ï2 TDT=4.15). In order to test for an  interaction between CTLA 4 and HLA, the patients were stratified  according to the presence of the high risk HLA DQ2 heterodimer.  The CTLA 4 AA genotype raised to 81.5% in the DQ2 negative group  showing a difference statistically significant versus both controls  (p=5.2x10 4) and DQ2 positive patients (p=4x10 3). In the families  where the affected child was DQ2 negative, the A allele resulted  transmitted in 8 out of 9 informative cases ( Ï2 TDT=5.4).

Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFa), involved in  rheumatoid arthritis (RA) binds TNFR1 and TNFR2 receptors.  Genome scans have suggested the TNFR2 locus as a candidate RA  locus. A case control study in a UK Caucasian population has shown  an association between a TNFR2 genotype (196R/R in exon 6) and  familial, but not sporadic RA. Objective. To test this association in the  French Caucasian population. Methods. To test for an association in sporadic RA, 100 families were  genotyped for the 196M/R polymorphism and analysed using the  transmission disequilibrium test and the haplotype relative risk (HRR).  To test for an association in familial RA, RA index cases from affected  sib pair (ASP) families (n = 100) were genotyped for 196M/R. Linkage  analysis was performed with 3 TNFR2 microsatellite markers. Results. The TNFR2 196R/R genotype was not associated with  sporadic RA (P= 0.72), but with familial RA (P= 0.026). The  association was most marked in the context of TNFR2 âtwin likeâ  RA sibs (affected sibs sharing both TNFR2 haplotype) (P= 0.0017).  Linkage analysis was consistent with the association, the subgroup of  families with 196R/R ASP index cases provided most of the TNFR2  linkage evidence. Conclusion. This study represents the first replication of the  involvement of TNFR2 in RA genetic heterogeneity. Our data refine  the initial hypothesis, to suggest that a TNFR2 recessive factor, in  linkage disequilibrium with the 196R allele, plays a major role in a  subset of families with multiple RA cases.",2002

Patients and methods : The IBD families were recruited through  a large European consortium. The 11 exons and intron exon  boundaries of CARD4/NOD1 were screened for the presence of  variants in 77 unrelated IBD patients (62 CD and 15 UC patients)  using direct sequencing. The genotyping of identified variants in  IBD families was carried out using a PCR RFLP procedure and  the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (TDT) was computed by  GENEHUNTER 2.0 program. Results : Nine sequence variations were identified in the coding  sequence of the CARD4 gene. Five of them (E266K, D372N,  R705Q, T787M and T787K) were non conservative variants but  only one (E266K) was present in more than one IBD patient. This  variant was genotyped in 373 IBD families including 235 CD,  57 Ulcerative Colitis (UC) and 81 mixed families.

We looked for an influence of these three markers  on anti AChR antibody titers of 480 seropositive MG patients by  ANOVA. We took thymus histopathology into account since it  markedly influences anti AChR antibody titers. Their distribution  was normalized by logarithmic transformation. A synergistic effect  of HB*14 and DQA1*0101 on autoantibody titers was observed  (P<0.03). In DQA1*0101+ patients, the increase in autoantibody  titers associated with the presence of HB*14 was 10 fold in average  in the subgroup of thymectomized patients with thymus hyperplasia  or with a normal thymus (P=0.0006). Consistent with these findings,  HB*14 was preferentially transmitted to DQA1*0101+ MG patients  of this subgroup (P=0.031). This effect of HB*14 was enhanced in  haploDR3+ patients, with a 18 fold increase of their autoantibody  titers (P=0.0006). Moreover, patients with high levels of autoantibody  titers (>100nM) had an increased frequency of these three markers  (OR=15.71 ; P=0.0032). Our data strengthen the hypothesis of an  immunological role of the CHRNA gene product in MG predisposition.  HB*14 would influence the immunogenicity of the alpha subunit of the  AChR, perhaps through presentation of a novel epitopic variant by  the DQA1*0101 gene product. This effect would be enhanced in the  context of the DR3 haplotype, that would provide non antigen specifi c  immune dysregulation.",2002

Material and Methods: Molecular genetic analysis of BRCA1 and  BRCA2 genes was performed in 150 high risk breast and breast/ ovarian cancer families and in 25 women diagnosed with early onset  sporadic breast cancers below 40 years. Protein truncation test and  heteroduplex analysis followed by sequencing was carried out on  genomic DNA isolated from blood samples. The genetic counseling  and preventive clinical follow up of gene carriers is part of the genetic  program. Results: A germline disease causing mutation was found in 63  screened high risk unrelated families (42%), 41 mutations (12  different) in BRCA1 gene and 22 mutations (15 different) in BRCA2  gene. The most frequently detected mutations in BRCA1 gene were  5385 5386insC (14 families) and 3819 3823del5 (7 families). Two  novel frame shift mutations were detected in BRCA1gene: 2616  2617ins10; 3761 3762del2. Three novel frame shift mutations were  detected in BRCA2 gene: 5073 5074del2; 6677 6678del2; 6866delC. Within sporadic early onset breast cancer cases no disease causing  mutation was found. Conclusion: Germline mutations in BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes are  responsible for a significant fraction of familial breast and ovarian  cancer cases in the Czech Republic.

The frequency of female  mutation carriers with breast/ovarian cancer depends on the  population studied, and display considerable variation in coincidence  with ethnic and geographical diversity. Mutations are mainly found  as small insertions, deletions or substitutions, but also as exon wide  deletions. We performed mutation analyses in 116 patients, selected  under informed consent, from the Sahlgrenska University Hospital,  Gothenburg, Sweden. The genes were initially screened using the  Protein Truncation Test (PTT) on genomic DNA (BRCA1 exon 11,  BRCA2 exon 10, 11) and cDNA from RT PCR (all other exons) for  truncating mutations. All mutations but one was detected with PTT;  the remaining one with dHPLC. Automated DNA sequencing of the  detected mutations revealed seven different frameshift mutations,  two nonsense mutations and one large deletion. Four of these have  not been reported earlier: BRCA1 409 410delCA; 2229 2230delAA;  3029delA; 1912 T>G. BRCA mutations were found in 34% of the  screened.families; this is comparable to frequencies reported in other  European studies. Notably, a western Swedish founder mutation  (BRCA1 3171ins5) accounted for 27 of the 37 mutations detected in  the 116 families. Our results are furthermore in accordance with the  observation that frameshift mutations in the first two thirds of BRCA1  are associated with a higher risk of ovarian relative to breast cancer  than are truncating mutations in the last one third of the gene.",2002

","Several structural and numerical chromosomal abnormalities have  been recorded in breast cancer. It has been suggested that some  chromosomal aberrations may be the result of telomere dysfunction  in rapidly proliferating cells. The de novo activation of telomerase  in cancer possibly provides a survival mechanism curtailing further  chromosomal aberrations. In order to investigate the relation of  telomerase level of expression and the extent of chromosomal  aberrations, 62 primary breast carcinomas were studied. Telomerase  activity was measured using a PCR based TRAP assay and 92% of  the tumors were found to express Telomerase with relative activity  ranging from 0 â 3839.6. Genetic alterations were determined by  G banding and Comparative Genomic Hybridization analysis. 97%  of the tumors exhibited chromosomal aberrations ranging from  0 45. The average number of genetic alteration recorded by G  banding and CGH was 10.98. No correlation was observed between  Telomerase activity levels and the number of genetic alteration in  the overall sample population. However when tumor samples with  below average genetic alteration numbers were considered as a  separate group, a statistically significant positive correlation was  recorded between Telomerase activity levels and number of genetic  alterations (R=0.339, p=0.032). This relationship was inversed in  the sample group with above average genetic alterations but it  was not statistically significant (R= 0.127; p=0.574). These results  suggest that Telomerase may be activated in the initial steps of  carcinogenesis perhaps to maintain chromosomal integrity of the  rapidly proliferating tumor cells while at the later stages alternative  survival mechanisms have evolved.",2002

Three sequence variations could be identified: 1 polymorphism  and 2 mutations (3597del2A at codon 1199 with termination of  protein translation at amino acid position 1206; 3949GÃ C at codon  1317, E1317Q). We describe the optimized conditions for DHPLC  for this gene. According to our results DHPLC is an efficient and  fast screening method to identify mutations in the APC gene which  can be applied to the other exons of the APC gene for a fast and  cost reducing mutation screening. The rapid mutation screening will  optimize further diagnostic and therapeutic strategies in families with  hereditary colon cancer.",2002
NF1 tumor suppressor gene in sporadic colon  cancer,P0063.,"Kapitanovic1, T. Cacev1, K. Pavelic1, R. Spaventi1,2","1Rudjer Boskovic Institute, Zagreb, Croatia, 2PLIVA d. d., Zagreb,  Croatia. ","Colorectal carcinomas are characterized by multiple genetic  alterations that occur during tumorigenesis. Several tumor suppressor  genes associated with colorectal carcinoma have been identified:  MCC and APC on chromosome 5q, p53 on chromosome 17p, nm23  H1 on chromosome 17q, and DCC and DPC4 on chromosome  18q. We examined 60 cases of human sporadic colon cancer  and corresponding normal tissue samples to evaluate the loss of  heterozygosity (LOH) at the NF1 gene loci. The purpose of this study  was also to evaluate whether the LOH at the NF1 gene is associated  with clinicopathological characteristics in sporadic colon cancer . DNAs were used for PCR, RFLP, VNTR, and LOH analysis. PCR  was performed using specific pairs of primers. PCR products were  analyzed by RFLP analysis, and VNTR analysis. To analyze LOH at  the NF1 gene loci we used three polymorphic markers: one RFLP  marker (exon 5 RsaI) and two VNTR markers (IVS27AAAT2.1 and  IVS38GT53.0). Using these three polymorphic markers 50 (83.3%) patients were  found heterozygous and informative for LOH analysis. DNA from  9 (18%) tumors exhibited LOH at the NF1 locus. The majority NF1  gene LOH was observed in Dukesâ A (56%), in the well differentiated  tumors (43%), and in the tumors that were smaller than 5cm (67%). Conclusion: Our results support the view that malignant progression  is a consequence of more than one genetic change and suggest that  inactivation of NF1 gene plays a role in a multistep process of colon  tumor progression as an early event.",2002

MCB analyses were performed on all aberrant chromosomes of this  composite karyotype, i.e. on the following eighteen chromosomes:  #1, #2, #3, #4, #5, #6, #8, #9, #11, #12, #13, #16, #17, #18, #19, #20,  #22 and X.

We have recently applied the DHPLC mutation detection to the 16  exons of hMSH2 and 19 exons of hMLH1 genes. To test sensitivity  and reproducibility of DHPLC, we have first determined the best  DHPLC conditions on the wild type sequences, followed by the  study of 35 sequence variants previously found by sequencing DNA   samples of HNPCC patients. All of the 35 mutations were detected  using DHPLC (sensitivity 100%). We then used DHPLC to analyse 18 patients with colorectal  cancer not fulfilling all the Amsterdam criteria. We have found two  mutations : Y43C in exon 1 of hMSH2 (unpublished yet) affecting a  highly conserved residue and a 790+1G to A in intron 9 of hMLH1  (previously described), one of them did not fulfill the Amsterdam  criteria. This low mutation yield could be due to the patients inclusion Posters   Cancer Genetics88 89 criteria. We have also found many polymorphisms, with a much  higher frequency than previously published.

SUBJECTS: Patients with multiple adenomatous polyposis of the  large intestine confirmed by histopathological evaluation. METHODS: DGGE of exons 1 14, PTT and heteroduplex analysis  of exon 15, RT PCR of exons 1 15, sequencing of the 5â end, and  Southern blot analysis of the APC gene. RESULTS: Six unrelated cases (one female and five males) with  multiple polyposis of the colon were enrolled in this study. Of the  six patients, only one had a positive familial history. In the female  patient the number of polyps was much lower (<100) than the number  observed in the male subjects (>1,000). Detailed DNA analyses of  the APC gene revealed the presence of rare (unusual) defects in two  patients. A large deletion, removing the entire APC gene, was found  in the patient with a positive familial history. A somatic mosaicism  for a deletion removing exons 2 14 was detected in the female  patient. No abnormalities at the DNA level and no allelic imbalance  in the expression profile of the APC gene were detected in the other  four patients. Abnormal APC gene transcripts were found in the  peripheral blood of two of these (deletion of exons 9 13 and exon 14,  respectively) that could not be explained by any defect at the DNA   level. CONCLUSION: The unusual findings of our study indicate that there  are genes other than the APC which might influence the development  of multiple colorectal adenomas, either through an APC related  mechanism or through other pathways.",2002

We present monozygotic sisters with MTS  caused by a point mutation (IVS5+3A>T) in the 3â splice site of exon  5 of MSH2 resulting in the deletion of this exon from the mRNA, thus  encoding a truncated protein. One sister developed her first squamos  cell carcinoma at 50 years, and at age 53 had two sebaceous  carcinomas and one adenoma removed. The second sister had  uterine cancer at age 40, metastatic colon cancer at 43, thyroid  cancer at 45, and sebaceous adenoma at 49 years. Their mother  is deceased at the age of 41 from uterine and liver cancer, and the  maternal grandfather was diagnosed with colon cancer at 50 years.  Kindreds with this same MMR mutation are described in the literature,  and the types of cancers represented in these families were quite  varied and included colon, uterine, rectal, endometrial, brain, ovarian,  ureter, gastric, breast, duodenal, sebaceous, bone, thyroid, and lung  cancer. Therefore, genetic counseling must emphasize the inability to  establish any correlation between the site of the individual mutation  and spectrum of tumor types and the use of appropriate surveillance  methods. This family demonstrates the intrafamilial variability of  carcinogenesis even among monozygotic twins, and suggests that  non genetic factors are important in modifying the expression of this  syndrome.",2002

These patients belong to families with high cancer incidence  and/or suffer from early onset tumours or multiple or multifocal  malignancies. Many cases of hereditary predisposition to cancer  are due to a germline mutation in one of the tumour suppressor  genes. Some familial cancer syndromes show predisposition to a  particular type of cancer (e.g. breast or colon cancer). The much  rarer Li Fraumeni syndrome (LFS) is distinct because members of  LFS families suffer from a wide spectrum of different malignancies  including sarcomas, brain tumours, breast cancer, adrenocortical  carcinomas and other tumours. The cancer predisposition in most  of these families is due to a germline mutation in the TP53 gene. It  is generally expected that the tumours in most of such predisposed  persons arise after the wild type TP53 allele is lost in a particular  cell clone in a carrier individual. We show on our material that many  tumours from germline TP53 mutation carriers retain the wild type  TP53 allele. The development of these tumours in LFS individuals  must therefore be based on another mechanism of the TP53 gene  silencing than simple DNA loss. Alternatively, one functional TP53  allele may still be present in these tumours. We also compare these  observations with records in our web database of published germline  TP53 mutations, which is a very useful tool for different analyses of  this intriguing syndrome.

","Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a valuable tool in clinical  practice of leukemia. However, high false positive and false negative  rates complicate the interpretation of results. These limitations are  especially important in follow up examinations, and in detection  of minimal residual disease (MRD). Recently, the Duet scanning  system (BioView Ltd, Rehovot, Israel) was introduced. The system  provides two important features: Automatic scanning of large  number of cells, and combined analysis of morphology and FISH  on the same cells. Prior to scanning, blood samples are processed  according to a unique protocol, which allows removal of RBC and  2 consecutive staining of WBC (giemsa or immunocytochemistry  and FISH). This approach was applied to 80 samples of various  hematological malignancies in order to: a) Determine the lineage  of cells carrying specific chromosomal rearrangement. b) Enhance  FISH analysis accuracy in leukemic cells. c) Determine clonality  and maturity of residual recipient/donor cells in bone marrow  transplantation. d) Determine the maturity of cells carrying  chromosomal rearrangements in MRD. The results were compared  to the diagnosis given by routine methods. We found that the Duet  system enabled increased specificity and sensitivity of leukemic cells  detection. Scanning automatically large numbers of cells provided  rapid and efficient identification of rare cells in MRD cases (up to one  leukemic cells in 15,000 WBC). The combined morphologic and FISH  information of suspected cells enhanced the specificity of leukemic  cells detection and reduced FP drawbacks.

There  was no evidence of allele inactivation by hypermethylation in these 4  samples, nor in a further 28 non deleted samples. No deletions were  found on screening the FANCC , D2, E, F and G genes in 64, 68, 31,  42 and 51 samples respectively. FANCA  is a large gene (43 exons,  80kb) with a high incidence of deletion mutations in affected FA patients. These results show that such deletions may also be found in  sporadic AML and may have contributed to leukaemogenesis.

Gene expression patterns in childhood acute  lymphoblastic leukemia,P0078.,"Bruchova , R. Brdicka","Institute of Hematology and Blood Transfusion, Department of  Molecular Genetics, Prague 2, Czech Republic","Array hybridization technique represents a useful method for the  expression profiling of large gene sets during disease processes.  Using this technology we studied gene expression in childhood acute  lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. For detection of transcription  activity we used Human Cancer cDNA Nylon Arrays (Clontech, USA)  with 588 genes that can be involved in transformation. Total RNA  was isolated from bone marrow leukocytes of patients at the time of  diagnosis (previously untreated). The standard sample was prepared  by RNA mixing of control individuals (bone marrow donors). Our  objectives were to identify genes that were differentially expressed  in ALL and might contribute to the disease development (and  characterization). Obtained gene expression profiles of patients were compared with  the standard profile. The majority of patient genes showed the similar  gene activity as in the control sample (e.g. gluthatione S transferase  homolog, vimentin, rho GAP hematopoietic protein C1, rho GDP  dissociation inhibitor 2, fau etc.). Many genes displayed signifi cant  expression changes only in some patients. In a few genes it was  possible to observe similar significant changes of gene expression  in most patients ( eg. PCNA, MMP8). These changes might be  associated with common stream of the disease process and they can  be studied in more detail. Supported by the grant IGA MZ CR no.  NM/5901 3.",2002

She died in the next three  weekes. The third case, a young man of 27 years old, with acute  myeloid leukemia, apart of Ph chromosome presented del11q21 and  del16q22. The rapid death of the three cases was a powerful prove of  positive correlation between the complexity of chromosomal changes  and disease agresivity. In change, a constitutional translocation  t(3;5)(q26;q21) identified in a 72 years old woman with ET, conferred  favourable evolution of the disease after a succesfull treatment with  HU. So, we appreciate that, if in the first three cases of myeloid Posters   Cancer Genetics90 91 and lymphoid leukemias could be a direct relationship between  the complexity of genomic rearrangements identified at the onset  and agresive development of the disease, in the fourth case of ET ,  constitutional translocation t(3;5), seems to be not involved in the  etiology of the disease.

Haferlach","Labor fÃ¼r LeukÃ¤miediagnostik, Klinikum Grosshadern, Munich,  Germany","AML represent a pathogenetically and prognostically heterogeneous  group. For differentiation of AML subgroups, cytogenetics offers  the most evaluated and established criteria today. 10 15% of AML  patients show complex aberrant karyotypes in leukemic blasts,  associated with a most adverse progression of the disease. So far , no  crucial candidate genes relevant for the pathogenesis were identifi ed. Data obtained by 24color FISH and CGH in 50 AML cases with  complex aberrant karyotype demonstrated a much larger percentage  of loss than gain of genetic material. Frequent observations included  deletions of the entire chromosomes 5 and 7, as well as interstitial  deletions within their long arms. These deletions may represent the first of two required mutation  events to deplete a tumorsuppressor geneâs function. Alternatively,  haploinsufficiency with only one mutation event might already be  sufficient to reduce the physiologically necessary amount of gene  product. To evaluate both models, we currently investigate 25 of these AML  cases with complex aberrant karyotype more precisely on molecular  genetic level: utilizing gene expression analysis (GeneChip U133)  and mutation screening (Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism  Analysis, SSCPA) we focus on 20 functionally relevant candidate  genes on chromosomes 5 and 7, involved in apoptosis, cell cycle/ transcription regulation and DNA repair mechanisms.

The dystrophic form of scoliosis in neurofibromatosis 1 (NF1) is often associated with severe decrease in bone mineral density, significantly  hindering reconstructive bone surgery. Osteoporosis has been  found to be associated with distinct polymorphisms of the vitamin  D receptor gene (VDR), oestrogen receptor gene (OER) and the  collagen 1 Î±1 gene (COL1A1) in the general population. The purpose  of the present case control study was to evaluate the hypothesis,  whether the genotypes at these three polymorphic loci are associated  with decreased bone mineral density in scoliotic patients with  neurofibromatosis. Genotype of 21 selected NF1 patients with  scoliosis and decreased bone mineral density was compared to 21  patients with non scoliotic NF1 with normal bone density. Patients  with idiopathic scoliosis with normal bone density measurements (21)  have been also assessed for the same genetic polymorphisms. In  this pilot study of altogether 63 individuals no association was found  between VDR and OER polymorphisms, and the phenotype. The  genetic marker distribution in the idiopathic scoliosis (IS) group did  not significantly differ from that of scoliotic NF1 patients. However, we  observed a threefold prevalence of the homozygous polymorphism  (CC) over the heterozygous form (Cc) of the COL1A1 gene in non  scoliotic NF1 patients compared to patients with scoliosis presenting  with an almost equal distribution in this genotype. This difference was  not statistically significant. The sample size of this pilot study is not  large enough to draw a final conclusion. A possible protective role of  CC genotype in non scoliotic NF patients deserves reevaluation in a  larger group of patients.",2002

We applied CGH technique to samples taken from various sites of  placentas originating from abnormal pregnancies (23 IUGRs, one  with fetal malformation, one with toxemia, one with hydrocephalus  and 2 undetectable MSAFP). In the control cases (7 normal and 5  with known aneuploidy) CGH concurred with the known karyotype. The most common aberration in the IUGR cases was the addition of  a whole or part of X chromosome. Other aberrations such as addition  of Y chromosome , addition of 13(q22) and loss of chromosome  17 where found in other cases. There was also one IUGR case of  trisomy 8 (in one site) and 47,XXY found in all sites. In the two cases  with the MSAFP=O monosomy 16 was detected (in one case on both  sites searched).

Among the 52 tissue culture of spontaneous  abortions, 10 cases showed failure of fetal cell growth in culture and  could not be identified reliably by conventional cytogenetics. CGH  analysis was successfully performed for detection of chromosomal  aneuploidy in spontaneously aborted specimens with tissue culture  failure. Balanced karyotype profiles were obtained for 5 samples. All  of them were analysed by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH)  with centromere specific DNA probes to exclude polyploidy. Nothing  cells with abnormal level of ploidy were found. Five spontaneous  abortions (50%) have monosomy 22 and trisomy 10, 14, 18 and  21. Monosomy 22 identified by CGH is one of the most rare  aneuploidies in spontaneous abortions. In all cases with an indication  of chromosomal imbalance by CGH, FISH with chromosome specific  DNA probe was performed to confirm the presence of aneuploidy.

We have designed and developed directly labeled PNA probes  to distinguish up to 2n 1 chromosomes (where n is the number  of different fluorochromes) using an epifluorescence microscope  equipped with a digital imaging camera and computer software  for pseudocoloring and merging images. Peptide nucleic acids  (PNA) are synthetic mimics of DNA in which the phosphodiester  backbone has been replaced with 2 aminoethyl glycine linkages,  but maintaining the four natural nucleobases. PNA probes bind to  the complementary DNA sequence obeying Watson Crick base  pairing, however the neutral backbone of the PNA molecule allows  for the PNA/DNA binding to occur more rapidly and more tightly than  DNA/DNA binding. Chromosome specific composite PNA probe  sets were generated from the human satellite sequences, in which  the different fluorochromes were incorporated to address specific  issues, like identification of marker chromosomes and anueploidies.  With four fluorophores, we were able to enumerate up to 15  chromosomes in both metaphase spreads and interphase nuclei in  a single hybridization experiment.

Comparative Genomic Hybridization (CGH) is able to identify the  origin of extra or missing chromosome material when either the  small size of the segment or a non discriminatory banding pattern  does not allow a cytogenetic diagnosis. It has also the potential to  detect both terminal and interstitial rearrangements. We illustrate  here the contribution of CGH in the delineation of 13 different cases  studied in our laboratory. In most cases, CGH was performed to  characterize a rearrangement detected using classical cytogenetic  methods i.e identification of extra or missing chromosome  material, confirmation of an imbalance or accurate definition of the  chromosome breakpoints. In all these cases CGH was decisive.  In some other cases, classical cytogenetics (550 to 850 bands)  did not detect any chromosome imbalance when CGH detected  a chromosome imbalance in several cases. All abnormal results  were confirmed using whole chromosome painting and/or FISH  with subtelomeric probes. In conclusion, CGH is a very powerful  method to analyze an unbalanced rearrangement already identified  using classical cytogenetics and requiring further characterization .  When no chromosomal rearrangement is observed, CGH could be  an alternative to multiprobe FISH study of all subtelomeric regions.  However its use as a screening tool in unexplained mental retardation  remains limited due to the difficulty of obtaining chromosomal  preparations allowing high quality hybridizations on a regular basis.",2002

Mutation characterization in patients with type I  Neurofibromatosis: towards a routine diagnostic test,P0107.,"Honsberger , C. DeLozier Blanchet, M. Morris","Divison Medical Genetics, Geneva University Medical Faculty,  Geneva, Switzerland","Neurofibromatosis type I, an autosomal dominant condition with  an incidence of about 1/3000, results from mutations in the NF1  gene. The variability in clinical expression is striking, with symptoms  varying from âcosmeticâ to lethal. This variability is apparently not  due to locus heterogeneity, since mutations in the NF1 gene are  responsible for the quasi totality of cases. Allelic heterogeneity may  explain a proportion, as over 400 mutations have been reported.  However, major intrafamilial variation in disease expression also  occurs, making the establishment of genotype phenotype correlations  difficult. A reliable molecular diagnostic test is needed to allow earlier  diagnosis, carrier detection and clinical follow up. However, the size  of the gene and the diversity of mutations currently makes testing  difficult outside of a research context. We have done molecular  analysis on 38 NF1 patients using a multi step DNA and RNA  based protocol, using SSCA of selected exons, RT PCR and PTT  followed by sequencing of variants. This approach has allowed us to  define mutations in nearly half (17 of 38) of our patients, with work  still ongoing. The mutations defined, 11 of which have not been  previously described, include 7 nonsense, 4 splice site, 4 insertion  deletions and 2 missense mutations. Attempts will be made to correlate clinical symptoms with specifi c  mutations, as a standard set of clinical information has been  collected.

A common feature of the tumor cells in HL is the  constitutive activation of the NF kB transcription factor. In a subset  of cases this might be due to the presence of the LMP1 of the EBV  or mutations in the NF kB inhibitors IkB alpha or IkB epsilon. Recent  comparative genomic hybridization studies have shown gains in  chromosome arm 2p as the most common imbalance in cHL. The  minimal region of gain contained two candidate oncogenes, REL and  BCL11A. Overexpression of REL due to genetic amplification might  contribute to NF kB activation. The transcriptional repressor BCL11A  has been shown to be overexpressed in cHL cell lines and may play  a role in B cell transformation through the BCL6 pathway. Here, we  investigated the involvement of REL and BCL11A in 44 primary cases  of cHL by combined immunophenotyping and interphase cytogenetics  (FICTION technique). A median 2p13 copy number above the  tetraploid range was detected in 24 (55%) cases. Adjustment for  centromere 2 copy number indicated gains of 2p13 in 11 of 31 cHL  (35%) with 8 (26%) high level amplifications. One case displayed  selective amplification of the REL locus not affecting BCL11A, and  another case showed signal patterns suggesting a breakpoint in the  region spanned by the REL probe. According to these data, REL  rather than BCL11A may be the target of the 2p13 alterations in cHL,  although a role for BCL11A in cHL cannot be ruled out due to its  frequent coamplification.",2002

Materials and methods: Sixteen microsatellite markers were  amplified in plasma, leukocyte and, when available, tissue DNA of 40  patients and 20 healthy controls by use of fluorescent primers. The  plasma was filtered prior to DNA extraction in order to exclude the  presence of cells.

It was  classified into two different types. Complete hydatidiform mole  (CHM) and partial hydatidiform mole (PHM). CHM is characterized  by gross hydropic swelling of almost all of the chorionic villi with  loss of intravillous vascularity and resembling bunches of grapes,  usually with an absence of a fetus or fetal tissue such as blood or  amniotic membrane. PHM is generally accompanied by a fetus, or  shows evidence of a previous existence of a fetus by the presence of erythroblasts or fetal membrane. The gene responsible for HYDM  have been mapped to chromosome 19q13.3 q13.4 (Hum. Molec.  Genet. 8:667 671, 1999; Europ. J. Hum. Genet. 8: 641 644, 2000).

","Various genetic changes affecting chromosomal region 10q24 have  been shown to be recurrent in malignant lymphomas. Among those,  the translocation t(10;14)(q24;q32) is supposed to activate the  NFKB2/LYT10 gene in 10q24 via its juxtaposition nexto the IGH gene  in 14q32. In addition, the NFKB2/LYT10 locus has been reported  to be targeted by deletions particularly in cutaneous lymphomas.  In the present study, we established an interphase FISH assay for  detecting alterations of NFKB2/LYT10 locus. As probes, differentially  labelled BAC clones from a contig of chromosomal region 10q24  were applied which cover at least 400kb on each side of the NFKB2/ LYT10 locus. The diagnostic cut off levels of the FISH probe set  in interphase cells were determined in normal controls. A cell line  known to carry breaks in both NFKB2 alleles served as positive  control. In all five studied B cell lymphomas with cytogenetically  proven t(10;14)(q24;q32) a break within the IGH locus but not in the  NFKB2 locus was detected. From 14 lymphomas with chromosomal Posters   Cancer Genetics98 99 aberrations in 10q, only a single case displayed a signal constellation  indicating a breakpoint within the NFKB2/LYT10 locus. Four cases  showed signal patterns indicating deletions of the NFKB2/LYT10  locus. Similarly, a loss of the NFKB2/LYT10 locus was detected in  8/18 cutaneous T cell lymphomas. These findings indicate that the  NFKB2 gene very likely is not the sole target of the t(10;14)(q24;q32)  and that deletions affecting the NFKB2/LYT10 locus are recurrent  particularly in cutaneous T cell lymphomas. Finally, our results show  the established double color FISH assay to provide a new routinely  applicable tool for diagnosing recurrent breakpoints and imbalances  in NFKB2/LYT10 locus.",2002

It is well known  that H Ras gene is one of a family of Ras genes, which encode p21  plasma membrane protein involved in signal transduction. Point  mutations within codons 12 and 13(exon 1) or codon 61(exon 2)  are frequently present in various tumours including OSCC. In our  study, in order to detect these mutations, we isolated DNA from 20  paraffin embedded OSCC specimens. Using PCR technique, it was  possible to analyse 10 of 20 (50%) samples, probably, because  of DNA degradation, which occurred during paraffin embedding.  According to the TNM staging, 5 of 10 successful amplified samples  were stage III and 5 stage II. These histopathological parameters  suggest that our analyzed samples, might have a higher incidence  of H Ras mutations, but to confirm this correlation, PCR products  will be screened by method for detection mutationsâSSCP.

The  feasibility and clinical value of using the reverse transcriptase (R T)  polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to amplify mRNA for tyrosinase  hydroxylase (TH), the first enzyme of catecholamine synthesis, was  evaluated to detect neroblastoma cells in patient samples. A total of 32 patients with neuroblastoma were studied. After  preparation of complementary DNA, the PCR was performed  to amplify the TH gene. Amplified products were analyzed in  polyacrylamide gel or by using the GeneScan Analysis on ABI  PRISM 310.The specificity of the amplified products was checked  by sequencing analysis and neuroblastoma cells were detected at  a level of 1 per 105 normal PB mononuclear cells by this method.TH  mRNA was in 19 of the 63 BM samples, in 6 of the 53 PB samples  and in 4 of the 8 tumor samples. RT PCR of TH mRNA is a sensitive and specific method for detection  of circulating neuroblastoma cells in BM and PB samples. The clinical  significance of these very low levels of neuroblastoma cells detected  by RT PCR requires further investigation.

This  established animal model reflects human pancreatic cancer disease. To investigate secondary genomic changes, more than 40 tumors  were analyzed by CGH. In about 40% of the tumors gain of proximal  chromosome 11 and loss of its distal part including p53 was detected.  Due to this loss no wildtype p53 allel is left. In addition to this recurrent aberration pattern further cancer  progression follows two alternate routes: Overrepresentation of  chromosome 15 including the Myc locus (A), or more rarely, loss  of the distal part of chromosome 14 including the Rb locus (B). It  seems that these aberrations occur exclusively because in none  of the aforementioned tumors a combination of these events was  detected. On the average mice bearing tumors of subtype B develop  tumors about 75 days earlier than mice with tumors of subtype A.  These data indicate that there are at least two different pathways in  pancreatic tumor formation: Proliferation through Rb deletion or c  myc overexpression and activation. To analyze the extension of the amplified regions of chromosome  11 and 15 cell lines were investigated by FISH and real time PCR.  On proximal chromosome 11 the amplification unit extends about 18  cM. Together with Egfr, the c Rel gene gets amplified which provides  antiapoptotic activity. In contrast, the Myc amplification unit of  chromosome 15 is much smaller. In the meanwhile a second series of pancreatic adenocarcinoma with  TGFa / p19ARF+/  was analyzed by CGH.

Here, we describe the cloning and characterization  of the breakpoint of this UM3 cell line. Using FiberFISH techniques the breakpoint was detected in the  switch gamma 1 region of chromosome14. Next, a genomic phage  library of the UM3 cell line was screened with a gamma 1 probe  resulting in a clone that spans the breakpoint.

These morphological differences between  NF1 and control melanocytes can be described by a mathematical  model where the cell is considered a self organized automaton.  The model describes the adjustment of the cells to a set point and  includes a noise term which allows for stochastic processes. It  describes the experimental data of control and NF1 melanocytes. In  the cells haploinsufficient for NF1 we found an altered signal to noise  ratio detectable as increased variation in dendrite formation in two  out of three investigated morphological parameters.

The DNA mismatch repair (MMR) system eliminates  the initial insertion deletion loops to reduce the error rates in DNA   replication. Defects in the MMR system result in an increased  loss or gain of repeat units in microsatellites, commonly known as  microsatellite instability (MSI). These processes play an important  role in cancer development and therefore serve as markers for  tumorigenesis. Due to this reason, efficient methodical approaches  for the reliable detection of MSI with prospects for high throughput  screening are needed. Matrix assisted laser desorption ionization    time of flight   mass spectrometry (MALDI TOF MS) possesses  these general features as shown for genotyping of single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs).

Following PCR amplification of genomic regions  including the microsatellites and primer extension reactions over the  microsatellites to produce informative molecular masses, MSI was  detected by MALDI TOF MS. The analysis of peak integral ratios in  a single spectrum of the peaks representing insertions or deletions  in comparison to the full length microsatellites lead to a relative  quantification of MSI.

Observations of biallelic alterations or deletions of hSNF5/INI1  in these tumors as well as in murine models provide evidence of  a tumor suppressor gene acting in this pathology. A precedent  work demonstrated that the major mechanisms associated to the  inactivation of hSNF5/INI1 are mitotic recombinations or putative non disjunction/duplication leading to partial or total isodisomy. In an attempt to further characterize the main chromosomal  mechanisms involved in the hSNF5/INI1 inactivation in rhabdoid  tumors, we report here the molecular cytogenetic data obtained with  18 rhabdoid cell lines harboring hSNF5/INI1 mutation or deletion  using 10 different markers located all along the chromosome  22q11.2 q12 region. The FISH results show that several deletions  may occured in the cases carrying chromosome 22 abnormalities.  The translocations including the hSNF5/INI1 consensus region are  always associated with an homozygous deletion of variable size. By  contrast, no deletion could be detected in any of the cases exhibiting  an apparently normal karyotype. Besides common mechanisms of mitotic recombination or non  disjunction/ duplication occuring in 60% of either retinoblastoma or  rhabdoid tumors, other specific chromosome mechanisms seem to  be involved in each category of tumors for inactivating the respective  tumor suppressor genes. Translocations associated with homozygous  deletions and monosomy cases associated with mutations are  mainly described in the rhabdoid tumors. Inactivation by two dif ferent  mutations is mainly found in retinoblastoma. These differences may  be related to the presence of low copy repeat families in the proximal  22q region leading to an increased chromosome instability.",2002

","Anticancer drug cisplatin covalently binds to DNA in vivo . The sites  of DNA platination are recognized by several nuclear proteins. In  particular, histone H1 and some of HMG proteins bind to platinated  DNA with binding constants hundred times greater in comparison  with unmodified DNA. Using computer modeling, we investigated  binding of proteins to DNA treated by cisplatin. Binding of proteins to  DNA is characterized by contact cooperativity as well as long range  interaction. Each platinated site is characterized by 100 times higher  statistical weight for protein binding in comparison with non modifi ed  ones. As a result the map of binding, i.e. the probability of each DNA  base pair to be bound to a protein was calculated. It was found that  chemical modification of one or several DNA base pairs by cisplatin  strongly changes the character of protein binding to DNA. This effect  is strongly dependent on the position of modified site. It was shown that a single chemical modification of DNA gives rise to a dramatic  rearrangement in protein positions. If one protein covers 15 base  pairs then the area of rearrangement involves up to 200 base pairs.  Cisplatin changes the region(s) of preferable binding of proteins. In  the case of chromatin, platination might cause primary nucleosome  repositioning and strong secondary stabilization of their locations. This work was supported by BRFFI (X99R 099)",2002

We observed also a gene  dose effect since homozygotes for 825C allele have a higher risk  to develop colorectal cancer than heterozygotes, both compared to  homozygotes with the T allele. CC versus TT gives an odds ratio of  4.83 (95% CI, 1.67 17.01) and CC versus CT gives an odds ratio  of 1.70 (95% CI, 1.06 2.72). The protein of the GNB3 gene is part  of a G protein heterotrimer involved in signal transduction. The  messenger RNA with the 825T allele is spliced differently but the  resulting protein is still active. There is evidence that the 825T allele  is associated with enhanced G protein reactivity and hypertension,  obesity and lately, that it is a genetic marker for enhanced T cell  response.",2002
Chromosome Insitability and Sister Chromatid  Exchange Studies in Patients with Esophageal  Carcinoma,P0146.,"Sahin , M. Ikbal, T. Tos, I. Pirim, C. Gundogdu, A. Yilmaz","Ataturk Universitiy, Erzurum, Turkey","Cytogenetic studies have been carried out using convansional  technique in peripheral blood lymphocytes in patiens with cancers.  Sister chromatid exchanges (SCE) are resiprocal exchanges  between sister chromatids. It has been reported that the ferquency  of SCE in peripheral blood lymphocytes is significantly higher in  patiens with variety type cancer than in normal individuals. This study  assesed the frequencies of SCE and chromosome abnormality in  peripheral lymphocytes of 28 patients with esophageal carcinoma  and 20 controls. Peripheral lymphocyt cells were cultured with  conventional culture methods. The blood samples were obtained from  the patiens after histopatologic confirmation of the malignancy but  before the initiation of chemotherapy or radiotherapy. The frequncy  of aberrant metaphases appear to be significant in patients with  esophageal carcinoma. The mean SCE ferquencies were 10.46  Â± 0.48 and 6.82 Â± 0.38 per methaphase in patients and controls,  respectively. The increase of SCE frequency in cancer patients was  stastically significant ( p< 0.001), but no seen in controls. Our results  suggest that patients with esophageal carcinoma show a degree of  chromosomal insitability that might be related to a predisposition to  neoplasia.",2002

Here we report a study on 25  oligodendroglial tumors (7 well differentiated oligodendrogliomas, 16  anaplastic oligodendrogliomas and 2 oligoastrocytomas) analysed  by CGH. Losses of 1p and 19q, known as common markers of  oligodendroglial tumors, were observed in 36% (9/25) and 68%  (17/25) of cases respectiveley and 32 % (8/25) of the tumors  displayed both losses. These 8 tumors with 1p/19q losses have  other abnormalities, except one case. The most prevalent deviations  associated with this 1p/19q losses were deletions of chromosome  22 (3/8) and gains of the region 13(q21qter) (4/8). Loss of 9p was  essentially restricted to anaplastic ooligodendrogliomas (4/16) and  occured in tumors with intact 1p or 19q. Interestingly, six tumors  (24%) showed gain of chromosome 7 associated in 3 cases with an  amplification of the EGFR region (7p11), and loss of chromosome  10, alterations known to be preferentially involved in the progression  of astrocytic tumors. This study confirms previous reports and shows  that oligodendroglial tumors carry heterogeneous genetic alterations  .

Data were associated with patientsâ clinicopathological features.

ICH examination revealed reduced E cadherin protein expression in  21/63 (33,3%) of carcinomas versus 42/63 (66.7%) with increased  E cadherin expression. Decreased e cadherin gene expression was  significantly associated with E cadherin ICH detection (P=0.0002)  and was paralleled with a decreased beta catenin expression in 70%  of the carcinomas examined (P=0.001). Thirty four out of 61 cases  (50,7%) were reported as hypermethylated in e cadherin promoter  locus versus 27/61 (40.3%) that were found to be unmethylated.  The methylation status of the e cadherin gene promoter was  significantly associated with E cadherin expression at both the RNA  and the protein level (P=0.002, P=0.004 respectively). A significant  association was observed between E cadherin ICH detection, lymph  node metastasis and/or tumour stage (P=0.007, P=0.01 respectively).  In agreement with prior work demonstrating that somatic mutations  and loss of heterozygosity (LOH) of e cadherin gene are rare  or absent in the vast majority of SCRCs studied, we have found  consistent aberrant methylation associated decrease of E cadherin  expression suggesting an epigenetically mediated loss of E cadherin  function.",2002

One of the most frequent cytogenetic abnormalities in AML is  t(8;21)(q22;q22), found in approximately 10 15% of the cases.  The t(8;21) fuses the AML gene to the ETO gene also identified as  MTG8 (myeloid translocation gene on chromosome 8), generating  predominant PCR products of a constant size (260bp), corresponding  to an in frame fusion of AML1 exon 5 to ETO exon 2. We present one AML patient in wich an abnormal AML1 ETO fusion  transcript was observed by RT PCR. The sequence of this purified  product revealed a 50 bp frameshift deletion in exon 2 of the ET O  gene. The loss of 50 bp originates a disruption of the reading frame  of this transcript creating a stop codon 48 aa downstream. As a  consecuence of this deletion, the expected protein will be a truncated  form. Due to the fact that: a) AML breakpoints are clustered between  exon 5 and exon 6, and ETO breakpoints are located upstream of  exon 2 and, b) the deletion is located in exon 2 of the ETO gene, the  structure of this truncated fusion protein will included only 31 aa of  the ETO gene. AML/ETO has been shown to fuction as a transcriptional activator  that is critical for the tissue specific expression of a number of  haemopoietic specific genes. This case shows that most ETO  sequence may be dispensable in AML/ETO+ leukemias.",2002

Except the P25L substitution, which could  represent a polymorphism, the mutations are pathogenic. Moreover ,  one rare variant, IVS2+8c>t, was also identified in one healthy  individual. In seven families, the identification of mutation in proband  was followed by presymptomatic DNA testing in 29 relatives at risk.  Negative results of mutation analysis in 3 patients with familial VHL   disease require further study. This work was supported by the Grant  Agency of Charles University (Grant No. 36/1996).",2002

The role of the H  ras oncogene in  neurometabolism: Do depression and cancer stem from a  common etiology?,P0162.,K. Brewer,"Harvard University, Cambridge, MA","An association between depression and cancer has long  been recognized. Essentially, the prevailing hypothesis is that  neurometabolic disturbances inherent in depression effect a change  in endocrine and immunological systems making one at greater risk  for cancer. More recently, molecular epidemiologists have postulated  that the linkage between depression and later cancer onset might be  genetic in nature. Specifically, the H  ras oncogene has recently been  implicated as a source of dysfunctional neurometabolism, presenting  as an alternative hypothesis to the prevailing view that cancer  results from a weakened immune system. Essentially, it has been Posters   Cancer Genetics108 109 theorized that dysregulation of this cancer gene results in impaired  serotonin and dopamine synthesis secondarily. However, whatever  the cause of depression/cancer comorbidity, studies have failed to  confirm a definite link between depression and later onset of cancer.  I expect that two confounding variables exist within the most recent  depression/cancer correlational studies. First, these studies have  failed to incorporate the growing body of literature delineating the  role of the H  ras oncogene in neurometabolism. It is plausible that a  dysfunctional H  ras gene may be the causal link between depression  and cancer. If so, longitudinal studies seeking to correlate depression  and cancer should parse out cancers known to be associated with  the H  ras gene. Second, existing studies fail to employ an accurate  classification and diagnosis of depression. My hypothesis is that a  depression/cancer correlation is caused by a dysfunctional H  ras  oncogene which acts primarily  to disrupt neurometabolism, the  serotonin and dopamine biosynthetic pathways specifically, and  secondarily  causes cancer over time.",2002

Studies have shown that IFN  Î± therapy induces both cytogenetic  response (reduction in Ph+ cells) and molecular response (reduction  in the bcr/abl + cells) in a significant proportion of CML patients  thereby improving their prognosis and survival. To the best of our  knowledge, no published reports are available from India using  molecular methods for evaluation of minimal residual disease.  The present study was conducted to evaluate the cytogenetic  and molecular response in CML patients on Interferon  Î± 2b (IFN  Î± 2b) therapy. Sequential cytogenetic analysis was done using  standard methods in 45 CML patients on IFN  Î± 2b therapy up to  a variable period of 3 years. Further dual colour Fluorescence In  Situ Hybridisation (FISH) analysis using specific probes for bcr and  abl genes was done to assess the molecular response. Complete  cytogenetic response (CCR) was observed in 8 patients. Of these 8  patients in CCR, 4 were negative for the bcr/abl  fusion gene implying  a complete cytogenetic and molecular response while the remaining  4 showed bcr/abl  fusion signals representing residual disease. Thus the present study stresses on the need for sequential cytogenetic  and molecular analysis in CML patients on therapy. The importance  of using FISH on interphase nuclei and poorly spread metaphases  that cannot be analysed using conventional cytogenetics is also  highlighted.",2002

CDKN2A, located in 9p21, consists of three  coding exons and encodes the cell cycle inhibitor, p16. This protein  plays a role as a negative regulator of the cyclin D1/CDK4/p16/pRb  signaling pathway, the major growth control pathway in the cell  cycle. In our study, on a wide sample of melanoma prone families,  we found 8 pedigrees in which a CDKN2A mutation was evidenced,  some already described in literature and some as a new mutation  (Pro48Thr, ivs1+2(T C), 201delC). Analyzing clinical data of these  8 families we observed that in 6 (75%) it was present at least one  multiple primary melanoma (MPM). The presence of a MPM in a so  large amount of the mutated cases brings us to consider CDKN2A  mutations as responsible to a high constitutional risk for melanocytes  transformation. For this reason, we think relevant to include CDKN2A   mutational screening in all the families in which there is one patient  with MPM, even if not familial. In addition in 2 out of our 8 families a larynx carcinoma was also  present, supporting the hypothesis of a related risk for this tumor in  CDKN2A mutation carriers. Al last, we also observed, in 5 out of these 8 pedigrees, the presence  of only two melanoma patients suggesting the opportunity to extend  CDKN2A mutations analysis also to families with less then three  affected relatives, at least in Italian population.",2002

LOH studies  demonstrate frequent loss of the NF1 gene in NF1 associated PAs.  Further, it has been demonstrated that loss of neurofibromin in a  NF1 associated PA is associated with elevated Ras GTP levels.  However, conflicting results on the role of the NF1 gene in the  development of sporadic PAs have been reported. Therefore, we  investigated 14 sporadic PAs for NF1 mutation and for LOH within the  NF1 locus. The protein truncation test, which identifies approximally  80% of the mutations found in NF1 patients, failed to detect NF1  mutations in 10 analyzed tumors. LOH analysis was unable to reveal  evidence for disruption of the NF1 gene in 11 informative cases.  The GTPase activating domain of the NF1 gene is expressed in  two isoforms. Using real time PCR we investigated the ratio of the  isoforms in 14 sporadic PAs and compared it to the ratios in normal  adult tissues, glioblastomas and neuroblastomas. In accordance  with previous reports we found marked predominance of the type II  transcripts in PAs as well as in two glioblastomas and in all analyzed  adult tissues including brain. In contrast, marked predominance of  the type I transcripts were observed in neuroblastomas. Our results  argue against a role of the NF1 gene as tumor suppressor in sporadic  PAs and suggest that the predominant expression of the type II NF1  transcript in PAs reflects the differentiation stage of the cells rather  than being a response to elevated cell proliferation.",2002

","More than 600 candidate genes were identified as differentially  expressed in gynaecological tumors by âin silicoâ approaches  and fifty of them, considered as either putative tumor suppressor  genes or oncogenes, were selected for further analysis in sporadic  gynaecological tumors by the GCC (Gynaecological Cancer  Consortium). To confirm the electronic Northern data, seven putative TSGs were  investigated by hybridization of cancer arrays (Clontech cancer  profiling arrays) against gene specific probes. Two genes (designated  bn39, bn40) were found to be expressed lower in up to 80% of breast  or ovarian cancer samples compared to matched corresponding  normal tissues, respectively. These data could be supported by real  time PCR (TaqMan) performed in matched tissue samples collected  at our hospitals. For each of the two determined TSG candidates, 20 LOH positive  tumor samples were screened for mutations by the DHPLC  technique. No functional mutations were found in one downregulated  candidate gene, only one frame shift mutation and one missense  mutation were detected in the other assumed TSG (bn40). To  characterize three putative oncogenes, expression was analysed  by hybridization of cancer arrays and assumed amplification was  determined by real time PCR or quantitative differential PCR. One  candidate gene (bt11) was shown to be frequently over expressed  especially in ovarian cancer while gene amplification could not be  shown. Conclusions: About 30% of the nominated candidate genes identified  by database screening were shown to be differentially expressed  in vivo. Down regulation of gene expression in cancer tissues might  be explained by epigenetic inactivation/activation mechanisms rather  than mutations or gene amplification.",2002

In an attempt to identify hepatoblastoma related  genes in this region we implemented a strategy that combined  restriction landmark genomic scanning (RLGS) and a genomic copy  number assay based on real time PCR. RLGS analysis uncovered six  chromosome 8 derived fragments amplified in one hepatoblastoma.  Virtual genomic scann, a novel informatic tool for sequence prediction  of RLGS fragments, identified the sequence of five of these  fragments.

The genes encoding Caveolin 1 and  2 are localized at 7q31.1.  The Cav 1 promoter contains several CpG dinucleotides of which  four are methylated in two human breast cancer cell lines. They fail  to express Cav 1 mRNA, suggesting an epigenetic mechanism of  Cav 1 gene regulation in these cell lines. WeÂ´re investigating the  role of Cav 1 in prostate cancer by investigating the expression of  Cav 1 in human cell lines derived from normal prostate and prostate  cancer. Our findings show that Cav 1 expression is absent from the  cell line LNCaP on RNA and protein level. To test the hypothesis that  DNA methylation in the promoter correlates with down regulation  of Cav 1 gene expression, we determined the methylation status of  additional prostate cell lines. A minimal promoter of Cav 1 contains  seven CpG sites and we found a very heterogeneous methylation  profile at four of these. Only the promoter region of LNCaP showed  almost complete methylation. The functional importance of these  CpG sites was demonstrated by an in vitro reporter gene assay  which revealed that the cav 1 promoter activity in vitro is regulated  by methylation of four CpG sites within its minimal promoter region.  We conclude therefore that repression of the Cav 1 gene in LNCaP  cells is due to DNA methylation. Furthermore, results from bandshift  assays demonstrated that a yet unknown methyl CpG binding protein  interacts with the methylated Cav 1 promoter region examined and  that this protein is different from MeCP2.",2002

Calcification of the basal ganglia,P0179.,"M. H. Abdel Salam , M. S. Zaki, N. A. Meguid","Department of Human Genetics, National Research Centre, Cairo,  Egypt","Calcification of the basal ganglia was observed in more than 30  medical conditions including infections, trauma and hemorrhage and  many genetic syndromes. Diverse neurobehavioral and psychiatric,  manifestations have been linked to this disorder. However, its etiology  remains obscure. Eleven cases were investigated who showed  calcification of the basal ganglia on computed tomography (CT). Main  presenting neurological symptoms were loss of acquired milestones  (3 cases), epilepsy (5 cases) and developmental delay (8 cases). Age  of onset and course of the disease were variable. Calcification in the  basal ganglia was bilateral in most of the cases (8 cases). Globus  pallidus was by far the most common site of calcification in the basal  ganglia. Further calcification in different parts of the brain rather than  basal ganglia was present in (4 cases) cortical, subcortical, white  matter or dentate nucleus. Measurements of the size of calcification  of basal ganglia and the neurological scoring were constructed.  Correlation of the neurological impairment and the size of calcifi cation  were non significant. However, the neurological impairment was  significantly inversely correlated with the head circumference  (p<0.002). In addition, the site of calcification inside the basal ganglia  was not pathognomonic. Parenatal consanguinity was documented  in 9 cases and positive history of affected family members in 7 cases  emphasizing the major role of the autosomal recessive gene in the  inheritance in these cases. We represent different phenotypes of  this mysterious sign and highlights the importance of computed  tomography in verification of calcification to overcome the difficulties  in genetic counseling of such cases.",2002

","Introduction: Mutation in AAAS gene has been proposed as the  underlying mechanism of triple A syndrome. We have studied these  mutations in a family in order to determine whether the healthy family  member is involved.  Method:  A family with involved triple A and double A syndrome as  well as alacrimia itself comprised study population. Control group  was from the noninvolved members of the family. 10 cc of peripheral  blood sample were obtained from each member. DNA was extracted  from Buffy coat layer and stored in 4 oC. Sequencing analysis was  performed for the exon 10 of each member. Results:  Proband was a 17 years old boy with triple A. He had two  sisters; A 19 years old otherwise healthy and a 12 years old with  double A syndrome. They have been born of a consanguineous  marriage. Aunt of their grandfather was involved by alacrimia  according to the family history. Sequencing analysis revealed a  single basepair insertion in exon 10 of the AAAS gene (1 BP INS,  1071T) in proband and the younger sister. Interestingly, we found the  mutation in his father which was otherwise healthy. Unfortunately, the  grandparents were not alive at the time of the study. Other members  of the family showed no mutation in the AAAS. Conclusion:  It seems that 1 BP INS, 1071T which was reported  previously in turkey is the responsible gene for the disease in Iran.  We propose that the mutation in AAAS alone can not induce triple A  in involved cases.",2002

The main features  are short, immobile neck and small thorax with the patognomonic  âcrab likeâ rib cage associated with multiple vertebral defects,  what frequently leads to respiratory problems and death in infancy .  Carefully prenatal ultrasound examination during the second  trimester should done for subsequent pregnancies. A clinically similar  disorders is Spondylocostal dysostosis (SCD). The main features  are abnormalities of vertebral segmentation and of the ribs, including  multiple hemivertebrae, vertebral clefting and fused, hypoplastic  vertebrae, rib fusions and deletions with a non progressive  kyphoscoliosis. Survival is much better and neural tube defects  only rarely occur. Cases are sporadic or familial, both recessive and  dominant autosomal inheritance has been reported. The identification  of genes affecting somitogenesis will be assist better classification.  Recently mutations in the recessive form were demonstrated in the  Notch pathway gene, DLL3, mapped at 19q13. We describe here  six cases of multiple vertebral segmentation defects. Two newborns  with the classical features of JLS, both had respiratory problems  with âfan likeâ chest deformities and one associated with thoracic  meningomyelocele and club foot deformity. The remaining four infant  presented features of SCD. These had short neck and trunk, different  degree kyphoscoliosis and occasional spina bifida.

Death usually occurs within the first year of  life from heart failure. nMFS results from mutations clustering in exons 24 to 32 of the  fibrillin 1 gene (FBN 1). Until now, only 19 mutations have been  described. This disorder has to be differentiated from severe lethal Congenital  Contractural Arachnodactyly (CCA), caused by mutations in the  fibrillin 2 gene (FBN 2). Severe lethal CCA is characterized by a  nMFS like appearance, but there is no ectopia lentis and visceral  anomalies are different : cardiac septal defects, interrupted aortic  arch and gastrointestinal abnormalities. We describe a newborn male, born from nonconsanguineous  healthy parents. At birth, he presented with a severe respiratory distress. Characteristic features of nMFS and CCA were seen at  physical examination. An echocardiogram showed marked prolapse  and regurgitation of both mitral and tricuspid valves. Neither  gastrointestinal, nor ocular abnormalities were present. Despite  vigorous treatment, death occurred at 62 hours from cardiac failure.  The visceral anomalies suggested the diagnosis of nMFS. Molecular  analysis confirmed this diagnosis with the detection of a new FBN 1  missense mutation at nucleotide 3165 in exon 25 (C1055W). In conclusion, nMFS and severe lethal CCA can be clinically  distinguished by visceral anomalies. The FBN 1 exon 25 mutation in  our patient confirmed the diagnosis of nMFS and is in agreement with  the previously described genotype phenotype correlation.",2002

","The Clark Baraitser syndrome of multiple congenital anomalies,  tall stature, macrocephaly and mental retardation, has been in a  limbo for many years. In the original report (Am J Med Genet 26: 13 15,1987), Clark and Baraitser suggested that their patients, two  brothers and a carrier mother, may have the Atkin Flaitz syndrome.  In the subsequent description of affected cousins (Am J Med Genet  57:380 384,1995), Baraitser et al. favored the view that all of their  patients had a condition distinct from the Atkin Flaitz syndrome. We  support the same view, by describing two brothers, who do not have  the Atkin Flaitz syndrome and strongly resemble Baraitserâs patients.  These boys are obese, macrocephalic, one of them excessively  tall and both have a characteristic face with square forehead,  prominent supraorbital ridges, bulbous tip of nose, short philtrum,  gap between upper central incisors, large ears. Genitalia are normal.  They also have big hands and feet and advanced bone age. They  are moderately to severely retarded, with a quiet but stubborn  personality. On brain MRI they have lateral ventricular dilatation,  cortical and cerebellar vermis hypoplasia. The fragile X syndrome  was ruled out by DNA testing and the Simpson Golabi Behmel  syndrome can also be ruled out for lack of specific signs.

Pseudoachondroplastic dysplasia in a 4 years old  boy.,P0195.,"Naumchik , N. Rumyantseva, N. Nehai","Institute of Hereditary Diseases, Minsk, Belarus","Pseudoachondroplasia (PSACH) is a spondyloepiphyseal dysplasia  characterized by dysproportionate short stature with relatively long  trunk, short bowed arms and legs and normal skull and face. On  the basis of severity of radiographic findings Hall and Dorst (1969)  classified PSACH into 4 types, 2 dominant (I, 177150 and III, 177170  MIM) and 2 recessive (II, 264150 and IV, 264160 MIM). In some  cases gonadal mosaicism was proposed. FP was the only child of young healthy nonconsanguineous parents  of average height. He was born after 37 wk pregnancy with BW  3000 g (75th percentile) and BL 48 cm (75th percentile). His motor  development was normal. Bowing of the legs and abnormal gait were  present from 18 months. At 4 years of age he was 88 cm tall (3rd  percentile) with good intelligence and showed normal skull, relatively  long trunk, exaggerated lumbar lordosis, and asymmetric bowed legs.  Radiographs showed widened metaphyses, small epiphyses of the  long bones with delayed ossification, mild platyspondyly. Laboratory  testing for metabolic diseases was normal. PSACH was diagnosed  although the sub type of the disorder was not verified. Detection of PSACH subtypes in early childhood is difficult due  to overlap the main clinical and radiological signs and limited  pathological changes for young children. We will compare our data  with those in the literature and discuss the differential criteria of the  sub types of PSACH.",2002

Ouvrier1","1Royal Alexandra Hospital for Children, Westmead, Australia,  2University of Sydney, Sydney, Australia","Arts syndrome was first described in a Dutch family with X linked  ataxia, muscle weakness in response to infections, deafness, loss of  vision in early childhood and a fatal course. We describe a family with  two affected brothers and a maternal uncle who died at 2 years of  age of a âmuscular dystrophyâ without having developed any speech.  The two brothers have profound sensorineural deafness, peripheral  neuropathy with generalised muscle weakness and, in the older boy ,  symptomatic optic atrophy. They are predisposed to severe muscle  weakness during recurrent infections which has led to mechanical  ventilation on a number of occasions. To localise the region for this syndrome, an exclusion mapping  approach was taken, using 33 microsatellite markers covering the  X chromosome. DNA was available from the affected brothers, their  normal sister, parents, maternal grandparents and an unaffected  maternal uncle. Two candidate regions were identified: Xq23 between  DXS 1106 and DXS 8064 (~13cM), and Xq27 between DXS 1227  and DXS 8091 (~21.4cM). The candidate region Xq21.33 q24 was  identified in the original family, so the Xq23 region was deemed most  likely. Databases were searched for likely candidate genes. TRPC5  was selected as the most likely because of its involvement in Ca2  flux, and its expression in mammalian brain and Drosophila eye.  Screening of this gene is in progress. To date one A>G change has  been identified at 919 42 (intron 1) in the affected boys, their normal  father and maternal grandfather. It is therefore likely to be a common  polymorphism.",2002

The  literature contains 7 cases with deletions distal to 7q35. In  conventional cytogenetics these deletions may be overlooked, so that  clinical characteristics have to be elaborated to further delineate a  specific syndrome. Case report: The girl was born as the second child to a 22 years  old mother and a 28 years old father. She was born at 39 weeks of  gestation. She had low birth weight with 2625g (5th centile), length: 47cm(10th centile), head circumference:30,8cm(<10th centile). The  cry was weak and she had severe problems with sucking, so that  gavage feeding was necessary. The most striking features were  microcephaly with a narrow forhead and large dysplastic ears with  a wide exernal meatus. The palpebral fissures slanted up. The nose was short with a bulbous tip, the philtrum was simple, the maxilla  hypoplastic. The muscle tone was generally reduced. The EEG was  abnormal. X ray showed thin ribs and an vertically absent sacrum,  which could not be suspected clinically.Sonographic investigations  revealed a tethered cord with a very low lying conus medullaris  inserting in a small lipoma. Hearing was severely impared. Standard  chromosomal analysis was normal, but subtelomeric analysisis using  a comercial multitelomere FISH.kit(Cytocell) revealed the absent  signal on 7qter.

Other SCS patients carry the missense  mutation P250R in the FGFR3 gene, leading to a similar phenotype.  The classical SCS phenotype includes brachycephaly or acrocephaly  and partial cutaneous syndactyly of hands and feet. The phenotypic expression of SCS is highly variable also within  families. These variability is very likely due to an influence of  modifying genes. Under the assumption that special alleles of  the FGFR1, 2 or 3 genes may be such modifiers, we investigated  several members of a German SCS family. Two members of this  family, a 6 months old boy and his father, displayed the classical  SCS phenotype. With the exception of partial cutaneous syndactyly ,  no further symptoms were present in the boys paternal uncle,  grandmother and grand grandmother. Both the boy and his father carried two mutations: D161X in the  TWIST gene and S252L in the FGFR2 gene. D161X had previously  been described in a SCS patient, and S252L was associated with a  mild Crouzon phenotype. No other family member carried D161X.  However, S252L was present in all family members with syndactyly.  We conclude that D161X arose de novo, leading to the classical SCS  phenotype, while S252L was associated with cutaneous syndactyly  only and spread from the paternal grandmother over the whole family .  To the best of our knowledge, this is the first family in which both a  TWIST and a FGFR2 mutation were present in SCS patients.",2002

Wilson1, S. J. Rickard2","1Institute of Child Health & Great Ormond Street Hospital, London,  United Kingdom, 2Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom","Albrightâs Hereditary Osteodystrophy (AHO) results from  heterozygous deactivating mutations in the GNAS1 gene which  encodes the alpha subunit of the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory  G protein, Gs. Associated clinical features include short stature,  obesity, brachymetaphalangia, ectopic ossifications and learning  disability. Inheritance is autosomal dominant but modified by genomic  imprinting. Maternal transmission is associated with the endocrine  features of pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHPIa) whereas paternal  transmission is usually not (pseudo pseudohypoparathyroidism,  PPHP). GNAS1 comprises 13 exons and the imprinting appears to be tissue  specific. However, 3 discrete upstream exons (NESP55, XLAS, exon 1A) which are spliced to exons 2 13 of GNAS are imprinted in all  tissues tested. Expression is exclusively maternal for NESP55 and  paternal for XLAS and 1A. We have screened for sequence changes in all the exons and  splice junctions of GNAS1 in a cohort of patients with AHO and  found a variety of mutations. We have confirmed that imprinting of  NESP55 and exon 1A is conserved in lymphoblastoid cell lines. In  AHO patients with mutations in exons 2   13 of GNAS from whom  lymphoblastoid cell lines were available, we have tested directly for  the mutation in the NESP55 and 1A cDNA transcripts. In 3 sporadic  patients with PPHP we have confirmed the mutation is present in the  1A transcript, but not NESP55 indicating paternal origin. In 6 patients  with AHO and PHP Ia we have confirmed the converse indicating  maternal origin. With the discontinuation of PTH for stimulation  testing, the clinical application for predicting the endocrine phenotype  in AHO patients will be discussed.",2002

A paternal  uncle and cousin had the reciprocal rearrangement with a derivative  of chromosome 1 resulting in partial monosomy for chromosome 1q  and partial trisomy for chromosome 3p. While profound mental and physical retardation, poor survival,  congenital heart defects, and neurologic abnormities were  characteristic for both rearrangements, facial dysmorphism was quite  distinct for each recombinant. Individuals who had the derivative  chromosome 3 had a long face, wide eyebrows, small palpebral  fissures, hypertelorism, prominent glabella, a large tip of the nose,  long philtrum with thin upper lip, and low set ears with prominent  helices. In contrast, family members with the derivative chromosome  1 had a tall forehead with bifrontal narrowing, full and large cheeks,  and large simple ears. In this kindred, the ratio of normal to abnormal individuals born to  balanced carriers is believed to be 1:1.5.

Twist  null/+ mice have been found to reproduce the main clinical features  of SCS. The aim of this work is the analysis of the phenotypic spectrum  related to haploinsufficiency in the TWIST gene through the study of  a large Indian family and the observation of the murine phenotype. Material and Methods: The TWIST gene was a candidate gene in a  large Indian family presenting with an autosomal dominant phenotype  initially classified as Blepharophimosis Epicanthus Inversus  Syndrome (BPES) linked to 7p21. The eyelid phenotype of twist null/+ mice bred on different genetic  backgrounds was observed. Results: A new nonsense mutation, at codon 82, was detected for  16 members of the family (excluding the 7p21 locus as the second  BPES locus as initially suggested). The clinical reappraisal of these 16 individuals carrying the mutation  identified a complete SCS phenotype for only 4 patients (25%).  75% of the patients did not show craniostenosis, 25% had a  phenotype considered to be normal and 75% of the patients had  eyelid anomalies. Isolated eyelid anomalies, without any cranial  anomalies, were also observed on Twist null/+ mice bred on a mixed  background. Conclusions: The clinical analysis of the Indian family confirms the  wide variability of the phenotype related to TWIST haploinsufficiency  ranging form a normal phenotype, an isolated eyelid malformation  to severe craniostenosis. In parallel, the wide phenotypic variability  was also observed in twist null/+ mice bred on different genetic  backgrounds.",2002

We report on a 5 year old boy  who by detailed cytogenetic procedures was diagnosed as having a  distal deletion 3p as well as a duplication (3)(q26>qter) due to a large  pericentric inv(3) inherited from his father. In addition to conventional  karyotyping, final diagnosis was achieved using multiprobe telomer  testing (Cytocell) and region specific FISH probes. Theoretically our  patient should express both the partial dup (3)(q26>qter) and the  deletion (3)(p25>pter) syndromes. In contrast we noted a mild but  apparent dysmorphic pattern with distinct features   square face,  temporal indentation, broad eyebrows, full cheeks, bulbous nose, and  full lips   suggestive of a mitigated partial dup 3p syndrome. No major malformation was observed. Causal parental pericentric inversion  was reported in a number of cases with similar breakpoints, but  the children were mostly severely affected with short survival. This  report should draw attention to some interesting details: (i) Loss of  the most distal region of 3p may be noticed without phenotypic ef fect  (Knight, J Med Genet 1995).(ii) Prediction of the phenotype seems  difficult even in well described conditions like 3qter syndrome (iii) In a  given pericentric inversion, survival would be more probable in great  duplication plus a small subtelomeric deletion than vice versa.",2002

To date the etiology has not been  elucidated and the search for molecular variants in these patients  has been focused to genes involved in the MÃ¼llerian regression Posters   Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 120 121 system. We present the results of molecular studies in the AMH, AMH  receptor, and GALT (galactose 1 phosphate uridyl transferase)genes  in a group of 12 Mexican patients with MRKHS. Methods: DNA  extraction from blood leukocytes, PCR amplification of all exons and  all exon/intron junctions of the AMH and AMHR genes, and PCR  amplification of exon 10 of GALT. Results: No mutations were found  in any of the patients in the AMH or AMHR. However, we identified  5 new polymorphisms: two in intron 6 of the AMHR gene, 1 in exon  1 of the AMH gene, and two in exon 5 of the AMH gene. All three  polymorphisms in the AMH gene change the encoded aminoacid.  When compared with 30 control alleles AMH exon 1 polymorphism  showed a preliminar association with the disease. The GALT N314D  allele, previously associated with the disease, was observed only  in one of our patients. These results demonstrate that mutations  at the AMH or AMHR genes are not a common cause of MRKHS.  Polymorphisms at the AMH or AMHR genes may contribute to  develop the phenotype.",2002

Short stature and delayed  puberty, which affect individualâs personal image, are common  complications associated with thalassemia major (TM) patients. Such  problems have psychological implications which deter an individual  from participating in peer group activities. In developing countries,  thalassemic patients are at a high risk of developing endocrine  deficiencies and hence growth failure. We evaluated growth pattern  of TM patients to see if they are experiencing secular trend in height  and weight as has been observed in the world populations. Material: Height, weight, serum ferritin and pretransfusion hemoglobin of 90 patients (2 17 years) were evaluated over a period of 3 years.  Growth pattern of these patients was compared with New and Old  Indian growth Standards and thalassemic patients from New Delhi. Results: Growth pattern of patients shows that they were significantly  shorter than New Indian Growth Standards . There was no significant  difference between height and weight of our patients and thalassemic  patients from New Delhi. Although our patients above the age of 11  years were short, the prepubertal patients were taller and heavier  than 35 years old Indian growth Standards. This suggests that our  patients are experiencing secular trend in height and weight. Conclusion: We attribute gain in height and weight to better treatment  regime. Better treatment and management can improve growth of  TM patients. However, this is possible provided financial support from  national and international agencies is available.",2002

The mean age of the patients was 24.7 (4 41) yrs and 30% were  male. Mean BSA was 1.54mÂ² Mean aortic diameter at the sinuses of Valsalva was 26.9mm (SD  4.6mm). Mean aortic diameter at the supra aortic ridge was 23.8mm  (SD 3.69mm). For each patient we compared the aortic root diameter with the  population based norms (Roman et al (2)). None of the patients  showed aortic dilatation at the sinuses of Valsalva. One 17y old  female patient with hypermobile EDS had an aortic diameter at the  supra aortic ridge that was slightly higher than 2SD In conclusion, we could not demonstrate aortic root dilatation in our  series of 40 patients with EDS. This is important with respect to the  management and genetic counselling in EDS. Longitudinal follow  up studies are necessary to evaluate the evolution of aortic root  diameters in this patient group. 1. Beighton et al, Am J Med Genet;77(1):31 7. 2.

Discovery of the molecular  basis for GVM permitted delineation of the clinical phenotype and  comparisons between GVM and other venous anomalies. Clinical data based on physical examination, and review of medical  records and clinical slides was compiled for 1716 patients with  inherited or sporadic venous anomalies. Diagnosis was histologically  and/or genetically confirmed for all inherited venous lesions and  most sporadic lesions. The data were statistically analyzed using the  Fisherâs exact test (two tailed) with SYSTAT software (version 10,  http:// www.spssscience.com/systat). We identified 30 patients with sporadic GVM, 105 with inherited GVM,  1548 with sporadic venous malformation (VM), and 33 with inherited  mucocutaneous venous malformation (CMVM). GVMs, accounting for  5% of venous anomalies, were frequently inherited (78%), whereas  venous malformations were rarely familial (2%). GVMs always  involved skin and subcutis, in contrast to CMVMs and VMs (p<0,001).  GVMs had a distinct raised cobblestone appearance. Trauma  was reported as an inciting factor for appearance of new lesion by  patients with inherited GVM (p=0,007), in contrast to patients with  CMVM. None of the patients with extensive GVM presented with  coagulopathy, in contrast to patients with large VM. This is the largest series of patients with cutaneous venous  anomalies. It establishes clinical criteria for differential diagnosis  between GVM and other subtypes of venous anomalies. This  differential diagnosis is essential as the treatment and outcome are  different.

Clinical  diagnosis is usually straightforward, however, CM can masquerade  a high flow vascular lesion, i.e., stage one AVM or AVF. We identified  several families with inherited CM. We clinically examined each  family member, noted all vascular anomalies and collected informed  consents and blood samples. Inter  and intrafamilial variation was observed, from nuchal CM  persisting throughout life and extending below the hairline, to solitary  or multiple CM disseminated all over the body. Seven of our families  with inherited CM had a member affected with a high flow vascular  malformation: three with either AVM (n=2) or AVF (n=1). Four families  had two members with AVM (n=8) including Parkes Weber syndrome  (n=3), AVM with multiple CM (n= 3), and intraosseus AVM with  cutaneous blush (n=1) or with extensive CM (n=1). These data confirmed autosomal inheritance of CM. The high  incidence of high flow vascular malformations within families with  inherited CM suggests genetic predisposition for AVM and/or AVF in  these families. (vikkula@bchm.ucl.ac.be)",2002

All patients diagnosed with CFC syndrome are sporadic, born to  non consanguineous parents and had normal chromosomes on  conventional cytogenetics. Rauen et al. [2000] reported on a patient with CFC phenotype and  an interstitial deletion of the 12q21.2q22 chromosome region. The  authors concluded that a gene responsible for the CFC syndrome  is likely to reside in this chromosome region. We looked for  microdeletions within this region in 17 CFC patients (12 males and 5 females), aged 2 to 25 years, by FISH, using 12 BAC probes  covering the 12q21.2q22 region at average intervals of about 1 Mb.  The patients presented with mental retardation (17/17), typical facial  appearance, with high forehead, bitemporal constriction, bulbous  nose, low set and posteriorly angulated ears, palpebral ptosis and  downslanting eyes (17/17), ectodermal abnormalities, consisting  of thin, sparse and curly hair, absent or sparse eyelashes and  eyebrows, keratosis pilaris, or hyperkeratotic skin patches (17/17),  speech delay (17/17), short stature (16/17), heart defect (14/17)  and relative macrocephaly (12/17).

Experienced geneticists usually make a diagnosis through immediate  pattern recognition. We have investigated how well a computer can  do this. In view of the fact that patients with a syndrome look more  similar than unrelated individuals do, we have chosen a pattern  recognition program that was developed to identify a person by  matching his face to faces stored in a database. It is not based  on anthropometric measurements, but uses digital photographs  of 256x256 pixels which are subjected to a Gabor Wavelet  Transformation to create a vector with 40 complex coefficients  (jet) for every pixel. For the purpose of this study, each face was  automatically labeled with 48 nodes. The jets attached to each  node of a face were then compared to the jets of all nodes at the  same fiducial points of every face in the data base (bunch graph).  Classification was based on a majority decision of all analysed  nodes of a face (jet voting). Analysis of 32 innerfacial nodes from  55 frontal view photographs of patients with mucopolysaccharidosis  type III (n=6), Cornelia de Lange (n=12), fragile X (n=12), Prader  Willi (n=12), and Williams Beuren syndrome (n=13) revealed correct  syndrome recognition in 42/55 (76%) of the patients.

Point mutations have been found in PMP22, myelin protein zero  (MPZ) (CMT1B phenotype), connexin 32 (Cx32) (CMTX phenotype)  and early growth response 2 (EGR2) genes which have important  role in the CMT pathogenesis. Aim of this study was to investigate mutations in MPZ and PMP22  genes in Croatian patients with different neuromuscular and  neurodegenerative diseases. We employed single strand conformational polymorphism analysis  (SSCP) for mutational screening. PCR products with altered mobility  patterns were sequenced to analyze the type of mutation. A novel Ser8Ser mutation was found in exon 1 of the MPZ gene in  two heterozygous subjects, in a father with mild CMT2 phenotype  and his daughter with normal clinical data. Thr118Met polymorphism  was found in exon 5 of the PMP22 gene. For the first time we found  heterozygosity for 118Met allele with nemalin myopathy. The second  heterozygous patient for 118Met allele had CMT1 disease.

To  evaluate the role of COL5A2 gene mutations in this group of patients  skin biopsy samples were taken from 6 patients with EDS I and 5  patients with EDS II. We isolated mRNA from cultured fibrobasts and  made RT PCR to get cDNA . Eleven pairs of primers for about 4,5  kb mRNA COL5A2 were designed and carried out the PCR SSCP  analysis. We have found the absence of first fragment including  the first ATG codon in EDS II patient. The clinical signs included  thin skin with moderate hyperextensibity, easy bruising, joint laxity,  scoliosis, pectus excavatum, flat feet, myopia, retinal bleeding and  varicose rectal veins. Other manifestations were striae and recurrent  hyperbilirubinemia, which are not typical for EDS. The study is in a  progress now.",2002

For variety of social and cultural practices various Gypsy groups in  our country represent genetic isolates with a very high rate of some  autosomal recessive neuromuscular disorders . During the last 7  years we identified several single gene disorders limited to specific  traditionally endogamous Gypsy groups in Bulgaria:  1. Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Lom (HMSNL)   is a severe demyelinating peripheral neuropathy associated with  sensorineural deafness, mapped to chromosome 8q24 (Kalaydjieva  et al., 1996, 1998) and caused by a truncating mutation in the N myc  downstream regulated gene 1 (Kalaydjieva et al, 2000). The disorder  affects different endogamous Gypsy metagroups belong to the  Wallachian Gypsy group: Kalderas, Kopanari and Lom Gypsies. 2. Congenital cataracts facial dysmorphism neuropathy (CCFDN)  syndrome is a novel multisystem genetic disorder which combines  both developmental abnormalities and a progressive neurological  deficit (Tournev et al., 1999). The most important features of  the syndrome include congenital cataracts and microcorneae,  dysmorphic facial features and small stature, mental retardation, a  predominantly motor peripheral neuropathy and hypogonadotropic  hypogonadism. The CCFDN syndrome was mapped on 18q23 (D.  Angelicheva et al., 1999).  3. Hereditary motor and sensory neuropathy type Russe  (HMSNR) is a severe, progressive, sensorimotor neuropathy with  prominent sensory loss in association with an intermediate reducton  in nerve conduction velocity (P.K. Thomas et al., 2001). Linkage  analysis localized the HMSN R gene to chromosome 10q23, in close  proximity to the EGR2 gene (T. Rogers, 2000).",2002

Haploinsufficiency of the Jagged 1  gene (JAG1) has been shown to cause Alagille syndrome. Abdominal  coarctation is an uncommon vascular congenital anomaly and has  been described only twice in AGS. We report on two more patients  with coarctation of the abdominal aorta in AGS. Recently, Loomes et al (Hum Mol Genet. 1999; 8(13): 2443 9) have  shown that Jagged1 gene is expressed in the developing heart and  in multiple associated vascular structure including the descending  aorta. Jones et al (J Med Genet 2000;37:658 662) studied the tissue  expression of JAG1 in human embryo and noticed that JAG1 was  also expressed in the developing aorta. We performed molecular  analysis of the Jagged1 gene in one of our patients with AGS and  abdominal coarctation and found a mutation deletion (1485 Del CT).  This corroborates with Loomes and Jones studies and confirms that  coarctation of aorta might be a part of the Alagille syndrome.

This investigation  provided us with two perspectives: 1) adequate training of the staf f  to prepare the pedigrees; 2) counselling of subjects at risk. It is to  be noted the importance of improving the professional practice to  construct a ânew professionalâ. Regarding counselling of subjects at  risk it is admitted that: A) transfer of results (diagnosis, prognosis)  must warrant privacy, based on psychological, sociocultural, ethical  and philosophical principles. B) there is a well known impact  produced by âknowing oneself and the own expectationsâ, thus  it is convenient to provide psychological support and/or preserve  the subject emotionally, as well as to suggest a consultation with  specialists.

Up to 4 weeks after birth the animals  are normotensive. Males first develop hypertension around 12 weeks  pp and hypertrophy of the left heart ventricle around 26 weeks pp.  We established a subtractive hybridization system based on cDNA  selection and suppression PCR using mRNA from these stages.  Subtractive hybridization using age groups 4  versus 12  as well as  12  versus 26 weeks identified 145 different cDNA clones. Screening  of these clones revealed 56 cDNAs as candidates for differentially  expressed genes during development to cardiac hypertrophy.  Northern blot analysis of 42 cDNAs identified 16 genes to be  upregulated in cardiac tissue of SHR in comparison to the wild type  Wistar Kyoto rat. In silico analysis of cDNA sequences identified  several known genes which are being discussed already in the context with cardiomyopathy (g sarcoglycan) or cardiac hypertrophy  (acyl coA dehydrogenase).

In Italian population, typical HFE mutations account for 64% of overt  hereditary hemochromatosis (HH)(versus 100% in other countries of  Celtic descent).A common HFE unrelated disease was hypothesized. One thousand and fifty candidate blood donors were screened by  iron tests,C282Y and H63D HFE mutations in a region in North Italy.  Subjects with repeated fasting transferrin saturation of 45% or more  and no secondary iron overload were defined as probands with  idiopathic iron overload. To assess the inheritance of iron overload,  relatives of probands were screened. The overall frequency of idiopathic iron overload probands was  3.43% (95% confidence interval, 2.32 to 4.52). 8.4% of them  had genotypes associated with HH (compound heterozygous for  H63D/C282Y or homozygous for H63D HFE mutations). 91.6% had  atypical genotypes: 47.2% were heterozygous for C282Y or H63D  HFE mutations, and 44.4% had wild type homozygote genotype.Iron  overload was familial in 33.3% of probands with atypical genotypes  (1.04% of the overall population). Pedigree analysis excluded linkage  of heterozygous HFE mutations with iron overload (cumulative lod  score  2.41) and documented a recessive non HLA linked locus  accounting for iron overload in wild type homozygote genotypes.  None of the probands had clinical signs of iron accumulation; in  males, serum ferritin positively correlated with age (r=0.63, P<0.01),  and the regression model predicted a serum ferritin of 700 ng per  millilitre at the age of 58. Conclusions. In Northern Italy an HFE unrelated, mild idiopathic  iron overload is highly prevalent. A recessive locus accounts for iron  overload in at least 1.04% of the overall population.",2002

However cytogenetic  results showed a mosaic for a marker chromosome in about 25%  of all mitoses and a high number of chromosomal rearrangements,  in particular balanced and unbalanced translocations preferentially  involving chromosomes 7,8 and 14 with decreasing relative  incidence. Multicolour FISH and whole chromosome paint  analysis demonstrated that the marker chromosome is derived  from chromosome 8 leading to the following karyotype: mos  47,XY,+mar.ish der(8)(wcp8+) [7] / 46,XY [23]. Improved banding  analysis performed subsequently allowed to specify a terminal  deletion with a breakpoint at 8q21.1 in the aberrant chromosome  8. So far there is no indication for a hematological anomaly or  malignancy, but a cytogenetic analysis of fibroblasts was also not  performed yet to confirm a constitutional mosaicism. It is interesting  that the breakpoint in 8q21 is identical at the cytogenetic level with  the Nijmegen Breakage Syndrome (NBS1) gene locus. Therefore  further molecular studies will be performed.",2002

It results from fertilization of an empty egg by a hapoid  sperm which duplicates without cytokinesis and restores diploidy , or  by two sperms. Outcome depends on maternal criteria of gravity : the risk of  persistent trophoblastic disease (PTD) is higher than is single  complete mole and seems to be correlated to zygocity mechanism  identified by molecular analysis. We report 4 well documented cases of complete hydatidiform mole  (CHM) coexistent with a twin live fetus (CHMLF). All of them were  spontaneous pregnancies, 2 ended by delivery of a live born baby ,  the 2 others were terminated because of maternal pre eclampsia  associated with intra uterine fetal death. If cytogenetic studies are sufficient for determining the ploidy,  molecular analysis are necessary to confirm the mecanism. Genomic DNA was extracted from the placenta, molar tissue and  peripheral blood leucocytes of parents. Using 10 microsatellites  marquers, we showed the paternal origin the molar tissue, and  homozygosity of the mole was confirmed in the four cases. As very rare, more cases are needed to predict the outcome.  Expectant management can be only discussed in absence of  maternal complications, associated with a normal fetal karyotype.

Paternal costitutional mosaicism in familial bpes,P0270.,"Piemontese1, P. Gasparini2, L. Zelante1","1IRCCS CSS, S","Giovanni Rotondo, Italy, 2TIGEM, Napoli, Italy. Blepharophimosis ptosis epycanthus inversus syndrome (BPES ) is  an autosomal dominant disorder recently ascribed to mutations in  the FOXL2 gene, a forkhead transcription factor. In type I BPES a  complex eyelid malformation is associated with premature ovarian  failure (POF), whereas in type II BPES the eyelid defect occurs as  an isolated entity. Here, we report a family with one child affected  by BPES.Both parents were clinically unaffected , and there was no  family history of an eyelid defect. Screening for mutations in the FOXL2 gene in the patient using  direct sequencing revealed a frameshift deletion in the coding region,  giving rise to a truncating protein.The same mutation was found in  both peripheral blood and fibroblasts of the father in mosaicism with  a percentage of about 25%. A reexamination of clinical findings in  the father revealed, indeed, a minimal reduction of the horizontal  diameter of the palpebral fissures. This study reports the first documented case of costitutional  mosaicism in BPES and serves as a reminder that mosaicism  should be considered in every case when a mutation is found. This observation has a significant impact on genetic counseling  of sporadic cases of BPES. In case of the paternal mosaicism an  accurate evaluation of the mosaicism distribution in the germinal  cells could provide an important tool to assign an accurate risk of  recurrence in the family.",2002

Although preference method is the direct mutation analysis of ATM  gene, but large size of the ATM gene with 63 exons and the large  number of possible mutation in patients considerably limit the facibility  of mutations analysis as a choice in diagnosis. Indirect method is a  better tool when parent are not carrier of founder mutation and pass  different mutations to their children. Indirect molecular diagnosis  using ATM related molecular markers facilitate prenatal diagnosis of  AT children. In this study four molecular markers: D11S2179,D11S1 787,D11S535,D11S1343 are genotype in 18 unrelated families from  different region of IRAN. Those markers are amplified using extracted  sequence primers from Gene Bank with their described PCR  conditions.

Spectral karyotyping (SKY) has been developed to unambiguously  display and identify all chromosomes at one time using a spectral  signature that generates 24 unique colors. Three cases of  constitutional supernumerary chromosomal markers and different  clinical manifestations are described in this report. Case 1: a male  (9 months of age) with microcephaly, up slanting palpebral fissures,  malformed ears, cryptorchidism, and âschawlâ scrotum. Case 2: a  6 year old female with facial asymmetry, strabismus, prominent nasal  bridge, micrognathia, and cubitus valgus. Case 3: a 14 year old male  with seizures, triangular face, strabismus, prominent ears, thoracic  asymmetry, scoliosis, cubitus valgus, macro orchidism, and wide gap  between first and second toes.

The data of 234 patients representing individual examples  of 21 different malformation syndromes were used. The numbers  of symptoms/combinations for the description of cases were limited  to 28, 55 and 78 in different series of tests. After the export of the  patients data to the shell the data of about 2/3 of the patients were  used for the training of the ANN. The remaining 1/3 of patients data  sets were used to test the diagnostic capacities of the different ANNs.  The most efficient yielded a diagnosis in more than 95 % of all tests.  Correct diagnoses without any concurrent differential diagnoses were  generated in 26 %; adding all tests producing the correct diagnosis  among other diagnoses amounted to 74 %. The application of ANNs  in the diagnostic process of malformation syndromes is efficient   one Posters   Clinical Genetics and Dysmorphology 134 135 shortcoming is, that different sets of training data produce models  with different generalization accuracies.

The  data of 119 patients with different clinically confirmed syndromes  were used to search differential diagnoses in OMIM feeding the signs  of the respective patient in all possible combinations. Four dif ferent  search strategies were tested (1) utilization of all signs of the patient,  (2) usage of those signs, that a clinical expert considered to be  important in diagnosis, (3) input of head neck signs (4) feeding all  but (3). The combinations of signs for the searches in OMIM were  created using the âANDâ and the âORâ junction. With the AND junction the number of differential diagnoses  decreased with the number of signs used in combination, while the  OR junction resulted in more than 200 differential diagnoses for  every syndrome and search strategy on the average. All four search  strategies yielded more than 50% positive results, interestingly even  strategy (4) was very effective. The number of differential diagnoses  decreased with the number of signs read in in combinations applying  the AND junction.

Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis  (PGD) represents an alternative approach to prenatal diagnosis,  especially for couples with an unsuccessful reproductive history  and/or undergoing assisted reproduction for male infertility who  have the additional risk of transmitting CF. The clinical application  requires optimization of single cell genotyping protocols to minimize  PCR failure, allelic drop out (ADO) and contamination. In addition  the protocol should allow detection of the wide spectrum of potential  CF affected genotypes, especially relevant for Southern European  populations. To this end we developed a flexible multiplex PCR  protocol allowing analysis of sequence variations in any combination  amongst 7 CFTR gene exons (4, 10, 11, 13 in two parts, 14b, 17b  and 21) by nested PCR and DGGE analysis, along with the intragenic  dinucleotide microsatellite IVS8CA. The experiments were carried  out on 390 single lymphocytes from 3 compound heterozygous  CF patients, one heterozygote and one non CF individual.

For Cystic fibrosis (CF), for which almost 1000 mutations have  been identified, the development of a mutation based PGD protocol  is impracticable. An way to overcome this problem is to set up  an indirect diagnosis using polymorphic markers allowing the  identification of the pathogenic haplotype instead of the mutation.  We present a new PGD protocol for CF, based on a multiplex  fluorescent PCR co amplifying the deltaF508 mutation and two CFTR  intragenic polymorphic microsatellites (IVS8CA and IVS17bCA).  Such an approach is justified since in 91% of the cases at least one  partner of the couple carries the deltaF508 mutation. The use of  intragenic markers reduces the risk of misdiagnosis due to meiotic  recombination. A PCR signal was obtained in 97% of the single  lymphoblasts (151/155) tested. A complete haplotyping was achieved in 137/151 (91%) lymphoblasts and a 6% rate of allele drop out  (ADO) was observed. During clinical application, 94% of blastomeres  gave PCR signals and a complete haplotype could be assigned to  84% of them. With the degree of polymorphism of the markers (48  and 39%) and their co amplification with the F508 locus, our test  should be suitable for nearly 80% of the couples requesting PGD for  CF. This fluorescent multiplex PCR indirect diagnosis provides also  a safer test since it allows confirmation of the diagnosis, detection  of contamination and could give an indication on the ploidy of the  embryos tested.",2002

Incidence was 1/2630, with a west/east gradient  which was confirmed over time (FinistÃ¨re: 1/2071 vs. Ille et Vilaine:  1/3286).

Since the identification of the cystic fibrosis (CF) gene  it has become possible to perform CF carrier screening. Despite the  positive results of pilot studies in various countries, carrier screening  is not yet standard practice. The question arises as to whether this  might be due to barriers in implementation. Objective. The objective was to explore possibilities and barriers  in the implementation of a nation wide preconceptional CF carrier  screening programme. Methods. Sessions with two focus groups of CF patients and CF  relatives, one focus group of people from the target population  (couples planning to have children), and two focus groups of care  providers (general practitioners, and health care workers in the  Municipal Health Services). Results. In general, there is a positive attitude among CF patients  and their relatives, the target population, and care providers towards  preconceptional CF carrier screening. The most important barriers in  implementation are the problem of reaching the target population, the  heavy workload of GPs, the limited knowledge about CF in general,  and the absence of a preconceptional consultation setting. Conclusion. Different intervention strategies will be necessary to  overcome the various barriers in the organisation and execution  of the screening. The positive attitude towards preconceptional  CF carrier screening, in combination with the willingness of the  care providers to participate in providing (a part of) the screening  programme, will make it easier to overcome the barriers.",2002

This  strategy results in early and accurate diagnosis of cystic fibrosis but  an excess of heterozygotes among neonates with hypertrypsinaemia  has been reported. Prevalence of heterozygosity in hypertrypsinaemic newborns.   We have assessed the heterozygosity frequency among 50.956  children born from July 2000 to December 2001 and screened for CF .  996 (1.9%, i.e. 1/51) of those tested had an IRT level greater than  the decisional threshold and were analysed for mutations. 19 were  CF with a positive sweat test and 80 were carriers. Incidence of CF  was 1/2682, leading to a carrier frequency of 1/26 while the estimated  frequency of heterozygtes in children with hypertrypsinaemia was  1/9, three times greater than the general population. The number  of different mutations in carriers is greater than in CF children (13  versus 10) and than in a cohort of 1574 newborns from our region,  not selected by IRT, analysed in a previous pilot screening (10  different mutations). The identification of an excess of heterozygotes  in hypertrypsinaemic newborns remains an important matter that can  be managed only with effective counseling strategies in the context of  newborn screening.",2002

In contrast  to many other recessive disorders, the carriers of CF mutations (1 in  25 Caucasians) have no biochemical or physiological alterations by  which they could readily be identified. As a consequence the search  for genetic markers became a matter of decisive importance. Thirteen  years after the discovery of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane  conductance regulator (CFTR) gene and the characterization of over  990 mutations, CF is now to become the first disease targeted for  population wide genetic screening. Pyrosequencing AB (Sweden) offers a PSQâ¢ 96 System well suited  to meet the demand for research and routine testing of mutations  in the CFTR gene, providing simple, rapid, cost efficient and  extremely accurate detection, of all relevant mutations, including  internal controls for each analyzed position. Pyrosequencingâ¢  is a DNA sequencing technology based on real time detection of  pyrophosphate released upon nucleotide incorporation. Highly  reliable CF assays have been designed and developed for all CFTR  mutations with a population frequency of â¥ 0.1% including point  mutations as well as insertions and deletions. The assays are greatly  condensed including multiplex design of both PCR and sequencing  reactions. The assays have also been optimized to even include less  common mutations in the same analysis simply by extending the  number of nucleotide dispensations in each pyrosequencing reaction.  In addition to these two approaches, the same assays have been  used for population based determination of carrier frequencies using  allele quantification.Posters   Cystic Fibrosis, Familial Mediterranean Fever 138 139",2002

Furthermore, single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPâs) induced alterations of motif scores of the serine/arginine rich  (SR) proteins SF2/ASF, SRp40, SRp55, and SC35 were analyzed  using score matrices. CF causing mutations were found in 4/14 ACP  patients (29%; 6.5 times the expected frequency, p < 0.05) and in 5/ 13 ICP patients (39%; 8.7 times the expected frequency, p < 0.05). 2  (14%) ACP and 4 (31%) ICP patients were compound heterozygous.  The frequency of SNPâs was increased in patients with ACP and ICP.  The SNP nt2694T/G in exon 14a reduces a SRp40 score motif and  generates a new SRp55 high score motif.

Amyloidosis causing renal failure is the most severe complication  of the disease which primarily affects populations of Mediterranean  extraction. In 1997, a gene for FMF ( MEFV ) was identified. The MEFV gene  product (pyrin/marenostrin) consists of 781 amino acids encoded  by 10 exons. The specific protein function remains unknown but the  expression in polynuclear leukocytes suggests an essential role in  inflammation processes. Several FMF studies helped to identify MEFV mutation hot spots.  Based on these data, a stepwise procedure was applied for FMF  routine diagnostics. Stage 1 consisted in sequencing of exon 10  where most MEFV  mutations are found. Stage 2 meant was analysis  of exons 2, 3 and 5, the location of several additional FMF associated  mutations. In Stage 3 the remaining exons were sequenced. Our diagnostic strategy applied to 94 cases resulted in the  identification of one MEFV  mutation in at least 50 cases.

Blepharophimosis Is The Most Constant Clinical  Feature In 14qter Microdeletion Syndrome,P0319.,"Rittinger1, G. Kronberger1, C. Fauth2","1Landeskliniken Salzburg, Salzburg, Austria, 2Institut fÃ¼r  Humangenetik, TU Muenchen, Muenchen, Germany","Mental retardation is a distressing disorder affecting approximately  3% of the population. Among these, cytogenetic anomalies explain  about 30% of patients with more severe mental retardation. Using  conventional methods, detection of subtle structural aberrations is  clearly limited to 6 10Mb. According to Flint et al.(Nat Genet,1995)  a substantial percentage of mental retardation is caused by  subtelomeric abnormalities. A couple of methods is now available  to establish diagnosis of submicoscopic deletions or more complex  rearrangements. We observed a young lady in which the dysmorphic  phenotype in spite of a normal karyotype remained highly suggestive  for a chromosomal aberration: the most impressive feature was  the orbital region with blepharophimosis, epicanthal folds, puffy  eyelids, a long shaped face with a pointed chin and small ears. The  hands were small with tapering fingers, body length was at the 90th  percentile range, no microcephaly was observed. Hypertrichosis  was seen only in the first few years. Mental disability was in the mild  range, with surprisingly good speech development. Finally, diagnosis  was done at the age of 12 years using a commercial multitelomere  FISH kit (Cytocell). It revealed a subtelomeric de novo deletion on  chromosome 14q. This result in the patient and the normal parental  karyotype were confirmed by a new strategy recently described by  Fauth et al. (Hum Genet,2001). Considering the results of other  groups we suggest blepharophimosis to be the most constant and  impressive clinical feature of this rare condition and we recommend  therefore to rule out 14qter deletion in all patients with equivocal  blepharophimosis syndromes.",2002

We have previously shown by means of high resolution FISH  that a number of the loci flanking the NF1 gene are duplicated, in line  with the previous identification of NF1 REPs by other groups. We  here report on a direct tandem duplication of the NF1 gene identifi ed  in 17q11.2 by means of high resolution FISH. FISH on stretched  chromosomes using locus specific probes revealed the duplication  of most NF1 gene from the promoter to 3âUTR, but with at least the  lack of exon 22. Fiber FISH using PACs/BACs specific for the NF1  gene, including the 5âUTR and 3âUTR and flanking regions, visualized  the direct tandem duplication of NF1 and showed the similar, but not  identical genomic organization of the duplicon copies. A duplicated  NF1 gene was also found at orthologous chromosomes loci in  chimpanzee and gorilla, suggesting that the duplication occurred  before the divergence of great apes. We hypothesize that the NF1  intrachromosomal duplication may contribute to the high whole  gene mutation rate by gene conversion, an unlikely mechanism in  the case of NF1 pseudogenes containing only limited portions of  the NF1 gene. The functional activity of the NF1 copy remains to  be investigated. Detection of the NF1 duplicon by high resolution  FISH may pave the way to filling up the gaps in the human genomic  sequence of the pericentromeric 17q11.2 region.",2002

Clinical findings at the age of four months included severe postnatal  growth retardation, microcephaly, dysmorphic facies (hypertelorism, iris coloboma, cleft palate, micrognathia), heart defect , right renal  agenesis and functional neurological abnormalities . Chromosomal analysis by G banding at 450   550 bands resolution  indicated a normal 46,XX karyotype.

The phenotype of such a âgeneral ring  syndromeâ consists of growth failure without malformations, few or no  minor anomalies, mild moderate mental retardation. We studied the mitotic behavior of various size ring chromosomes in  non mosaic karyotypes   to examine the supposition that the size of ring influences on it  stability and   to evaluate the correlation between ring size and instability of  somatic cells. Cytogenetic analysis showed dicentric rings of twice the size, smaller  rings, three  and tetracentric rings, double size and single size rings  simultaneously, two single size rings, poliploid (three , tetra  and  pentaploid) metaphases, metaphases with 45 chromosomes without  ring and other abnormalities. Mitotic instability of ring chromosomes  in vitro as well as the lability of rings in vivo may lead to high cellular  death rate and interfere with normal development.

Recently, we demonstrated that human satellite DNA  based artificial chromosomes (hSATACs) could be generated via  amplification dependent de novo chromosome formation induced  by integration of exogenous DNA sequences into the centromeric/ rDNA regions of human acrocentric chromosomes. Human SATACs  have been successfully constructed in different cell types from  exogenous DNA, and âneutralâ endogenous sequences of the short  arm of chromosome #15. These artificially generated accessory  chromosomes carry predictable DNA sequences and they contain  defined genetic information. We suggested that hSATACs composed  of rDNA and non coding satellite DNA sequences that lack  transcription units for undesired and unknown genes can be regarded  as genetically âneutralâ and hence are prototypes of safe or low risk  artificial chromosome vectors. Here, we report the existence and characterization of a natural  equivalent to human satellite DNA based artificial chromosomes. This  small stable accessory chromosome derived from the centromeric/ short arm region of human chr #15 is carried by healthy members  of a family, and remained apparently unchanged at least in three  generations.

Diamantopoulou, E. Meidanis; Sismanoglio General Hospital, Marousi, Greece. Double minute chromosomes (dms) are extensively associated  with cancer cells. There are few reports of their presence in the  peripheral cells of normal individuals. We report the existence of a  dm chromosome in the peripheral blood lymphocytes of a 31 years  old young lady, without any type of malignancy or any history of prior  exposure to mutagenic agents. The patient had a leukopenia due to  an anemia of vitamin B12 deficiency. The bone marrow aspiration and  tephrine biopsy was not diagnostic for an MDS (FAB classification).  She is followed cytogenetically for a period of five years. Peripheral  blood samples were cultured accordingly to standard techniques.  Chromosome preparations were stained with GTG banding  technique. The karyotype was 47,XX (dm included in 50 analyzed  metaphases). The dm was studied in detail with FISH. We used a  specific for 8q24 region (LSI VYSIS), that contains c myc oncogene,  a specific for MLL gene at 11q23 (LSI VYSIS), and a centromeric  for chromosome 8 (cep8 VYSIS). The visible dm was a centromere  of chromosome 8 in 100% of the metaphase spreads and in 500  counted interphase nuclei as well. To the best of our knowledge this  is the first case in which on a dm c myc oncogene or MLLgene is not  amplified and it contains centromerâs 8 amplicons. We believe that:  (1) the patient has an unusual type of MDS, (2) the amplified genes  on that extra centromere of chromosome 8 propably give a favorable  advantage to her mild and stable clinical course.",2002
A solution for bloody amnios ?,P0334.,"Blake , P.

Such small SMCs often are uneasy  to characterize in standard cytogenetic or molecular cytogenetic  approaches. Recently, we developed a probe set, using all  human centromeric probes labeled in different colors, allowing the  simultaneous characterization and identification of all chromosomes by their centromeric region (Nietzel et al., 2001, Hum Genet, 108,  199 204). The technique, called cenM FISH has been extended by  the introduction of an additional probe specific for the short arm of all  human acrocentric chromosomes called midi54 (described in Mrasek  et al., 2001, Cytogenet Cell Genet, 93, 242 248). This acro/cenM  FISH probe set revealed in the present case, that the both SMC were  identical derivatives of chromosomes 15 with two specific signals  for the centromere 15 specific and the midi54 probe. Additional  FISH experiments using the high resolution multicolor banding  (MCB) technique and probes specific for the Prader Willi/Angelman  syndrome region (SNRPN and D15S10), respectively, characterized  the derivative chromosomes as dicentric iso chromosomes  i(15)(pterâq13::q13âpter).

Nonetheless, there is still a chromosomal region which is not well  investigated with the presently available probe sets: the pericentric  region. This region is of special interest when small supernumerary  marker chromosomes (sSMC) shall be characterized. Neither  whole nor partial chromosome painting (wcp and pcp) probes are  informative if centromere near euchromatic material is present on  a sSMC. This question can be answered best when hybridizing  centromere near probes like BACs. At present we are working on  24 probe sets, each for one human chromosome, which consists of  a centromere specific satellite probe, one centromere near BAC in  q and p (excluding the acrocentric chromosomes) and arm specific  pcp probes. These probes are used after characterizing the sSMC  by cenM FISH (Nietzel etal., 2001, HumGenet, 108, 199 204).  Up to now two cases with cat eye syndrome (CES) chromosomes  [inv dup(22)(q11.2)] and three sSMC derived from #2, #16 and  #22, respectively, have been characterized by centromere near  BAC probes. As expected, centromere near euchromatic material  was present in the CES chromosomes. For the derivative #2 q  arm specific centromere near material could be detected, while  the derivatives #16 and #22 consisted only of centromere and  heterochromatin. Additionally, a clinical case with a normal karyotype  apart from the very small pericentric inversion could be detected  using the chromosome 2 specific peri centromere probe set.

An inverted duplication of the q14 26.2 region was assessed. The  deletion of q26.3 was also demonstrated. The resulting karyotype  was: 46, XX, inv dup del(15)(pterâq26.2::q26.2âq14). The parentsâ  karyotypes were normal. The phenotypic alterations of the proband  are only in part superimposable to those described in the literature for  analogous cases.

Chromosomal  aberrations involving the human chromosome 15 (most often the q1 1  13 region) have been frequently reported in the literature. It has been  suggested that duplicons with opposite orientation may predispose to  inverted duplications and that distal deletion and a single copy region  between the duplicated regions are then present. We are currently  investigating the hypothesis that the rearrangement described here  might be related to the recently discovered duplicons in the 15q26  region.",2002

However, in samples with a high level of mosaicism, a significantly  increased asynchronous replication was detected in the 46,XX  cells. Conclusion: An altered temporal replication control in Turner  syndrome may suggest an epigenetic mechanism involved in this  condition affecting the aneuploid and euploid cells.",2002

They are detected  with a frequency of 1:1,660 1:1,040 at amniocentesis, 1:5,555 in  liveborn individuals and 1:330 in mentally retarded patients. MCs  are classified as de novo or familial, satellited or non satellited and  mosaic or non mosaic. In some families, MCs are transmitted through  several generations, apparently with no associated abnormalities,  whereas other MCs carriers may present serious clinical symptoms,  such as mental retardation, dysmorphic features and malformations. Several syndromes associated with MCs are known. Mosaic i(12p)  causes the Pallister Killian syndrome; an inv dup(22) is found in the  âcat eye syndromeâ and an i(18p) syndrome has also been described.

Several  tumours (e.g. esophagus, colon, lung) were characterized to be  preceeded by chronic inflammation. In an effort to evaluate if there was a relationship between  chronic inflammation and tumour development we determined  tumour indicating parameters like polyploidization, centrosome  hyperamplification, multipolar mitoses and the state of p53 during  inflammation in humans and mice. In inflammatory tissue of human and rodent wounds we detected  an increased tetra  and polyploidization rate, accompanied by  centrosome hyperamplification in human wounds. Tetraploid  cells seem to be advantageous during times of unfavourable  circumstances, as they are during inflammation. Their number  decreased at the end of the healing process during scar formation,  coordinated by an intact p53. In inflammatory tissue of the bronchus, we also detected tetra  and  aneuploid cells as well as centrosome hyperamplification, both  increasing with the grade of inflammation. Since tetraploidy is  defined as an intermediate during tumourigenesis, a decrease of this  population, which we could see after transient inflammation in the  human wound, is necessary to prevent a malignant development.  However chronic inflammation, as in the bronchus, promotes  aneuploidization and malignancy because the unfavourable  conditions are persistent and expose the cells to prolonged stress. We could also show, that an enhanced number of centrosomes plays  a critical role during the process of segregating the chromosomes  into normal euploid (diploid) cells as well as into aneuploid ones.",2002

Skin abnormalities are rarely reported. There are no cases of psoriasis vulgaris in patients with the 18p  syndrome.  Psoriasis vulgaris is a chronic inflammatory skin disease that affects  about 3% of the caucasian population. The psoriasis susceptibility  loci have been suggested within many chromosomes (1p, 1q, 2p,  6p, 17q etc.). We describe the first case of psoriasis vulgaris in a  male with 18p  syndrome. Examination at the age 27 years showed  psoriatic red scaly patches on the skin of his head and forearms.  He was moderately mentally retarded and had dysmorphic features:  short stature, downslanted palpebral fissures, exophthalmus,  prognathism, kyphosis, brachydactyly, micropenis etc. Cytogenetic  analyses using GTG banding revealed partial deletion 18p in all  cells studied. FISH showing two fluorescent signals with WCP18  DNA probe and one signal with 18p subtelomeric DNA probe on  metaphases confirmed the finding. Karyotype is 46,XY,del(18)(: p11.23 qter). As psoriasis vulgaris has not been previously described  in patients with 18p  syndrome, one might argue that they have not  reached an age to be able to determine whether they are affected  with psoriasis or not. Follow up examination of these patients will  be necessary. The coexistence of psoriasis vulgaris and 18p  in  our patient is possibly an association, but it might also be a causal  connection and may be helpful in the localization of an additional  susceptibility locus for psoriasis in the region of 18p.",2002

Chromosomal analysis of both parents showed normal karyotypes.  Even a minor 14q duplication of one parent was excluded by FISH.  There is no published case of proximal duplication 14q with exactly  the same breakpoints. Thus, it is conceivable that not all clinical  features of our patient are concordant to other patients with proximal  duplication 14q.

Furthermore, a  detailed characterization of the genome of these rare events remains  an arduous task. The aims of our study include the development of  new molecular cytogenetic methods for a detailed characterization of  disseminated cells and their application on bone marrow of patients  with urologic tumors, such as renal cell carcinomas and bladder  cancer. Our molecular cytogenetic strategy employs in a first step an  enrichment of disseminated cytokeratin positive cells using  established protocols (e.g. magnetic beads). In a second step,  disseminated cells are analyzed either by multicolor interphase  FISH and/or by single cell CGH. Multicolor interphase FISH is done  by using simultaneously at least seven different DNA probes, each  labeled in a different color.

HYPOTHESIS: The case presented here suggests the existence  of a genetic base not only for the cleft palate feature but for the  nonsyndromic PRS located on 2q32. The absence of other phenotipic  manifestations rather ssuggests the idea that in this family there is  not a microdeletion but a breakage point in the possible âcandidate  geneâ.",2002

Micro FISH showed that  the minute marker contained the centromere of chromosome 8.  Chromosome analysis in a 26 year old female showed an extra  marker chromosome in 50% of her lymphocytes. She was referred  because of mental retardation, dysmorphism and obesity. The marker  chromosome contained chromosome region 14q10â14q12. The  third patient was referred for chromosome analysis at the age of 10  years because of growth retardation. She appeared to be carrier of 2  different marker chromosomes.

Because the patient had an excellent treatment outcome  and rapidly achieved hematological remission we supposed  that this constitutional translocation might not be involved in ET   pathogenesis, but rather in the reproduction. This is the reason  why we extended the cytogenetic investigations in the patientâs  offspring: her 52 year old only daughter and two grandchildren (a boy  aged 22 and a girl aged 18). All of them are phenotipically normal  including hematological values. Using peripheral blood samples  for chromosomne slides and GTG banding followed by FISH with  telomere probes and whole chromosome painting ( Appligene  Oncor CP5406G, CP5410R and Cytocell, PCM 356) we identified  the same translocation t(3;5)(q26;q21)in proband, her daughter  and granddaughter, but not in the male offspring. The maternal  inheritance of such a large translocation in three generations without  striking reproductive failures is unexpected taking into account the  involvement of chromosomal rearrangements in meiotic segregation  of unbalanced gametes. In order to have a better and precise characterization of the breakpoints, extensive studies are needed.  Molecular description of genomic region flanking the 3q and 5q  breakpoints will help us to understand the relationship between this  structural rearrangement and probandâs hematologic disorder (ET),  if any.

Using of dual color in situ hybridization for  detection of numerical abnormalities in uncultured and  cultured leucocytes of radiochemical industrial workers,P0389.,"A. Timoshevsky , S. A.

We used dual color  FISH for detection of aneuploidy in peripheral blood leucocytes of  15 men â radiochemical industrial workers, contacted with complex  of radioactive and chemical substances. Analysis of hypo  and  hyperploidy was carried out for three chromosomal pairs: 7/12,  11/16 and X/Y using digoxigenin/biotin labeled probes. We found Posters   Cytogenetics156 157 significantly increased frequencies of numerical chromosome  abnormalities in uncultured leucocytes of the exposed workers  compared to the unexposed controls (10 individuals) for nullisomy  Y chromosomes only. However significant differences were found in  cultured lymphocytes for hypodiploidy of chromosomes 11, 12 and  hyperdiploidy of chromosomes X and 12. Moreover, a tendency to  higher values was observed for hypodiploidy 16 and total frequency  of numerical abnormalities in cultured lymphocytes. We conclude  that agents of the radiochemical industry can induce aneuploidy in  leucocytes and cause the premutagenic lesions, which are expressed  during the cultivation of lymphocytes in vitro. It is possible, that some  chromosomes have larger liability to nondisjunction and loss. Our  data suggest that analysis of numerical aberrations must be carried  out in addition to standard cytogenetics tests.",2002

","Mosaic trisomy 7 has been found in a variety of tumors, non  tumorous lesions, and even apparently normal tissues. Although  characteristic in some condition, the meaning and pathological  relevance of trisomy 7 is still unclear. Recent investigation has given  rise to the question, whether somatic gain of chromosome 7 is rather  related to age than to a specific disease. By FISH we analyzed the chromosome 7 copy number in blood  lymphocytes of 30 healthy individuals with normal conventional  karyotype selected for three different age groups.

Evidence for nonhomologous meiotic co  orientation (NMC) in man,P0399.,V. Kovaleva,"Institute of Obstetrics and Gynaecology RAMS, St.Petersburg,  Russian Federation. ","Homologous Robertsonian translocations/isochromosomes  represent unique model for studying chromosome behavior in the  absence of homologous pairing and recombination. Though the  number of published cases is small, and the only data available is  the sex of the offspring of the dup(21q) carriers, some conclusions  on the segregation pattern of both rearranged chromosomes and  gonosomes can be made. It was found that 7 male carriers of  dup(21q) fathered 13 children with Down syndrome of known sex. 12  of them were males, differing from 1:1 ratio (p=0.0017, binomial test).  There was no significant male predominance in cases of maternal  transmission (23 males, 16 females). This finding is considered as  a direct evidence for NMC of the dup(21q) and X chromosome.  NMC, proven for Drosophila [Grell, 1971], was proposed to explain  male excess in Down syndrome (DS) with paternally derived trisomy  [Kovaleva NV.Genetika(Russ)1992,28:5 15]. NCM of chromosomes  21 and X would result in production of different gametes: 23,X, 23,Y,  23(+21, Y), 22,XY( 21), 22,0( Y), 22,X( 21), 24,Y(+21), 24,XY, also  explaining the occurrence of gonosome aneuploidy and double  aneuploidy of paternal origin. Further data supporting the NMC  hypothesis come from studies on sperm in healthy and infertile men  [Griffin et al,1996; Baumgartner et al,1999], in fathers of patients with  aneuploidy [Blanco et al,1998; Soares et al,2001] and in carriers of  balanced translocations (âinterchromosomal effectâ) [Morel et al,2001;  Pellestor et al, 2001], together with data on elevated risk of progeny  with autosomal trisomies in carriers of sex chromosome anomalies  (Nivelon Chevallier et al, 1988; Tarani et al, 1998; Hennebicq et al,  2001).",2002

","Mosaicism is caused by postzygotic aberrant mitoses and leads to  numerical or structural aberrations or a combination of both. The  karyotype of the zygote can be normal or abnormal. Our investigation group comprises 25 cases of gonosomal mosaicism  with a Y chromosome analysed in at least one cell system: 45,X/ 46,XY (n=8), 45,X/46,X,idic(Y) mosaicism (n=7), 45,X/47,XYY  mosaicisms (n=5), 45,X/46,X,del(Y) (n=4) and 45,X/46,X,r(Y) (n=1). 13 patients were phenotypically male, 7 were female and 5 showed  intersexual external genitalia. The patients age at the time of chromosome investigation ranged  from the prenatal period up to the age of 36 years. The most frequent clinical findings were: growth retardation,  abnormalities of the external genitalia, kidney malformations and  different types of heart defect. Cytogenetic investigations combined metaphase and interphase  analyses with FISH (DNA probes: wcp X and Y; CEP X and Y; Yph  3.4). Between 2 and 5 cell systems per patient were analysed with  regard to their origin from different blastodermic layers. An unequal distribution of the mosaic could be demonstrated in the  different cell systems, with no preferential combination. Patients with dicentric Y chromosome revealed the highest instability  of karyotype. There was no age dependent karyotype changes in our  investigation group.

A novel BAC probe set for the analysis of  hematological malignancies,P0405.,"Lee1, D. Lie1, S. Tien2, C. Rudduck Sivaswaren2","1Division of Medical Sciences, National Cancer Centre, Singapore,  Singapore, 2Department of Pathology, Cytogenetics, Singapore  General Hospital, Singapore, Singapore","Background: Translocations and deletions in the chromosome  11q23 region are frequent in hematologic neoplasms such as  acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL), acute myelogenous leukemia  (AML), myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) and chronic lymphocytic  leukemia (CLL). We describe here the use of a bacterial artificial  chromosome (BAC) probe set from the 11q23 region, applied to these  malignancies. Methods: Four BAC probes from one contig, and two BAC probes  from another contig on 11q23 spanning the MLL region were  labeled with either biotin or DIG for dual color fluorescence in situ  hybridization (FISH) analysis. These probes were applied to cases  with hematologic malignancies with known structural abnormalities  involving 11q23. Results: A split signal was detected in one ALL case with  t(4;11)(q21;q23), one AML case with t(9;11)(p22;q23) and another  AML case with t(11;19)(q23;p13), demonstrating that the probes span  the MLL region known to be involved in these translocations. The probes were further tested on one case of AML with  add(11)(q23) and two cases of MDS and two cases of CLL, all  with del(11)(q13q23). The additional material on 11q23 and marker  chromosomes were found to be amplification of the regions detected  by the probe set. Although the MDS and CLL cases cytogenetically  appeared to have the same abnormality, the MDS cases had deletion  of both contigs, while the CLL cases only had deletion of one contig. Conclusions: At a molecular level, deletions in our CLL and MDS  cases appeared different. This study demonstrates the importance  of combining molecular and cytogenetic techniques to further defi ne  chromosome abnormalities.",2002

We  report on chromosomal findings in a boy with axial hypotonia and  dysmorphy. He was born after a full term uneventful pregnancy. He  was the third child of healthy unrelated parents. The mother has had  nine miscarriages. The child was first admitted at the age of 8 months  for gastro enteritis which was rapidly cured. Physical examination  showed moderate axial hypotonia, hypertelorism and bilateral  epicanthus, high arched palate, macroglossia, and antimongoloid  palpebral fissures. There was no evidence for visceral malformation.  By conventional cytogenetic analysis a reciprocal balanced  translocation between chromosomes 3 and 22 was diagnosed. In  order to define clearly the breakpoints on the two chromosomes,  chromosome painting was used and revealed a complex, apparently  balanced translocation t(3;22;9). This translocation was inherited from  the mother. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with different locus  probes near breakpoints showed a deletion of abl gene located at  9q34.1 in the patient. This deletion was not found in the mother and  in the sister carrying the translocation. Deletion of abl gene has been  described once in a newborn with a complex cardiac anomaly and  carrying a paracentric inversion of the long arm of chromosome 9  (Kleyman et al., Am J Med Genet, 1997).

"A comparative analysis of G banding, FISH and  RT PCR for the diagnosis of bcr abl positive CML",P0410.,"Brill Zamir , I. Laevski, D. Sahar, R. Gershoni Baruch","Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel","Phildelphia (Ph) chromosome positive CML, with the bcr abl gene  translocation, has a dismal prognosis. The identification of Ph positive  patients is vitally important because only aggressive therapeutic  approaches, such as interferon alpha (IFN alpha) treatment and  allogeneic bone marrow transplantation, may result in long term  disease free survival. Routine diagnostic methods for detection of the  bcr abl translocation include conventional cytogenetics(G banding),  reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR), and  more recently, fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis.  Routine cytogenetics . sensitive at the initial diagnosis is unreliable  during treatment. RT PCR analysis is considered the most sensitive  tool for the detection of the bcr abl translocation, and is widely used  alone, or in combination with the other methods. FISH analysis is  simple, extremely reliable and sensitive. This study compares the  efficiency of the three methods for the initial diagnosis of Ph positive  CML, and for detection of minimal residual disease during treatment.  Conventional G banding cytogenetics, FISH with BCR and ABL  double color probes and RT PCR for detecting Ph positive CML were  undertaken in 22 CML patients undergoing either IFN alpha treatment  or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation (allo BMT). The results  obtained using the three methodological approaches were 100%  correlated at diagnosis. Following treatment the cytogenetic analysis  becomes technically less feasible and the results less reliable.  Whereas, RT PCR and FISH analysis remain equally and mutually  contributive. We thus conclude that the concomitant use of FISH and  RT PCR remain the optimal diagnostic combination for the detection  of the bcr abl translocation.",2002

The Mendelian Cytogenetics Network database  (http://mcndb.imbg.ku.dk) contains information on 75 breakpoints in  25 individuals with oral clefting. Ordered YAC/BAC clones were used  to map the breakpoints associated with two of these rearrangements:  One involved a 46,XY,ins(9;5)(p22.2;q23.3q33.3) karyotype; the  5q33.3 breakpoint has been narrowed to a 250 kb region. Two  overlapping BACs at the 9p22 breakpoint contain a hypothetical  unknown gene, and the 5q23.3 breakpoint has been narrowed  to a 150 kb region containing three candidate genes, including a  putative zinc finger gene. None of these three breakpoints affects  chromosomal regions previously known to harbor loci associated  with orofacial clefts. The second case displayed an aberrant banding  pattern on 7q36, a region previously implicated in congenital  malformations affecting midline structures and a region included  among those associated with orofacial clefts in more than one  case in MCNdb (1p31, 4q21, 6p24, 7q36, 9p13, 16q24, 17q23 and  17p25). Chromosome 7 paint did not suggest the involvement of  other chromosomes, the 7q subtelomeric signals were normal, and  high resolution CGH was normal, excluding deletions/duplications  larger than ~3 Mb.

Few cases of this fetal  syndrome have been published. The pregnancy was uneventful, until prenatal sonographic  examination at 20 weeks of gestation showed intra uterine growth  retardation (IUGR) and an encephalocele. The parents were non  consanguineous, and had no relevant history of genetic diseases.  Chromosomal examination of amniotic fluid cells showed an  isochromosome 18q in all examined cells (46,XX,i(18q)). The fetus  thus had trisomy 18q associated with monosomy 18p. The parents  elected termination of pregnancy. Fetopathologic examination revealed features of monosomy  18p (holoprosencephaly and facial malformations, occipital  meningocele, heart and skeletal malformations), and trisomy 18q  (microcephaly, short neck with pterygium colli, club feet, ovarian  epithelial hypoplasia). In this case, the severity of the phenotype  resulted in prenatal recognition of the chromosomal abnormality.  Holoprosencephaly is not a common feature in post natal monosomy  18p (16% of all cases). It is thought to result from the deletion of  HPE4, a gene encoding TGIF and located at 18q11.3. Isochromosome 18q is thought to result from centromere fission  (monocentric chromosome), or from chromatid exchange (dicentric  chromosomes). Isochromosome (18q) is seen as a derivative  chromosome; to our knowledge, no cases of supernumerary i(18q)  have been reported, probably because tetrasomy 18q is not viable.  The fetal features of isochromosome (18q) closely resembles the  post natal phenotype, although the fetal syndrome may be more  severe.",2002

To assess the importance of these chromosomal  anomalies during the gametogenesis, we have explored three  infertile phenotypically normal men with reciprocal translocations.  We performed meiotic segregation analysis of their sperm using  FISH and PRINS methods. For patients 1 and 2, respectively  with reciprocal translocations t(1;4)(q12;q28) and t(4;5)(q35;q34),  more than 10000 spermatozoa were screened. In both cases,  alternate segregation (giving phenotypically normal offspring) is  the most frequent mode of segregation (68 and 70%) and the most  frequent type of imbalance is adjacent 1 segregation (24 and 28%),  corresponding to the most expected imbalance at birth. For patient  3 with reciprocal translocation t(1;21)(q11;q21) and with severe  oligozoospermia, only 981 spermatozoa (from two ejaculates) could  be screened. Alternate segregation is also the most frequent type of  segregation (80%) and the two most frequent types of imbalance are  adjacent 1 (10%) and 3:1 exchange (7,5%), this latter is responsible  for the most expected imbalance at birth. Although alternate  segregation is the major type of segregation, these three men have  infertility.

The gene encoding  apolipoprotein E ( APOE ) has been proposed as a candidate gene  for vascular complication in type 1 diabetes. Apolipoprotein E was  discovered as a plasma protein involved in the metabolism of  lipoproteins. There are three common alleles, E2, E3, and E4, which  code for three major isoforms, resulting in six common genotypes.

Nevertheless, IDDM in APS1 patients  strongly resembles HLA associated IDDM with high titers of GAD65  autoantibodies and specific lymphocytic destruction of pancreatic  Ã cells. The gene responsible for APS1   AIRE (autoimmune  regulator)   has been mapped to chromosome 21q22.3 and  characterised as a transcriptional activator.

Haplotype 2 1 3 was reported to be significantly enriched among  high end normal alleles. In our study we also revealed a number  of closely allied haplotypes (1 1 3, 2 1 2, 3 1 3) which are almost  exclusively linked with âgray zoneâ CGG repeats. We suggest that this  group could arise from the founder chromosome with haplotype 2 1 3  and intermediate size FRAXA allele, by the series of single mutational  events, by mechanism similar to replication slippage. It means that  such chromosome must have a higher rate of replication mistakes in  this region or inability of repair system to correct changes naturally  occurring in repetitive sequences. Remarkably, that the same  mechanism was proposed for gradual progression of intermediate  alleles towards instability threshold. Instability in both FMR 1 and  the flanking markers in Xq27 can be influenced by a common trans  acting factor promoting general instability in microsatellite sequences.

Yuan  Shan Research Institute, I Lan, Taiwan Republic of China. ","Congenital adrenal hyperplasia (CAH) is a common autosomal  recessive disorder mainly caused by defects in the steroid 21  hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. More than 90% of CAH cases are  caused by mutations of the CYP21 gene. Approximately 75%  of the defective CYP21 genes are generated through intergenic  recombination termed âapparent gene conversionâ from the  neighboring CYP21P pseudogene. A chimeric CYP21P/CYP21 gene  with its 5â end corresponding to CYP21P and 3â end corresponding  to CYP21 has been identified. This kind of gene is nonfunctional  because it produces a truncated protein. We have found that  there are two distinct chimeric genes in CAH patients. Both had a  sequence with  300 nucleotides of the 5â head as the CYP21P gene.  Otherwise, the coding region consisted of a fusion molecule with  the CYP21P gene in two different regions. One of the junctions was  located in chi like sequence of GCTGGGC in the third intron and  the other was in the minisatillite consensus TGGCAGGAGG of the  exon 5 of the CYP21P gene. In addition, the analysis of restriction  fragments length polymorphism for these two 3.3 kb chimeric  molecules showed these sequences arose as a consequence of  unequal crossover between the CYP21P and CYP21 genes.

Engel","Institute of Human Genetics, GÃ¶ttingen, Germany","In the present study we undertook functional analysis of a  differentially regulated gene, named calgizzarin, which shows a  decreased expression in murine Sertoli cell germ cell cocultures  compared to cultured Sertoli cells alone. Calgizzarin is expressed in  low level in all adult tissues examined; however, a high mRNA level  for calgizzarin in mouse testis is maintained until stage P15 and  then declines dramatically, whereas the expression pattern in the  ovary remains constantly high throughout development. Therefore  its expression in Sertoli cells might be repressed by some unknown factor/s originated from spermatocytes/spermatids. The gene is  approximately 6 kb pairs in size and contains three exons. The ORF  encodes for a 98 amino acid polypeptide containing two putative  EF hand calcium binding domains. To elucidate the potential role of  calgizzarin gene, we decided to delete the gene in mouse by targeted  disruption (knock out). A replacement targeting vector was designed  to delete the two exons encoding calgizzarin protein and replaced  them with the neomycin phosphotransferase gene. The ES cell were  transfected with the targeting vector and selected for homologous  recombination event. Five recombinant clones were identified by  genomic Southern. Two clones produced germ line transmitting  chimeras after injecting them into blastocyst derived from C57B/J6  female. These chimeras were bred with C57B/J6 female to generate  F1 animals, which were heterozygous for calgizzarin deleted allele.  Generation of homozygous animal is awaited. The phenotypic and  molecular analysis of these mice might give us insights, about the  potential role of calgizzarin in spermatogenesis.",2002

RFXANK encodes a subunit of the  tripartide RFX transcription complex that functions in the assembly of  multiple transcription factors on MHC II promoters.

Functional and genomic analysis of the SIX gene  family,P0436.,"M. Hanson , A. G. Brown","University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom","Members of the SIX gene family are involved in a variety of  developmental processes in vertebrates and invertebrates. All SIX  genes encode two highly conserved motifs, a homeodomain that  mediates DNA binding, and a SIX domain that mediates protein  protein interactions. It is now clear that Drosophila has three SIX  genes (sine oculis, Optix and D Six4) while humans have six (SIX1  6). Phylogenetic analysis of Drosophila and mammalian amino acid  sequences shows that the proteins fall into three clear subgroups,  suggesting that a common ancestral organism possessed three SIX  genes. An intriguing feature of the human SIX genes is their genomic  organisation, as revealed by the Human Genome Sequencing  Project; five of the six genes are clustered. We have shown that the  mouse SIX genes appear to have a similar genomic arrangement.  Despite extensive amino acid homology within the SIX domain, SIX  proteins differ dramatically in their interactions with transcriptional co  factors encoded by the EYA gene family. We report work in progress  which shows that while SIX1 interacts strongly with EYA2 and EYA4  in a yeast two hybrid assay, SIX3 interacts with neither. This implies  that there are clear functional differences between the subgroups of  SIX proteins.Posters   Gene Structure and Function166 167",2002

Within these data exists a large redundancy. We take advantage of  this redundancy by analysing the differences of sequences belonging  to the same gene. The EST sequences are clustered and assembled to a consensus sequence. However, many clusters cannot be  assembled into a single consensus sequence. The sequences then  fall into multiple consensus sequences (contigs) within one clusters.  The differences might be due to imperfect sequence data (e.g.  partially unspliced sequence templates) or due to alternative splicing.  Instead of one gene coding for one mRNA leading to one protein,  alternative splicing of transcripts may lead to potentially different  proteins. Splice variants are often due to alternative exon usage, which we  verify by RT PCR. We have set up a medium throughput strategy that does allow us  to screen expression of genes in 31 different human tissues. We  initiated this project by analysing genes on Chromosome 21 and 22.

","Disregulation of the RET proto oncogene transcription may play a  role in both inherited cancer syndromes and Hirschsprung disease.  Understanding the gene regulation might provide new clues to  clarify pathogenesis. Recently, we reported that RET transcription is  highly cell line specific, while the promoter region is equally active in  different cell lines. Here we show that RET upstream sequences can modulate  gene expression via cell line specific chromatin acetylation level  contributing to promoter function. Acetylation and deacetylation  activities, working on specific lysines of histonic tails, alter the  accessibility of transcription factors to DNA thus modulating gene  expression. Histone deacetylase inhibitors, such as sodium butyrate,  up regulate both RET mRNA levels and transcription rate in a RET  expressing cell line. The same treatment allows transcript detection  in RET negative cell lines (lymphoblasts), while no enhancement  is seen in cells expressing RET already at high level. Sensitivity  to sodium butyrate appears to be sequence specific in transient  transfection assays. Chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments,  using antibody against H4 tetra acetylated hystones, confirm the  direct role of histone acetylation level within RET upstream region, in  regulating gene expression. Sodium butyrate derepressive effect allowed us to overcome the lack  of this gene expression in the majority of adult cells and analyse RET   mRNA from Hirschsprung patients, by treating lymphoblastoid cell  lines.

The comparison of substrate recognizing regions  of Cytochrome P450 2C subfamily enzymes suggests the  diversity enhancing evolution of these regions during the  evolution.,P0442.,Kuno,"Tokyo Womenâs Medical University, Tokyo, Japan","The enzymes belonging to cytochrome P450 2C subfamily  metabolize numerous drugs in liver. Four enzymes (2C8, 2C9,  2C18 and 2C19) members of this subfamily have been identified  in humans. These enzymes play roles in metabolizing various  toxic compounds. Considering the diverse nature of the chemical  structure of these compounds, it is reasonable to assume that  the substrate recognizing regions of these enzymes undergo  diversity enhancing evolution just as the antigen binding regions  of major histocompatibility complex. The test for the diversity  enhancing evolution is performed by the comparison of synonymous  (silent) nucleotide changes versus nonsynonymous (amino acid  altering) nucleotide changes during the molecular evolution. If  nonsynonymous substitution is estimated to have occurred more  frequently than synonymous substitution, then we suspect that  diversity enhancing evolution might have occurred. Cytochrome P450  2C subfamily has 6 substrate recognizing regions. By the analysis  using a window with 30 codons, nonsynonymous substitutions were  found to augment near the substrate recognizing regions. When the  comparison was made between synonymous and nonsynonymous  changes in cytochrome P450 2C subfamily enzymes, the diversity  enhancing substitutions were observed in different substrate  recognizing regions. The hypothesis of diversity enhancing evolution  was tested by the simulation experiments and it was supported  in almost cases with significance. Similar results were obtained  in rabbit, rat and golden hamster. These results suggest that the  substrate recognizing regions of cytochrome P450 2C subfamily  enzymes have undergone diversity enhancing evolution due to the  selection pressure favoring the diversity adapting to the environment  in which a variety of possibly toxic compounds attack the species.",2002

Disturbing the interplay between excitation and  inhibition causes various neurological disorders. GABA and glycine  are the main inhibitory neurotransmitters of the adult central nervous  system. Synaptic inhibition by GABAA and glycine receptors, which  are ligand gated Cl  channels, depends on the intracellular chloride  concentration ([Cl ]i). High [Cl ]i can lead to excitatory GABA  responses that are deemed to be important during development.  Several potassium chloride cotransporters can lower [Cl ]i, including  the neuronal isoform KCC2, which was substantiated by antisense  experiments in vitro. Analysis of the expression pattern of KCC2  during murine embryonic and postnatal development by in situ  hybridization and Western blot analysis, shows that KCC2 parallels  neuronal differentiation and precedes the functional GABA switch.

We suggest that the tight organization of the LCAT gene  cluster has biological significance. The domain organization of this  chromosome region is currently analyzed by COMET FISH and by  the topoisomerase II mediated DNA loop excision protocol. COMET  FISH is gel electrophoresis of DNA from a single nucleus, which is  lysed on microscope slide to produce nucleoids. The nucleoids are  electrophoresed extending the loops into tails. Subsequent FISH  allows mapping of specific DNA sequences/genes from the LCAT  region relative to the DNA loops. We are also using a complementary  approach, which is based on the ability of cellular topoisomerase  II to cleave DNA in the presence of several anticancer agents. The  cleavage sites are associated with regions of DNA attachment to the  nuclear skeleton, thus indicating DNA loop anchorage sites. Analysis  of the topoisomerase II cleavage sites within the region therefore  permits mapping of the domain organization. Human cells have  been exposed to topoisomerase II inhibitor, the DNA from the cells  was cleaved with restriction enzymes, separated by pulsed field gel  electrophoresis, blotted, and hybridized with probes from our map.  This dual approach allows exploration of the topological organization  of the region of human chromosome 16q22.1 and permits correlation  of the structural architecture to the functional organization of the DNA.Posters   Gene Structure and Function170 171",2002

Matthews","University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","Background: Anecdotal evidence from genetic counsellors suggests  that some people tell their relatives genetic risk information, whilst  others do not. Similarly people tell some of their relatives, but  not others. This issue is important because individuals might be  disadvantaged emotionally, socially, financially or medically by having  this information withheld or disclosed and conflicts may arise within  families if some cannot accept a parentâs or siblingâs right to privacy. Methods: In depth interviews were undertaken with people who have  received genetic counselling for risk of Huntingtonâs disease and  hereditary breast/ovarian cancer, and their partners. The interviews  explored whether relatives had or had not been told their risk by  participants; the factors which influenced telling or not telling; who  should tell; and views of genetic counselling. Results: In total, 36 consultands and 19 partners were interviewed.  The analysis confirms clinicians observations that people tell  some relatives but not others. Data related to telling or not telling  different relatives will be presented. Respondentsâ views about  whose responsibility it is to pass on this type of information will be  particularly explored. Conclusions: The level of disclosure to relatives can at times be  limited but also depends on the psychosocial, familial and disease  context. Disclosure, moreover, should be viewed as a process of  telling as opposed to a dichotomy of âtellingâ versus ânot tellingâ.  Ultimately, we hope this study will contribute towards a wider  understanding into the dynamics within families after someone in that  family attends for genetic counselling.",2002

Evidence was provided  that type I BPES (eyelid abnormalities and female infertility) is caused  by mutations resulting in a truncated FOXL2 protein. In contrast,  extension of the FOXL2 protein is found in type II BPES, in which  fertility is generally normal. This genotype/phenotype correlation  provides challenges for genetic counselling, as molecular testing may  be predictive of female fertility. We report a 32 year old female patient with sporadic BPES and  a history of menstrual irregularities and periods of secondary  amenorrhoea. Mutation analysis revealed a protein extending  mutation (c959 960insG) in the FOXL2 gene with a modified  sequence for the last 57 amino acids, suggesting a type II BPES  despite the menstrual irregularities. The clinical presentation of our  patient and of three female patients with type II BPES described  by De Baere et al.

The theoretical and normative foundations of  genetic counselling   completing a jigsaw puzzle without  a picture.,P0472.,S. Hasan,"Centre for Medical Ethics, Oslo, Norway","The speciality of genetic counselling is paradigmatic in many aspects.  As a fairly recent member on the medical frontier its practitioners are  pioneers of an evolving ethos. Upon examination of the theoretical foundations of genetic  counselling there appears to be an absence of a formal ethical  framework. This is further highlighted by the lack of presence of a  formal implementation of the four main bioethical principles that are  commonly perceived to govern good clinical practice. The normative  foundations of genetic counselling rely heavily on the formality that  lies within the code of ethics by which a genetic counsellor practises.  There is a commendable objective for the counsellor to be adequately  trained in order to deliver the best service they can, however, it is not  sufficient to have good intentions. This paper will explore the implications and importance of having a  formal ethical framework and whether it can be universally attainable.  It will question if regulating the ethics of conduct is a sufficient activity  or whether the professionals (genetic counsellors and geneticists)  have a parallel duty to define boundaries (and thereby dispelling  possible ambiguities and inconsistencies in clinical practice), and  debate the desirability (and feasibility) for these boundaries to be  independent of the laws of society and public opinion.",2002

Genetic research is highly interdisciplinary and  collaborative which makes necessary the communication between  geneticists, various academic disciplines and the public. The  informational content of technical terms, which have a (nearly) clear  meaning in the realm of medicine in general, is liable to be garbled  when transferred to and uncritically used within human genetics. One  of the technical terms we focussed on is âpreventionâ, which e.g. as  primary prevention means keeping a disease from occurring at all  by removing risk factors but in human genetics especially in prenatal  diagnosis is mainly understood as prevention of the ill. Fourteen scenarios were developed from genetic counselling before  conception to abortion of a child with trisomy 21. Three groups of  students of medicine differing in their level of clinical and theoretical  experience (1st, 3rd and 6th years of medical education) were  interviewed using these scenarios in a structured questionnaire.

Understanding of risk by patients and physicians    how to raise the haze of Bayes?,P0478.,Pelz,"Reformstudiengang Medizin, CharitÃ© Campus Mitte, Berlin, Germany","Genetic tests become increasingly accessible. Possible benefits  of testing for susceptibility to chronic disease may be substantially  outweighed by confusion raised by test results. The concept of  sensitivity, specificity and positive predictive value of a test are  all complex and therefore not necessarily understandable to an  uninitiated patient. On the other Hand in order to make informed  decisions on participation in genetic screening programs and in  prenatal diagnosis patients should be told about these concepts.  Moreover several studies have shown that even physicians have a  poor understanding of probabilities and the predictive value of test  results. Gigerenzer and coworkers hypothesised that due to human  evolutionary development mental algorithms were not designed for  probabilities and a Bayesian reasoning but for the understanding of  natural frequencies. In order to test their hypothesis for genetic counselling four  problems were presented to more than 200 of our fellow students  (representatives of an upper middle class lay population) either as  probabilities or as natural frequencies: (1) positive triple test and  the risk of trisomy 21, (2) insulin dependent diabetes mellitus and  DR3/DR4, (3) breast cancer and BRCA1/BRCA2, (4) inheritance of  familial polyposis and symptom free ageing. Participants received in  a randomised order all four problems, two presented as probabilities  and two as natural frequencies. They generally ranked the natural  frequency questions as less difficult and yielded a significant better  understanding of the risk. The representation of complex concepts  in natural frequencies rather than in probabilities can improve the  understanding of patients and of physicians. P 9.

The R408W  2.3 and R408W 1.8 mutations exhibit west east and east west clinal  distributions across Europe respectively. Crucial evidence for the  origin of R408W by recurrent mutation was provided by a previous  report [Byck et al. Hum. Molec.

We have investigated VNTR  sequence variation across a range of European populations. DNA  samples (n=141) from thirteen European regions were obtained  (with appropriate ethical approval) in collaboration with the members  of the European PAH VNTR cassette sequence variation study  group. VNTR alleles were amplified by PCR, gel purified and cycle  sequenced in forward and reverse orientation. Cassette sequences  were identified according to the standard nomenclature. VNTR 3  alleles exhibited a single cassette organisation (a2 b2 c1) common  to all chromosomes whether of wild type or R408W mutant genotype.  In contrast, wild type VNTR 8 alleles had two different cassette  structures represented within the study cohort at roughly equal  frequency, namely (a1)5 b3 b2 c1 and (a1)5 b5 b2 c1. R408W 1.8  chromosomes exhibited the (a1)5 b5 b2 c1 VNTR structure alone  but were associated with different STR alleles compared to wild  type 1.8 chromosomes.

The dissection of the YAP+ lineage in several  distinct haplotypes showed that only a few derivative haplotypes are  present in Europe.

Pierides3","1The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus,  2Private Practice, Nicosia, Cyprus, 3Dept of Nephrology, Nicosia,  Cyprus","Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF) is an autosomal recessive  disease of high prevalence in four ethnic groups, Non Ashkenazi  Jews, Armenians, Arabs and Turks. Typically it presents as acute  episodes of periodic fever accompanied by abdominal pain, chest  pain, or joint pain. The attack usually lasts from 12 to 72 hours,  with arthralgia or arthritis often lasting longer. The most dangerous  potential complication is amyloidosis that can lead to ESRF. About  40 mutations have been identified so far, some of them being very  frequent. Founder effects have been postulated to be responsible  for the high frequency of certain mutations in selected populations.  Molecular investigation of the Cypriot population reveals that about 1: 8 is a carrier of one of four mutations, E148Q being the most frequent  (1:12). Among 87 MEFV chromosomes analysed, the results are:  V726A 27.6%; F479L 21.8%; M694V 20.7%; E148Q 6.9%; M694I  2.3%; R761H 2.3%; Unknown 18.4%. Mutation F479L is rather rare  in other populations. Preliminary evidence suggests that this frequent  Cypriot mutation is associated with later age of onset of symptoms,  the most debilitating of which is strong and frequent abdominal pain,  with or without fevers and arthralgias. Despite the high frequuency  of E148Q, only 6 of 53 patients carried it, supporting its mild nature.  More than have of documented cases were diagnosed during the  past year, after announcing the availability of molecular testing and  providing evidence that FMF is not rare. Molecular testing is expected  to assist further in identifying ambiguous cases, while general  newborn screening is under consideration.",2002

International standardised  networks of registries of patients such as the Eurocat allow data  comparison and give the possibility of gaining experience in  surveillance and prevention of rare diseases. AIM: To to determine  population based prevalence rates, types and epidemiological  characteristics of the major congenital anomalies in northwestern  Croatia using standardised Eurocat methodology. RESULTS: During  the 1990 1999 period, 1274 children with congenital anomalies per  64.364 births were registered, with the mean prevalence of 19.7/10  000 births. Stability in the overall prevalence of malformations was observed, but there were differences in congenital anomaly rates  between different regions (p<0.01). Limb anomalies (32.3%) and  congenital heart defects (24.2%) represent the largest groups of  anomalies detected, followed by the defects of the urogenital system,  gastrointestinal system and central nervous system. An unusually  high rate of polydactyly was observed in Varazdin (16.9/10000  compared with mean rate of 8.0/10000 for EUROCAT registries).  The most frequent congenital heart defects were ventricular  septal defect (14.5/ 10 000), atrial septal defect (8.4/10 000) and  transposition of the great vessels (2.2/10 000). Down syndrome was  the most frequent chromosomal aberration (10.7/ 10.000 births).  CONCLUSIONS: Differences in congenital anomaly rates between  different regions of Croatia require further investigation in order to  determine whether they represent a true difference in the prevalence  rates or they are due to small number variation, differences in clinical  reporting or characteristics of the population (e.g. size, maternal age).",2002

The software helps visualizing the transmission of rare  alleles, extracting the fragment of complex pedigree with identical  mitochondrial genome or identical Y chromosome. The software uses a data file with LINKAGE format and creates  PostScript files for printing. PedigreeQuery draws complex pedigrees  with multiple loops, inter generation mating, individuals with multiple  mates. There are several additional features for visualization of  genetic data: different colors of symbols according to the different  phenotypes, crossing symbols, text underneath the personâs symbol  which includes any desired information (genotype markers, name,  age, etc.). Drawing pedigrees is highly configurable and may be  specified by nine parameters, i.e., font and symbolâs size, space  between symbols, and others.

The anthropological analyses of the  Cumanians suggest that they might be originated from Asia, however  their genetic origin has not been known. DNA was extracted from 11 bones for studying the genetic origin  of Cumanians. From the extracted DNA gender determination and  mitochondrial D loop sequence analysis has been carried out.  Using X and Y chromosome specific alphoid satellite markers the  gender of the 6 bone samples out of 11 were determined. Our  analysis confirmed the anthropological sex identification of four adult  individuals as males and was successful in cases of the female  juvenile individuals. The remaining five samples did not preserve the  investigated genomic DNA markers in detectable form. The nucleotide sequences of the mitochondrial hypervariable region  I were determined. The genetic homogeneity was investigated  within the studied Cumanians, and the phylogenetic relationship  among the Cumanian samples and modern populations was also  established. One part of the investigated Cumanian bone samples  carries common maternal lineages with the Asian Mongol and Buryat  populations, while the other part shows common mitochondrial  haplotypes with some modern European populations.

Objective:  To compare the power of haplotypic tests, taking into  account simultaneously the information on two neutral markers, to the  power of tests realised individually on each marker. Methods:  A program was written to calculate for patients and  controls the frequency of haplotypes and alleles for the two markers,  according to different models for the functional polymorphism (allelic  frequency, different genotype penetrances) and different values of  linkage disequilibrium. Power was then calculated for the haplotypic  test and the tests on each marker. Results:  In many situations, the role of the candidate gene is  detected by the haplotypic test when it can not be detected by  the separated study of each marker. The power increase of the  haplotypic test depends on the contrast of the linkage disequilibrium  between patients and controls, disequilibrium which may be  sometimes of contrary sign in the two samples. This situation was  observed in the study of the low density lipoprotein receptor related  protein gene in Alzheimerâs disease (Verpillat et al, 2001).

The majority  of the mtDNA lineages of Nogays belong to haplogroups H (23,6%)  and U (20,2.%). East Asian specific lineages of mtDNAs were  observed in 38,2% (haplogroups M,C,Z,D,G,A,B,F). On the data of  mtDNA genetic variation we demonstrated that the Nogays have  slightly more similarities with South Eastern Bashkirs, which live in  the Volga Ural region of Russia than with other populations from  Caucasus. The most maternal lineages of Kazakhs and Uzbeks have  the Asian mtDNA haplogroups. However, the relative frequencies of  this continental fraction of the mtDNA pool vary considerably over the  populations studied. The frequency of Asian haplogroups in Kazakhs  reached 62,38%, in Uzbeks   52,52%. Thus, based on the mtDNA  haplogroups composition analysis, the Kazakhs and Uzbeks were  found to be the closest population to the East Asian populations.",2002

Obstetrical  complications such as preeeclampsia, IUFGR and some others  are known to be associated with placental thrombosis. This study  investigates the relation between certain gene mutations and  obstetrical complications in Turkish women. Methods:  88 pregnant women with obstetrical complication and 44  control subjects were studied. FVL, prothrombin 20210A and MTHFR  C677T mutations were screened using PCR RFLP method. Results:  Results have yet been obtained for 54 patients and 44  controls. The incidance of FVL heterozygosity was found to be  20.37% among patients, being most common in preeclamptics (7/34)  followed by stillbirth (2/9) and IUFGR (2/10) groups. Only 2 stillbirth  cases of 54 patients (3.7%) carry both the prothrombin 20210A and  FVL mutations. Of 22 patients screened for MTHFR C677T mutation,  12 (55%) were found to be heterozygous carriers whereas the ratio of  homozygotes is 9%. (2/22, both preeclamptics). In the control group,  FVL mutation was found in 6.82% of the cases although prothrombin  20210A mutation was absent.Conclusions:  The study being still progressing, FVL gene mutation  seems to be relatively common in pregnancies with preeclampsia  than the uncomplicated ones. Both prothrombin 20210A and MTHFR  C677T mutations were detected in certain groups, but the number of  subjects is not sufficient for reasonable statistical analysis.

One explanation is  that these disorders are a result of an interaction between genes  and environment, and under such conditions, it may be difficult to  measure the true genetic effect without accounting for the interaction.  Umbach and Weinberg (2000) have proposed an association test  which looks at the joint effects of genotype and environment using  case parent trios. In this study, we explore under which conditions  accounting for GxE interaction enhances one?s ability to detect the  main effect of the gene. Using asymptotic power calculations, we  investigate the power to detect the gene effect over varying exposure  frequencies and several models of GxE interaction. We show that,  for a given sample size, interaction model and allele frequency,  the gain in power while accounting for the interaction depends on  the exposure frequency : the largest gain are seen for the smallest  exposure frequencies, and a loss of power can even be observed  when the exposure is frequent and/or the exposure effect is strong.  If we consider a gene with a disease allele frequency of 0.2, with  no effect in the absence of exposure, an exposure with a 10 fold  increase risk and a GxE relative risk of 2, then : when the exposure  frequency is 0.1, accounting for GxE interaction increases the power  to detect the gene effect in 200 trios by 10%; when the exposure  frequency is 0.9 it decreases the power by 15%.",2002

The majority of CMS are inherited as autosomal  recessive traits due to loss of function mutations of the acetylcholin  receptor (AChR) subunit genes or the collagenic tail subunit of  acetylcholinesterase (ColQ) gene. Many of the e subunit deficiencies,  as most frequent causes of CMS, were found to be due to âprivateâ  mutations and produce clinical phenotypes with great variations. This study summarizes data of the genetic analysis of a common  mutation, a homozygous basepair deletion in exon 12 of the AChR  e subunit gene (e1267delG) in 66 CMS patients from 46 non related  families. All patients were clinically characterized as having sporadic  or autosomal recessive CMS. All e1267delG families were of Romani  (Gypsy) and/or southeastern European origin. Phenotype analyses  revealed a uniform pattern of clinical features including bilateral  ptosis, moderate fatigable weakness of ocular, facial, bulbar and limb  muscles, positive response to anticholinesterase treatment and a  benign natural course of the disease. Genotype analysis was carried  out and indicated a common ancestor (founder). We conclude that  the mutation e1267delG might be the most frequent cause of CMS  in patients of Romani (Gypsy) ethnic origin. Therefore, carrier and/or  newborn testing may be beneficial in this group, as the disease is  treatable. Moreover, additional haplotype studies in patients harboring e1267delG may enable a more accurate age dating of this particular  mutation.

Egorov","Institute for Experimental Medicine, St.Peterburg, Russian  Federation. ","Familal hypercholesterolemia (FH) is one of the most common  inherited diseases (1:500), leading to atherosclerosis and premature  myocardial infarctions. FH is caused by mutations in the human  low density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor gene. The early diagnosis  of disease by means of DNA analysis allows to perform genetic  counseling and to prevent the development of the disease in the  FH patients by drug treatment. Aiming to identify the FH causing  mutations of the LDL receptor gene we have screened the separate  exons of the gene in collection of 42 FH probands by means of  PCR/SSCP analysis followed by DNA sequencing. During this study  we have identified the following DNA mutations: C74X (c.285 C>A,  TGCâTGA), E397X (c.1252 G>T, GAGâTAG), G571E (c.1775  G>A, GGGâGAG), that seems to be causative for FH development,  and two neutral mutations: H229H (c.750 T>C, CATâCAC), T705I  (c.2177 C>T, ACCâACT). All the mutations with the exception of  C74X and T705I were new and not reported elsewhere. Besides the  mutations we have identified five neutral changes considered as DNA  polymorphisms, namely c.66 C/T (C18C, TACâTAT), c.1171 G/A  (A370T, GCCâACC), c.1773 T/C (N570N, AATâAAC), c.1959 C/T  (V632V, GTCâGTT), c.2231 G/A (R730R, CGGâCGA). We have  compared the occurrence of the polymorphism alleles in FH group  and in the group of control (68 non related subjects) that have not  differed besides allele C of c.66 C/T polymorphism and allele A of  c.1171 G/A polymorphism were more common in control rather than  in FH group.",2002
Impact of Misspecifying Parental Relationships in  Maximum Lod Score Affected Sib Pair Method,P0521.,"L. Leutenegger1,2, E. GÃ©nin1, E. Thompson2, F. Clerget Darpoux1","1I. N.S.E.R.M. U535, Le Kremlin Bicetre, France, 2University of  Washington, Seattle, WA. ","Many linkage studies are done in small isolated populations and  populations where marriages between relatives are encouraged. In  these populations, missing information on pedigree structure is quite  frequent. Here, we study the impact of misspecifying the parental  relationships of the sib pairs in the Maximum Lod Score method  (Risch, 1990) and on the triangle constraints (Holmans, 1993). Characterising the parental relationships by the kinship coefficient  between the parents ( f), the maternal inbreeding coefficient ( am) and  the paternal inbreeding coefficient ( ap), we studied the behaviour  of the identity by descent (IBD) vector expected under the null  hypothesis of no linkage with respect to these quantities. We find that  the expected IBD vector is not anymore (0.25, 0.5, 0.25) when they  differ from zero. There is an increased probability of sharing one or  two alleles IBD. And in some cases the vector is even outside the  triangle constraints. We simulated data on two different family structures: (1) parents  are double first cousins ( f = 0.125, am = ap = 0), (2) each parent is  offspring of first cousins ( f = 0, am = ap = 0.0625). We then analysed  the data underestimating the parental relationships. We find that  ignoring the kinship and/or inbreeding of the parents increases the  type I error of the test when data on the parents are not available.  But when parents are typed, we observe a decrease in type I  error. We also point out some unpleasant feature of the software  GENEHUNTER even when parental relationships are properly  specified.",2002

Characterised by an iron overload,  the disease is associated with increased risk of hepatocarcinoma  but is effectively treated by phlebotomies. The HFE gene was cloned  in 1996 and a single mutation (C282Y) is responsible for 80 95% of  cases. HHC presents a genetic heterogeneity and its expression can  be modified by environmental factors. The aim of this study was to  identify the influence of alcohol use on the intensity of iron overload,  measured by serum ferritin, in patients homozygous for the main  mutation. We retrospectively registered patients C282Y/C282Y treated in  a blood centre of western Brittany. A clinical questionnaire was  completed at their first visit, informing on biological and clinical signs,  life customs, â¦. The analysis was made using a linear regression  model. This study included 351 subjects of whom 60.4% were males.  The most frequent clinical signs were: weakness (58.5%), arthritis  (44.7%), melanoderma (28.1%) and hepatomegaly (14.8%). Twenty  five patients had an excessive alcohol use (>60 g/day   7.2%). Those  subjects presented a significantly increased serum ferritin (1865.5  vs 940.3 ng/ml   p<0.001) and a higher risk of hepatomegaly and  melanoderma. The result of regression analysis remained unchanged  after adjustment on sex and age at onset. Excessive alcohol use accentuates iron overload in C282Y/C282Y  patients. This aggravating factor increases the risk of cancer and  of cirrhosis. Consequently, it is recommended to those patients to  have a reasonable alcohol use.

The investigated populations related to two basic racial  types of Eurasia: Mongoloid and Caucasoid. In contrast to other  polymorphic Alu insertion the presence repeat (allele Alu+) is  ancestral for insertion at the CD4 locus. Primates (chimpanzees,  gibbons and gorillas) are found to be monomorphic relative to  insertion presence. All studied ethnic groups are polymorphic at  the CD4 locus. It is interesting to note that deletion frequency  (allele Alu ) decreases with increased Mongoloid component in  the population. Maximal frequency of deletion allele is shown  in Russians (0.339). It decreases to the east and is minimal in  Yakuts (0.025). For Caucasoids living in Central Asia, i.e. Tajiks  and Uzbeks the frequency of Alu allele was 0.143 and 0.130, while  those for Mongoloids, i.e. Kazakh and Kirghiz was 0.129 and 0.125,  respectively.

Early onset periodontal diseases (EOP) are  a group of inflammatory disorders characterised by a rapid rate of  periodontal tissue destruction, in young individuals. There is now  substantial evidence to suggest that genetic factors play a role in the  pathogenesis of EOP. Polymorphisms in the MMP 1 gene, which may underpin inter  individual differences in MMP 1 synthesis and secretion have  been associated with other diseases, which have an inflammatory  pathogenesis. Genetic variation within candidate genes in EOP  patients may represent a mechanism by which individuals are  rendered susceptible to disease. Objective:  To investigate whether three biallelic polymorphisms  occurring within the exonic regions of the MMP 1 gene (positions  +85*, +2506** and +2613**) are associated with EOP. Methods:  The MMP 1 polymorphisms were detected using a PCR  SNP SHOT method. MMP 1 polymorphisms were examined in 72  patients with EOP and 91 healthy matched UK controls. Results:  No differences in allele and genotype frequencies were  observed for the +85 and +2613 SNPâs.

In the study blood samples of  602 individuals from 8 populations from Volga Ural region were  investigated: 4 ethnic groups of Bashkirs, Tatars, Russians,  Chuvashes, Mordvinians, Maris, Udmurts, and Komis. The method  involved PCR amplification using primers flanking only CAG  polymorphic cite (without CCG repeats) with subsequent PAGE and  dyeing with ethidium bromide. In all populations normal distribution of  CAG repeats was found (p<0,001) showing unimodal nature peaking  around repeat CAG17; the distribution skewness varied from 0.74  in Chuvashs to 1.98 in Bashkirs. 26 alleles containing from 9 to 36  repeats were revealed in total sample.

We  included all liveborn, stillborn, and terminated cases diagnosed with  NTD and reported to the Hungarian Congenital Abnormality Registry  from 1987 through 1999. Additional cases with NTD obtained from  our nationwide field study were also recorded. There were a total  of 1,772 cases with NTD among 1,497,515 births. Thus, the overall  prevalence was 11.8 per 10,000 births. Anencephaly accounted for  25.3%, spina bifida 61.0%, encephalocele 13.7% of all cases with  NTD. The proportion of NTD pregnancies terminated increased  from 17% during 1987 1996 to 72% during 1997 1999, while the  proportion of live births significantly declined from 58% to 21%.  This two fold reduction in live birth prevalence is resulted from  improvements in the accuracy of prenatal detection of NTD affected  pregnancies with an increase in termination of these pregnancies.  Previous surveys of mothers showed that most of them took folic acid  supplementation during pregnancy but only about 10% had started  it before conception. Thus, the impact of primary prevention on the  prevalence of NTD is far from optimal compared to the impact of  prenatal diagnosis in Hungary in recent years.",2002

Additionally,  genetically determined differences in the activity of the metabolic  enzymes can increase an individualâs susceptibility to certain types of  chemically induced cancers and possibly other diseases. Cytochrome  P450 ( CYP) is one of the most important metabolic systems of  the organism involved in the oxidation of different drugs and other  xenobiotics. Based on the metabolic activity the population is divided into three  phenotypes: ultraextensive, extensive and poor metabolizers. Inter  ethnic differences in the activity of CYPâs have been reported.  Cytochromes CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 are involved in metabolism of  more than 50 drugs. It is questionable which of the mutant alleles  should routinely be identified to allow a sufficiently reliable but still  practicable estimation of a persons metabolic capacity. In our study, we inwestigated the prevalence of most frequent alleles  of CYP2C9 and CYP2D6 among 200 unrelated Croatian individuals.  The most frequent CYP2C9 alleles are 2C9*1 ( 0.74), 2C9*2 (0.165)  and 2C9*3 (0.095).

In this study, we report a  novel method for quantitative measurement of Phe in serum. The  method was developed using Proteus Rettgeri bacteria, which  produce phenylalanine deaminase (transaminase). These bacteria  could convert Phe into phenylpyrovate in the culture medium, which  can be easily detected by spectrophotometer using ferric chloride  reagent. In this method, the standard curve for Phe ranging from 2  30 mg/dL was linear. This method was applied to 33 PKU samples  (serum and blood spots collected on filter paper), which their serum  Phe had already been tested using the Gutheri bacterial inhibition  assay (GBIA) and the HPLC method.

Semrad2","1University of ChildrenÂ´s Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic, 2Dept. of  Cardiology, Faculty Hospital, Brno, Czech Republic. ","Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) is a cardiovascular disorder  characterized by prolongation of the QT interval on ECG and  presence of syncope, seizures, and sudden death. Five genes have  been implicated in Romano Ward Syndrome, the autosomal dominant  form of LQTS: KVLQT1 (11p15.5), HERG (7q35 36), SCN5A (3p21  24), KCNE1 and KCNE (21q22). Mutations in KVLQT1 and KCNE1  also cause the Jervell and Lang Nielsen Syndrome, a form of LQTS  associated with deafness, a phenotypic abnormality inherited in an  autosomal recessive form. We used mutational analyses to screen LQTS patients from 23  families for mutations in the KVLQT1 gene, a potasium channel  subunits that account for most of RWS cases. In six unrelated  LQTS patients, singlestrand conformation polymorphism analyses  identified aberrant conformers. DNA sequence analyses identified  two missense mutations G325R and T309I, localized in the  transmembrane domains S6 and pore region. CT substitution  resulting in a tyrosine to an isoleucine transition at codon 309 (T309I)  was novel. We also identified two single nucleotide polymorphisms  in four unrelated LQTS patients, F484F and Y171Y, which have not  been previously reported. Further functional studies will be required  to determine what effect each of these changes may have on  KVLQT1 channel function. Genetic screening using mutational analysis can improve  presymptomatic diagnosis. Familial and sporadic cases affected  by mutations in all LQT genes can now be genetically screened to  identify individuals at risk of the development of the disorder.

A mass media campaign in 1995  informed the public of this advice. In the Netherlands 80 90% of  pregnancies are planned. The aim of the campaign was to reach  at least 70% of women wishing to conceive and that 65% of these  women would use it appropriately. Awareness and use of folic acid: At first or second antenatal visit, women filled out a questionnaire.  The survey was performed 5 times. The percentages that used  folic acid are mentioned in the table. In 2000, 26% of low educated  vs. 47% of high educated women used folic acid during the entire  advised period. Although an impressive proportion of women  complies to the advice, the aim (85%*70%*65%=39% appropriate  folic acid use) has not been attained.

Towards a general quality standard in genetic  testing,P0554.,"Dequeker , J. J.

Many laboratories now participate in external quality  assessment (EQA) schemes. In order to evaluate the status of QA  implementation in genetic diagnostic laboratories, a survey on QA   and accreditation was sent to 206 laboratories from 32 European  countries and 5 laboratories in Australia and the USA. 151 participants responded (73 %) to the survey. In order to minimise  errors, an appropriate QA system needs to be worked out for the  whole procedure of a genetic analysis. Such system is established  in 110 of the surveyed laboratories (73%): 45 laboratories follow  an international standard, 52 a local or national standard, and  13 laboratories did not specify which guidelines are being used.  However, only 82 laboratories are officially inspected: 52 are  inspected by a national body, and 30 are accredited by an internationally recognised accreditation body .  Thus, it is clear that at present there is no harmonisation on QA   among laboratories. The new ISO 17025 standard, which is accepted  by most national and international accreditation bodies, could  therefore be an important step towards harmonisation of laboratory  practice. This new standard also includes requirements for reporting  the results.

Early identification of deaf babies and remedial education  is beneficial, with better expressive and receptive language, speech,  and social and emotional development. Pilot screening scheme.  The primary screening tool is the  measurement of transient evoked otoacustic emissions (TEOAE),  administered to all newborns before dismissions from the neonatal  center. If the TEOAE test is pathological is repeated three times, then  the brain stem auditory evoked response (BAER) will be measured.  When deafness is present, the baby is referred to a specialistic center  for audiological assessment and for the application of a rehabilitative  protocol and molecular test is performed. Molecular analysis.  In  developed countries, deafness has an important genetic origin, and at  least 70% of genetic cases are autosomal recessive non syndromic,  80% of which due to mutations in the GJB2 gene. In this pilot  screening genetic counselling is offered to parents of deaf babies. In  a previous study with direct sequencing of the GJB2 gene, we found  mutations in 43 of 74 cases (58%) of severe/profound deafness. The  most common mutation is 35delG, accounting for 74% (30/43) of all  deafness alleles. The mutations V95M and E47X were detected four  and two times, with a relative frequency of 4.6 and 2.3% respectively .  Other mutations (L90P, 290 291insA, 333delAA, W24X, E119del,  M34T, Q80P) were detected once.

Most cases are detected incidentially when PD has  been performed because of an increased risk for Down syndrome.  Because KS is likely to be unfamiliar to the general population,  information given about KS may be of crucial importance for parentsâ   decisions about whether or not to continue with the pregnancy. Methods:  A systematic review of the case notes of all KS diagnosed  up to 24 weeks of gestation in 8 European regions in 5 European  countries (France, Germany, The Netherlands, Spain and the UK)  was conducted. The variables documented included maternal age,  parity, gestational age at diagnosis, speciality of health professional  providing information before and after PD. Results:  Details of 111 pregnancies and their outcome were obtained.  Mean maternal age was 36.9 (Â±4.6) years, 44.1% pregnancies were  terminated. Across the 8 European regions termination rates varied  between 76.9% and 0%. Using multivariable logistic regression  analysis, the only significant predictor of continuation of the  pregnancy was the speciality of the health professionals conducting  post diagnosis counseling: the affected pregnancy was more likely  to continue when post diagnosis counseling involved only a genetics  specialist (RR 2.42 (95% CI 1.14 to 5.92)). Discussion:  There is an association between whether or not a woman  terminates a pregnancy affected by an unfamiliar fetal anomaly and  the professional background of the health professional providing post  diagnostic counseling.

In this population  based study, we examined the impact of the RFC 1 A80G variant on  NTD risk and the potential interaction between this polymorphism  and MTHFR A1298C mutation. We report that the RFC 1 A80G  variant is common in the Italian population (0.47). Nevertheless, the  allelic frequency was higher among NTD cases and their parents.  Heterozygous patients and mothers have OR of 1.72 (95% CI 0.96  3.11) and 1.86 (95% CI 0.68 5.27), respectively. More sensitive risk  was calculated for the 80GG genotype of cases (OR=2.35; 95%  CI 1.21 4.58). On the contrary, the heterozygous genotype of the  mothers and both heterozygous and homozygous genotypes of  the fathers did not seem to be significant risk factors. According to  multifactorial basis of NTDs, we found that combined genotypes  for MTHFR A1298C and RFC 1 A80G polymorphisms of cases  (1298AC/80GG and 1298CC/80AG) results in greater NTD risk than  heterozygosity and homozygosity for RFC 1 A80G variant alone.",2002

Human PAX6 mutations  are associated with a range of ocular abnormalities, including aniridia,  various anterior segment defects and foveal hypoplasia. We carried out a mutational analysis of the PAX 6 gene in 54  unrelated patients with aniridia or one of various closely related  syndromes. Despite an association of several methods a deleterious  variation was evidenced in only 30 patients : twenty four different  mutations, 16 of which are novel, were found. The spectrum of PAX 6 mutations in our population is highly  homogenous with 96% of all mutations leading to premature  truncation of the protein (8 nonsense and 4 splice site mutations, 1 1  insertions and deletions) and only one missense mutation (4%). Examination of the phenotype did not allow to recognise significant  differences whatever the protein was deprived of one or another of  its functionnal domains. We present 22 mutations in association with  common recognisable aniridia phenotypes and 2 in association with  atypical phenotypes : a missense mutation (R19P) in an individual  with an unusual microphtalmia sclerocornea phenotype and a splice  site mutation (IVS4+5G&gt;C) in a family presenting a panocular  defect associated with a congenital nystagmus. Our observations support the concept of dosage effects of the PAX  6 mutations as well as presenting evidence for variable expressivity .

Shetty","Centre for Research in Mental Retardation (CREMERE), Mumbai,  India","Approach of detection, diagnosis, management and care of the  mentally retarded (MR) children in India differs from that of the  industrialized countries due to its varied socio economic, religious,  cultural and family structures. The rural, slum and semi urban  population with genetic diversity make the situation more complex  by consanguinity. A community based approach was therefore used  for creating awareness about genetic components, and care of the  MR children by establishing a âReferral Systemâ with networking of  primary health centres. During 3 yearsâ study, screening of 5.5 lakhs of population was  conducted using the existing Primary Health Post infrastructure.  Training of medical, paramedical and community health volunteers  (N>800), and door step care by this trained field staff, followed by  detection and referral of the MR children to the tertiary Genetic  Centre   CREMERE, were the important features. The nature of the  disability, causes and recurrence risk were explained through genetic  counseling, emphasizing consanguinity and hereditary factors to the  parents. Pregnancy monitoring and prevention was stressed in young  couples. The causative factors in total 511 MR children are discussed in  view of the present health scenario, genetic expertise and limited  laboratory infrastructure in India. Emphasis is given on prevention,  when therapy is yet a distant hope. The significant point indicated  for health policy planners was the 49% preventable factors (birth  asphyxia, infections and low birth weight) and 36% genetic etiology  contributing to mental retardation.

","Germline activating mutations of the RET proto oncogene cause  three different dominantly inherited cancer syndromes, including  multiple endocrine neoplasia type 2A (MEN 2A), type 2B (MEN  2B), and familial medullary thyroid carcinoma (FMTC). Mutations,  involving the somatic cell lineage, are found in about 30% of sporadic medullary thyroid carcinomas (MTC). Early detection of mutations  is mandatory for genetic counselling and risk assessment in family  members allowing presymptomatic testing and improvement of the  disease management. The majority of the activating RET mutations  affect exons 10, 11, 13, 14, 15 and 16 and are currently detected by  SSCP and restriction enzyme analysis. In order to improve sensitivity,  time and cost of the RET mutation analysis, we have developed a  Denaturing High Performance Chromatography (DHPLC) based  protocol. In this system mutations can be determined on the basis  of the melting behaviour of heteroduplexes, which elute from the  column by a combination of temperature and acetonitrile gradient.  We performed DHPLC in 141 MTC patients with previously  characterized mutations and 35 relatives. Heteroduplex peaks were  detected for each mutation tested which produced a distinct and  highly reproducible DHPLC elution profile. These results indicated  that DHPLC methodology: a) displays a high level of sensitivity,  approaching 100% for mutations in the RET proto oncogene; b) is  suitable for rapid genetic testing of members of the MEN2 affected  families; c) provides a relatively simple and accurate screening  technique by exhibiting advantages over conventional mutation  methods, including semi automated analysis of 96 PCR samples in  less than 12 hours and low cost .",2002

Our data point to a non random distribution of the disease  in the Roma in Bulgaria. The disease is confined to the Xoroxane  Roma, clustered in the South Eastern part of the country, where  an ancestral SMA allele accounts for 98% of SMA chromosomes.  We found that this SMA allele has diverged in three closely related  conserved haplotypes, carrying different types of SMN gene deletions  and conversions. Their combinations determine the varying severity  of SMA disease. By contrast, the same ancestral allele is rare in  Hungary. It occurs in only 50% of Hungarian SMA chromosomes and  is not confined to any specific Romani group. The high prevalence of SMA in Bulgarian Gypsies, and the existence  of a founder SMA allele, raise the question of prevention among  the target Xoroxane groups. However, the lack of an inexpensive,  reliable, high throughput method for the detection of deletion carriers  makes population based carrier testing programs unrealistic at this  stage.

Finne2","1Thermo Labsystems, Helsinki, Finland, 2Dynal Biotech ASA, Oslo,  Norway","KingFisher Blood DNA kit is developed for the purification of genomic  DNA from human blood using paramagnetic particles and KingFisher  mLâ¢ magnetic particle processor. The kit is based on two step  process where three different kind of magnetic particles are utilized.  In the first step white blood cells are captured from whole blood using  leukocyte specific magnetic particles thus leaving behind e.g. red  blood cells and serum proteins. In the second step white blood cells  still attached to beads are lysed in lysis/binding buffer and released  DNA is isolated using DNA binding magnetic particles. Finally the  purified DNA is released into elution buffer and is ready for the direct  use in PCR or other enzymatic reactions. Fresh human blood (stored  maximally 3 4 days at +4ÂºC) is strongly recommended as starting  material.  EDTA is recommended as an anticoagulant. Maximal  sample volume is 200 Âµl, which typically gives 4 10 Âµg of high quality  DNA. The approximate processing time for 15 samples is 50 minutes. The KingFisher Blood DNA kit provides a timesaving and convenient  way to purify genomic DNA from human blood samples. The  purification process requires no phenol/chloroform extraction or  alcohol precipitation, and involves very little handling. As a result,  DNA with high quality and yield is obtained for further applications,  such as amplifications, digestion with restriction endonucleases and  Southern blotting.",2002
Mutation Screening in Lysosomal Enzyme  Genes by Real time Monitoring of Melting Behavior in  Oligosaccharides labeled with SYBR Green,P0586.,"Paschke1, M. Czapka1, K. Paul1, W.

Lysosomal storage disorders comprise approximately 40 recessive  enzyme deficiencies leading to markedly reduced life span and  severe deterioration of multiple organ functions. Promising recent  results of novel intravenous infusion therapies with recombinant Posters   Genetic Services, Genetic Screening, and Public Policy 198 199 enzyme preparations markedly increase the impact of a complete  elucidation of the genotype in affected families. Due to the high  number of rare or unknown mutations this includes laborious  electrophoretic methods of mutation screening like Single Strand  Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) or Denaturing Gradient Gel  Electrophoresis (DGGE). We evaluated the possibility of using real time PCR to monitor the  melting behavior of fluorescently labeled oligonucleotides for mutation  screening. PCR replicons of 100 bp   fragments, overlapping at a  length of 12 bp were labeled with the unspecific fluorescent dye  SYBR Green and the differences to wild type melting temperature  were assesed in a ROCHE Light Cycler. Compared to SSCP the  results could be obtained with a considerably shorter time (1,5 vs 8  hours) at a comparable specificity. The increased number of PCR  reactions necessary could be reduced by the efficient optimization  in real time PCR. Within two years we were thus able to identify  80 90 % of the affected alleles in 108 patients with 4 rare lysosomal  genenzyme deficiencies. 33 (55%) of 60 mutations found were so  far unknown. Therefore this approach may be useful for the routine  genotyping of patients with rare genetic disorders. P 11. Genomics and Bioinformatic",2002

In this way polymorphisms for six genes  (ADSL, BZRP, CYP2D, CRYBA4, DIA1 & PDGFB) that showed  strong sequence homology with their human counterparts and their  locations are well known in human have been developed in cattle.  Polymorphisms were developed for introns or 3âUTRs of those genes.

Recently we evaluated  the quality of this annotation by characterizing a set of C21orfs and  PREDs, identified by mapping spliced ESTs to the genome and only  by in silico analysis, respectively. This study underscored the limit  of in silico only gene prediction, as many PREDs were incorrectly  predicted. To refine the HC21 annotation, we have developed a  reliable algorithm to extract and stringently map sequences that  contain bona fide 3â transcript ends (3â tags) to the genome. We then  created a specific 21q Acedb that incorporates new ESTs as well as  features such as CpG islands, repeats and gene predictions. Using  these tools we identified 27 new putative genes.

Di repeats  are always the most represented, tetra repeats are more represented  in mammals than in the other organisms, whereas tri repeats are  consistently scarce. In man tri repeat representation is less than 1â4  of tetra ; their frequency is 6.4 repeat/Mb and their coverage 473  b/Mb. Motifs such as ACG, ACT, CCG are scarce, while the others  present taxa specific variations.

In man ACG is the least represented, ATC has  the highest coverage, AAT the most frequent. Tri repeat coverage  generally increases linearly with frequency, except for AAG, ACC,  AGG, ATC in man, and AAG, AGG in mouse: these repeats tend  to expand in the former more than in the latter and occasionally ,  but never in exons, exceed copy number of 40, the observed limit  for tri repeat pathological expansions. Tri repeat scarcity seems a  feature of mammals and the variable representation of their motifs  may constitute a novel signature for eukaryotic genomes: since  both probably result from a structural control on DNA synthesis, the  aberrant elongations found in dynamic mutations may be due to the  derangement of one or more control elements.",2002

Giovanni Rotondo, Italy. ","A cytoplasmic ribonucleoprotein (mRNP) infrastructure works in the  cell as an interface between the transcriptome and the proteome,  being responsible for transcript transport, localization, turnover and  translational control. This complex is composed by aggregates of  distinct subsets of mRNAs with regulatory RNA binding proteins,  which finally interact with ribosomes and the cytoskeletal apparatus  to allow protein synthesis. It has been proposed that the clusters  of monocistronic mRNAs composing individual mRNPs function  like poycistronic mRNAs transcribed from operons in procariotic  organisms, adding with their combinatorial nature a further level of  regulative complexity. If these mRNPs are really regulative units,  the bound mRNAs should be endowed with uniform turnover and  translation rate. Here we show that a clusterization of human primary  fibroblast mRNAs based on their individual half life (measured by  an high density microarray approach) produces groups of mRNAs  which can be demonstrated to be colocalized, and probably belong  to the same mRNP type.

Many factors  implicated in this absorption have been recently characterized without  explaining its adaptation to the iron store of the whole organism. This  adapted absorption is probably due to an unknown sensibilization  of intestinal crypts undifferentiated cells. These cells differentiate  during their migration along the crypt villosity axis and would become  fully differentiated enterocytes with an appropriate iron absorption  capacity. Caco 2 cells, a colon adenocarcinoma cell line, seem to be  a good model for studying iron effects on gene expression during the  enterocytic differentiation. A transcriptomic approach has been implemented to identify genes  involved in the regulation of iron absorption in the intestine : 1536  cDNA were selected by subtractive suppressive hybridization ( SSH )  and spotted on micro arrays. Their sequences reveal that each array  represents 700 genes, half of them with an unknown function. mRNA   from Caco 2 cells at different stages of differentiation were hybridised  to the microarrays. These experiments show that 400 out of the  700 genes can be classified in seven distinct expression profiles  that seem to correlate with functional role, most of iron metabolism  genes being indeed overexpressed in differentiated cells.

The major goal of this study  was to develop a feasible protocol for the postnatal and prenatal  diagnosis of Ã thalassemia in the Italian population, based on a  Denaturing High Performance Liquid Chromatography (DHPLC)  assay. First of all, empirical optimization of DHPLC parameters was  set up in a total of 40 Italian heterozygous carriers, whose 26 different  Ã globin mutations had been previously identified by ARMS PCR.  A group of 30 normal individuals was used as control. Secondly,  the DHPLC optimized parameters were successfully applied to  the mutational analysis of Ã thalassemic patients, both compound  heterozygotes (12 subjects) and homozygous patients (4 subjects). In  addition,12 chorionic villi samples were subjected to DHPLC analysis  upon molecular characterization of each parental Ã globin alleles.  Two other mutation detection methods (i.e. ARMS PCR and allele  specific reverse dot blot) plus direct sequence analysis were used in  parallel to the DHPLC method, showing an accuracy rate of 100%.

Beta thalassemia  minor (BTM), a mild form of anaemia, also shows a characteristic  geographical distribution with high prevalence in the Mediterranian  region. Due to ineffective erythropoesis, BTM is associated with iron  overload. The goal of the current study was to examine the potential  interaction between these two genetic disorders, both with signifi cant  prevalence in Hungary. 97 unrelated, consecutive patients (males/ females:47/50, average age:33.5 years) with altered laboratory tests  characteristic to BTM were examined for the presence of C282Y and  H63D mutations of the HFE gene by PCR RFLP. For the laboratory  detection of the BTM phenotype, we used haemoglobin F (HbF),  haemoglobin A2 (HbA2) and permeability tests. Each patient showed  elevated HbA2 and either elevated HbF or altered permeability.  The HFE genotyping showed 5 (5.2%) C282Y heterozygous and  30 (30.9%) H63D heterozygous patients, two of them compound  heterozygous. The C282Y allele frequency (2.6%) was lower than  the reference value for Hungary (3.8%), the difference was not  significant. The H63D allele frequency (15%) was similar to the  reference value (14%). We are currently collecting additional clinical  data to assess the iron homeostasis of BTM patients with different  HFE gentoypes.

The causes of  such a shortcoming are related to the following factors. Lack of  awareness by the majority of the population at risk and by the fi rst  (G.P.âs and midwives) and second line of healthcare (obstetricians,  neonatologists paediatricians). Moreover, know how and technology  for carrier diagnostics is not always available in the laboratory .  Carriers, whenever diagnosed, are not sufficiently informed about  genetic risk and prevention and not referred for counselling.  Finally, requests for financial support to the Dutch prevention  foundation, for the implementation of a national prevention strategy ,  are systematically rejected.

In India  thalassemia is a serious public health problem. Since India is a  large country, therefore screening of general population for carrier  status is not feasible. Hence, screening has to be restricted to high  risk groups. Extended family screening (EFS) means screening  relatives of the affected child for carrier status. Objective: To explore  if EFS for carrier detection was feasible in India, if not, then what  are the barriers to its acceptance. Methods: Hundred couples  with a thalassaemic child were interviewed using a predesigned  questionnaires. Parents of affected child were given information  on disease and its transmission and asked if they had conveyed  to their relatives the possibility of their giving birth to a similarly  affected child. Results: 96 couples had no reservation in sharing  information about their thalassaemic child with relatives. Relatives  of 62 couples accepted risk of being carriers but only 14 families got  themselves tested. Another 34 families were willing to get tested but  because of non   availability of screening facility in near by town,  cost of test and lack of sufficient motivation did not get themselves  tested. Conclusion: Majority of parents have no reservations in  sharing information about the affected child. Communication needs  to be improved for all families at risk to accept the risk of having  a thalassaemic child. Screening should be more readily available  and high risk groups should be motivated through awareness  programmes.",2002

A G+1 to C transition in one allele  of intron 11, causing the skipping of exon 11, was detected in a  third proband and this is the first report of a mutation in a splicing  donor site of the prolidase gene. A G 1 to A transversion in intron  7 was identified in two unrelated probands and shown to cause  multiple alternative spliced transcripts. Long term cultured fibroblasts  from these PD patients were used to investigate the biochemical,  microscopical and ultrastructural changes in affected cells. Light and  electron microscopy revealed that patientsâ cells were more round  and branched than controls. We also detected increased cytosolic  vacuolization, plasma membrane interruptions, mitochondria swelling  and mitochondrial matrix and cristae modifications. JC 1 labelling  showed decreased mitochondrial membrane potential. An intracellular  accumulation of the Gly Pro dipeptide was revealed by capillary  electrophoresis analysis. The composite data provide new insights  into PD physiopathology, suggesting the activation in skin fibroblasts  of a necrosis like cellular death, which could be responsible for the  typical skin lesions in this disease.",2002
Five years of molecular diagnosis of  hypophosphatasia : benefits for genetic counseling and  for understanding the molecular basis of the disease,P0621.,Mornet,"Laboratoire SESEP, UniversitÃ© de Versailles Saint Quentin en  Yvelines, Versailles, France","Hypophosphatasia is an inherited disorder caused by a deficiency of  bone alkaline phosphatase due to mutations in the tissue nonspecifi c  alkaline phosphatase (TNSALP) gene. The disease results in low  or nil bone and dental mineralization. It is highly variable in its  clinical expression, due to the strong allelic heterogeneity in the  TNSALP gene. Since 1997, we studied 127 patients or families of  patients from European, North American and Australian origins and  identified by sequencing 101 mutations among which 91 were not  previously described. Twenty six molecular prenatal diagnoses were  performed in 22 families affected by the lethal form of the disease.  The great number of mutations collected by our laboratory constituted a powerful tool for studying the correlations of genotype and  phenotype, for understanding the cases of dominant transmission,  and for elucidating the role of alkaline phosphatase in bone  mineralization. For that, we used a panel of methodologies such as  site directed mutagenesis, 3D modeling and monoclonal antibodies  directed against the protein. Our results allowed us to distinguish  severe and moderate alleles, to discriminate recessive and dominant  mutations, to show that the dominant effect of some mutations result  from an inhibitory mechanism and to identify major functional regions  of the enzyme, a result of significant importance in understanding  the role of this enzyme in bone mineralization. These results have  been immediately used to improve genetic counseling and molecular  diagnosis of the disease and in the long term, could help to discover  drugs for treatment of the disease.",2002

Except of X linked adrenoleukodystrophy  (X ALD), all diseases are based on autosomal recessive type of  inheritance. This defect is based on peroxisome biogenesis or  deficiency in individual peroxisomal protein. Methods:  Gas Chromatography/Mass Spectrometry (GC/MS)  analysis of very long chain fatty acids (VLCFA), phytanic acid,  pipecolic acid and urinary organic acids were used for diagnostics  of peroxisomal diseases with defect in Ã oxidation route, primary  hyperoxaluria I and mevalonic aciduria. In some cases digitonin  permeabilisation of cultured fibroblasts was realised. For X ALD  mutations analysis cDNA sequencing was used. Results:  One case of the peroxisome biogenesis disorder and three  cases of single peroxisomal enzyme deficiencies with fatal course  to 3 year were diagnosed. X ALD with variable phenotypes was  found in five male patients. In two patients (brothers) of age about 30  this disease was presented as adrenomyeloneuropathy associated  with adrenal insufficiency and Addison crises. In the other sibling  X ALD as childhood cerebral form and until now asymptomatic form  was manifested. Among the X ALD patients there is also a 12 year  old boy with 5 year continual therapy with Lorenzoâs oil. He has a  slow progression of disease and nearly physiological VLCFA serum  values. One case of primary hyperoxaluria I with kidney stones at 4  year and mevalonic aciduria were also diagnosed. Conclusions:  During the last five year inherited disease of  peroxisomal compartment has been definitively proved for 11  patients.

","Gaucher disease (GD), the most frequent lysosomal storage  disorder, is an autosomal recessive disease characterized  by deficiency of glucocerebrosidase (GBA). Mutations in the  GBA gene cause the disease and enzyme deficiency results  in accumulation of glucocerebroside, mainly within cells of the  monocyte/ macrophage lineage, which may lead to splenomegaly,  hepatomegaly, thrombocytopenia, bone marrow suppression,  and bone lesions. The disease is panethnic and has been divided  into three major types on the basis of the absence (type 1) or the  presence and severity of neurologic manifestations (type 2 and  type 3). The most common variant of the disease is type 1, which  is particularly frequent in the Ashkenazi Jewish population with  an estimated disease frequency of 1 in 850 and a carrier rate to  approximate 1 in 15. We have developed a reverse hybridization  assay (Gaucher Disease StripAssay) for the simultaneous detection  of eight point mutations (84GG, IVS2(+1), 1226G, 1297T, 1342C,  1448C, 1504T and 1604A) and two multiply mutated alleles derived  from rearrangements between the structural gene and the 16 kb  downstream pseudogene (RecNciI, RecTL).

An Automated Screening Test for Multiple  Mutations Associated with Hereditary Iron Overload,P0625.,"Moritz, G. KriegshÃ¤user, F. Kury, C. Oberkanins","Viennalab Labordiagnostika, Vienna, Austria","Inherited iron overload is a heterogenous disorder, including âclassicâ  autosomal recessive hereditary haemochromatosis (HH), as well as  juvenile and autosomal dominant forms of the disease. The most  prevalent variant among Caucasians is autosomal recessive HH due  to mutations in the HFE and transferrin receptor 2 (TFR2) genes.  More recently, mutations in the genes for ferroportin (FPN1/SLC11A3/ IREG1) and ferritin heavy chain (FTH1) were found to be associated  with autosomal dominant iron overload. In most cases therapeutic  phlebotomy provides an effective and inexpensive lifelong treatment.  DNA testing is now routinely used to support the diagnosis in patients  with abnormal iron parameters, for the presymptomatic identification  of individuals at risk, and its potential for population screening  programs is currently under discussion. We have developed a reverse hybridization assay  (Haemochromatosis StripAssay) for the rapid and simultaneous  detection of 18 known mutations in the HFE, TFR2, FPN1 and FTH1  genes. The test is based on multiplex DNA amplification and ready  to use test strips containing oligonucleotide probes for each wild type  and mutated allele immobilized as parallel lines. The entire procedure  from blood sampling to the identification of mutations requires  less than 6 hours, and may be carried out manually or essentially  automated using existing instrumentation (e.g. TECAN profiBlot).

Prenatal diagnosis by biochemical methods  may also be problematic for some families. The FAA gene maps to 15q23 25, has 14 exons, and more than  34 different mutations have been reported. There are four common  mutations associated with this disorder, most of the remainder are  private mutations. Of the 37 patients (from 35 families) at Birmingham  Childrenâs Hospital, 62% of disease alleles were accounted for by  these four mutations. 27% were G192T, 27% IVS12+5 G to A, 6.8%  IVS6 1 G to T, and 1.4% G1009A. 68% of these patients are of Asian  origin: within this group G192T is exclusive, and IVS12+5 G to A is  more common than in the whole group. Mutation screening by single stranded conformational polymorphism  (SSCP) analysis was developed to identify the remaining disease  causing mutations. 8 patients had further testing (14 untyped alleles).  From this group of patients, 9 additional mutations were identifi ed of  which 6 were novel, and together accounted for 13 of the 14 disease  causing alleles. Five of the mutations were mis sense mutations  (S23P, H133R, P156Q, T325M and S352R) and one splice site  mutation (IVS9 2 A to G).

Dedicated softwares automatically delivers genotype  and quality assessment for each sample. A major advantage with  Pyrosequencing is its combination of accuracy, speed and ease of  use. Pyrosequencing assays for determination of four single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) and two deletion polymorphisms were  developed to identify the functional allele *2 and five of the non  functional CYP2D6 alleles (*3, *4, *6, *7 and *8). The establishing  of a multiplex genotyping procedure enabled simultaneous scoring  of these polymorphisms in only two Pyrosequencing reactions.  130 patient samples were analysed and the results compared to  genotyping by RFLP.

Cloning of the MSD  gene has been hampered by absence of familial cases suitable for  linkage mapping. A recent study demonstrated that the biochemical  basis of this disease is a defect of a post translational modification,  which appears necessary for sulfatase catalytic function.  However, no information is available on the protein performing  such modification, and consequently of the gene mutated in this  disease. We have used microcell mediated chromosome transfer  to clone by complementation the gene associated with multiple  sulfatase deficiency (MSD).

More than 360 different mutations of the gene  have been reported and most of them are unique. Eleven patients were diagnosed by using VLCFA analysis. The  mutation analysis has been performed in 8 Russian patients with  childhood cerebral form X ALD. 6 different mutations have been  identified using such methods as PCR SSCP analysis and direct  nonradioactive sequencing. Three of them (R152L, Y296C, and  S606L) have previously been reported. Three mutations detected  were novels ones: fs164 (c494delG), L138del or L139del in exon  1 and D555N in exon 7 . In one family with two affected boys the  mutation fs164 (c494delG) was found in both sibs. But the c494delG  has not been detected in DNA sample extracted from leukocytes of  the mother.

This accumulation  is a consequence of the reduced activity of the lysosomal  enzyme glucocerebrosidase. Several different mutations in the  glucocerebrosidase gene were identified in the Spanish Gaucher  disease patients, some of which were new. In order to characterize  the resulting enzyme, these mutant alleles were expressed in an  improved baculovirus system. This novel gene expression system  allows rapid and efficient generation of recombinant baculovirus  DNAs by site specific transposition in E. Coli. In particular cDNAs  corresponding to the following mutated alleles were studied: P182L,  N188S, R257X, Y313H, E326K, N370S, P391L, N392I, I402T,  D409H, L444P, N188S+E326K and E326K+L444P. Expression of wild type cDNA results in an overexpression of acid b  glucosidase activity (mesured with 4MU b glucoside as substrate) of  6 to 10 fold the value of control fibroblasts. In the case of I402T, D409H, N370S, L444P, N188S+E326K and E326K+L444P mutations,  expression studies revealed an activity lower than 30% of the wild  type values.

Novel mutation of human OCTN2 carnitine  transporter in a patient with severe ischaemic heart  disease,P0642.,"Bene , K. KomlÃ³si, V. Havasi, B. Melegh","Dept. of Medical Genetics and Child Development, University of  PÃ©cs, PÃ©cs, Hungary. ","Novel mutation of human OCTN2 carnitine transporter in a patient  with severe ischaemic heart disease Primary carnitine deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder  of fatty acid oxidation resulting from defect of the tissue carnitine  transport. Impaired carnitine transport can be caused by mutations  of the carnitine transporter gene SLC22A5 encoding the organic  cation transporter (OCTN2), a Na+ dependent carnitine transporter.  It has been already recognized that the OCTN2 mutations are  associated with different phenotypic presentations, and differences  can be observed even in patients with identical mutations. However ,  cardiac symptoms are always present in the affected individuals, and  there are indications that certain mutations can also be associated  with heart problems even in heterozygotes. In a female patient with  moderate cardiomyopathy myocardial infarction developed at the  age of 45, and due to the persisting coronary insufficiency, later  an artery bypass grafting was necessary by open heart surgery. At  the age of 70 myocardial infarction developed again. Examination  of the SLC22A5 gene revealed a C T transition at the 15 np of the  exon V (in a heterozygote form) which is associated with serine  phenylalanine replacement at the amino acid position 280, which  has not been reported elsewhere. This amino acid exchange means  a replacement of an aminoacid with potential functional residue.  Whether this mutation plays a role in or contributes to the pathology  or can be at least regarded as a mutation which generates an  additional susceptibility, remains to be elucidated.",2002

Hospital  Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands, 5Univ. Childrenâs Hospital, Kiel,  Germany, 6Inst. of Child Health, London, Germany. ","Flavin containing mono oxygenase 3 (FMO3) is required for N  oxidation and detoxification of many endogenous and exogenous  compounds including biogenic amines and several common drugs.  Individuals with severe FMO3 deficiency have a constant fish like  body odour (fish odour syndrome) due to insufficient N oxidation  of trimethylamine (trimethylaminuria), whilst mild deficiency is  associated with transient or intermittent malodour. So far, seventeen  mutations or amino acid variants of FMO3 have been identified.  A common FMO3 gene allele [E158K,E308G] (homozygous in 4  % of the German population) was shown to be associated with  reduced FMO3 function. We now report the result of more extensive  biochemical and molecular studies, using a DGGE mutation scanning  method, in individuals with constant or intermittent malodour.  Malodour in two patients was related to carnitine treatment, a well  known but previously unexplained side effect. Nine novel mutations  in the FMO3 gene were identified; all but one are missense mutations  that may leave residual enzyme activity. Mild mutations were  identified in combination with severe mutations, or in homozygous  state, in patients with mild variants of trimethylaminuria as well as patients with fish like malodour under carnitine treatment. In  summary, mutations in the FMO3 gene cause a broad spectrum  of phenotypes ranging from severe fish odour syndrome to mild  enzyme deficiency that is common in the general population  but only intermittently associated with malodour. In view of the  important metabolic functions of FMO3, its mild deficiency may play  a role as susceptibility factor in various pharmacological and other  pathophysiological conditions.",2002

Determination of DL pipecolic acid in body fluids  by gas chromatography mass spectrometry,P0645.,"Futas , R. Petrovic, J. Chandoga","Centre of Medical Genetics, University Hospital, Bratislava, Slovakia","Background:  Pipecolic acid (PIPA) is a metabolite of lysine  degradative route. PIPA pathway accompanies the major  saccharopine pathway of L lysine degradation, being prominent only  in brain, while it is obligate for D lysine. Hyperpipecolatemia is found  as an overflow effect in familial hyperlysinemia. PIPA accumulates in  body fluids in some disorders of peroxisome biogenesis leading to  deficient activity of L pipecolic acid oxidase, too. Objective:  Simple quantification of PIPA in body fluids as a tool for  biochemical diagnostics of inherited metabolic diseases. Methods: Gas chromatography  mass spectrometry determination  of PIPA as a N ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester prepared by reaction with  ethylchloroformate in the presence of ethanol and pyridine. Reaction  was performed in the matrix of deproteinized (acetonitrile ethanol)  biologic sample after extraction of neutral lipids (hexane) without  preliminary isolation of amino acids. A capillary column with non chiral  phase was used. Results: N ethoxycarbonyl ethyl ester of PIPA was easily noticeable  in the vacant area of chromatogram. Detection limit for L pipecolic  acid standard solution was 0,1 Âµmol.l 1 under used conditions.  Physiological values for PIPA concentration in serum and urine of  patients without peroxisomal disorder were determined. In a male  child (6 months) suspected for generalised peroxisomal disorder the  serum PIPA level reached 101 Âµmol.l 1, with urine PIPA level of 55,1  mmol/mol creatinine. Conclusion:  A simple and reliable method for determination of DL  pipecolic acid in body fluids is presented. It has the advantage of  simultaneous analysis with other amino acids in one run and so it  may be a component of a screening program.",2002

The SLC3A1 gene   coding for a high subunit of the heteromeric amino acid transporters  (HATs), rBAT  is responsible for type I cystinuria, whereas the  SLC7A9 gene  coding for a light subunit of the HATs, b0,+AT  is  involved in determining non type I (before types II and III) cystinuria.

Plasma DÃH deficiency  has been associated with a severe congenital orthostatic syndrome  with absent plasma (nor)epinephrine. Low plasma DÃH, however,  also occurs in 5% of normal subjects having normal (nor)epinephrine.  The genetic basis of symptomatic DÃH deficiency has never been  investigated. Methods: We sequenced the DÃH gene in two unrelated patients with  DÃH deficiency and an orthostatic syndrome. We determined plasma  DÃH in 49 healthy blood donors to identify asymptomatic individuals  with low plasma DÃH activity to sequence their DÃH gene. Results: Two mutations uniquely associated with plasma DÃH  deficiency and absent plasma (nor)epinephrine were found in the Posters   Inborn Errors of Metabolism and Biochemical Genetics 212 213 patients with the orthostatic syndrome. One patient was homozygous  for a splice site mutation (IVS1+2 T>C), and the other was compound  heterozygote for this splice site variant and a deletion of base 575.  In blood donors with low plasma DÃH activity we found a mutation  at  1021, immediately upstream of the transcription initiation site.  Individuals homozygous for  1021T had almost absent plasma DÃH activity. Conclusions: Our study is the first to describe pathogenic mutations  in the DÃH gene. It defines the genetic basis of DÃH deficiency with  absent plasma (nor)epinephrine leading to an orthostatic syndrome.  It also explains the genetic background of asymptomatic DÃH  deficiency. The concurrence of homozygosity for the DÃH  1021  T allele with low plasma DÃH in healthy individuals suggests that  the  1021 locus determines secretion of DÃH into the blood without  interfering with normal catecholamine synthesis.",2002

PV is clinically characterized  by acute attacks of neurovisceral crises and/or dermatologic  manifestation. The clinically manifest patients show typical plasma  fluorescence at 626 nm, have increased fecal porphyrins and, during  acute attacks, have increased porphyrin precursors in urine. The  activity of PPO in heterozygous patients is about 50%. The human  PPO cDNA and gene has been cloned and mapped to chromosome  1q22 23. The gene spans about 5 kb, contains 13 exons, the cDNA  encodes a protein of 477 amino acids. We have studied 6 unrelated Czech families with clinically and  biochemically diagnosed PV. Four new mutations were detected: one  deletion (1393 del 8 bp), two missense mutations (W227G, C459Y)  and one splicing mutation (IVS 6+1 GÂ®A). Although the relationship  is not known, the deletion 1393 del 8 bp was identified in two of these  families. In the last family the already described deletion 1177 del  G was found. The pathological significance of missense mutations  was determined by their expression in prokaryotic system. Both  these missense mutations resulted in the absence of PPO activity in  E. coli which is in good agreement with an expected 50% activity in  the heterozygous state. Availability of screening for all PV families  will ensure correct diagnoses in all gene carriers and prevents life  threatening porphyric attacks.

The PAH gene harbours many mutations (~ 400 variant  alleles), which cause various degrees of phenylalanine hydroxylase  deficiency. Missense mutations, represent ~ 60% of the mutations  so far recorded. The Puerto Rico Newborn Screening Program has found that the incidence of PKU in the island of Puerto Rico (PR) is  1:18,000 on average. The most frequent hyperphenylalanemia in  PR is classic PKU. In the present study we screened 15 classical  PKU Puerto Rican patients for mutations by PCR amplification of  all exons followed by DGGE and/or SSCP analysis and direct DNA  sequencing. We found several polymorphic sites in exons 4, 7,  11, and 12 and a novel frameshift mutation in exon 4. The novel  mutation was found in one patient with a homozygous insertion of an  A nucleotide at codon 120. Two patients were homozygous for the  E280K mutation and another patient was homozygous for the R176X  mutation. The E280K mutation has been found in high frequency  among Cuban PKU patients, whereas the R176X mutation was found  previously in Southern Europe PKU patients.

Previous studies have  shown that classical galactosaemia has an overall incidence of 1  in 21,000 live births in Ireland, higher than elsewhere in Europe.  Although there is a spectrum of causative mutations in the GALT  gene, one mutation (Q188R) predominates in Caucasians. The  frequency of this Q188R mutation exhibits an East to West gradient  of increasing frequency across Europe, peaking in Ireland (89.1%).  This raises questions as to the origins and introduction of the Q188R  mutation to Ireland. Through a combination of bioinformatics, PCR, dHPLC and  Restriction Fragment Length analysis (RFLP), four novel Single  Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNPs) and three flanking Short Tandem  Repeat (STR) markers linked to the GALT gene have been identified.  A haplotype system for Galactosaemia has been established through  the combination of these markers with two previously known SNPs.  Sixty Irish control DNA samples have been analysed demonstrating  that 8 distinct haplotypes exist in the Irish population. The analysis  of the haplotype backgrounds of the common GALT gene mutations  present in the European population is now underway.

However the mutation  rates of this class of microsatellites differ significantly between loci.  The purpose of this study was to evaluate the mutation rates and  allelic frequencies of ten autosomal tetranucleotide loci in Western  Siberian population. Allelic polymorphisms were studied in 200 â 290  unrelated individuals from Tomsk region, and mutation rates were  estimated as frequency of parent child mismatches in the segregation  analysis of STR alleles in 134 families with proven paternity.

A general aim is to to  achieve a density of at least 1SNP/10kb in previously identified  chromosomal regions and to screen all coding and regulatory  regions of candidate genes. A combined SNP map for a manageable region(Â±5Mb), may require genotyping 300 500 SNPs. Especially  with such a high throughput, individual genotyping of SNPs  remains expensive. Although current methods may be accurate,  robust and adequate for large scale application, a cheaper and  less time consuming alternative to individual genotyping is using  allele frequencies determined in DNA pools. We have developped  an accurate and reproducible protocol for direct allele frequency  determination using pyrosequencingTM technology in large genomic  DNA pools(374 individuals). A correlation of 0.980 was measured  between the allele frequency detected by this method and by  individual genotyping. In the context of disease associated SNPs  studies, we compared the allele frequencies between disease and  control groups. The measured difference varied with 1.5Â±0.9%  between the two detection methods. It may be concluded that the  protocol with large DNA pools could reliably detect a 4% difference  between populations. Furthermore, it is economic with regard to  amounts of DNA and reagents required. The method is currently  used to screen a region of chromosome 2(6Mb) and 10(3.5 Mb) for  SNPs with an allele frequency differences between type 2 diabetes  or obesity and control groups.

A 4G allele  is associated with increased transcription of PAI 1 protein due to  different binding of transcription regulating proteins than in 5G site.  This may change the fibrinolitic capacity, decreasing the ability to lyse  clots. Many studies showed that 4G5G polymorphism was associated  with increased risk for cardiovascular disease. Still, conflicting data  are reported for cerebrovascular disease, even suggesting protective  role of 4G allele. In order to investigate relation between 4G5G polymorphism and  stroke incidence, 52 stroke patients and 126 healthy subjects were  genotyped by PCR SSCP analysis. Genotype distribution among  controls was: 4G4G 24% (30), 4G5G 48% (60) and 5G5G 29% (36).  The allelic frequencies in control group were: 4G 48% and 5G 52%.  In patients group the genotype distribution was: 4G4G 23% (12),  4G5G 40% (12) and 5G5G 37% (19). The frequencies for 4G and  5G alleles were 43% and 57%, respectively.

A trend towards a lower prevalence of  the 4G allele in the patients group was observed (43% vs. 48% in  control group, OR 0.8, 95% CI 0.53 1.32).

The clinical phenotype in these 3 families of different geographic  origin (Australian, Austrian and Belgian) is strikingly similar to the  original ALS4 family except for a younger onset age in the distal  HMN families.

An  exhaustive mutational study of the gene was performed by SSCP  analysis in CF patients with and without MI. Several sequence  variations in the ATB0 gene were identified, although none of them  seemed to be related to the intestinal phenotype of CF. Even though  no particular allele or haplotype in ATB0 appears to be associated to  CF MI disease, new SNPs identified should be useful in segregation  and linkage disequilibrium analyses in families affected by other  disorders caused by the impairment of neutral amino acid transport.",2002

Molecular haplotype determination using  PyrosequencingTM technology,P0668.,"Pettersson , M. Bylund, A. Alderborn","Pyrosequencing AB Vallongatan 1, Uppsala, Sweden","The identification of haplotypes from a combination of single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) on one chromosome is a  powerful tool for genetic research. Haplotyping is usually performed  statistically by computational analysis or by time consuming cloning  techniques. Here we present a simple molecular approach for reliable  haplotype determination on an individual basis. The procedure is  based on allele specific PCR in combination with PyrosequencingTM  technology. Allele specific PCR primers were designed with the 3Â´end at the SNP  position and primers specific for each allelic variant of the SNP were  tested in two separate reactions. A PCR product in both reactions  implied a heterozygote SNP, whereas a PCR product from just one  reaction denoted the homozygote for which the allele specific primer  was complementary.

Amplified allele specific fragments too long  for analysis by Pyrosequencing technology were subdivided by  nested PCR.

They are defects of vasculogenesis/angiogenesis and thereby  provide a tool to study the mechanisms involved in these processes.  Capillary malformation (CM, or âport wine stainâ) is the most common  vascular malformation occurring in 0,3% of newborns. CMs are small  flat cutaneous lesions that consist of an increased number of ectatic  capillary like channels within papillary dermis. Vascular birthmarks,  such as salmon patch, are milder variants of CM that occur up to 40%  of newborns. Unlike common macular stains, the reddish coloration  of CMs does not disappear, but becomes darker with advancing age. Increased incidence of lesions in first degree relatives of CM patients  and several reported familial cases suggest that genetic factors may  play a role in the pathogenesis of CM. We performed a genomewide  linkage analysis on 13 families with inherited CM. In non parametric  linkage analysis, statistically significant evidence of linkage (peak  NPL score 6.72, p value 0.000136) was obtained in an interval of  69 cM on 5q11 5q23. Parametric linkage analysis gave a maximum  combined HLOD score of 4.84 (a value 0.67) from the same region  and the analysis using only the linked families, defined a smaller,  statistically significant locus of 23 cM (LOD score 7.22).

These conditions are  characterized by a loss of corneal clarity due to an abnormally  functioning endothelium (Waring et al. 1982). It is thought that this is  a result of defects in neural crest differentiation (Bahn et al. 1984) A genome wide search of a three generation family (FECDPed1) with  FECD demonstrated significant linkage with D1S2830 (Zmax = 3.72,  Î¸ = 0.0).

Developmental studies have suggested a role for type VIII  collagen in cell differentiation (Shuttleworth 1997) and the protein is a component of endothelial basement membrane, making COL8A2 an  attractive candidate gene. Analysis of the coding sequence of COL8A2 within FEDPed1  revealed a missense mutation (Gln455Lys) within the triple helical  domain. This missense mutation was demonstrated in 2 further  families with FECD and one family with PPCD.

While high risk  alleles well explain familial aggregation of PCa, observed in about  10% of all affecteds, low risk alleles may account for a higher portion  of the disease, especially âsporadicâ cases. Concerning a putative  predisposition to PCa, we investigated the gene encoding the  Prostate Carcinoma Tumor Antigen 1 (PCTA 1), mapping to 1q42.2  43, a major susceptibility region identified in a French and German  genome wide search. The open reading frame of PCTA 1, which was  found to be free of deleterious mutations previously, harbours several  SNPs altering the amino acid sequence in four residues. In turns  of a population based association study six SNPs were genotyped  in 265 controls, 216 sporadic and 57 familial patients. None of the  examined SNPs per se revealed association, but one out of five  resulting haplotypes, which we call âC2 alleleâ.

Each boy manifested, at  least, two of the following features: positive family history of mental  retardation, long face, large ears, hyperextensible finger joints  and bulbous halluces. Patients were assessed for 18 physical  features and 23 behavioral features. Reverse transcriptase  polymerase chain reaction (RT PCR) amplifies across the two KH  domain regions specific for FMR1 gene. Diagnosis of patients was  absolutely dependent on the detection of absent FMR1 transcriped  mRNA. This approach successfully diagnosed fifteen boys (60%)  from 11 families as fragile positive and ten boys (40%) from 8  families as fragile negative. Multiple regression analysis revealed  11 features (4 physical and 7 behavioral) with high predictive  value for fragile X syndrome. The frequency of speech defect was  significantly increased in boys with fragile X syndrome. Delayed  language, numerical and time concepts, domestic activities and  directive behavior were significantly delayed in those boys. Eysenk  personality questionnaire, Beck depression inventory and parental  attitude questionnaire were applied to all mothers and revealed  increased psychoticism, neuroticism, criminality and various degrees  of depression in mothers of fragile X boys.

This approach is much more powerful than standard  statistics because it allows for testing model assumptions, such  as concerning the effect of explanatory variables, and for reducing  variability in the data by down weighting unusual observations, and  adjusting for intra familiar variation. It also allows for estimation  of heritability of complex traits. The data from extended 110  fragile X families (including 185 fragile X subjects and 110 normal  relatives) were analyzed. Fragile X status was determined by the  number CGG repeats in the FMR1 gene. Physical phenotype  was represented by trunk, limbs, head and face measures, and  neuropsychological phenotype, by the cognitive (Wechsler), and  executive function measures. Evidence is presented for strong  phenotypic (neuropsychological) involvement in premutation carriers,  especially in males, which predominantly affects performance skills  and executive cognitive functioning. The effect of premutation status  on physical phenotype was less evident and concerned only some  facial measures in both sexes, and the measure of jointsâ laxity  in females.

","Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is the most common inherited cause  of mental retardation, with a prevalence of about 1/4.000 5.000 in  males. Therefore many clinicians must deal with fragile X individuals  in their daily routine, but many of them still donât recognise this  syndrome. This problem is greater in women, in whom the prevalence  is theoretically the same as in males, but due to the fact that at least  50% of the fully mutated women are normal, the clinical prevalence in  females is in fact much lower, about 1/10.000. Our laboratory has been working on FXS molecular testing since  1991, receiving the majority of requests for FMR1 testing from  Northern Spain.

Galliera, Genova, Italy. ","Background Brachydactyly Mental Retardation syndrome (BDMRS),  MIM 600430, also defined as Albright Hereditary Osteodystrophy like  (AHO3) syndrome, is associated to distal deletion on 2q37 region.  This association was first described independently by Phelan et al  and Wilson et al (1995). Results MultiFISH based screening for subtelomeric chromosome  defects (Cytocell) was performed on 250 mentally retarded patients.  The observed frequency of subtle chromosomal abnormalities was  6% (15/250). Among the fifteen subjects carrying chromosomal  rearrangements six showed 2q37 de novo deletions (2.4%)  associated to BDMRS. Since the probe included in the kit still detects  2q37 telomeric polymorphism (Macina et al, 1994; Knight et al, 1997),  for all patients the 2q37 deletion was mapped by microsatellites and  FISH analysis using genomic probes (PAC and BAC) encompassing  the chromosomal region. Parental origin was determined by  microsatellites analysis. The occurrence of the length polymorphism  at 2q37 was also found in 17 subjects (7%). In two of them the  polymorphism was present in compound heterozygosity with the  BDMRS associated deletion. Conclusion Advancement of FISH strategies allowed to screen  large series of mentally retarded patients and consequently improve  the frequency definition of some recurrent chromosomal aberrations  escaping from conventional karyotype. Among previously reported patients (Phelan et al and Wilson et al, 1995) with 2q37 deletion,  only one of nine showed a normal karyotype. The group of patients  presented here carried submicroscopic deletions allowing the  evidence that BDMRS is an emerging clinical grouping. The presence  of chromosomal polymorphisms is under investigation to verify a  genetic predisposition to 2q37 rearrangements.",2002

In affected boys, consistent  clinical features of XLAG are intractable epilepsy of neonatal onset,  severe hypotonia, poor responsiveness, genital abnormalities  and early death. On MRI , a gyration defect consisting of anterior  pachygyria and posterior agyria with a moderately thickened brain  cortex, dysplastic basal ganglia and complete agenesis of the corpus  callosum are consistently found. Neuropathological examination of  the brain shows a tri layered cortex containing exclusively pyramidal  neurons, a neuronal migration defect, a disorganization of the basal  ganglia and a gliotic and spongy white matter. Finally, females related  to affected boys may have mental retardation and epilepsy, and often  display agenesis of the corpus callosum.

These diseases often  tend to be diagnostic problems due to their wide variety. That renders  the precise estimation of the cognitive and behavioral phenotype a  great importance. Aim:  to study cognitive and behavioral characteristics of patients  with dysmorphic syndromes most often met in clinical practice  (Down, Frigali X, Prader Willi, Williams Beuren, Noonan and Cornelia  de Lange) and to define the specific cognitive and behavioral  phenotypes. Results and discussion: The different dismorphic syndromes  manifest cognitive capacity deviations of different severety. IQ  level in an individual patient changes with age in different ways. In  our experience patients with Down, FRAX A and CdeL syndromes  show an intellectual decline with age, as other authors have  observed, while patients having PWS, WBS and NS manifest an  unequivocal tendency to imrove their cognitive skills. The most  maladaptive behavior is shown by patients with CdeL and FRAX  A. The relationship between intellectual functioning and adaptive  skills is in inverse proportion   for example for CdeL syndrome  there are low IQ values and a large number of psychopathological  behavioral symptoms hampering adaptability, while for NS there are  comparatively high IQ values and negligible behavioral deviations. Conclusions:  The patients with some dismorphic syndromes  manifest more or less specific psychological profiles of cognitive and  behavioral characteristics. These profiles may be successfully used  both in support of diagnostic process and as a basis for adequate  medical and psychological intervention and counselling of parents.",2002

We report clinical and molecular data from a  family where a terminal 22q deletion was identified. The proband, a  8 years old girl suffered of a global development delay with a patent  discrepancy between development of speech and of the other areas.  This deletion was inherited from a paternal balanced translocation  between the terminal end of a 22q arm and the p arm satellites of a  chromosome 14.

Interestingly a 22qter partial trisomy was identified on a probandâs  brother affected with Aspergerâs syndrome, including a very precious  language, rich vocabulary and pedantic speaking style.

","Angelman syndrome (AS) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder  with a difficult clinical diagnosis and a heterogeneous genetic basis.  More than 70% of patients carry a 15q microdeletion detectable  by FISH. Up to 5% of patients have maternal UPD, identifiable  by segregation analysis of chromosome 15 microsatellites. Up  to 5 10% of cases are due to an abnormal imprinting process.  M PCR test reveals all genetic defects except mutations in the  UBE3A/E6 AP gene, which are responsible for the remaining 20%  of cases. We report on 243 patients with a clinical diagnosis of AS  analyzed by one or more of the following techniques: FISH, M PCR,  chromosome 15 haplotyping, UBE3A mutation screening.

sleep and its disturbances in Angelman syndrome,P0709.,de Leersnyder,"Hopital Necker, Paris, France","Angelman syndrome (AS) is a severe neurogenetic disorder,  characterised by severe mental retardation, ataxia, seizures, absence  of speech and characteristic facial features. We have studied  sleep behavior of 62 AS patients aged 2 to 20 years through sleep  questionnaires filled by the parents. Bedtime was between 8 and  10.30 p.m. , awakenings between 6 and 9 am, these results were  similar to control group (30 healthy children aged 2 to 20 years),  53% of the children woke up 1 to 3 times each night, and need  parentâs attendance to go back asleep. These sleep disturbances  have a major impact on parents and family members, who report  tiredness, depression, becoming sleep deprived themselves. After  the age of 3 years, children had no naps during the day , and do  not objective fatigue. Adding anti epileptic medication, 42% of the  patients take different medications for sleep. Patients had maternal  deletion 15q11 q13 (84%), paternal disomy (10%), imprinting  defects (1%) or mutations of the UBE3A  gene (4%). There was no  phenotype genotype correlation for sleep disturbances in AS. The  mechanism of sleep disorders in AS is complex, insomnia may be  related to abnormalities in brain development which may include  abnormal function of the circadian system and seizures play a part  in night awakenings.

We herewith report a new case with the same  pattern of the 15q11 methylation, which extends further the clinical  pattern of such anomalies. The girl was born from healthy parents aged 37 years at conception  and she is the second child. Pregnancy was uneventful. Length and  birthweigth were normal. She walked unaided at 18 months. First  words were said at 12 months. Language did not develop thereafter .  At 3 years 6 months her weight and height were at the mean for the  age. Her head circumference was at  1 sds for age. She exhibited  mainly hyperactivity and was joyful. Cytogenetic analysis was normal.  Because of the behavior characteristics the methylation pattern of  the 15q11 SNRPN was evaluated. The maternal band was found  fainted on three different samples (SNRPN exon alpha, Southern  blot, XbaI and NotI double digestion). Methylation specific PCR at the  SRPN locus confirmed a faint maternal band. Quantitative Southern  blot analysis of the critical IC region (AS SRO) showed a normal  dosage. Therefore IC deletion is unlikely. Sporadic imprinting defect  and cellular mosaicism are likely explanations for such a pattern.

A 7 years old girl was referred for chromosome analysis because  of recurrent infections and microcephaly. High resolution banding  revealed an interstitial deletion in 17p11.2. The deletion was  confirmed by FISH with the SMS probe (Oncor). The girl presents with few facial dysmorphic features: anteverted  ears, full upper lip with a âtentedâ appearance and mild micrognathia.  Overall facial âgestaltâ does not resemble the Smith Magenis  Syndrome (SMS). Thyroid function is in the normal range, while  GH secretion was reduced upon stimulation. Her height, at 3rd  percentile until 5.5 years, has improved to the 10th percentile after  starting replacement therapy. She is microcephalic (below the 3rd  percentile) and has short hands. Immunity function is normal apart  from a IgA value at the lower limit of normal range. The girl had  occasional absence like episodes and repeated EEGs showed non  specific alterations. Psychomotor development evaluation revealed  a borderline I.Q.

Recently, it has been shown that subtelomeric chromosome  rearrangements may be a common cause of idiopathic mental  retardation (MR). Such aberrations were found in ~7 % of patients  with severe or moderate MR and dysmorphic features. However,  further studies are needed to elucidate their prevalence and to  establish more cost effective selection criteria for subtelomeric test.  We report results of screening studies in 52 families with idiopathic  MR. Apart from MR, the main inclusion criteria were clinical features  suggestive of a chromosomal aberration. Fluorescence in situ  hybridisation with Chromoprobe Multiprobe T System (Cytocell) was  used. In five cases subtle rearrangements were found. Verification  of the karyotype at a higher resolution level has revealed that two  rearrangements were half cryptic and in two cases both products  of identified translocation could be seen. In one of them it was  not a subtelomeric rearrangement but it could not be seen in the  routine karyotype because of similar banding pattern and the size  of involved regions. The prevalence of subtelomeric abnormalities  was 4/52 (7,7%). All identified aberrations were familial in the origin  and no abnormalities were shown in patients with mild MR. Our  results confirm previous findings, indicating the important role of  subtelomeric rearrangements in the aetiology of MR. They also  emphasise the preferential occurrence of such abnormalities in  patients with severe MR and positive family history for intellectual  disability. Moreover, they also show that higher banding resolution  should be used in the routine karyotyping in this group of patients.",2002

","Cryptic subtelomeric chromosome rearrangements have recently  been implied in the aetiology of mental retardation. Systematic  FISH screening techniques to detect such rearrangements using subtelomeric probes have been introduced. To facilitate a  more efficient analysis, multi colour hybridisation techniques for  subtelomeric probes are being developed. COBRA (COmbined  Binary RAtio labelling) is a recent multi colour FISH labelling  technique which combines ratio and combinatorial labelling to attain  especially high multiplicities [Ref. 1, 2]. With the novel âSubtelomere COBRA FISHâ, the specific detection  of all necessary 41 BAC and PAC FISH probes (second generation  probe panel, Ref. 3) is possible in only two hybridisations. By  strict probe selection and characterisation and by using the ULS  / Universal Linkage System Â® labelling technique, high specificity  and hybridisation efficiencies could be reached. This allows the  unequivocal analysis of 21 respectively 20 probes per hybridisation  with only two to three metaphases each. In contrast to other  subtelomeric multi colour techniques, the high multiplicities of  Subtelomere COBRA FISH make it possible to differentiate e. g. long  arm and short arm subtelomeric regions of a given chromosome thus  permitting the diagnosis of cryptic pericentric inversions in addition to  translocations and deletions. The technique, its validation and first results will be presented. References: [1] Eur J Hum Genet (1999) 7: 2 11, [2] Genome Res.

OBJECTIVES: The goal of this study is to use and compare  both Fluorescent In Situ Hybridisation (FISH) and high resolution  Comparative Genome Hybridisation (CGH) in 2 populations:  children with mental retardation, and couples having had at least 3  unexplained miscarriages. PATIENTS : 200 children with idiopathic mental retardation and 57  couples (114 patients) were studied after informed consent according  to the Helsinki convention. Of 200 patients 29 were excluded  because they had abnormal karyotype, non telomeric microdeletion  or a sib in the study. METHODS: FISH was performed using the Cytocell or Adjenix  probes. CGH was performed using the Adjenix Nick Translation kit  and the Cytovision Image Analyser. RESULTS: In the mental retardation group 13/171 anomalies were  found or 7.6% using FISH. Anomalies were often familial and 5  involved chromosome 22q. CGH was performed in 50 patients:  39 picked at random and 11 to validate the method. One familial  microdeletion was found involving chromosome 17. 7 couples had  an abnormal Karyotype but no FISH anomalies were found in the  miscarriage group. CONCLUSIONS : Telomeric FISH screening is useful for diagnostic  and prognostic purposes in children with mental retardation and  normal karyotype resulting in 7.6% anomalies.

We have evaluated the  methylation status of FMR1 and other X linked loci in chorionic villi  from first trimester and full term female placentas of normal and  fragile X pre/full mutation individuals. In contrast to somatic tissues,  X inactivation methylation was absent from DXS255 and from the  FMR1 promotor at any stage of development while methylation  was present on other loci. In contrast to X inactivation methylation,  fragile X full mutation hypermethylation has been detected in a 13  week old male fetus but was frequently not seen in the first trimenon.

A rheostat model for a rapid and reversible form  of imprinting dependent evolution,P0727.,"L. Beaudet , Y. Jiang","Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX","The evolutionary advantages of genomic imprinting are puzzling.  We propose that genomic imprinting evolved as a mechanism  that maximizes the inter individual variability in the rates of gene  expression for dosage sensitive loci that can alter the phenotype over  a wide continuum with minimal unrelated deleterious effects, and we  refer to this as a rheostat model. We hypothesize 1) that genomic  imprinting provides a haploid selective advantage (HSA)   not an  original proposal; 2) that many imprinted genes have evolved genetic  and epigenetic mechanisms that facilitate quantitative hypervariability  (QH) of gene expression; 3) that the combination of haploid selective  advantage and quantitative hypervariability makes possible a rapid  and reversible form of imprinting dependent evolution (IDE) that can  mediate changes in growth, behavior, and perhaps other traits; 4)  that this enhanced adaptability to a changing environment provides  selective advantage as an assisted form of evolution; and 5) that  these mechanisms have provided at least one of the driving forces  for the evolution of genomic imprinting in mammals. The rheostat  model suggests some nontraditional genetics including both genetic  and epigenetic variants contributing to an integrated mechanism of  mixed Mendelian and non Mendelian inheritance, the possibility that  the majority of variants are not intrinsically deleterious but are each  potentially advantageous depending on the environment, a reversible  form of assisted evolution, and the ability to protect a silent allele  from selection for many generations but reactivate and expand it in  the population quickly.",2002

Identifying female  mutant carrier before or at early pregnancy through a wide screening  program is considered a practical approach. However, the carrier  prevalence in a population and cost of screening test should be  carefully evaluated prior to implementation of such a program. To  ascertain the prevalence of FXS in Taiwan, we screened a total of  1002 pregnant women using a high resolution Southern blot test to  examine the pooled DNA, and a simple non radioactive PCR test  to identify heterozygous women ( Tzeng et al; Diagn Mol Pathol  2001;10:34 41 ).

It was suggested that the  frequency of mutations in MECP2 in mentally retarded males equals  the frequency of the CGG expansion in the FMR1 gene. In order to  determine if MECP2 screening should be implemented in a routine  diagnostic setting for patients with nonspecific mental retardation,  we tested a cohort of 500 male and 100 female mentally retarded  patients who were negative for the expansions across the FMR1  CGG repeat. Furthermore, 70 mentally retarded patients with a  clinical diagnosis of Angelman syndrome, but without a molecular  abnormality on 15q, were included in this study. In each of these  three patient groups only one causative mutation could be identifi ed.  Several amino acid changes appeared to be polymorphisms after  testing unaffected male family members. Because one of these  patients showed a Prader Willi like phenotype, we performed MECP2  mutation analysis in 100 patients with a clinical but no molecular  diagnosis of Prader Willi syndrome.

Neurologic abnormalities include spastic paraparesis, ataxia,  intermittent hyperventilation, and epilepsy. Growth retardation,  scoliosis, and autonomic dysfunction are common.

Mutations in the MECP2 gene are involved in a broad spectrum  of phenotypes from classical Rett syndrome to mild intellectual  difficulties in feamles and neonatal encephalopathy in males . Recently, few MECP2 mutations were reported in males with non  specific mental retardation suggesting that defects in MECP2 are  responsible for about 2% of X linked mental retardation. To assess the frequency of MECP2 mutations, we screened, by  DHPLC, the coding sequence and flanking regions of the MECP2  gene in a cohort of 262 mentally retarded males found negative for  fragile X syndrome. First results show one recurrent intronic polymorphism (IVS3  19delA) and a nucleotide variant P376S. None of these sequence  modifications were detected in 200 controls. Nevertheless, we  already identified the nucleotide variant P376S, in a girl presenting an  atypic Rett syndrome.

","The Fragile X syndrome is an X linked disorder and the most  common heritable form of mental retardation, and results from the  deficit or absence of the FMRP protein which is expressed mainly in  the brain and has been implicated in translational regulation. While the vast majority of mRNAs is restricted to the cell soma  of neuronal cells, a number of them are also transported into the  dendrites, where they are translated. Transport and translation of  specific mRNAs in extrasomal locations, plays an important role  in nerve cell development and synaptic plasticity. Here we show  by RT PCR that FMR1  mRNA that encodes FMRP is found in  synaptoneurosomes. Furthermore, by electron microscopy studies  we detected FMR1  mRNA in proximal and distal dendrites of the  hippocampus. To identify potential localisation signal on the mRNA, we started  by analysing the 3âUTR. We observed that the FMR1  sequence  contains several polyadenilation sites. DNA constructs were made  expressing EGFP fused to the entire 3âUTR or to shorter region and  transfected into mouse hippocampal neurons showing that alternative  poly(A) sites are responsible for producing FMR1 mRNA molecules  with different 3âUTRs differentially delivered into the cell. We have  investigated the function of the FMRP protein at the synapses by  analysing the translational efficiency of mRNAs in synaptosomal  preparations. We find that some dendritic mRNA (a CaMKII and Arc)  are translated very efficiently in FMR1 K.O. mice as compared to wild  type mice, whereas control RNA, (beta actin) is not affected showing  that FMRP inhibits the translation of target mRNAs.",2002
Differential gene expression in the fragile X  mouse model,P0745.,"Gantois , E. Reyniers, F.

However, despite intense research it is still unclear why absence of  the fragile X protein leads to the mental retardation, macroorchidism  and specific behaviour problems observed in fragile X patients. In an  attempt to unravel this mechanism, we performed gene expression  analysis by means of the differential display method using the fragile  X mouse model. In analogy to human patients, the fragile X knockout  mouse shows a learning deficit and macroorchidism. The expression  of approximately 95% of all genes in the hippocampus of control  mice and fragile X knockout mice was compared.

The Fragile X syndrome is the leading cause of inherited mental  retardation, affecting approximately one in 5000 individuals. In fragile  X cells carrying a full mutation , hypermethylation of the expanded  CGG repeat and of the upstream promoter leads to transcriptional  silencing of the FMR1 gene. Absence of the FMR1 protein results in  the phenotypic manifestation of the syndrome. We previously proved  that treatment with 5 azadeoxycytidine of fragile X cell lines results  in reactivation of the FMR1 gene restoring the production of the  specific mRNA and protein product. We now show that this treatment  causes demethylation of the FMR1 gene promoter. We employed  the bisulphite sequencing technique to detect the methylation status  of individual CpG sites in the entire promoter region upstream of the  CGG repeat. Lymphoblastoid cell lines of fragile X males with full  mutations of different sizes were tested before and after treatment  with 5 azadeoxycytidine at various time points. We observed that  individual clones are either completely demethylated or not, with few  relevant exceptions. We also investigated the extent of methylation  in the full mutation (CGG repeat) itself by Southern blot analysis  after digestion with methylation sensitive enzymes Fnu4HI and  McrBC and found that the CGG repeat remains at least partially  methylated in many clones with a demethylated promoter.

Skewed X inactivation has been  observed in several human disorders in which there is a deletion  or mutation on one of the X chromosomes. This skewing is thought  to be the result of selection against cells with growth disadvantage.  Previous research by Rousseau et al. and Taylor et al. revealed  a skewed X inactivation pattern for females with the Fragile X full  mutation. As part of a larger Genotype Phenotype research study, we analyzed  molecular data for 51 females with the full mutation and 43 females  with the premutation status for FXS, with an age range of 4 to 65  years. In contrast to females with the premutation, females with the  full mutation demonstrated skewed X inactivation with a tendency  toward a higher activation ratio or proportion of normal active X.  The median activation ratio for females with the full mutation was  significantly larger than that of premutation carriers. Also, linear  regression analysis revealed a significant positive relationship  between the activation ratio and age for females with the full  mutation, but not for females with the premutation.

The mutation observed is almost exclusively an  expanded (CGG) repeat in the first untranslated exon of the FMR1  gene. The repeat is polymorphic in length in the normal population  (6 to 55 repeats) and may be unstable. Two types of mutations  have been distinguished : premutation (up to 200 repeats) in the  phenotypically normal carriers or full mutation (over 200 repeats) in the affected patients. In the latter case FMR1 is abnormally  methylated and transcriptionally silent. Molecular diagnosis is based  on the determination of the number of trinucleotide repeats by either  Southern blot or fluorescent PCR. Transmission of the deleterious  chromosome can also be established by haplotype analysis with  flanking markers. We have searched for the CGG expansion in a family comprising four  siblings : two mentally retarded boys and their two sisters. Southern  blot analysis revealed a large repeat expansion in the two boys and  the oldest girl, whereas no expansion was observed in the youngest  girl. These results were confirmed by PCR. Indirect analysis with  three microsatellites (DXS548, FRAXAC1, FRAXAC2) allowed us  to identify the maternal fragile X chromosome which is carried by  the four children. In the youngest girl, the presence of this maternal  fragile X chromosome is inconsistent with the absence of expansion.

Using a positional cloning approach, we have recently  identified heterozygous loss of function mutations in the gene for  epsilon sarcoglycan (SGCE) in MDS families. Pedigree analysis  showed a marked difference in penetrance depending on the parental  origin of the disease allele. This indicates a maternal imprinting  mechanism, which has been demonstrated for the mouse orthologue. Bisulfite sequencing of the CpG rich SGCE promotor showed a  parent specific methylation pattern in lymphoblasts. A rare single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promotor region allowed us  to distinguish the parental alleles. The methylated strand showed  the maternal polymorphism, while the paternal wildtype allele was  unmethylated in all CpG dinucleotides examined. Expression studies showed that SGCE is only paternally expressed  in lymphoblasts. Due to the fact that MDS is a non degenerative central nervous  system disorder we also investigated the promotor methylation in  brain tissue. SNPs in the promotor region revealed that there is also  differential methylation in human brain, suggesting regulation of  expression in an allele specific manner. As imprinted genes are often located in clusters, we examined four  adjacent genes by expression analyses in maternal and paternal  UPD7 cDNA samples.

This  gene remains the only gene in the 15q11 q12 region found to play  a role in the pathogenesis of AS. All UBE3A mutations reported so  far were randomly distributed over the 2.6 kb major coding region  including exons 8 to 16. The detection rates are around 30 % in  non deletion/ non UPD/ non imprinting defect index cases, with an  incidence of UBE3A point mutations in total AS patients estimated  around 2 10 %. In this study, we investigated 33 patients from 25  families with a definite clinical diagnosis of AS and we evaluated 4  methods to establish a mutation screening strategy for the UBE3A   gene. Automated SSCP analysis was used to screen the UBE3A  gene for point mutations in all patients, in combination with direct  sequencing if mutation could not be detected. Since the majority of  UBE3A identified mutations are truncating mutations, we developed  the protein truncation test (PTT) as a possible alternative approach  to rapidly detect such inactivating alterations in this large gene. The  combination of the different techniques allowed us to identify 22  point mutations from 25 families (88%)which represents the highest  percentage of mutation reported so far in AS.",2002

RTS can result from mutations of the gene for CREBBP. This nuclear protein  controls chromatin structure (DNA accessibility) by acetylation of  histones, and therefore assists in the initiation of DNA transcription.  We report on 10 unrelated subjects, nine with RTS and one with  a phenotype of possibly very mild RTS. Mutation analysis was  performed using FISH and genomic sequencing. We identified five  novel mutations (86del148nt, 1108C T, IVS4+1G A, IVS7+1G A,  3524A G), two gross deletions of the CREBBP gene and two single  nucleotide coding polymorphisms. The 1108C T stop mutation was  observed twice suggesting a mutational hotspot. The proband with  the mild variant was very interesting. She presented a missense  mutation (3524A G) predicting a tyrosine to cysteine exchange  (Y1175C) within a fully conserved (man vs. mouse) 79 aa segment of  the protein domain that elsewhere was shown to confer the histone  acetyltransferase activity.

We report the  use of molecular tools to thoroughly analyse the CREBBP gene in a  cohort of 65 patients. These include cDNA probes to search for gross  rearrangements by Southern blot analysis and to identify mRNA of  abnormal size by Northern blot, intragenic microsatellite markers to  look for intragenic deletions, as well as a complete set of primers to  amplify each of the 31 exons of the gene for mutation search by direct  sequencing.

Expression pattern of the RSK2  or Coffin Lowry  syndrome gene during murine development,P0760.,"Vogel , B. Fischer, H. Hameister, H. Kehrer Sawatzki","Department of Human Genetics, University of Ulm, Germany","Mutations in the RSK2 gene on Xp22.2 are causing Coffin Lowry  syndrome, which is characterized by severe psychomotor retardation,  facial and digital dysmorphism, and progressive skeletal deformations  affecting mostly the vertebral column. About 50 60% of the mutations  identified so far lead to premature translation termination and are  predicted to cause loss of function alleles. Some missense mutations  are associated with milder phenotypes. In one family, the R383W  mutation is causing non syndromic X linked mental retardation  without other symptoms. RSK2 is a member of the 90kDa ribosomal  S6 serine/threonine kinase family acting at the distal end of the Ras  signalling cascade. After activation by MAPKs, RSK2 translocates  to the nucleus and regulates gene expression by phosphorylation  of transcription factors such as CREB. RSK2 knock out mice are  10% smaller compared to wildtype littermates. Additionally, RSK2  KO mice have impaired learning and poor coordination, suggesting Posters   Molecular Basis of Development 234 235 that RSK2 seems to have similar roles in mental functioning both  in mice and humans. To investigate the spatio temporal expression  spectrum of RSK2 during mouse development, we performed RNA  in situ hybridization. In early embryonic development (ED 9.5 10.5)  high RSK2 expression was observed exclusively in somites and  lateral plate mesoderm from which among other tissues the vertebral  column develops. At later embryonic stages (ED 12.5 14.5) enhanced  RSK2 mRNA levels are detected in the peripheral nervous system  (dorsal root ganglia) and in sensory ganglia of the cranial nerves.

","Chiari complex is the most frequent pathology among hindbrain  malformations, characterized by caudal cerebellar herniation,  sometimes associated with lower brain stem dysmorphism, skull  bases and vertebral anomalies. In vertebrates hindbrain, generation  of regional diversity is achieved through a segmentation process that,  during primary neurulation, leads to the formation of 7 metameric  units, called rhombomeres. In this process, Hox genes display a  key role in controlling and regulating neuronal migration and in  mainteining cellular segmental identity. Among labial hortologous,  Hoxb 1 gene is the first one to be activated in CNS and the only  one to show an expression domain restricted to rhombomere 4  and in the neural crest cells that from r4 migrate in the second  branchial arch. We performed the mutational screening of the  homologous HOX B1 gene in 49 patients and 103 control individuals.

Overexpression of  this gene at early stages of development in Xenopus and in chicken  embryos determines a ventralization of the retina, thus suggesting  its role in the molecular pathway underlying eye development.  We have generated and characterized a mouse with a targeted  null mutation of the Vax2 gene. Vax2 homozygous mutant mice  display incomplete closure of the optic fissure that leads to eye  coloboma.

A single adenine insertion in exon 4 disrupts the DE loop and  E helix at the carboxy terminal end of the subunit and leads to  brain iron accumulation and a variable clinical phenotype that can  mimic Huntingtonâs disease, parkinsonism and dystonia. Several  cases have now been recognised in the UK and share a common  haplotype.

We show that this  family shares the closest marker in the disease haplotype found in  north England. Genealogical research has linked some of the English  families to the 18th century Coulthard family of North Cumbria. The  surname has been traced to a Norman extraction based on the town  of Coudehard raising the possibility of a much more ancient origin for  the mutation.

Most cases are inherited in an X linked  recessive manner and present mutations in the V2 vasopressin  receptor ( AVPR2 ) gene. A few cases are autosomal recessive, due  to mutations in the AVP sensitive water channel gene, aquaporin 2  (AQP2 ). A female index case presented with an average fluid intake of  12L/day. An additional four male subjects were affected, presenting  an inheritance suggestive of an X linked disorder. Clinical and  biochemical analysis of the index case showed incomplete responses  to the water deprivation and vasopressin loading tests. Partial  hemodynamic and coagulation responses to the synthetic V2 specifi c  agonist dDAVP were observed. Genetic analysis was performed by  PCR amplification of the coding regions and exon/intron boundaries  of the AVPR2  gene, followed by automated DNA sequencing. A 493GâC transversion in exon 2 was observed, leading to the  substitution of an alanine by a proline at codon 165.

Recently, a gene  responsible for Noonan syndrome in some families has been cloned.  Missense mutations in PTPN11 , the gene encoding the non receptor  protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP 2, is responsible for at least 50%  of the Noonan syndrome cases.

The  prevalence of inherited LQTS is estimated as 1:10 000. Mutations  of five ion channel genes (KCNQ1, HERG, KCNE1, KCNE2 or  SCN5A) may cause LQTS. We have identified two founder mutations  (KCNQ1 Fin and HERG Fin) that together account for 35 40% of  LQTS cases in the genetically isolated Finnish population. This study was conducted to approximate the prevalence of inherited  LQTS in the Finns and, in particular, to screen for mutations  of SCN5A among LQTS probands. The causal mutation was  documented in 86/236 (36%) families studied, and 631 mutation  carriers were identified corresponding to a population prevalence  of 1:8000 (Table 1). Case detection rate suggests that the actual  prevalence is at least 1:5000. Simple PCR assays for the KCNQ1  Fin and HERG Fin mutations alone detect 35% of cases. Samples  from 150 LQTS probands without prior mutation detection were  screened for SCN5A mutations. One amino acid change (G5851T  corresponding to V1951L) and two silent polymorphisms (G4218A  and C5457T) were detected. In conclusion, DNA analyses show great promise in establishment  of the LQTS diagnosis and may identify variants showing a disease  modifying role.

In the cases of a  specific DGGE pattern was recognized, mutations were identified by  direct fluorescent automated sequencing or by restriction enzyme  digestion analysis. 19 different PAH gene mutations were identified  on 173 PKU chromosomes (95%). The most common ones were  R408W (73.6% chromosomes) and R158Q (6.6% chromosomes)  whereas the remaining mutations appeared to be rare (relative  frequencies were from 0.55% to 2.2%.). In 11 PKU chromosomes  for 9 patients repeated DGGE scanning of the whole coding region  of the PAH gene and sequencing exons if specific pattern was  recognized revealed no mutations.

In contrast  with other CAH, this disease is not caused by a defect in the enzyme  (P450scc), but in the Steroidogenic Acute regulatory protein (StAR),  implicated in the transport of cholesterol from the outer to the inner  mitochondrial membrane where P450scc is localized. Almost all  lipoid CAH patients (41/42) who are not of Caucasian origin are  homozygous or compound heterozygous for mutations of the StAR  gene.

This study shows that mutations of the StAR gene are responsible for  lipoid CAH in only 60% of patients of Caucasian origin. Compound  heterozygous mutations of the CYP11A gene can also be responsible  if residual P450scc enzymatic activity produces enough progesterone  to avoid spontaneous abortion.

This phenotype occurs almost exclusively in  males. We follow a girl who presents gouty arthritis of big toe and  hyperuricaemia from the age of 9 years. Normal activity of phosphorib osylpyrophosphate synthetase, loss of HPRT activity, raised adenine  phosphoribosyltransferase activity and raised nicotinamide adenine  dinucleotide concentration in erythrocytes revealed partial HPRT  deficiency. The loss of HPRT activity was found also in the patientâs  father, who presented with renal colics and gout since the age of 18  years. The sister of our female patient is asymptomatic and her HPRT  activity is within normal limits. Mutation analysis revealed that both sisters inherited from their father  a previously described mutation in the 3rd exon of HPRT gene,  c.158T>C (V53A). X inactivation study performed in peripheral blood  leukocytes showed that the X inactivation is highly skewed in both  sisters leaving the paternal mutated chromosome predominantly  active in the symptomatic girl, while the second asymptomatic girl has  almost exclusively active maternal non affected chromosome. Conclusions: 1. The unusual description of phenotype shows a possibility of presence of partial HPRT deficiency in girls with  unexplained hyperuriceamia. 2. Results of biochemical tests performed in heterozygotes may fail  because of X inactivation status. Mutation analysis is necessary for a  reliable identification of carriers of mutated gene.

However, recent studies using microinjected sperm  into mouse oocytes support the hypothesis that sperm mitochondria  are targeted for destruction by nuclear encoded proteins, but the  underlying mechanism remains a mystery. In this report we show for  the first time that paternally derived mtDNA can indeed survive and  contribute substantially to the mtDNA pool in man.

The mtDNA  haplotype in muscle was identical to the haplotype found in the  father, while that of blood was identical to the mtDNA haplotype in  the mother.

Examination of balanced  translocations is an alternative approach to identify genes involved in  microcephaly. We report on a 12 year old girl with prenatal onset of  microcephaly, a severe developmental delay including speech defect  and seizures. Structural brain malformations were excluded by MRI.  Chromosome analysis revealed an apparently balanced translocation  t(2;21)(q22;q22). Molecular cytogenetic techniques were used to fi nd  breakpoint spanning clones. Subsequent breakpoint analysis showed  that the chromosome rearrangement led to disruption of the DYRK1A   gene. Semiquantitative RT PCR experiments revealed a 50%  reduction of DYRK1A expression in the patientâs lymphoblastoid cell  line compared to a control cell line. The chromosome 2 breakpoint  maps within the putative tumor suppressor LRP1B, a member of the  low density lipoprotein receptor family. Dyrk related kinases belong to a new family of protein kinases that  have been suggested to be involved in the regulation of cellular  growth and development. The Drosophila homolog minibrain (mnb)  is required for normal postembryonic neurogenesis and mutations  in this gene lead to size reduction of the brain. We could show that  haploinsufficiency of DYRK1A is associated with microcephaly. This  is supported by the finding of microcephaly as a main feature in  patients with monosomy 21q22.

Surprisingly, mutations in the nuclear envelope proteins  lead to muscular dystrophy. The pathological mutations in that case  are mainly missense, which are most informative for understanding  mechanisms of mutagenesis. We analysed 27 missense substitutions of the lamin A/C gene,  regarding their possible origin. Transitions account for 59.3% versus  transversions 40.7%. Nine transitions (33.3%) in CpG islands could  be explained by methylation mediated deamination. We analysed  the mutability at dinucleotide level. As expected the CG dinucleotide  was most frequently affected. Single base mutability was assessed  on non CpG mutations and the obtained order was: G=C>T>A.  Other mechanisms of mutagenesis (e.g. slipped mispairing during  replication) may require specific flanking sequences (arrest sites for  polymerase a, direct repeats, palindromes and symmetric elements).  We analysed 15 nucleotides upstream and downstream the mutation.  Slipped mispairing hypothesis is applicable in 37% of the cases. The  arrest site for polymerase a was associated with 25.9% of mutations.  Direct repeats, palindromes and/or symmetric elements were almost  invariably present in all the analysed areas.

Two other FGA donor  splice mutations, in intron 1 (IVS1+3A>G) and in intron 3 (IVS3+1_ +4delGTAA) were identified in afibrinogenemia patients. Because  it was impossible to directly study the effect of these mutations on  mRNA splicing in patient hepatocytes we designed a transfected cell  approach. For the common IVS4 mutation, multiple cryptic donor  splice sites in exon 4 and intron 4 were found to be utilised. One  of these, situated 4 bp downstream of the normal site was used in  85% of transcripts resulting in a 4 bp insertion frameshift leading  to premature truncation of FGA. Analysis of the IVS1+3 mutation  showed intron 1 inclusion in the majority of transcripts, while the  IVS3delGTAA mutation caused exon 3 skipping. The different  outcomes of these donor splice mutations appear to follow the model  proposed by Byers et al.(EJHG 2001, vol 9 suppl 1 p.80) in a study  of fibrillar collagen genes, where donor splice mutations occurring  in a rapidly spliced intron with respect to upstream introns lead  preferentially to exon skipping, while mutations in later spliced introns  lead to intron inclusion or cryptic splice site utilisation.

","Autism is a relatively common primary developmental disorder, with a  significant genetic component. Routine investigations for the cause of  autism, including chromosome and fragile X analysis, almost always  are normal. There is a polygenic component to autism, and large sib  pair studies have been carried out by a number of groups worldwide.  Several groups have identified associations between autism and  a wide area of chromosome 2q, flanked by markers D2S364 and  D2S2188 (Buxbaum et al & the IMGSAC respectively) which shows  the strongest evidence for linkage. These results strongly suggest a  predisposing gene(s) to autism within the 2q region. We have recently identified a patient with high functioning autism,  who has a small but cytogenetically visible de novo deletion of  chromosome 2q32 which falls within these linkage findings. This  would appear to be the smallest known deletion of this part of  chromosome 2, suggesting that the deletion includes a predisposing  gene(s) for autism. Fine mapping of the deleted region was carried out using markers  from 2q32, to map the exact size of the deleted region. This  reduces the very large linkage region by >75% to approximately 8.7  megabases. The region contains approximately 16 known genes and  16 ESTs, a number of which are potential candidates for autism. We present results of a wider study for the presence of  submicroscopic microdeletions, and of candidate genes,  incorporating both linkage disequilibrium and mutational screening  approaches in a panel of 77 Irish families with autism within the  mapped region.

All variants of DEB have been  associated to mutations in type VII collagen gene (COL7A1). More  than 200 mutations, often specific to individual families, have been  disclosed in this gene and some of them have been shown to be  characteristic of certain ethnic populations. We report the survey of COL7A1 mutations in Italian DEB patients.  From the analysis of 51 DEB families 42 mutations were identified, 18  of which are novel. Genotype phenotype correlations were in line with  the general rules already drawn in DEB. In the characterised families,  we performed 70 analyses of the carriers of mutations and 3 prenatal  diagnoses. Six frequent mutations were identified in Italian RDEB patients,  i.e. the 497insA, the 4783 1GâA, the 7344GâA, the 425AâG,  the G1664A, and the 8441 14del 21. While the 7344GâA and the  425AâG mutations have been found in different populations, the  remaining have been identified prevalently or only in Italian patients.  The haplotype analysis, together with the common geographic origin  of the patients carrying the frequent Italian COL7A1 mutations,  has evidenced an ancestral common origin of the mutated alleles.  Altogether the 6 frequent mutations cover about 43% of RDEB alleles  in Italian patients and therefore they should be screened firstly in the  patients not yet characterised at molecular level.",2002

The inheritance is autosomal  dominant but modified by genomic imprinting. Additional endocrine  abnormalities, known as pseudohypoparathyroidism (PHP1a), are  associated with mutations of the maternal but not the paternally  derived GNAS1 allele. The AHO phenotype is heterogeneous and  the diagnosis is difficult to confirm in the absence of PHPIa without  access to GNAS1 mutation screening. GNAS1 lies within a complex imprinting cluster at chromosome  20q13. It comprises 13 exons spanning 20kb and encodes the 394  amino acid alpha subunit of the adenylyl cyclase stimulatory protein,  Gs. We have screened over 80 patients with features of AHO for GNAS1  mutations using DHPLC for exons 2 13, and sequencing for exon  1. To date we have identified fourteen mutations spread throughout  the gene and two novel exonic variants, V36V and S54G which are  likely to be polymorphic. In addition, we have identified a small GCC  expansion in the 5âUTR of an affected patient, a common intronic  deletion polymorphism close to a splice site, and five further intronic  variants.

However, as there  are almost a hundred sequence alterations identified so far, and their  geographic distribution differs a lot, there is great interest for a rapid  and easy method of identifying other mutations. Here we present  easy screening techniques for the 3 recurrent GJB2 mutations in the  Greek population, besides the 35delG. These mutations, K224Q,  W24X and L90P, were originally identified by DGGE and/or direct  genomic sequencing of the coding region.

In the present  study, we report the identification of a novel SCN5A  missense  mutation causing either Brugada syndrome or ICCD in the same  pedigree. In a large French family, we identified a G to A mutation at  position 4372 that was predicted to change a glycine for an arginine  (G1408R) between the DIII S5 and DIII S6 domains of the sodium  channel protein. Among 45 family members, 13 were carrying the  G1408R mutation.

One patient with ICCD had episodes of syncope and  required a pacemaker implantation. Expression study of the G1408R  mutated SCN5A  showed no detectable Na+ current but a normal  protein trafficking. We conclude that the same mutation in the SCN5A   gene can lead either to Brugada syndrome or to ICCD.

In approximately 50% of the patients with severe HA (fVIII  level<1%), the disease is caused by fVIII gene intron 22 (IVS22)  inversions, generally occuring as a result of an intrachromosomal  recombination between the F8A gene located in IVS22 and one of  its two extragenic homologous copies located telomeric from the  fVIII gene.

We found known, altered inversion  patterns in 54 (53%) cases: 38 (70%) distal, 12 (22%) proximal  types and 4 (8%) unusual patterns. We observed loss or exclusively  altered intronic bands in two cases of the latter group.

The late onset form is often  so mild that it may be undiagnosed in affected individuals (cryptic  CAH). Symptoms of classical CAH ranges from simple virilisation to  a potentially life threatening inability to retain salt. There is a strong  demand for prenatal diagnosis from couples who have already had  an affected child. Prenatal diagnosis is usually carried out by linkage  analysis with microsatellite markers closely flanking the functional  21 hydroxylase (CYP21) gene. Couples may opt for an in utero  treatment regime for affected female pregnancies. The majority of the mutations causing 21 hydroxylase deficiency  are known but testing for them is complicated by the complex  arrangement of the genes responsible. We currently carry out testing  for large scale deletions/conversions of the CYP21 gene by Southern  blot analysis. We also screen for a common form of deletion and  eight other mutations using direct ARMS tests. The CYP21 genes of  affected individuals with one or more mutations undetected following  these tests are sequenced in four overlapping fragments. This strategy has identified both mutations in approximately 95%  of >400 families tested and enabled us to assess the frequency of  each mutation in British patients with 21 hydroxylase deficiency.  In addition, this study has highlighted a number of interesting  cases where for example there is evidence of mosaicism, de novo   mutational events and parents with cryptic CAH. These observations  indicate the need for mutation screening prior to prenatal diagnosis  by linkage analysis wherever possible.",2002

In the present study, we have performed a D HPLC scanning of the  HFE coding region in twenty HC probands from Brittany to define if  they carry uncommon mutations liable to explain their iron overload  phenotype. Material : The 20 HC probands were selected because  a transferrin saturation above the threshold (Â³ 60% in men Â³ 50% in  women) in absence of others known cause of iron overload. Results  : D HPLC scanning had allowed us to detect a novel missense  mutation in exon 4 of the HFE gene from one proband who was  also C282Y heterozygous. Subsequent sequencing analysis  identified an adenine to cytosine transversion at position 848 which  changes amino acid 283 from glutamine to proline (Q283). Another  family member (sister) was also found C282Y/Q283P compound  heterozygote , presenting with a transferrin saturation level of 74%.  Theoritical structural analysis shows that folding of HFE is blocked  by a proline in position 283 which cannot complete the H bonding  network and could have a deleterious effect on the key disulphide  bridge in the a3 domain. Conclusion : With the description of ten  other rare or private causative mutations, our study confirms that it  may be of particular interest to perform a complete analysis of the  HFE coding region in HC probands with at least one chromosome  lacking the C282Y, H63D and S65C mutations.",2002
Fabry disease: Exclusion of D313Y as a disease  causing mutation of the alpha Galactosidase A (GLA)  gene.,P0806.,"Neumann , A. Eigel, M. Herrmann, N. Bogdanova, J. Horst","Institut fÃ¼r Humangenetik, Westf","Wilhelms UniversitÃ¤t, MÃ¼nster,  Germany. Fabry disease is a X linked recessive metabolic disorder caused by  mutations in the alpha Galactosidase A (GLA) gene. The identification  of the disease causing mutation in a given Fabry family permits  precise genetic counselling, heterozygote detection of female family  members and prenatal diagnosis. We present a large pedigree of a German Fabry family with mutation  analysis in more than thirteen individuals. All affected males had  died. Mutation analysis in a putative female carrier (suspected by  biochemical GLA measuring) showed the sequence variant D313Y of  the GLA gene. D313Y was previously described as a disease causing  mutation by Eng et al. in 1993. In a prenatal diagnosis (CVS) of a  male pregnancy we detected the D313Y sequence variant. In order to  confirm our results, we performed a biochemical GLA measurement.  Unexpectedly the CVS cells showed an alpha Galactosidase A  activity in the normal range. Molecular genetic investigations in further family members (i)  identified the D313Y variant in a healthy 49 year old male and (ii)  excluded this sequence variant in an obligate female carrier, whose  DNA became meanwhile avaible for genetic analysis. Genomic DNA  sequencing in this individual revealed the nonsense mutation W348X  in exon 7 of the GLA gene. Pedigree analysis confirmed that W348X,  as distinct from D313Y, cosegregates with the disease in the family. Our results show that the D313Y sequence variant of the GLA gene is  an amino acid substitution, whose influence  if at all  on the severity  of the Fabry phenotype remains to be clarified.",2002

LHON  associated mtDNA mutations have been found in LHON patients  from around the world, but the Iranian LHON population has not  been studied. METHODS: 23 Iranian patients were defined clinically  as having LHON on the basis of painless, subacute, bilateral optic  neuropathy and the exclusion of other causes of subacute optic  neuropathy. MtDNA was extracted from blood of the probands and healthy members of their families and assayed for a panel of primary  LHON associated mtDNA mutations by polymerase chain reaction  (PCR) based methods. We studied four well known LHON associated  primary mutations (at nucleotide positions 11778, 3460, 14484, and  14459) in all 23 probands. RESULTS: Among the 23 probands tested  for four common LHON mutations, 3 carried the 11778 mutation, 1  carried the 14459 mutation, 1 carried the 3460 mutation and no one  carried the 14484 mutation. The phenotype of female of members of  family who carried 11778 mutation showed the normal variant even  they had the same level of this mutation. Beside one patient who  carried 3460 mutation all of our patients were male. We could not find  any new point mutation in ND6 gene of other patient even this gene  is hot spot for LHON.

At the protein level, the frameshift mutation results in the removal of  5 of the 6 critical cysteine residues in the C propeptide, necessary  for the incorporation of the chain in collagen type I molecules. The  mild phenotype of this patient suggests that this latter protein defect  is predominant and causes haploinsufficiency. Further biochemical  characterization will be performed.",2002
A novel mutation in the SDHD gene in a family  with inherited paragangliomas,P0823.,"Renard1, C. Godfraind2, L. Boon3, M.

They may be unilateral,  although with inherited predisposition, they tend to be bilateral. It  has been observed that paragangliomas are often inherited via  the paternal line; thus maternal imprinting occurs. This helped in  finding linkage to 11q23 qter (Heutink et al. 1992), which led to the  identification of a mutated gene, SDHD, which encodes the small  subunit of cytochrome b in the succinate ubiquinone oxidoreductase  complex (PGL1) (Baysal et al. 2000). This enzyme complex,  constituted from SDHA, B, C and D, is important for the tricarboxylic  acid cycle and the aerobic respiratory chains. Thus, loss of SDHD  may lead to chronic hypoxic stimulation of cellular proliferation that  leads to tumorous growth. Mutations in the SDHB and C genes  (PGL3 and PGL4) have also been identified, but in families with non  imprinted inheritance of paragangliomas (Niemann, and Muller, 2000;  Astuti et al., 2001). Interestingly, another PGL locus was mapped  more telomerically on 11q (PGL2). We report a family with three generations affected with  paragangliomas. Generation skipping of phenotype was noted once,  when the disorder seemed to be inherited from the mother. Thus, the  SDHD gene became the most likely candidate. In fact, we identified  a novel splice site mutation that co segregated with the phenotype.  Interestingly, six non affected carriers were observed, all of which  had inherited the mutant allele from their mother. The identification  of carriers enables genetic counseling, an important aspect for these  usually treatable vascular tumors. (vikkula@bchm.ucl.ac.be)",2002

Many actors in  this transmission pathway have been identified by genetic studies  in Drosophila  ; their homologues in man are candidate genes for  dysmorphic syndromes. In humans, Sonic Hedgehog  is mutated in Holoprosencephaly,  Patched  in Gorlin syndrome, and GLI 3 , the homologue of the  Cubitus interruptus  gene in Drosophila , is implicated in Greig  syndrome and in Pallister Hall syndrome. Its co activator, the  transcription factor CBP is mutated in Rubinstein Taybi syndrome.  Finally, one of the target genes of SHH , Pitx2 , is responsible for  Rieger syndrome. We have implemented genetic diagnosis of Gorlin syndrome (OMIM  180500), of Greig (OMIM 175700) and Pallister Hall syndromes  and also of Rieger syndrome (OMIM 180500).This work allowed  us to consider phenotype genotype relationships of these different  hereditary diseases. We identified 9 novel mutations of the Patched   gene, 4 novel mutations of the Gli3 gene and one new mutation of the  Pitx2  gene. While a correlation exists between the mutation spectrum  and Greig and Pallister Hall syndromes, no correlation is found in  Gorlin syndrome. Finally, the Reiger syndrome is characterized by  major genetic heterogeneity. Clinical data and molecular results are  discussed in the light of our understanding and knowledge of the  Hedgehog signaling pathway in vertebrates.",2002

","Mutations in the GJB2 gene have been found in a great number of Posters   Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 248 249 familial and sporadic cases of congenital deafness. This gene is  responsible for more than 20% of prelingual recessive hearing loss  in Caucasian populations, mainly due to mutations 35delG, and  167delT. Furthermore, the involvement of GJB2 gene in autosomal  dominant deafness is also proposed but remains uncertain. One of  the more controversial allele variants, M34T, has been hypothesized  to cause as well an autosomal recessive, as a dominant  nonsyndromic hearing loss, and even a null allele in the GJB2 gene.  Recently, studies extending the analysis of the genetic background in  the allele with the M34T mutation have identified a 10bp deletion (  493del10) in the non coding region upstream of exon 1. In this study ,  we present a family with three sibships compound heterozygotes  M34T/V95M with different degrees of hearing impairment. The  proband has a mild hearing loss. His sister and his brother have a  moderate hearing loss but presenting different audiometric data.  Moreover, his mother has normal hearing but his father who is  heterozygous for M34T mutation has a mild hearing loss. The  effect of M34T mutation remains to be deciphered, and certainly its  interpretation becomes more difficult in terms of genetic counseling.

","X linked retinitis pigmentosa (XLRP) is regarded as being the  most severe form of RP because of its early onset and its rapid  progression, which leads to legal blindness before the age of 25. Four  XLRP loci have been demonstrated (RP2, RP3, RP23 and RP24),  but only two genes have been cloned so far (RP2 and RPGR). The  RP2 locus accounts for 20% of the XLRP forms and the RP3 locus  (RPGR) is the most prevalent with 70 80% of cases. The other two  loci are very rare. Haplotype and linkage analyses were carried out in twelve Spanish  XLRP families. Six dinucleotide repeat microsatellite markers and one RFLP spanning the RP2 RP3 region, plus an additional  microsatellite strongly linked to RP24 were used. An ABI PRISM 310  Genetic Analyzer ( Applied Biosystems ) was the tool of choice for the  genotyping process. After haplotype analysis we could rule out RP24 in 7 families, RP2  in 1 family and RP3 in another family. We found no informative  meioses for RP24 in 5 families and for RP2/RP3 in the vast majority  of cases. Excluding obligate carriers, we found 14 female carriers of  the disease, 12 non carriers and 5 non informative females, out of 31  women at risk of being carriers. In conclusion, this seems not to be an informative method of  distinguishing between the main XLRP loci, but it is worth doing  because it permits a rapid and effective early detection of carriers,  which is of paramount importance for genetic counselling.",2002

PCR products of these cDNAs were arrayed onto nylon filters and  hybridised with radioactively labelled cDNAs from patients fibroblasts  and age matched controls.

Andersen syndrome is a condition in which cardiac  arrythmias (long QT) and periodic paralysis are associated, thus  representing a powerful tool to identify possible common pathways. A de novo reciprocal translocation t(4;12)(q26;p12) was detected in  one patient with Andersen syndrome. Both parents were unaffected.  Several long QT syndromes (LQT) have been defined. The LQT4  gene maps to 4q25 q27 ; the critical region extends over 18 cM and  the gene remains unknown. Colocalization of the 4q26 breakpoint  with the LQT4 region suggested that both syndromes could be  sustained by the same gene.

All  clones are situated within a gap of the human genome sequence KCNJ2 (chr.17) was identified as one Andersen syndrome gene while  this analysis was underway.

The  translocation bored by the patient could alter the LQT4 gene, which  in turn would generally act as a modifier gene in Andersen syndrome.  Consistent with this latter hypothesis is the fact that the LQT4 locus  could contribute the QT interval variability (Busjahn et al, 1999).",2002

Most of the point mutations result in the introduction  of premature termination codons (PTC). To establish a genotype  phenotype correlation in GLI3  associated morphopathies a functional  role has been invoked for different truncated protein products. To test if GLI3 mRNA molecules with truncating mutations in different  positions are retained for translation we determined the amount  of mutant GLI3 mRNA relative to the wild type transcript in patient  derived fibroblasts lines using the ARMS ( Amplification Refractive  Mutation System) test and differential restriction following RT PCR.  Transcripts with PTCs at position 309 or 366 of the cDNA were  present at lower levels (20 40%) compared with the allelic wild type  transcript. In contrast, transcripts with a PTC located in the last GLI3   exon or carrying a silent amino acid exchange were present at equal  levels compared with their wild type counterparts. These data are  in line with previous observations that only transcripts with PTCs  upstream of the last intron exon junction undergo nonsense mediated  mRNA decay (NMD). Haploinsufficiency due to NMD might occur in the 56% of GLI3  PTC  mutations located in the first 14 exons associated with all types of  GLI3  morphopathies, including PHS. Different mechanisms, like  protein instability or functional haploinsufficiency must be invoked for  PTC mutations in the last GLI3  exon that accounts for about half of  the coding capacity of the full length GLI3 protein.",2002

No sequence changes  resulting in an amino acid substitution or a splice site mutation were  found in affected persons. Several intronic polymorphisms, revealed  also in normal donors, were found in this family, including CMT  patients. This fact allows us to exclude the deletion of the whole  KIF1B gene as a cause of CMT in this family. We propose two hypotheses to explain the present situation: (1) In  this family the disease is caused by deletion of a whole exon or by  mutations in the noncoding part of the KIF1B gene, which could not  be revealed by sequencing. (2) There might be another gene in the  1p36 chromosomal region the mutation of which is responsible for the  axonal type of CMT2A neuropathy.",2002

Background: Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH) is a rapid  progressive disease with remodeling of the small pulmonary arteries  which occurs at any age. In the families with autosomal dominant  inherited PPH of adults mutations of the bone morphogenic protein  receptor 2 (BMPR2) gene have been identified. The genetic cause of  PPH in children who are often severely affected remains unknown. Methods: We studied 42 relatives of 5 children with PPH, aged  8 to 32 months at diagnosis. PPH was confirmed by right heart  catheterisation in all patients. The pulmonary artery systolic pressure  (PASP) was estimated by Doppler echocardiography at rest and  during exercise in all family members. A screening of BMPR2 gene  was performed by SSCP and DHPLC. Linkage analysis was carried  out with markers of chromosome 2. Results: In all children but one both parents and relatives out of both  paternal and maternal branches showed abnormal pulmonary artery  pressure responses during exercise. None of the children or their  relatives showed mutations of the BMPR2 or Alk1 gene. We found no  linkage to chromosome 2q31 33 in all families. Conclusion: PPH in the 5 children and their families appeared to be  transmitted by an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance without  evidence of BMPR2 mutations. Therefore, we hypothesise that PPH  in children (IPPH) might be genetically different from PPH in adults.Posters   Molecular Basis of Mendelian Disorders 252 253",2002

In this island  of the Indian Ocean near Madagascar, the incidence of SW forms  was found higher (1:2141) by neonatal screening (1978 1988). We  have determined the molecular defects of the CYP21 genes in more  than thirty 21OHD. A new mutation with a high incidence (69% SW  chromosomes) was identified and carefully characterized. Southern  blotting studies have showed an unusual Taq 1 pattern suggesting  a reverse gene conversion CYP21P pseudogene to CYP21 gene  without deletion. Nevertheless using PCR methods associated with  the entire sequencing of the genes, this rearrangement did not result  in two normal CYP21 genes, but in two duplicated CYP21/CYP21P/ CYP21 hybrid genes. The presence of multiple mutations predicted  no 21 hydroxylase activity. As all patients homozygous for this  mutation have a SW form, a good relationship between genotype  and phenotype has been observed. This mutation was found in a  genetically homogeneous isolate called French small white, but  not in the other ethnic populations of this island (Asian, Indian,....).  The incidence of the other mutations was similar to this observed in  Caucasian populations. Reunion mutation seems to originate from a  single common ancestor who was among the settlers of the island.  In our large French population (1732 classic CAH chromosomes),  each time that this mutation has been detected, the patients were  from Reunion Island.

CAA transport is mediated by y+L system, which is exerted by a  heterodimer consisting of the 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc) and SLC7A7  (4F2hc/SLC7A7). We have identified 16 causative mutations of the  SLC7A7 gene in LPI patients, originating from Italy, Tunisia, Greek,  Algeria, Pakistan and Japan. We examined nine of these mutations  (M1L, M50K, F152L, T188I, S386R, W242X, Y457X, 346delGGA,  and 1425delTTCT) to assess the arginine transport function by  co injection of each SLC7A7 mutant with 4F2hc cRNA in X. laevis  oocytes. Eight mutations (M1L, M50K, T188I, S386R, W242X,  Y457X, 346delGGA and 1425delTTCT) abolish the arginine transport  as compared with the âwild typeâ control (4F2hc/SLC7A7). Another  mutation, F152L, reduces the arginine transport of about 10% only .  We then performed triple injections (cRNA ratio 1:0.5:0.5) of 4F2hc/ F152L+346delGGA, 4F2hc/wt SLC7A7+346delGGA, and 4F2hc/wt  SLC7A7+F152L which resemble the genotypes of one patient and  his parents. The arginine uptake was abolished when the 4F2hc/ SLC7A7+346delGGA or the 4F2hc/F152L +346delGGA were injected  into the oocytes. We speculate that the 346delGGA mutation might  have a dominant negative effect. This correlates well with the severe  clinical LPI phenotype observed in the patient.

The complete loss of NF kB activation is lethal for males during  embryogenesis but females can survive, owing to mosaicism  as a result of X inactivation.

BBS has been considered historically an  autosomal recessive trait, on which premise six loci have been  mapped in the human genome. Nevertheless, mutational and  genetic analyses of the first three cloned BBS genes, BBS2 , BBS4   and BBS6  suggest that BBS may also exhibit a complex mode  of disease transmission, requiring at least three mutations in two  genes to manifest the phenotype (triallelic inheritance). In an ef fort  to elucidate the molecular basis of triallelism, we have reasoned that  either the different BBS proteins are part of the same multisubunit  protein complex, or that they operate in discrete yet complementary  pathways. Based on these hypotheses, we are conducting  coimmunoprecipitation and immunohistochemical studies to ascertain  the cellular localization and potential interaction between the three  known BBS proteins. We present data from coimmunoprecipitation  assays performed by transiently co transfecting HEK293 cells with  Myc  and HA tagged BBS proteins, that suggest that the three BBS  proteins do not interact directly. Furthermore, cellular localization  studies indicate that BBS2 and BBS4, but not BBS6, may be  localized in the same cellular compartments, suggesting that the  molecular basis of triallelism in BBS may be due to cellular rescue  by alternative pathways.

ClC 7 is a ubiquitously expressed chloride  channel that resides within late endosomes and lysosomes. Mice  deficient for ClC 7 show severe osteopetrosis that becomes apparent  shortly after birth and retinal degeneration. Although osteoclasts are  present in normal numbers, they fail to resorb bone because they  cannot acidify the extracellular resorption lacuna. In osteoclasts,  ClC 7 is highly expressed in the ruffled membrane that is formed  by the fusion of H+ ATPase containing vesicles and that secretes  protons into the lacuna. We conclude that ClC 7 provides the chloride  conductance required for an efficient proton pumping by the H+  ATPase of the osteoclast ruffled membrane. Comparison with the  mouse mutant osteosclerotic (oc), which lacks a subunit of the H+  ATPase, revealed that the retinal phenotype is not secondary to the  osteopetrosis but most likely a direct effect of the loss of ClC 7 on the  photoreceptors. As the murine phenotype closely resembles human infantile  malignant osteopetrosis, we also searched for mutations in the  human gene, CLCN7, in 23 patients suffering from this disease.

This child, who died before 1, was the first  offspring of a close consanguineous marriage (inbreeding coefficient,  F= 0.0703). The ascending genealogy of the proband shows that  her parents and one set of her great grand parents were both first  cousins. In addition, the extended genealogical analysis revealed  another consanguineous marriage (paternal probandâs uncle and  his wife) with a lower value of relationship (F= 0.0195), although  relevant in terms of genetic risk to offspring. No homozygous deletion  of SMN1  and NAIPt  genes were found in the proband, indicating  that she probably has a rare mutation. However, haplotype analysis  shows homoallelism for five closely linked polymorphic markers.  Considering the familiar consanguinity, the proband homoallelism  suggests identity by descent at SMA locus. The probandâs uncle and  his wife are both carriers for the same haplotype, thus each offspring  has a risk of 25% to be affected with SMA type I. In conclusion, this study shows that the extended genealogical  prenatal investigation and genetic counselling are very informative in  families carrying rare recessive genes.

When muscular tissue is  available, sequencing of cDNA is used to seek for mutations. 5 point  mutations, 1 deletion and 1 duplication were identified this way. If the biopsy is impossible, strategic choice becomes delicate. As the  gene is large, sequencing of all exons doesnât seem the appropriate  one at first. It is though the approach we chose for different reasons:  1) we have in our laboratory an old version of sequencer which is  not very suitable for screening techniques, 2) the patients being  hemizygotes, one sequence is sufficient to explore an exon.

However ,  molecular analysis often revealed a wide genetic heterogeneity.  Recently, new classifications based on the molecular defect, rather  than clinical presentation, have been proposed. Familial Hypertrophic Cardiomyopathy (FHC) is transmitted as  autosomal dominant trait with a prevalence of about 1/500. The  disease is characterised by a hypertrophied and non dilated left  ventricle. The clinical course of the disease is heterogeneous: some  patients remain asymptomatic, others die suddenly. Mutations  causing disease in ten cardiac contractile proteins have been  identified in FHC patients. Recently mutations on a non sarcomeric  protein gene have also been identified as responsible of FHC. Posters   Muscle Diseases258 259 Genotype phenotype correlation is crucial to the understanding of  the natural history of FHC and possibly to separate heterogeneous  clinical presentations into different diseases. Genetic definition  of FHC may also have to be reconsidered including the clinical  interpretation of possible recessive mutations, double heterozygous  mutations, and mutations on two genes in the same subject. We believe that it is crucial to perform the molecular characterisation  of patients on several loci. Due to the large number of genes  responsible for this disease, we have started a pilot study to organise  an Italian laboratory diagnostic network, and we look forward to join  other European laboratories working in the same field. Our activity has focused on search of mutations in MYH7, MYBPC3,  TPM1 and TNNT2 genes using the DHPLC technology and  automated sequencing. A total of 26 different mutations have been  identified. Specific cases will be reported in our presentation.",2002

Goal of this study is to develop a cell culture system in which  the SMN  gene expression can be varied using catalytic nucleic acids.  Catalytic nucleic acids are short sequences of RNA (ribozymes) or  DNA (DNAzymes) capable of sequence specific cleavage of a target  mRNA, thus downregulating gene expression. We designed three  ribozymes and three DNAzymes targeted against the murine Smn  RNA sequence.

Cleavage of target  RNA was observed at magnesium concentrations as low as 2 mM,  which corresponds to the intracellular Magnesium concentration of  mammalian cells. Cleavage increased in a time and concentration  dependent manner.

Iron binding properties of frataxin and its  homologues,P0889.,"Adinolfi1, S. Martin2, A. Pastore2","1National Institute of Medical, London, United Kingdom, 2National  Institute of Medical Research, London, United Kingdom","Friedreichâs ataxia (FRDA), an autosomal recessive cardio  and  neurodegenerative disease, is caused by low expression of frataxin: a  small mitochondrial protein, encoded into the nucleus. At biochemical  level the lack of frataxin leads to disregulation of mitochondrial  iron homeostasis and oxidative damage which eventually causes  neuronal death. Recently, it has been reported the Yfh1 (yeast  frataxin homologue) shows a ferritin like behaviour in vitro: the  protein was shown to form large aggregates able to sequester  iron form solution in the presence of an iron excess (1). No direct  iron binding was however shown for human frataxin under similar  conditions (2). We have carried out an exhaustive study on three  frataxin orthologues from E. coli, yeast and from human with the aim  of further testing the working hypothesis of a direct involvement of  frataxin in iron binding. Using these three proteins, selected as representatives of different  evolution steps, we have characterised their fold and thermodynamic  stability, compared their ion binding specificity and their tendencies  to aggregate. A number of mutants was produced to identify the  protein surface involved in these functions. Our work leads us to a  more complex and complete picture of the binding and aggregative  properties of frataxins. References 1) Adamec J, Rusnak F, Owen WG, Naylor S, Benson LM, Gacy  AM,Isaya G.

The gene responsible  for the most frequent form of autosomal dominant HSP (SPG4)  encodes spastin, an ATPase belonging to the AAA proteins family.  Interestingly, almost all the missense mutations found in HSP patients  fall into the AAA functional domain. The cellular pathways in which spastin operates and its role in Posters   Neurogenetics 262 263 causing degeneration of motor axons are still unclear. By expressing  wild type or ATPase defective spastin in several cell types, we  show that spastin interacts dynamically with microtubules. This  association is mediated by the N terminal region of the protein and  regulated through the ATPase activity of the AAA domain. Expression  of missense mutations falling into the AAA cassette leads to  constitutive binding to microtubules in transfected cells and induces  the disappearance of the aster and the formation of thick perinuclear  bundles, suggesting a role of spastin in microtubule dynamics.  Moreover, overexpression of wild type spastin seems to promote  microtubule disassembly in transfected cells. These data suggest that  the degeneration of corticospinal axons, in HSP patients, could be  due to impairment of fine regulation of the microtubule cytoskeleton. To better understand spastin localization, specific antibodies have  been produced and experiments to determine the endogenous  protein localization are in progress. Furthermore, a recombinant  spastin obtained with the baculovirus system will be used in  microtubule severing assay in order to confirm the hypothesized role  of spastin in microtubule disassembly.",2002

In order to study the pathogenesis of HSP due to lack  of paraplegin, we have generated a mouse model by inactivation of  the Spg7 gene. Paraplegin deficient mice are born at the expected  mendelian ratio, are viable, and fertile. At approximately 6 months  of age homozygous Spg7  /  animals start displaying an impaired  performance on the rotarod apparatus. Semithin sections of the  spinal cord of 7 months old animals show a variable number of  focal axonal swellings in the distal axons of the fasciculus gracilis  and of descending spinal tracts, consistent with a retrograde  axonopathy. This phenotype is slowly progressive, with signs of  axonal degeneration becoming prominent at 12 month of age. Mice  older than one year show additional phenotypes, such as axonal  swelling and degeneration in the optic and sciatic nerves, and muscle  abnormalities. Electron microscopy analysis of affected spinal cords  demonstrates that, long before degeneration, axons are filled with  mitochondria with abnormal morphology, indicating that mitochondrial  dysfunction is likely the cause for the disease. Swollen axons contain  accumulated organelles and neurofilaments, suggesting that axonal  degeneration may be due to impaired axonal transport.

Data from yeast and  patients indicate that frataxin defect causes a specific iron sulfur  protein deficiency and mitochondrial iron accumulation, suggesting  oxidative damage involvement. As complete absence of frataxin in mouse was lethal early in  development, we have chosen a conditional gene targeting approach,  to generate first a heart frataxin deficient line and a neuron/heart  frataxin deficient line. The heart line reproduces well the different  steps of the human cardiac defects, but the neuron/heart line  (generated to study the neurological defects) was very severe.  Indeed, the mutant mice showed a short life expectancy (25 days),  probably due to many additional lesions in brain and other tissues. To better reproduce the natural evolution of the neurological  symptoms, we have generated two inducible neuronal frataxin  deficient lines by using tamoxifen inducible recombinase. The  deletion of frataxin is induced at 4 weeks of age. In one line the  deletion occurs in the central and the peripheral nervous system and  the other line presents a deletion more specific of the cerebellum.

Moreover, in the  adult, there are two clinical variants, one in which motor signs are  predominant, the other in which psychiatric symptoms dominate, although secondarily the patients become bedridden and demented.  The evolution in the adult forms may be of several decades.

One family with nocturnal oro facio brachial seizures and centro  temporal epileptiform discharges associated with oral and speech  dyspraxia and cognitive impairment had been described (Scheffer et  al., 1995).

Epilepsy is of the rolandic type and language dysfunction  is of the same type as in the former family. Video EEG in the  youngest patient showed asynchrone biphasic spikes predominant  over the centro temporal regions increased by sleep. The five  subjects who performed neuropsychological testing showed a mental  delay with significantly lower verbal performances.

MPO is present at high levels  in circulating neutrophils and monocytes but is not detectable in  microglia in normal brain tissue . However, MPO presence has been  demonstraded in microglia associated with Alzheimerâs disease (AD)  plaques, suggesting that MPO gene expression may play a role in  neurodegenerative diseases involving macrophage microglia. One  portion of the gene thought to be involved in regulation of MPO  expression is the proximal 5â flanking region. The polymorphic G/A  nucleotide base shift, 463 bases upstream from the transcription start  site, negates the binding region for the general transcription factor  SP1, and results in reduced gene expression, which would imply  lower susceptibility to Alzheimerâs risk.

The age at onset ranges from 2 to 80 years, with a mean between  46.0 and 48.9 years and the number of repeats, in the causal  CAG repeat expansion, is inversely related to the age at onset and  accounts for 50 77% of the variation in age at onset. We analysed a Dutch cohort of 755 individuals retrospectively to  assess the probability of onset for any given CAG repeat. The repeat size is the major determinant of age at onset, with a  correlation of  0.74, stronger ( 0.84) in paternal than in maternal  inheritance ( 0.64), consistent with increased repeat expansion  and stronger anticipation in the paternal line. The age at onset  within families was more similar, than could be explained by the  resemblance of the repeat size of persons in the same family.

A CAG repeat expansion  in the IT15 gene on chromosome 4 accounts for 93% of typical HD  cases in our series. Recently, 2 new mutations were reported in HD  like (HDL) patients : a 192 nucleotide insertion in the PRPN gene  encoding the prion protein (HDL1) and a CTG/CAG repeat expansion  in the gene encoding Junctophilin 3 (HDL2). We analyzed 74 HD  patients without expansions in the IT15 and DRPLA genes for these  2 mutations. The 192 nucleotide insertion in the PRNP gene was  not detected in our series. The CAG/CTG repeat at the HDL2 locus  was polymorphic in the controls and ranged from 8 to 28 units with  a 62% heterozygosity rate. Only one Moroccan HD patient carried  50 uninterrupted CTG/CAG repeats at the HDL2 locus. This patient,  a 44 year old woman with no know family history, presents with a 2  years duration of mild choreic movements of the face and extremities  and sub cortical dementia. Enlargement of the anterior horn of  the lateral ventricles was observed on cerebral MRI suggesting  atrophy of the head of the caudate nucleus. Cortical atrophy was  marked. In conclusion, CTG/CAG repeat expansions at the HDL2  locus account for 0.2% of our series of HDL patients while the 192  nucleotide insertion in the PRNP gene was not found.

"Polyalanine accumulation and toxicity in a CAG  tract disorder, Machado Joseph Disease.",P0922.,"Toulouse , C. Gaspar, D. Rochefort, J. Roussel, G. A. Rouleau","McGill University Health Centre Research Institute, Montreal, PQ,  Canada","Machado Joseph disease (MJD) is part of a group of  neurodegenerative disorders caused by the expansion of a  polyglutamine coding CAG repeat. A pathological hallmark of  these disorders is the presence of intranuclear inclusions (INIs)  which are aggregates of insoluble proteins including the expanded  polyglutamine protein. The presence of such INIs in patient material  and cellular models has lead to a cellular toxicity model. Similar INIs  are found in oculo pharyngeal muscular dystrophy (OPMD), which is  caused by the short expansion of an alanine encoding GCG repeat.  The similarities between OPMD and the CAG tract disorders INIs led  us to hypothesize that frameshifting events leading to polyalanine  accumulation could contribute to the toxicity observed in CAG tract  disorders. We previously demonstrated that such events occur in  patient material and in a cellular model of MJD. Here we propose  a frameshifting mechanism for CAG tracts involving RNA structure  formation, similar to that previously implicated in retroviral organisms.  We also investigate the role of polyalanine accumulation in the  cellular toxicity observed in MJD.",2002

A mutation screening, by SSCP and DHPLC, of the CACNA1A gene,  still ongoing, was performed on 26 ataxia patients from different  families. So far 4 patients with a mutation of CACNA1A gene  were identified. Two families showed a CAGn expansion, and 2 a  previously undescribed point mutation: 1 missense and 1 deletion  in frame. In addition single nucleotide substitutions have been  detected in introns or in exons, without aminoacid change, possibly  affecting exon splicing enhancers sites. No mutations leading to  premature stop were so far identified. The clinical picture was that  of EA2 or of SCA6, showing once more the wide overlap between  the 2 disorders. The functional analysis of some of the above EA2  point mutations favors the hypothesis of a loss of channel function.  Overall the present and literature data suggest that ataxia causing  point mutations, different from those leading to truncated protein, are  relatively frequent and appear to be preferentially located in the III  protein domain, while missense mutations causing FHM appear to be  widely spread in all protein domains.

Ellerby2","1University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT, 2Buck Institute, Novato, CA","Spinocerebellar ataxia type 7 (SCA7) is a polyglutamine disorder  characterized by specific degeneration of cerebellar, brainstem  and retinal neurons. Although they share little sequence homology,  proteins implicated in other trinucleotide (CAG)n repeat disorders  have similar attributes beyond their characteristic polyglutamine  tract and neurodegenerative pathology. These attributes include a  nuclear aggregation phenotype associated with apoptotic cell death  and roles as caspase substrates. In this study we present evidence  that ataxin 7, the product of the SCA7 gene, has a predominantly  nuclear distribution in HEK 293 cells that does not depend upon on isoform, polyglutamine tract length or the presence or absence of a  putative nuclear localization sequence. However, the morphology of  nuclear aggregation appears to depend upon polyglutamine length.  Ataxin 7 is implicated in apoptotic cytotoxicity by qualitative as well  as quantitative parameters . Consistent with its nuclear localization  and apoptotic propensity, ataxin 7 acts as a substrate for an activated  caspase. Ataxin 7âs susceptibility to caspase action was eliminated by  mutation of specific residues. The data support a model whereby one  of ataxin 7âs roles in the nucleus is as a modulator",2002

The disease can be demyelinating as well  as axonal and is inherited as an autosomal dominant, autosomal  recessive or X linked trait. Mutations in the ganglioside induced  differentiation associated protein 1 gene (GDAP1) were recently  shown to be responsible for recessive CMT4A (chromosome  8q21.1). GDAP1, comprising an ORF of 1077 nucleotides, encodes  a protein of 358 amino acids containing a glutathione S transferase  (GST) domain. GST enzymes are known to function in antioxidant  pathways and in detoxification. Therefore, GDAP1 might play a  role in protecting myelin membranes against free radical mediated  damage, to which it is susceptible. We screened the GDAP1 gene  for the presence of mutations in 7 recessive CMT families compatible  with linkage to CMT4A. A homozygous nonsense mutation in exon  5 of GDAP1 (c.581C>G, S194X) was found in a consanguineous  Moroccan family. Clinical, electrophysiological and neuropathological  examination of the patients showed an axonal CMT phenotype.  A homozygous 1 bp deletion in exon 6 (c.786delG, G262fsX284)  of GDAP1 was identified in two probably related Turkish families.  Electrophysiological as well as neuropathological data support a  demyelinating CMT phenotype. In a Turkish consanguineous family  a homozygous missense mutation (c.844C>T, R282C) in exon 6 of  GDAP1 was detected. Electrophysiological examination of the patient  revealed an axonal CMT phenotype. In conclusion, we detected 3  distinct homozygous GDAP1 mutations (a nonsense, a frameshift  and a missense mutation) in families with recessive CMT.

Subsequently we constructed fusion proteins  with GFP for P0wt and the Ala221fs mutation to visualize the effect  in vivo both on the intracellular localization and on the changes in  the adhesion capability. The GFP P0wt fusion revealed the expected  adhesion capability and moreover the membrane insertion of the  fusion protein was clearly visible using a fluorescent microscope. The  Ala221fs mutation is expressed, however, no membrane insertion  takes place. This may explaine the lack of its adhesion capability.

","The newly recognized ataxia ocular apraxia 1 is the most frequent  cause of autosomal recessive ataxia in Japan and is second only to  Friedreich ataxia in Portugal. It shares several neurological features  with ataxia telangiectasia, including early onset ataxia, oculomotor  apraxia and cerebellar atrophy. However, it does not share its  extraneurological features (immune deficiency, chromosomal  instability and hypersensitivity to X rays). AOA1 is also characterized  by axonal motor neuropathy and the later decrease of serum  albumin levels and elevation of total cholesterol. We have identified  the gene causing AOA1 and the major Portuguese and Japanese  mutations.

Early manifestations of the disease are tonic, clonic and tonic clonic  seizures occurring within the first year of life. These seizures are  often prolonged, generalized and associated with fever. Later in life,  SMEI patients suffer from afebrile seizures, including myoclonic,  tonic clonic, absences, simple and complex partial seizures.  Early psychomotor and speech development is normal, but in the  second year of life developmental stagnation occurs. Patients often  become ataxic and speech development is delayed. In general,  SMEI is very resistant to all anti epileptic drugs. A mild type of  epilepsy associated with febrile and occasionally afebrile seizures in  adulthood is generalized epilepsy with febrile seizures plus (GEFS+).  Missense mutations in the gene coding for a neuronal voltage  gated sodium channel Î± subunit (SCN1A) were identified in families  with GEFS+. Since both GEFS+ and SMEI show fever associated  seizures we screened 13 unrelated SMEI patients for mutations in  SCN1A. Mutation analysis was performed using DHPLC and DNA  sequencing. We identified a single heterozygous mutation in each  patient: 4 frameshift, 2 nonsense, 2 splice donor and 5 missense  mutations. Using a multi allelic marker we genotyped the patients  and the parents to confirm paternity. Sequencing demonstrated  that all mutations are de novo mutations.

Nazarenko; Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation. One of the most important conceptions over the past few years in  interpretation of the pathogenesis of abnormal intrauterine human  development is the statement about possible discrepancies between  karyotype of cells of embryonic and placental origin. During prenatal  diagnosis the incidence of confined placental mosaicism is evaluated  usually about 1 2%. In order to determine the influence of distribution  of cells with chromosomal abnormalities in placental tissues on arrest  of embryo development the non cultured cells from cytotrophoblast  and extraembryonic mesoderm of 28 first trimester internal abortions  were studied by interphase FISH analysis with centromere specific  DNA probes for each chromosome. 7 discrepancies (25%) between  karyotypes of two studied tissues were found. Cell lines with trisomy  7, trisomy 8, monosomy 15 were confined to cytotrophoblast  whereas the karyotype of extraembryonic mesoderm cells was  normal. One embryo has mosaic monosomy 7 in cytotrophoblast  only but in mesoderm the tetraploidy/diploidy mosaicism was  detected. Two abortions have chromosome aberrations both in  cytotrophoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm but in former the  chromosomal abnormalities were in mosaic form with normal cell  line whereas in later only the cells with abnormal karyotype were  detected.

Recent data have shown that apoptotic  fetal cells can be detected in plasma of pregnant women and that  many fetal nucleated red blood cells (NRBCs) in the maternal  circulation were TUNEL positive. It has, therefore, been suggested  that the maternal immune system may clear NRBCs by apoptosis and  that this leads to the production of circulatory fetal DNA.

For this purpose we have examined whether apoptosis occurs in fetal Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 276 277 NRBCs that have crossed into the maternal circulation or rather if this  is a physiological phenomenon of NRBC maturation which occurs  when these cells are still in the fetal circulation.

In pregnancies at risk for HDN it is useful to  know the RhD zygosity of the partner, since there is only a 50%  chance that the fetus will at risk for HDN, if he is heterozygous. The  determination of this has previously been very difficult and unreliable  by conventional antibody assays. Recent reports have indicated that RhD zygosity can be determined  by quantitative fluorescent PCR or Taqman real time PCR. We have recently developed a multiplex real time Taqman assay for  the simultaneous analysis of the male SRY locus and RhD gene. Our  studies have shown that this assay is very reliable for the analysis of  both fetal sex and RhD status using cell free fetal DNA in maternal  plasma. Since one only needs to determine RhD zygosity of the male partner  in pregnancies at risk for HDN, we have examined whether our  Taqman assay can be used for this purpose. In our study we examined 39 male blood samples. RhD zygosity  was determined both by the ratio of RhD:SRY or RhD:GAPDH  loci by Taqman PCR. Our study showed that RhD zygosity could  quite clearly be classified as either RhD/RhD and RhD/Rhd by both  assays. No discordant results were obtained between the two assays.

","OBJECTIVE: Fetal choroid plexus cysts (CPC) are commonly found  at the time of a routine second trimester scan, but there is much  debate as to their clinical significance. The aims of this study were to  define the incidence of CPC in an unselected population and describe  their association with aneuploidy. METHODS: 10594 pregnant women that were subjected to second Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 276 277 level ultrasonographic analysis at the Department of Perinatology ,  Zeynep Kamil Maternity and Children Hospital has been studied. 109  cases of CPCs were identified among these group (1.02%) between  16 and 22 weeksâ gestation. These patients had genetic counseling,  and biochemical testing and amniocentesis were offered to all  patients. RESULTS: The majority of the cases 102/109 presented only isolated  CPC and the remaining 7/109 (6.5%) were associated with additional  ultrasonographic findings. No relationship was found between the  diameter, bilaterality or the complexity of the cyst. Aneuploidies  (mostly trisomy 18) were found in 3/102 with isolated CPC (2.94%)  and in 3/7 with additional ultrasonographic findings (43%). Advanced  maternal age as an additional risk factor was found in only one of  isolated CPC, but the remaining two had no other risks so far. CONCLUSION: The management of isolated choroid plexus  cysts remains controversial. Fetus with CPC should be examined  carefully by detailed ultrasound assessment to seek for further minor  malformations in a specialized center. The review of the literature  show that the majority of the authors advocate amniocentesis when  the CPC is associated with another ultrasound abnormality.",2002

","The purpose of this study was to determine the number of  chromosome 21 present in the fetal cells from pregnancies  complicated with Down syndrome by differentiating the chromosome  21s of different parental origins with human chromosome 21  specific DNA marker polymorphism. Forty amniotic fluid samples  from pregnancies complicated with fetal Down syndrome were  analyzed for D21S11 and interferon  Î± receptor gene intervening  (IFNAR) sequence. Fluorescence labeled polymerase chain reaction  (f PCR) was performed to amplify these sequences followed by  polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Data were delineated with  automatic DNA sequencer and 35 of 40 (87.5%) fetal Down  syndrome samples analyzed for IFNAR showed 3 distinct peaks,  each peak represented an individual chromosome 21, while 24 of 30  (80%) cases analyzed for D21S11 showed 3 distinct peaks. There  were two Down syndrome samples showed two uneven peaks. By  analyzing 98 euploid pregnancies as controls, the ratio of area under  the peaks was determined to be 1.31Â±0.22 and 1.96Â±0.18 (mean Â±  SD) for the euploid pregnancies and pregnancies complicated by  fetal Down syndrome with two peaks, respectively. Altogether 39 of  40 (97.5%) Down syndrome cases were correctly identified based on  either the 3 peaks pattern in at least one of the DNA markers or the  relative peak area ratio calculation. It was concluded that polymorphic  DNA markers are useful in determining the number of chromosome  21 present in fetal cells.

Holzgreve","University of Basel, Basel, Switzerland","A major focus of our group is the development of a risk free non  invasive method for prenatal diagnosis of fetal aneuploidies using  fetal cells enriched from the blood of pregnant women. A concern  with the introduction of such a new test is that pregnant women may  feel coerced to undergo involuntary testing. In order to address this  issue we have examined the attitude of 145 pregnant women to the  introduction of such a test, consisting of 3 groups: 1. Women with a normal pregnancy (n=97). 2. Women judged to have a high risk for a fetal abnormality and who  had undergone an invasive prenatal diagnostic procedure (n=24). 3. Women who had become pregnant following IVF treatment (n=24). In addition we examined the attitude of 68 non pregnant women.Our study showed that: 1. 79,3% would not feel coerced by the introduction of a risk free test. 2. 80% would be interested in first using a non invasive test as  preliminary a screening procedure. 3. If the test result was found to be normal, 84.4% of pregnant women  would not elect to have further tests. 4. If the result was abnormal, 56% would elect to have the result  confirmed by invasive tests. 5. Women undergoing IVF treatment, would prefer to have the result  confirmed by a further non invasive test (58.3%). Our data, therefore, indicate that pregnant women would not feel  coerced to undergo involuntary testing, and that such a risk free test  would be especially welcomed by couples undergoing IVF treatment.",2002

Amniotic fluid samples were obtained between 12  and 34 weeksâ gestation, 116/162 (72%) being between 15 and 20.  In cases with a sole abnormal US finding (n=24) nine aneuploidies  were detected (1 tris 13, 8 tris 21). In the group with two or more  malformations (n=59) there were 18 aneuploidies (9 tris 18, 3 tris 21,  2 monosomy X,1 tris 13, 2 triploidy, 1 karyotype: 48,XXY,+21). In this  group conventional cytogenetic revealed also three chromosomal  anomalies not detectable by FISH: a trisomy 16 mosaicism, a 4p  and  a r(13). No sex aneuploidies alone were observed. In the group with  normal US, 52 cases were analysed because of maternal anxiety and  27 had positive maternal serum screen or advanced maternal age. In  this latter group of pregnancies only two trisomies 21 was detected.  The complete concordance between FISH data and conventional  karyotype analysis observed in our sample, prompt us to consider  the interphase FISH as an useful tool in pregnancies with high risk  of chromosomal aneuploidies. When ploidy status is known to be  normal, the overall risk of chromosomal abnormalities is significantly  reduced. Otherwise, the findings of three chromosomal anomalies  undetectable by AneuVysionR Assay confirms that FISH results  should be complemented by the conventional chromosomes analysis.",2002
Further experiences with the application of STR  analysis for the detection of the most common trisomies  by F PCR,P0959.,"Ban , C. Papp, B. Nagy, L. Lazar, E. Toth Pal, Z. Papp","Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary","OBJECTIVE: Prenatal cytogenetic analysis for trisomies requires  lengthy and work intensive laboratory procedures. A rapid method  for the detection of the most common trisomies is the fluorescent  PCR amplification of small tandem repeats (STR) located on the  chromosomes 13, 18 and 21. This method is a potential alternative  to conventional cytogenetic analysis for the screening of these  disorders. Recently the method has been reported to be used as a  single screening method for age related aneuploidies. OBJECTIVE:  We compared the results of the routine cytogenetic analysis of  amniotic fluid and chorionic villus samples to the results of the  fluorescent PCR analysis of the same samples (n=1200). METHODS:  The multiplex fluorescent PCR was performed with 3 primer pairs  specific for chromosome 21 (D21S11, D21S1411, D21S1312) and  2 2 primer pairs specific for chromosome 18 (D18S851, D18S51) and  13 (D13S631, D13S258). The capillary electrophoresis and fragment  analysis was performed on an ABI 310 Genetic Analyser. RESULTS:  We found 16 cases of trisomy 21, 10 cases of trisomy 18, 7 cases  of trisomy 13 and 3 cases of triploidy. We found the same pathologic  samples as the cytogenetic analysis. CONCLUSION: The multiplex  fluorescent PCR analysis of STRs proved to be fast and reliable in  the diagnosis of the most common trisomies. It is not replacing the Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 278 279 cytogenenetic analysis of prenatal samples, but in certain cases  like advanced maternal age it is worth considering it as a routine  alternative to it.",2002

Chromosomal aberrations are the main  cause for pregnancy loss in more than 50% in the first and 20% in  the second trimester of pregnancy. Conventional cytogenetic analysis  of spontaneous abortions is usually used for detection of structural  and numerical chromosomal aberrations, but disadvantages of the  method are difficult tissue culturing and contamination by maternally  derived cells. Our previous cytogenetic and molecular genetic studies  have indicated that oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes could  play a role in fetal development disturbances.

Two distinguishable phenotypes  are delineated: the first one is characterized by craniofacial defects  whereas the second one includes urogenital anomalies, abdominal  placental attachment and inconstant anomalies of inferior limbs. We describe here a fetus with BWC detected by ultrasound at 16  weeksâ gestation. Direct chromosome analysis of chorionic villi  displayed a trisomy 13 in 20 of 21 cells whereas the cultured cells  showed a normal karyotype 46,XY. Foetopathological examination  demonstrated a male 17 week old fetus with an inferior celosomy  associated with a short umbilical cord, urogenital anomalies and limb  defects. Postmortem karyotype from skin fibroblasts was normal. Little is known about the pathogenic mechanisms of BWC. At  present, the three main theories are early amnion rupture sequence  including all phenotypes of BWC, early vascular disruption involved  in the craniofacial phenotype and early embryonic maldevelopment  with disturbance of the embryonic folding at the origin of the second  phenotype. The latter could result of a malfunction of the ectodermal  placode or rather of a disturbance of the ectodermal cells deposition  into the mesodermal compartment, as suggested by Hartwig (1992). To our knowledge, chromosome anomalies have not been reported in  BWC.

Although it has frequently been reported in early  spontaneous abortions, tetraploidy is extremely rare in term  pregnancy. Most of late surviving patients are diploid/tetraploid  mosaics and present severe mental and physical impairment. To our  knowledge, only four tetraploidies were ascertained in the prenatal  stage on amniocytes and/or fetal blood lymphocytes. We report here on the prenatal diagnosis of a diploid/tetraploid fetus:  at 11 weeksâ gestation, a karyotype performed on chorionic villi (direct  analysis and cultures) for cystic hygroma showed full tetraploidy .  Subsequent amniocentesis was considered as normal (despite the  presence of a tetraploid clone among the 15 analysed). However a  sonographic examination at 18 weeksâ gestation displayed a complex  cardiopathy. After termination of pregnancy, chromosome analysis on  different tissues confirmed diploid/tetraploid mosaicism. This observation and the four previously reported in the literature  emphasize the difficulty of the prenatal diagnosis of true tetraploidy,  first because the features are not specific, often mild or revealed late  in pregnancy, second because tetraploidy may be an artifact on in  vitro cell cultures or a confined placental mosaicism. Therefore, in a context of ultrasound abnormalities, when cytogenetic  analysis displays tetraploidy, caution is advised and karyotypes  on other tissue samples have to be performed and compared with  control cultures.

From a total of 228 PD, 80 fetus (35%)  were malformed. The causes of gestational wastage were classified  as maternal (85 cases, 37%), fetal (104 cases, 45%), or unknown  (39 cases, 17%). Fetal causes were more commonly found in the  group of early neonatal deaths. Besides obstetrical causes, the other  main diagnosis found among PD from maternal origin, were arterial  hypertension and infectious diseases. Among PD from fetal causes,  24 cases (23%) were twins. The remaining were all malformed  foetus distributed as follows: 35 (44%) isolated defects, 15 (19%)  foetus with multiple anomalies, and 30 (37%) syndromic fetus. In the  isolated group congenital malformations of the CNS (22) followed by  uro genital (12) were the most frequent anomalies. Chromosomal  and disruption syndromes, besides skeletal dysplasias were the  main syndromes diagnosed. With regard to all the known causes of  deaths in the whole group, we observed that secondary prevention is  possible in more than half of the deaths with maternal origin. Among  deaths from congenital anomalies of the foetus, prevention by genetic  counselling and/or prenatal diagnosis is possible in more than 80% of  the cases.

Rapid prenatal diagnosis of common autosomal  aneuploidies by relative semi quantitative fluorescence  PCR on uncultured amniocytes,P0971.,"Philippe1, H. Rahil1, J. Solassol2, G. Lefort2, P. Jonveaux1","1Laboratory of Human Genetics, Vandoeuvre les Nancy, France,  2Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Montpellier, France","Prenatal diagnosis of chromosomal abnormalities by cytogenetic  analysis is time consuming, expensive and requires highly qualifi ed  technicians. Rapid diagnosis of aneuploidies followed by reassurance  for women with normal results can be performed by molecular  analysis of uncultured foetal cells in less than 24 hours. Today, all molecular techniques developed for a fast diagnosis of aneuploidies  rely on the semi quantification of fluorescent PCR products from  short tandem repeat (STR) polymorphic markers. Our objective  was to test a chromosome quantification method based on the  analysis of fluorescent PCR products derived from non polymorphic  target genes. An easy to set up co amplification of portions of  DSCR1 (Down Syndrome Critical Region 1), DCC (Deleted in  Colorectal Carcinoma), and RB1 (Retinoblastoma 1) allowed the  molecular detection of aneuploidies for chromosomes 21, 18, and  13 respectively. Semi quantitative analysis was performed in a blind  prospective study of 400 amniotic fluids. Four samples (1%) could  not be analysed by PCR probably because of a low concentration of  foetal DNA. Follow up karyotype analysis was done on all samples  and molecular results were in agreement with the cytogenetic data  with no false positive or false negative results. Our gene based  fluorescent PCR approach is an alternative molecular method for a  rapid and reliable detection of aneuploidies which can be helpful for  the clinical management of high risk pregnancies.",2002
Deletion 22q11 and conotruncal cardiopathy in  four successive pregnancies: contribution of prenatal  diagnosis.,P0972.,"Zamir Brill , R. Gershoni Baruch","Rambam Medical Center, Haifa, Israel","CATCH 22, an acronym for cardiac defects, abnormal facies, thymic  hypoplasia, cleft palate, and hypocalcemia is associated with a  variable deletion on chromosome 22q11 and occurs in patients  with dysmorphologic and cardiological syndromes: DiGeorge,  velocardiofacial and conotruncal/face syndrome. Estimates suggest  that the 22q11.2 deletion occurs in approximately 1/4000 live births,  making this disorder a significant health concern, so much so that  22q11.2 deletion studies are becoming part of a standardized  diagnostic workup for some isolated heart defects. We report  on 4 consecutive 22q11.2 deletion antenatal diagnoses, in an  asymptomatic 22q11.2 deletion carrier, ascertained following in utero  detection of a conotruncal cardiac defect. Her first pregnancy resulted  in a normal female. The second and 3rd pregnancies were terminated  following ultrasonographic visualization of conotruncal cardiac defect.  FISH analysis of amniotic fluid from the second affected pregnancy  confirmed the diagnosis of 22q11.2 deletion, for which the mother  herself tested positive. FISH performed on CVS from her 4th and  5th pregnancies were again consistent with the diagnosis of 22q1 1.2  deletion. Cardiac defects detected on ultrasonograph of the 4th  pregnancy were not visualized during the 5th pregnancy, which was  terminated on week 15. The ethical issue imposed by termination of  what seems to be a normal fetus, albeit carrying 22q11.2 deletion,  is underlined. This report highlights the importance of offering  22q11.2 deletion testing to parents of affected probands and couples  following in utero detection of a cardiac defect. Antenatal knowledge  of the deletion status provides couples with an accurate diagnosis,  prognostic information, and recurrence risk.",2002

Alpha1 antitrypsin deficiency, an autosomal  recessive disorder, predisposes individuals to the development of  pulmonary emphysema and is also associated with chronic liver  disease. The PI gene is located on the long arm of chromosome 14  at position 14q32.1. Numerous normal or deficient variants of this  gene have been described but two major mutations (Z and S) are  responsible for the pathology. We report on a child with developmental delay and alpha1 antitrypsin  deficiency (ZZ). His mother is heterozygous for the Z mutation but  his father presented with a normal genotype (MM).Exclusion of  paternity was discarded and then we began a molecular analysis  to explain the genotype discordance and the particular phenotype  of the child. Six microsatellites on the long arm of chromosome 14  (D14S264, D14S1057, D14S258, D14S76, D14S67, D14S1162) were  tested. Analysis of DNA polymorphisms shows no contribution of the  father and two chromosomes 14 from the mother with isodisomy for  markers near the PI locus and heterodisomy for the more centromeric  markers. Uniparental disomy as a mecanism of recessive disorders may  be evocated when the implicated chromosomic region carries a  mutated gene.So, cystic fibrosis due to disomy of chromosome 7 has  been reported. We report here the first case of alpha1 antitrypsin  deficiency due to disomy of chromosome 14.",2002

Bach1","1Dpt of Human genetics, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem,  Israel, 2Dpt of Pediartrics, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem,  Israel","CLAH is a rare autosomal recessive disease, quite common in the  Palestinian population in Israel and is usually diagnosed after birth.  The clinical picture is adrenal insufficiency at birth: dark skin, vomiting  and failure to thrive. The phenotype is of a female although the  karyotype is XY. Unless treated early, death can occur shortly after  birth. Treatment with steroids and salts is required for lifetime. The  basic defect in this disease is no production of any steroid: cortico   mineralo  and sex steroids. The genetic defect is in the StAR gene,  encoding a cholesterol shuttle protein, which transports cholesterol  into the mitochondria, where the process of steroidogenesis takes  place. Prenatal diagnosis of CLAH is possible by mutation analysis of  the StAR gene, or measuring the MSuE3 during 1st trimester of  pregnancy, between 10 13 weeks. We will present our experience  in diagnosing fetuses with CLAH and other types of fetal adrenal  insufficiency in the 1st trimester of pregnancy.

Somatic microsatellite instability in prenatal  samples detected by QF PCR,P0976.,"Mann , C. Mackie Ogilvie","Guyâs Hospital, London, United Kingdom","Mosaicism (the presence of two or more different cell lines) is  reported to occur in approximately 1 % of chorionic villus samples  (CVS), although one cell line may be confined to the placenta.  Rapid aneuploidy testing is now being applied in many cytogenetic  laboratories either to complement or replace conventional karyotype  analysis. Assessment of these technologies includes their ability to  detect potentially significant abnormalities such as mosaicism. Quantitative fluorescence PCR (QF PCR) detects genomic  imbalance by comparing the alleles of amplified STR markers.  Routine use of QF PCR in our centre (>3000 samples to date)  has established that this technology can detect low level trisomy  mosaicism. However, a previously unreported form of mosaicism at the molecular level was also observed. Nine out of 275 (3.3%) CVS  samples showed frond specific de novo STR alleles. In two of these  samples instability was confirmed (one 8bp expansion of D13S742  and one 4bp expansion of D21S1411) by investigation of parental  DNA, and in seven by the absence of the novel allele from other  fronds and from cultured cells. Mosaicism for a novel allele at a single  locus was also detected in uncultured material and cultured cells from  one amniotic fluid sample. Eight different STR markers to date have  demonstrated novel alleles. Although repeat instability is unlikely to  represent an abnormal phenotype, the relatively high frequency of  somatic mutation in individual villi is surprising. Case results, possible  mechanisms and implications for the interpretation of QF PCR results  will be discussed.",2002

This method is  based on the PCR amplification of highly polymorphic short tandem  repeats (STRs). In the course of PCR amplification, a fluorochrome  is incorporated into the products, which are then visualised  and quantified using an automated DNA sequencer. Several  investigations have documented the accuracy of performing rapid  prenatal diagnoses of trisomies involving chromosomes 21, 18 and  13. However, due the unavailability of highly specific STR markers, only  in recent times it has been possible to detect X and Y chromosome  abnormalities. For the detection of Turner syndrome, several X linked  STRs are included in multiplex PCR assays so that, using up to 4  markers, the likelihood of a normal female to be homozygous for all  sequences, is expected to be extremely low (about 2/1000). Here we report a new method for rapid detection of X chromosome  copy number in all prenatal samples. The test is based on QF PCR  amplification of the X linked HPRT with the autosomal D21S1411  used as internal control for quantification. X chromosome copy  number is rapidly and accurately assessed by comparing the ratio  between the fluorescent activity of the X specific and autosomal PCR  products, thus independently from any calculation of probability .

Applications of two dimensional electrophoresis  and fluorometric enzyme assay for MPS prenatal  diagnosis,P0988.,"Chuang1, S. Lin2","1Genetics & Metabolism, Dept.of Medical Research, Mackay  Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan Republic of China, 2Dept. of  Pediatrics, Mackay Memorial Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan Republic of  China. ","The mucopolysaccharidoses (MPS), a group of heritable disorders,  are transmitted in an autosomal recessive manner, except for  MPS II(X linked). The diagnosis of MPS can be achieved by two  dimensional electrophoresis (2 D EP) for MPS typing determination  and enzymatic assay for MPS confirmation. In 2000   2001, we had Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 284 285 successfully completed prenatal detection by 2 D EP and fluorometric  enzyme assay in seven unrelated families having previous affected  children; 5 with MPS II, 1 with MPS III and 1 with MPS IV. Amniotic  fluids (AF) were taken at 14th ~ 18th weeks of gestation. For 5 AF  with high risk of MPS II, the results showed normal EP pattern, in  which the chondroitin sulfate (CS) and hyaluronic acid (HA) were  demonstrated. The activities of iduronate 2 sulfatase (IDS) were  normal in the cultured AF cells. For pregnancy with high risk of MPS  III, the 2 D EP result showed a composed pattern of CS, HA, and  heparan sulfate (HS). For pregnancy with high risk of MPS IV, the  result showed a composed pattern of CS, HA, and keratan sulfate  (HS). The enzyme activities of alpha N acetyl glucosaminidase and  galactosamine 6 sulfatase were all reduced in the cultured AF cells,  which were corresponding with the 2 D EP results. On the basis of  these results the pregnancies were terminated. By reviewing the 2  D EP method, it is definite, sensitive, and easy to perform for MPS  prenatal diagnosis, however, a final confirmation is required by  performing an enzymatic assay of that specific enzyme activity.",2002
Characterisation of the gene defect in 12 patients  with sporadic haemophilia B.,P0989.,"Acquila , M. Pasino, D. Caprino, T. Lanza, F. Bottini, P. G. Mori, M.  P. Bicocchi","Gaslini childrenâs hospital, Genova, Italy","Previous studies have shown that haemophilia B (HB) is the result  of several mutations, mostly single nucleotide substitutions, in  the Factor IX gene. In order to evaluate the impact of mutation  analysis on genetic counselling in sporadic and uninformative HB  familial pedigrees, we re analysed 12 patients by dHPLC, who had  previously been studied by restriction fragment length polymorphisms  (RFLPs). In order to perform mutation analysis, the coding regions,  intron/exon splice junctions , 5â and 3â untranslated regions, and the  promoter and polyadenylation site of Factor IX gene were amplified  using the appropriate primers. In all cases unique abnormal dHPLC  chromatograms were found, the specific abnormal fragments were  sequenced and the mutations were characterised. The distribution  detected in our screening studies fits with what is reported in the  FIX mutation database. 93% of the mutations occurred in the coding  sequences of the gene. They were all independent mutations, mostly  (9/12) associated to the severe form of the disease. Point mutations  were the most recurrent mutations. Three mutations were novel,  unreported in the HB database and none involved CpG dinucleotides.  Ten mutations were single base substitutions, one was a base  insertion, and one was a four nucleotide deletion. By identifying the  detrimental mutations in affected males, carrier status was correctly  diagnosed in all the women we studied. 3/12 de novo events were  found in maternal meioses.",2002
Discordant prenatal diagnosis due to a mosaic  structural rearrangement of chromosome 21 in two  trisomic 21 fetuses.,P0990.,"Brisset , A. Aboura, F. Audibert, V. Gautier, R. Frydman, G.  Tachdjian","HÃ´pital Antoine BÃ©clÃ¨re, Clamart, France","Trisomy 21 mosaicism associated with a structural rearrangement  is uncommon. We report on two prenatal diagnoses in which  karyotypes showed mosaicism with an aberrant cell line including  a rearrangement of chromosome 21. Prenatal diagnoses were  performed because of increased nuchal translucency. In the first  case, analysis of trophoblast cells revealed an abnormal karyotype:  46,XX/47,XX,+del(21)(q21). The amniocentesis and cordocentesis  showed a non mosaic trisomy 21. In the second case, the trophoblast  direct analysis showed a normal male karyotype whereas the  long term culture revealed trisomy 21 mosaicism secondary  to a rearrangement of chromosome 21 (either a Robertsonian  translocation or an isochromosome): 46,XY/47,XY,rea(21q21q)/ 45,XY, 21. Amniocentesis confirmed the trisomy 21 in all cells.  FISH analysis proved that these rearrangements were derived from  chromosome 21. The mechanisms of formation are discussed. The  first case could be explained by the deletion of one chromosome 21  in a trisomic zygote with instability of this de novo marker leading  to a normal cell line. In the second case different mechanisms are  suggested. The rearrangement might occurred postzygotically  in a normal embryo with a non disjunction or a translocation of  homologous chromatides of one chromosome 21 leading to a cell line with the rearranged chromosome 21 and another cell line with  a monosomy 21. A more complex mechanism of formation is also  considered with a cascade of meiotic and subsequent mitotic errors.  Our cases underline the importance to combine the short term and  long term cultures and emphasises the need for confirmatory studies  in other tissues when mosaicism is encountered in chorionic villi.",2002

The majority of patients  with demyelinating neuropathy (CMT1) have 1,5Mb duplication/ deletion in 17p11.2 chromosome region. It is responsible for nearly  80% of authosomal dominant CMT cases. We have analyzed a total of 28 CMT1 families with clinical data  for authosomal dominant inheritance for 6 highly polymorphic  markers closely linked to 17p11.2 region: D17S921, D17S122,  D17S1357, D17S1358, D17S2226 and D17S2227. We have set up  analytical conditions on ALF fragment analyzer to receive reliable  and reproducible gene dosage differences in affected subjects and  controls. We have detected 11 families with duplication and 1 with  deletion. The combination of markers D17S921 and D17S122 was  informative in 9 cases. Additionally testing for D17S1357, D17S2227  and D17S2226 revealed another 3 cases of 17p11.2 duplication.  With these five markers we were able to identify duplicated/ deleted and normal alleles in 100% of CMT1A and HNPP families.  Polymorphic markers have been arranged in two sets based on  their informativeness and length of repeats. The first one included  D17S921, D17S122, D17S2227 and allowed correct and fast  molecular diagnosis of 17p11.2 duplication/deletion in 90% of cases.  The second one comprising D17S1357and D17S2226, we used in  non informative cases and as a verification test. Marker D17S1358  was informative in only 2 cases and therefore it is not currently  used in our laboratory diagnostic practice. The described two step  procedure is fast, efficient and inexpensive, which makes it suitable  for routine postnatal and prenatal diagnostics of 17p11.2 duplication/ deletion in Bulgarian CMT1 families.",2002

In the first pregnancy, severe micromelia and  generalized edema were noted on ultrasound at 21 WG. Clinical  evaluation of the fetus after termination of the pregnancy revealed  short limbed dwarfism with short trunk, narrow thorax, large head,  generalized edema, flat face, short nose with anteverted nostrils,  micrognathia and short neck. Radiographs showed typical findings  of achondrogenesis type II, including very short and squared  tubular bones, with irregular metaphyseal spurring, short iliac  wings and absence of ossification of ischiatic and pubic bones. The  vertebral bodies were very poorly ossified and bipartite in the dorsal Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 284 285 region.

Karyotype from amniocytes was 46,XX. QFPCR analysis  confirmed normal STR pattern for chromosomes 13,21,X and Y using  D13S258,D13S631,D21S11, D21S1414,X22,XHPRT STR markers.  Female sex of the fetus was confirmed. D18S535 STR marker  (18q12.2 q12.3) characteristics brought evidence of normal diallelic  pattern with peak ratio 1,2. Repeated examinations of STR D18S51  marker disclosed diallelic type of partial trisomy 18 in 18q21.3 region  with peak ratio 2,41 (2,31 2,60). The mother decided for the abortion  of this fetus. In aborted fetus ventricular septal defect, open foramen  ovale and ductus arteriosus, pericardial exudate, aplasia of umbilical  artery, ren arcuatus with cystic dysplasia of the caudal kidney pole  were found. These anomalies correspond to the described features  of partial trisomy 18q21.1. The abnormal chromosome was inherited  from the mother as follows from the comparison from parental and  fetal electrophoretic patterns. These STR markers did not allow to  ascertain origin in first or second meiosis, because the mother was  homozygous for D18S51 STR marker.

Until recently ,  the most accurate diagnostic tests for DMD were the determination of  serum creatine kinase levels, muscle biopsy, and EMG. However, the  application of recombinant DNA technology to the diagnosis of DMD  has resulted in the development of more accurate tests. Methods: 81 families with increased risk of DMD passed clinico  neurological, CK test, muscle ultrasonography investigations and  molecular study. MPCRâs were performed for deletion detection (18  different exons of dystrophin gene were tested in patients DNA) and  RFLP analysis (pERT87 8/TaqI, pERT87 15/BamH1 and 16 intron/ TaqI polymorphisms).Posters   Prenatal and Perinatal Genetics 286 287 Results and Discussion: About 76 % of probands were proved to be  carriers of dystrophin gene deletion by MPCR. The given test highly is  informative at the patients from Moldova. The analysis of informative  families with MDD/B on the three intragenic polymorphisms pERT87  8/Tag1, pERT87 15/BamH1 and 16intron/Tag1 has revealed high of  polymorphism 16intron/Tag1 (47,36 %) and low percent of informative  was determined at the pERT 87 15/BamH1 polymorphism (21%).

These dates coincides with theoretical accounts of  populations frequencies of the pERT87 8/Tag1, pERT87 15/BamH1  and 16 intron/Tag1 alleles which were counted by Hardy Weinberg  equilibrium. Conclusion: The algorithm of molecular researches, selected by  us, allows to define informative in 76 families (93% cases) and,  accordingly, to conduct clinical, preclinical and prenatal diagnosis in  DMD families.",2002

We reviewed 21 detailed fetal descriptions of Fraser syndrome  from the literature (Thomas et al., Boyd et al., Ramsing et al.), and  compared total of 26 fetal cases to 68 pediatric cases reviewed by  Gattuso et al., the last representing viable milder form of the Fraser  syndrome. A quantitative estimate of the frequency of the principle clinical  manifestations in the fetal versus pediatric population was obtained.  The sensitivities of major criteria in fetuses varied between 77% (cryptophtalmos) and 96% (syndactyly), and of minor criteria varied  between 81% (renal agenesis/laryngeal anomalies) and 23% (cleft  lip/palate). Different renal anomalies were present in 96% of fetuses.  Severe form of the syndrome should be more frequently diagnosed  in utero regarding a very poor prognosis and high perinatal lethality .  Furthermore, a high recurrence risk of 25% among sibs warrants  diagnosis for appropriate genetic counselling, the prenatal diagnosis  being also much facilitated in further pregnancies in the cases with  positive family history. Therefore, we are emphasizing the frequency  of renal agenesis and laryngeal anomalies among fetal population  and suggesting these two features should integrate major diagnostic  criteria of Fraser syndrome in fetuses.

Objective: The comparison of clinical genetic aspects  between the patients of two families and a correlation with data  obtained from review. Patients and method: Our clinical genetic  study comprises 18 cases personally examined in two not connected  families (a family with 14 cases, another family with 4 cases).  Results: The cases offer a complete and well defined clinical picture  of a rare syndrome that has as definitory elements: brachydactyly+sy mphalangism+progressive deafness+autosomal dominant inheritance  pattern. The syndrome is characterized by complete penetrance  and variable expressivity. They are surprisingly similar in what the  extension of finger morphologic lesions is concerned, but different  in what the onset age and the degree of hearing loss is concerned.  The large number of cases, on more generations, with constant  association of the three anomalies, offers a good opportunity for gene  investigation by linkage analysis. The role of Nog gene is discussed.  Conclusions: The description of a large series of 18 examined cases  belonging to two families shows the association of three distinct  pathologic changes: Brachydactyly Symphalangism Deafness  (BSD Syndrome).

We have studied 75 unrelated individuals with congenital NSHL in  order to evaluate the prevalence 35delG mutation. Most of patients  have had NSHL with unknown reason. We did not exclude patients  with some risk factors for acquired hearing loss. In a total this  mutation was found in 44% of the patients tested and was presented  in 42% of sporadic cases. The hearing loss in homozygous and heterozygous individuals  varied from moderate to profound. No evidence of progression of the hearing impairment was found. The majority of homozygous for  35delG mutation have severe or profound hearing loss. Only one  homozygous has significant asymmetrical hearing impairment. Two  heterozygous patients have mild hearing impairment, but both of  them are from deaf families. We have confirmed that 35delG mutation of the Cx26 gene accounts  for a large proportion of cases with congenital NSHL and especially in  cases with unknown reason. More over hearing loss have considered  to be acquired in some of 35delG homozygote before identification of  this mutation. Thus molecular genetic analysis will allow appropriating  genetic counseling. Other Cx26 mutations are under study.",2002

GJB2 is the gene more  often involved and encodes the gap junctions protein connexin 26  (Cx26). More than 60 different Cx26 mutations are described but one  is particularly common, the 35delG, a deletion of a guanine within  a stretch of six Gs residues that starts at position 30 of the coding  region. The 35delG mutation accounts for about 60% of the mutated  GJB2 alleles. We analysed by direct sequencing the GJB2 the gene in 138 NSRD  patients and identified mutations in 88/276 chromosomes analysed;  26.1% (72/276) showed 35delG mutation, while the remaining  showed 12 different mutations (31del14, G12V, W77R, E47X, V95M,  310del14, 35insG, M34T, 167delT, L90P, D179N and H100L). We  also found two allele variants: V27I and V153I (http://www.iro.es/ cx26deaf.html). The 35delG was present in about 68% of all Cx26  mutations identified. Two out of twelve were novel mutations but while  H100L was identified in a family with a recessive form of hearing loss,  the D179N mutation was present in a subject where the subsequent  family history showed a dominant hearing loss segregation. In conclusion our findings confirm that the 35delG mutation of the  GJB2 gene is the most common cause of NSRD in our population,  but many other mutations are also present indicating that the  complete sequence is needed for an appropriate molecular diagnosis  and genetic counselling.",2002

To investigate the  expression pattern of TMPRSS3 we isolated the mouse ortholog.  The mouse Tmprss3 gene maps to MMU17 and encodes a protein  with 88% identity to the human ortholog. RT PCR on rat and RNA  in situ hybridisation on mouse cochlea, respectively, revealed that  it is principally expressed in the spiral ganglion and epithelial cells  supporting the organ of Corti and semi quantitative RT PCR on  mouse tissues showed strong expression in the stomach. Transient  expression of a TMPRSS3 ECFP protein in HeLa cells showed a  primarily localization within the endoplasmic reticulum. The amiloride  sensitive sodium channel (ENaC) is regulated by channel activating  serine proteases (CAPs). ENaC is expressed in many sodium  reabsorbing tissues including the inner ear where it colocalizes  with TMPRSS3 and is likely to be involved in maintenance of low  sodium concentrations in the endolymph. Functional studies in a  Xenopus oocytes expression system demonstrated that TMPRSS3  increased ENaC currents and that a significant fraction of TMPRSS3  is catalytically processed. In contrast, six TMPRSS3 missense  mutations causing deafness that fall in all identified domains except  the TM and a S401A mutant in the catalytic triad of TMPRSS3  all failed to activate ENaC and to undergo proteolytic cleavage.  TMPRSS3 related deafness and these data indicate that important  signalling pathways in the inner ear are controlled by proteolytic cleavage and that this may lead to abnormal sodium homeostasis of  the inner ear. guipponi@wehi.edu.au",2002

In the  majority of PCG cases, the disease causing mutation is located in  the CYP 1B1 gene (GLCA3, cytochrom P450 1B1). The type of the  mutation shows large heterogenity in the Caucasian population.  Recently a single ancestral mutation was found in an isolated  Slovak Gypsy population of PCG patients. All of the patients were  homozigous for the Glu387Lys (G1505A) mutation in the CYP 1B1  gene, the carrier frequency was 10% among healthy Gypsies. The  aim of our study was to identify the disease causing mutations in  Hungarian PCG patients. To predict the significance of the Glu387Lys  mutation in Hungary, a population study was performed in two healthy  Gypsy groups (Northern Hungary [NH]: n=207, Southern Hungary  [SH]: n=150) by PCR RFLP. We found significant differences  between carrier frequencies of the two healthy Gypsy groups (NH: 2,9%, SH:0%). We analysed 24 PCG samples (11 Gypsies, 13 non  Gypsies) for the presence of the Glu387Lys mutation and, found  10/11 homozygous Gypsy patients, while this mutation was not  present among non Gypsy patients. In the absence of the Glu387Lys  mutation, direct sequencing of the coding regions are performed  to identify the disease causing mutation. In conclusion, we found  the Glu387Lys mutation in Hungary with significant geografical  differences, which contradicts the Slovakian endemic theory, but  confirms the Northern (Slovakian) Gypsy origin of the mutation.  Among the Hungarian Gypsy PCG patients, the most common  disease causing gene defect is the Glu387Lys mutation.",2002

Carriership for this trait is believed to provide a selective advantage  of survival after a Plasmodium falciparum  infection, which is the  inducer of malaria tropica. Homozygotes or compound heterozygotes,  on the other hand, suffer from a severe microcytic hypochromic  anemia known as beta thalassaemia major, which results in early  death (without proper treatment) or life long transfusion and  chelation therapy dependence. The majority of molecular defects  causing beta thalassemia are point mutations affecting beta globin  gene expression. The total number of different beta thalassaemia  causing mutations known to date is approximately 180. However a  limited number of mutations occurs in different populations. Once  the spectrum of beta thalassemia causing mutations is known for a  certain population, a screening strategy for efficient diagnosis can be  applied. The feasiblity of a micro array based approach using Single  Base Extension was tested in an immigrant Dutch and an Iranian  population from Hormozgan. A total of 18 different mutation specific  oligonucleotide primers were selected, covering approximately 90%  of the Dutch and 86% of the Iranian beta thalassemia mutations.

There  has been an increasing demand for rapid and accurate method for  scanning of point mutations in BRCA genes particularly. Meta PCR is a new method for creating chimeric DNA molecules  using a modified PCR reaction (Wallace et al 1999) that allows  maximizing the length of sequence that can be scanned by  downstream technique. Here we present data to demonstrate the assembles of exons 2,  20,23 and 24 of the BRCA1 gene and their subsequently analysis by  direct sequencing. The BRCA1 exons 2 and 20 are hot spot regions that are known  to harbour particularly deleterious mutations. In order to avoid  missing any mutation in these two exons, the above four exons were  assembled in the following order of preferences: 23 20, 2 and 24.  However, the order of fragments can be predetermined by primer  design. We verified by direct sequencing that the order and sequence of  the component exons in the Meta PCR products were as predicted.  Meta PCR products from three previously ascertained heterozygotes  for BRCA1 mutations were directly sequenced and gave the same  sequence patterns. Scanning of each exon of BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes individually  represent a tedious task. Meta PCR technique might be circumvents  this problem and is likely to be useful for clinical molecular diagnostic  laboratories, helping them to fulfil the demand for scanning of  complex genetic disease at the lower cost. v.r.yassaee@shef.ac.ukPosters   Techniques for Mutation Detection 292 293",2002

For large genes or large number of samples, this is a  time consuming process, necessitating methods that rapidly identify  DNA fragments containing mutations, the exact nature of which may  then be determined by DNA sequencing. One such screening method  is Single Strand Conformation Polymorphism (SSCP) analysis, in  which DNA fragments differing in only one nucleotide position may be  separated on the basis of sequence specific conformation of single  stranded DNA.

","Hereditary hearing loss (HHL) is one of the most common  congenital disorders and is highly heterogeneous. Mutations in  Connexin 26 (CX26) gene account for about 20% of all cases of  childhood deafness. This number approaches 50% in documented  recessive cases of non syndromic hearing loss. In addition, a single  mitochondrial DNA mutation, A1555G, in the 12S rRNA gene, is  associated with familial cases of progressive deafness. Effective  screening of populations for HHL necessitates rapid assessment  of several of these potential mutation sites. Pyrosequencing links  a DNA synthesis protocol for determining sequence information  to an enzyme cascade system which generates light whenever  pyrophosphate is released during primer strand elongation. We  assessed the ability of Pyrosequencing for detecting some of the  common mutations causing HHL. Genomic DNA samples were  collected from peripheral blood or dried blood spots using standard  protocols. Mitochondrial DNA was coisolated with total genomic  DNA. Detection of the most common CX26 mutations in individuals  of Caucasian (35delG), Ashkenazi (167delT) and Asian (235delC,  V37I) origins was confirmed by Pyrosequencing analysis. A total of  41 different mutations in CX26 gene and the mitochondrial A1555G  mutation were also confirmed.

Biancalana","Laboratoire de diagnostic gÃ©nÃ©tique, Strasbourg, France","Study of microsatellite (CA or tetra repeats) segregation around a  locus is a tool widely used. Traditionally, such a study is performed  with two flanking specific primers, one being labelled (radioactive  or fluorescent) for detection. Use of radioactivity is inconvenient  in a diagnostic setting, and implies an additional step of kination  for each microsatellite analysed. For fluorescent analysis on  automated sequencers, labelled primers are commercially available,  but are rather costly and have a limited lifetime. This aspect is a  real limitation when such primers are used infrequently for genetic  counselling of very rare diseases. For each microsatellite, we use its two unlabeled specific primers,  and a unique fluorescent primer, in an single reaction. One of  the specific flanking primers is tailed with a common 5â sequence  selected by Warner et al (1996) for the TP PCR technique. Primer  sequences were chosen in order to define the best combination  between one of the specific primer and the other with the  common tail. Detection is achieved with a fluoresceinated primer  corresponding to this common sequence. In the early amplification  cycles, specific primers give rise to a product with the tail. A particular  molar ratio of primers ensures that the specific primer with the  tail is exhausted in the early amplification cycles. This allows the  fluoresceinated primer to amplify preferentially from the end of  products from previous amplification rounds.We have validated this strategy for 55 microsatellites, most of them  on the X chromosome. We have tested successfully multiplex for up  to 4 microsatellites.",2002

In particular, analysis of single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) is expected to have an enormous impact  in future human medicine, e.g. by determination of risk factors for  common diseases, causes of multifactorial diseases, and modulators  of pharmacologic effects. MALDI TOF mass spectrometry has been shown to be one of the  most valid methods for SNP genotyping. Combination of analysis  speed, accuracy of results, cost effectiveness, and automation  capabilities makes MALDI TOF one of the most promising SNP  typing technologies for medical research and diagnostics. On  the other hand, drawbacks of the technique are complex sample  preparation and high purification requirements before MALDI  measurement. Here, we present a novel method for MALDI SNP typing sample  preparation, GenoSNIP. An UV cleavable site is introduced into  a primer which hybridizes adjacent to the polymorphic site. This  photolinker creates an abasic site in the primer and does not prevent  annealing to the target sequence. The primer is converted by single  nucleotide extension to products specific for the corresponding  alleles. Subsequently, these products are cleaved by UV light  resulting in very small molecules, usually pentamers, which can  be measured with very high sensitivity, accuracy, and resolution in  a MALDI TOF MS instrument. We present different designs of the  GenoSNIP assay including a simple pipetting protocol which is fully  compatible with the 384 microtiterplate format.

Firstly, 256 oligonucleotides, consisting of constant GAATTC part in  5âend and a variable 3â end part, containing all possible tetramers,  were chosen. Twenty synthetic oligonucleotides of 50bp length,  containing EcoRI restriction site, were used as templates in this  system. Reaction mixture for APEX contained all four fluorescently  labeled ddNTP s, thermostable DNA polymerase and denatured  templates. During optimization different template concentrations  were tested at temperatures ranging 20Â°C   45Â°C. The nucleotide  in the fifth position from the EcoRI site was correctly identified in all  templates. Secondly, to further improve APEX specificity with thermostable  DNA polymerase, we tried to raise Tmâs of 10 mers by including  one, two or three LNA monomers into different positions of  three oligonucleotides. The reactivity of original and modified  oligonucleotides was tested in APEX and hybridization experiments  at temperatures ranging 30Â°C   50Â°C. Fluorescence signals were  scanned by Array Scanner 428 and quantitated by ArrayPro Analyzer 4.0 software. Contrary to expectations, LNA oligonucleotides  produced weaker signals than normal 10 mers in APEX reactions. At  the same time LNA oligonucleotides gave equal or 2 6 times higher  signals in hybridization. Probably LNA monomers interfere in DNA  polymerase reaction with such oligonucleotides. In conclusion, 10 mers could be effectively used for APEX method  in oligonucleotide microarray format on glass slides.

Bakker","Leiden University Medical Center, Leiden, Netherlands","The identification of disease causing small mutations in human  genetic diseases is generally performed using indirect mutation  scanning techniques such as SSCA, DGGE or DHPLC and  subsequent sequencing of PCR amplified products. Direct  sequencing is relatively straightforward and therefore suitable  for automation of the complete procedure from reaction setup  to purification of PCR products and sequencing reaction. The  availability of automated pipetting stations and large capacity DNA   sequencers enables the use of this method for high throughput  mutation scanning. However, a major drawback of this approach is  the large amount of sequence data to be analyzed both efficiently  and accurately. Furthermore, the available sequence analysis  software is usually not developed for comparative mutational  analysis and therefore not entirely suitable. Recently the SeqScapeTM  software (Applied Biosystems) was introduced, allowing base calling,  sequence assembly, alignment and comparison, all combined in one  analysis. Prior to the analysis, for each amplicon a fragment specifi c  analysis definition is setup containing analysis defaults, reference  sequence and base variants previously identified. This results in  clean sequence data and easy identification and characterization of  homo  and heterozygous base variants and has led to a significant  reduction in manual data editing in our laboratory. However, for  correct identification of heterozygous deletion or insertion mutations,  extended data management and quality assurance improvements are  required.

To  identify genes, survival is modeled (Cox proportional hazards) as a  function of sets of gene expression levels. In its simplest version, the  modeling is done one gene at a time. Prioritizing results for follow up  requires a realistic assessment of the significance of a relevant test  statistic for the thousands of simultaneous comparisons made with a  typical microarray. We have studied the performance of several multiple testing  procedures for survival data (including Bonferroni, Westfall and  Young maxT family wise error rate (FWER) controlling procedure,  and Benjamini and Hochberg false discovery rate (FDR) controlling procedure). We illustrate their use on two publicly available cancer  microarray datasets: a melanoma dataset with survival and gene  expression measurements for 15 individuals on 3613 genes; and  a lymphoma dataset with 40 individuals and 4026 genes. Although  there are several unadjusted p values smaller than 0.01, none of  the genes appears particularly promising once adjustment is made  for multiple testing. The lack of significant findings with either the  FWER or FDR controlling procedures could be due to the small  sample size, but also points to limitations of current approaches.  Firstly, FWER controlling procedures may simply be too stringent in  some microarray applications. Secondly, FDR controlling procedures,  while less conservative than FWER controlling procedures, need  to be refined to take into account the joint distribution of the gene  expression levels.",2002

Inoko2","1Tokai University, Hachiouji, Tokyo, Japan, 2Tokai University, Isehara,  Japan","The aim of this study is to exclusively identify genes related to  coronary atherosclerosis and aortic aneurysm by genome wide  association analysis using polymorphic microsatellite markers.  Microsatellite markers showed linkage disequilibria with disease  related alleles spanning from 100 to 200 kilobases (kb). For the  purpose of genome wide association studies, we finished identifying  30,000 polymorphic microsatellite markers from the human genome  draft sequence which can cover whole genome. We then genotyped  pooled DNA from 100 to 200 healthy Japanese individuals using  those markers to confirm microsatellite polymorphism, allele  frequency and heterozygosity. We have simultaneously started to  apply those markers to conduct a genome wide association study  of atherosclerosis susceptibility genes. We also investigated gene  expression in aortic aneurysm tissue using GeneChip (Affymetrix) U95 sets. We report here our findings to date of different susceptibility locations  within the genome. For example, we found strong association in the  area from 7q32.3 to 7q36.3 confirmed by two different normal and  diseased DNA pools. By narrowing the area, we believe there should  be unknown gene related to coronary atherosclerosis. In addition,  we found about 4700 known genes expressed in aortic aneurysm Posters   Techniques for Mutation Detection 298 299 tissue. Genes of osteopontin, apolipoprotein E, metalloproteinases  and cathepsin D were highly upregulated. We believe the information  gathered from DNA microarray technology would complement our  genome wide association studies.

","Sequence variants in the human genome are responsible for the  genetic component of disease, individuality and drug response.  In order to find associations between SNPs and phenotype, large  sample sets need to be genotyped with high density markers.  With chromosome 22 fully sequenced and a SNP map constructed  across 22q, we have performed genotyping of Estonian and German  samples and CEPH families with 1279 SNP markers. An array with  5200 oligonucleotides was designed to genotype each SNP twice  from both DNA strands simultaneously using APEX technology. Allele  frequencies, Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and heterozygosities were  calculated for each genotyped marker. We have characterised the patterns of linkage disequilibrium and  calculated Dâ for the whole 33Mb of chromosome 22. Our results  demonstrated that along the chromosome the pattern of LD is highly  variable, where regions of high LD are interspersed with regions of  little or no detectable LD. It appears that SNPs from public databases  will need additional testing in order to find out useful SNPs in respect  of genotyping technology. Construction of LD maps across the human  genome and identifying haplotypes in individual genomic regions will  facilitate the identification and characterization of genetic variants  responsible for common complex diseases.",2002

","The MassARRAYâ¢ System is widely used to do high throughput  scoring of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) using the  MassEXTENDâ¢ assay. A new application for high throughput genetic  analysis is presented which we call Fragmentation. Single stranded  nucleic acid is created and in four separate reactions fragmented at  positions corresponding to each of the four bases. Using a reference  sequence, such as the now available human genome, the precision,  accuracy, and resolution of MALDI TOF Mass Spectrometry allows  one to definitively identify each resulting peak. Taken together, the  collection of peaks creates a sort of biological barcode that supports  high throughput typing. It also allows one to quickly and accurately  perform sequence validation, key to many European patents. Recent  software developments now also allow us to use this technology  in high throughput, targeted SNP discovery. In contrast to other  techniques such as SSCP and dHPLC, in the majority of the cases  Fragmentation not only detects SNPs, but can also definitively  identify and locate the polymorphisms. This allows for the facile and  quick design of a MassEXTEND assay for accurate, high throughput  SNP scoring.",2002
Development and application of a cytochrome b  SNP microarray to screen patients with mitochondrial  complex III deficiency,P1060.,"A. Nuber1, F. Erdogan1, F. A. Hol2, H. H. Ropers1","1MPI for Molecular Genetics, Berlin, Germany, 2University Medical  Center Nijmegen, Nijmegen, Netherlands","Complex III is the second enzyme in the electron transport chain  of mitochondrial oxidative phosphorylation, and consists of several  polypeptide subunits. One of these, cytochrome b, is encoded by  mitochondrial (mt) DNA. So far, mutations in MTCYB and a nuclear  encoded gene, BCS1L, have been found as cause of complex III  deficiency. Patients with cytochrome b mutations may show widely  varying clinical phenotypes, ranging from pure exercise intolerance to multisystem abnormalities, and the clinical findings also overlap  with other mitochondrial diseases. These disorders are therefore  best classified on the basis of pathogenic mtDNA variations. In order  to systematically screen patients with biochemically determined or  suspected complex III deficiency for single nucleotide DNA variations,  we have established a cytochrome b SNP microarray. This tool  consists of covalently attached allele specific primers representing  all 90 SNPs and mutations of MTCYB found to date. In contrast to  other SNP detection methods, only one PCR product comprising the  complete MTCYB mtDNA and therefore all variations, is used as a  target. The subsequent primer elongation protocol allows the typing  of all 90 variations in one reaction. To test if this method is suitable  for detecting heteroplasmy, we have mixed MTCYB DNA targets  with known polymorphisms from two different samples. Material from  approximately 70 patients is currently being analysed to detect novel  cytochrome b phenotype genotype correlations. Our next aim will be the extension of this microarray to cover mtDNA   encoded polypeptides of complex I.",2002

Several different databases now contain millions  of candidate SNPs. In order to realize the full potential of SNP   genotyping in large scale population studies, sensitive, accurate  and cost effective methods have to be established for scoring SNP  genotypes. We have developed a ligation/PCR based assay (OLA/ PCR) that uses a universal DNA microarray for SNP specific assay  product identification. Genomic DNA is interrogated with multiplex  sets of ligation probes specific for selected SNP loci. After ligation,  the resulting products are simultaneously amplified in a universal  PCR reaction. The minimum single tube multiplex level has been  shown to be ~50 loci, translating into a consumption of approximately  1 ng of gDNA per SNP genotype. We have assembled several  multiplexes and tested these against 28 different CEPH DNA samples  to demonstrate the feasibility of this approach. We will present data  that describe the reproducibility and accuracy of this assay. P 23. Therapy for Genetic Disorder",2002

Recent studies showed that BRCA1  (BReast CAncer 1) is part of  a multiprotein complex called BASC, involved in recognition and  repair of aberrant DNA structures such as the double strands breaks  induced by X ray irradiation. Aim of the study: to determine the role of BRCA1  expression in the  radioresistance of melanoma cell lines. Materials and Methods: The A375 melanoma cell line was transfected  with a vector expressing an anti  BRCA1  ribozyme. Clones with  diminished mRNA expression determined by real time quantitative  RTPCR were irradiated and cell survival assays performed. Results: Two clones, c88 and c91, exhibited a residual BRCA1   expression of 60% and 50% respectively. Both had increased  radiosensitivity compared to non transfected lines and lines  transfected with the vector alone. Clone 88 was cultivated for two  months, after which it recovered a normal BRCA1  level of expression  and interestingly also its radioresistance. Discussion: Our data suggest that in melanoma as it has been shown  in BRCA1  mutated breast cell lines, BRCA1  expression is involved in  radioresistance.

Aim: to assess the clinical impact of the administration of  bisphosphonates in Croatian OI patients. Methods: We report results of 1 3 years treatment with intravenous  pamidronate (APD) in seven children (four girls) of age 3 months    11 years at entry, with severe OI. Pamidronate was administered in  cycles as monthly infusions at a daily dose of 1 1,5 mg/kg during 6  months following pause for three months, or the same dose for three  days every four months. Results: Following treatment DEXA measurements showed a  gradual increase in bone density in all patients. Number of confi rmed  fractures decreased in all. The reduction in pain and improvement  in well being and ability were impressive in two boys who had been  confined to a wheelchair and now they walk using crutches. Acute  phase reactions were noted during first infusion cycle in two children  and asymptomatic hypocalcemia in three children. Three children  gained excessive weight.

However, the technique has not yet held its promises in  the fields of transgenics and gene therapy, and some groups reported  persistent failures. In order to implement the technique in our laboratory, we targeted  the HPRT gene. HPRT+ and HPRT  cells can be readily selected in  HAT and in 6 thioguanine (6 TG) medium, respectively. The gene  is expressed ubiquitously and is located on the X chromosome so  that only one allele is to be mutated in male (XY) cells.

W e  introduced mutated and control RDOs in human male, diploid cell  lines by transfection or direct microinjection. In all experiments we  failed to observe any significant difference in the number of 6 TG  resistant clones between controls and RDO treated cells. Moreover ,  resistant clones did not result from specific mutagenesis but merely  from the background noise of the selection process. Our experiments were designed to meet criteria defined to address  criticisms expressed about early reports dealing with RDOs. In view  of potential artifacts and the lack of reproducibility of published  reports, we consider that conversion mediated by chimeric RDOs still  awaits validation. We hope that confrontation of negative as well as  positive results will help solving the problem of reproducibility of this  potentially promising methodology.",2002

Two patients  are treated with rhGAA derived from milk of transgenic rabbits 40  mg/kg IV weekly and two patients with CHO cell derived rhGAA 10  mg/kg IV weekly. Safety is evaluated by recording adverse events,  vital signs, physical examination, antibodies to rhGAA and routine  clinical lab tests. Clinical efficacy endpoints include ventilator free  survival, left ventricular mass, motor and cognitive development,  and growth. Muscle biopsies are performed at baseline, 3 months,  and 12 months. Two patients have been treated for more than one  year and two for three months by now (mean age at enrollment 6,6  months, range 2,6 14,5). Results : Initial safety data indicates that  the treatment is generally well tolerated. There has been an overall  improvement in left ventricular mass, cardiac function, skeletal  muscle function and histologic appearance as evidenced by reduction  of muscle glycogen. Younger patients and those with less advanced  disease have shown the best clinical response. Conclusions : Our  data suggest that rhGAA appears to be well tolerated and capable  of improving cardiac status and skeletal muscle function in patients  with classical infantile Pompe disease.

Peterlin1","1Division of Medical Genetics, Department of Obstetrics and  Gynecology, University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia,  2Andrology Centre, Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology,  University Medical Centre, Ljubljana, Slovenia","BACKGROUND. The clinical picture of trinucleotide repeat diseases:  myotonic dystrophy type 1 (DM1), fragile XA syndrome (FraXA) and  spinobulbar muscular atrophy (SBMA), is manifested as reduced  infertility in men. The principle feature in adults with severe form  of DM1 and SBMA is testicular atrophy, and for FraXA syndrome  macroorchidism is characteristic. Several studies have reported  that fertile males with a higher number of CAG repeats in normal  range of androgen receptor have an increased risk of impaired  spermatogenesis. In DM1 hypergonadotropic hypogonadism, leading  to azoospermia and impotence, is frequently observed. An increased  number of CTG repeat in infertile males could represent a risk of DM1  among offspring conceived by intracytoplasmic injection of sperm  (ICSI). The aim of this study was to compare the distribution of number of  CTG repeats in normal range between infertile and fertile group of  males to evaluate the involvement of CTG repeat number in male  infertility. PATIENTS. The number of CTG repeats in 107 infertile men (38  with azoospermia and 69 with oligoasthenoteratozoospermia), ICSI  candidates, and in 102 fertile men with no sign of myotonia or muscle  weakness was determined. RESULTS. Among infertile males no premutation or mutation carriers  were found. The distribution of the number of CTG repeats compared  between infertile and fertile males was not statistically signifi cant (p =  0.825). CONCLUSION. We conclude that the number of CTG repeats in  normal range does not contribute to male infertility. Moreover, this  results show that increased risk of DM1 among offspring conceived  by ICSI is unlikely.",2002
Risk of sex chromosome mosaicism associated  with Y chromosome AZFc microdeletions,P1081.,"C. Patsalis1, C. Sismani1, A. Ioulianos1, C. Eftychi1, C. Krausz2, L.  Quintana Murci2, K. McElreavey2","1The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus,  2Institut Pasteur, Paris, France","Deletions of specific Y chromosome regions cause male infertility.  Recent advances in infertility treatment permits deleted Y  chromosomes to be transmitted to male offspring with the assumption  that there will be no clinical consequences other than infertility in adult  life. Recent data suggested that sex chromosome mosaicism could  arise when AZFc deleted Y chromosomes are transmitted from one  generation to another by ICSI. If this hypothesis is correct, it raises  the possibility that some patients with 45,X/46,XY karyotypes, such Posters   Y chromosome, Infertility304 305 as patients with Turner related phenotypes or sexual ambiguities may  in fact harbour Y chromosome microdeletions. To test this hypothesis,  we screened a group of patients with a 45,X/46,XY karyotype for Y  microdeletions using several Y specific markers. We show that 33%  of patients presenting with Turner stigmata and/or sexual ambiguities  and a 45,X/46,XY karyotype, carried Y chromosome microdeletions  of distal Yq. These results highlight a potential risk for offspring born  to fathers carrying Y chromosome microdeletions and treated by  assisted reproductive techniques. The risk is the development of sex  chromosome aneuploidy during foetal and embryonic development.  The clinical consequences of this can be severe, including Turner  syndrome, mixed gonadal dysgenesis, male pseudohermaphroditism  and rarely mild mental retardation or autism. Our data may also  explain in part the observation that in almost three quarters of all 45,X  patients with Turner syndrome, the X chromosome is maternal in  origin. Concluding, the transmission of Y chromosome microdeletions  could potentially have more severe clinical consequences other than  male infertility, such as the development of sexual ambiguities and/or  Turner stigmata.",2002

In order to elucidate the above debate,  we designed a national based population screening with well defined  study and experimental criteria. Eighty Greek Cypriot patients that  met the selection criteria were included in this study as well as 50  normal controls with proven fertility.

The data show that MFS represents  a significant burden on many aspects of daily life but that most  individuals are coping effectively with the disorder. The level of coping  and the quality of life is determined by the subjective rather than by  the objective severity. The subjective attitude towards the condition  influences the attitude towards professional activities, relationships  and reproductive options. Many individuals have difficulties  discussing problems associated with the MFS.

The aim of the study presented here  is to investigate long term psychological and social consequences  of living with the knowledge of FAP running in the family. The main  interest is to analyse the influence of genetic knowledge concerning  reproductive decisions. Method: 16 affected people from all over Germany were asked to tell  their life histories in order to investigate how people suffering from  FAP live with their genetic knowledge. The qualitative evaluation of  transcripts of the interviews followed the methodology of narrative  biographical analysis developed by G. Rosenthal (1995). Findings: All people investigated have learned to manage their  own disease during their disease trajectories and to get over the  uncertainties concerning their own health. However, the possibility  to pass on or to have passed on the mutated APC gen to the  children remains a steady cause of uncertainty which is a major  problem living with FAP. Four different types of strategies to cope  with this uncertainty were found which have different consequences  concerning reproductive decisions or explaining facts of FAP to the  children. Due to the biographical approach of the analysis it is shown  that the coping strategies mainly depend on individual experiences  rather than on rational considerations concerning the genetic disease. Conclusion: The individual case history has more influence on  reproductive decisions and health care behaviour than rational  genetic considerations. This must be considered in counselling  models.

Previous research has explored the psychological and mental health  aspects of having a skeletal dysplasia and has highlighted a range  of difficulties particularly in adolescents. (Apajasalo et al., 1998;  Hunter, 1998 and Vallmitjana, 1999). However, these studies relied  upon quantitative measures. A qualitative methodological approach  is effective in giving a fuller picture of the subjective experiences.  A pilot sample consisting of both adolescents, older adults and  parents (n=19) were interviewed using the constant comparative  method with theoretical sampling derived from Grounded Theory  (Glaser and Strauss, 1967; Strauss and Corbin, 1998) in order  to identify key areas of concern. Analysis was performed using  Atlas.ti software based on grounded theory principles, effective  for qualitative analysis. Three major categories of themes were  elicited. Firstly, the effect of the disorder on the psychological and  social well being of the individual when living with a conditon of this  nature. The other two major themes concerned aspects of medical  care and issues surrounding genetic diagnosis and testing. The data  suggests that both psycho social and practical benefits and problems  are associated with molecular diagnosis for the patients and their  families, important for the future direction of healthcare service  provision.

Overall scores for quality of life (QOL)  as well as scores in each of the four subdomains were significantly  lower in affected individuals than in the relatives. Lower self  esteem scores, affected status, and lower income were the most  significant predictors of a reduced quality of life index. A qualitative  analysis of open responses to questions about the advantages and  disadvantages of achondroplasia revealed that individuals were as  likely to cite disadvantages relating to their health and functioning  as they were to cite social disadvantages. Affected individualsâ  reduction in quality of life, lower than that which would be expected  by relevant sociodemographic variables, can be interpreted to be a  result of negative factors relating to social constraints on living in an  average sized world.

Purpose  To test the hypothesis that a diagnosis of familial EMPAG Plenary Sessions306 307 hypercholesterolaemia (FH) incorporating genetic testing reduces  perceptions of control over FH and adherence to risk reducing  behaviour. Method 340 families (340 FH probands and 129 adult relatives) were  randomised to: Routine clinical diagnosis; or Routine clinical  diagnosis plus genetic testing (mutation searching in patients  and direct gene testing in relatives). Outcomes were assessed at  baseline, one week and six months after diagnostic testing. Results 81% of probands and 73% of relatives completed the trial. Mutations  were found in 29% of the 196 probands undergoing mutation  searches and in 46% of the 37 relatives undergoing direct gene  testing. The diagnosis of FH where a mutation was found had no  impact on perceived control or adherence to risk reducing behaviour  at either time point, compared with a non genetic diagnosis of FH.  By contrast, for those in whom a mutation search was unsuccessful,  perceived control over FH and heart disease was lower one week  after testing, but not at six months. Conclusion The hypothesis was not supported. Future studies are needed to  determine whether similar results are obtained in general populations  undergoing genetic testing to learn of increased risks for early heart  disease and other conditions.

Methods: Subjects are parents(n = 41) who applied for genetic  testing of their children less than 16 years old. Before and two weeks  after DNA test disclosure these parents completed questionnaires  that assess levels of anxiety related to the test disclosure (IES),  depression (BDI) and general anxiety (STAI). Results: All parents showed high levels of distress at predisclosure  measurement. After disclosure, parents of carrier children (n = 24)  had significantly higher scores on the IES (t = 5.03, P = .000), the BDI  (t = 2.65, P = .013) and on the STAI s (t = 2.34, P = .031) compared  with parents without a carrier child (n = 12). After disclosure, the  percentage of parents of child carriers with high or very high scores  in comparison with the normal population on the distress measures is  considerable: 41 % had IES scores indicating a traumatic impact, 29  % of the carriers had BDI scores indicating depression and 53 % had  STAI scores indicating a high level of general anxiety. Conclusion: High levels of psychological distress in our group  may reflect great suffering for having a child with a life threatening  inherited arrhythmia. Whether the high levels of distress in these  parents can be valued as a sign of maladjustment is dependent on  the outcome of a follow up study. E",2002
Interactional framing of decision making and  coping trajectories in counselling for predictive testing  for Huntingtonâs Disease,PS07.,"Sarangi1, K. Bennert1, L. Howell1, A. Clarke2, P. Harper2, J. Gray2","1Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom, 2Institute of Medical  Genetics, Cardiff, United Kingdom","Genetic professionals and clients in Huntingtonâs clinics may  assign different meanings to the extended format of the counselling  protocols for predictive testing. While counsellors typically see their  role as following a specific agenda for the evaluation of clientsâ  understanding of predictive testing, including possible results and  their implications for families, clients may regard their experience of  protocols as of a gatekeeping nature that need to be complied with to  gain access to testing. We use discourse analytic methods to examine the interactionally  complex framing of clientsâ decision making and coping trajectories,  as prompted by counsellorsâ agenda driven probing. The notion of frame is taken from Goffman (1974:21) to denote `schemata of  interpretationâ that enable participants`to locate, perceive, identify,  and labelâ occurrences and events within their everyday life spaces.  The data includes over 40 detailed transcripts of audio recorded  pre test sessions for HD involving 15 families in Wales. Our analysis  suggests that the pre test counselling sessions are predominantly  oriented towards a display of clientsâ (i) accounts of the trajectories  that underpin their current decisions about having or not having a  predictive test, and (ii) reflections on how they are prepared to cope  with the future implications a positive or negative test result may  have upon themselves and their families. The analytic focus will be  the incidences of misalignments in counsellorsâ attempts to facilitate  clientsâ accounts of decision making and coping   both retrospectively  and prospectively   and in clientsâ differential orientations to the  temporal dimensions of their experience of living with the genetic  condition.

Methods: The 5 year assessment is an extensive psychological  evaluation of tested persons (24 carriers, 33 non carriers), using  psychometric tests and qualitative measures. Some of these tests  had also been administered at baseline and 1 year post test. Results: Carriers did not differ from non carriers with regard to  general distress. With regard to specific distress, carriers had  significantly more avoidance behaviour and had less positive feelings  about their test result than non carriers five years post test. The study  further showed that mean depression level, general and HD specifi c  anxiety had significantly decreased at the 5 year assessment,  compared with the baseline level. The evolution did not significantly  differ for carriers and non carriers. We found clear evidence  for the role of the participantâs test motivation in psychological  distress. Persons who asked the test to get rid of the uncertainty ,  without specifying implications for substantial life areas, had more  psychological distress before and after the test, compared to those  who wanted the test to take action in an important life domain.  Moreover, the pattern of distress differed over time, depending on the  test motivation. Implications of the findings for pre and post test counselling will be  discussed. E",2002
"Damned if you do, damned if you donât: the role  of religious faith in predictive and diagnostic testing for  Huntingtonâs disease",PS09.,"A. Simpson , L. Emslie, Z. Miedzybrodzka","Grampian University Hospitals Trust, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","Presymptomatic predictive testing for Huntingtonâs disease (HD)  has been provided for those at risk of this neurodegenerative  disease for more than 15 years at centres throughout the world.  Professionals from the international community, with family members,  created a code of practice which is adhered to in most centres  world wide. Despite cultural differences, this protocol has been  remarkably successful in ensuring support for those who seek to  know whether or not they have the mutation for HD. Guidance for the  test suggests pre test discussion ought to take place about issues  involving family relationships, potential insurance problems, and  employment difficulties, but religious faith is generally not included  as a discussion topic. The role of spirituality in health and well being  has been extensively explored in the medical literature, and in the  field of prediction for cancer risk. Religious faith has been noted to  be important in providing support after a predictive test result for HD,  but there is no discussion about the role of religion in the decision  making process. This paper will discuss the literature and give four EMPAG Plenary Sessions308 309 case histories where issues surrounding religious faith have caused  significant difficulties for the individuals who underwent predictive or  diagnostic testing whether or not favourable or unfavourable results  were produced.

Provision of Genetic Services in Europe: Do we  meet the Community Needs?,PS10.,Ayme,"INSERM SC11, Paris, France","Genetics and biotechnology provide us with new diagnostic tests  (around 600 genetic diseases can be accurately diagnosed) and  much needed therapeutic tools (around 100 diseases are now  treated with a specific drug) , but health technology, practices and  procedures cannot be left to the vagaries of economic forces and  personal interests. There appears to be tendency to adopt the  new applications of molecular genetics without always providing  appropriate information and counselling. There are profound  economic and technological inequalities between countries  and population groups within Europe. Efforts must be made to  propose and harmonize safeguards so that such inequalities are  not aggravated, that the safety and rights of all individuals and  communities are adequately protected. The rapidity and complexity of the progress made in the field  of human genetics generates the need to evaluate, apply and  disseminate new techniques by skilled health professionals and an  informed public. Medical genetic services are rapidly extending but  there is concern about rising demand, inadequate infrastructures and  the ethical and social implications of the changes.Genetic screening  at the population level is expending rapidly, before an appropriate  evaluation. Not only should genetic screening do more good than  harm at a population level, it would do well to make individual sense  to the person being screened. The availability of genetic tests at low  cost may lead to the systematic offer of screening tests without the  appropriate medical environment for providing information prior to  testing as well as comprehensively explaining the results afterwards.

The universality of the human issues raised by  genetics,PS11.,"Clancy1, B. Pooe Monyemore2, N. Madolo2","1Regional Genetic Service and Academic Group of Medical Genetics,  Manchester, United Kingdom, 2Human Genetics, Department of  Health, Pretoria, SOUTH AFRICA","The priority that governments can give to genetic services varies  between countries, particularly between those in the developing  and the developed world. This is determined by factors including  overall resources available and competing priorities. In August 2001,  the Department of Health of the Republic of South Africa (RSA)  announced the launch of the âHuman Genetics Policy Guidelines for  the Management and Prevention of Genetic Disorders, Birth Defects  and Disabilitiesâ. Alongside this, genetics training courses for nurses  and midwives from the nine provinces took place with the support  of the World Health Organisation. Three of the one week courses,  involving colleagues from eight of the provinces, were organised  jointly by the Department of Health (RSA) and the Department of  Clinical Genetics, St Maryâs Hospital, Manchester (UK). The format  and content of the training will be outlined. Both the resources  available to and the cultural issues facing colleagues in RSA and the  UK are different. However, examples will be presented to illustrate  that the psychosocial impact of inherited disorders and birth defects  are similar in the two countries. This suggests that while different  priorities need to be set for genetic services in the developing and  the developed world, the human issues raised for families and  professionals are universal.

Twenty years of social work in clinical genetics  in the Netherlands: Where do we stand and what do we  need in the future,PS12.,"G. Van Spijker1, T. Brouwer2","1University Medical Centre, Utrecht, Netherlands, 2University Medical  Centre VU, Amsterdam, Netherlands","From its beginning as a profession, social work has demonstrated a  strong commitment to serving individuals and families whose health problems have influenced their psychosocial functioning in serious  ways. In most clinical genetic centres in the Netherlands there are  social workers involved in the genetic testing programs who provide  psycho education and support. Although the role of social workers  in the psychosocial counselling for individuals and their families  is widely accepted, there are only a few practice based research  reports. In the Netherlands, the number of social workers in the clinical  genetic centres has doubled in the last fifteen years. They offer  individual support to counselees and their partners, they participate  in formulating counselling protocols, and they develop models for  professional help and psycho education. Recently it has become evident that a job description was needed  to define the core competencies of the position for other (health)  professionals, both in the field of clinical genetics and externally. The  areas of results are well defined in the job description so it is now  clear in which areas specific to genetics a social worker can offer  help. From a joint inventory of the activities carried out in recent years, we  present an overview of the type of help most frequently requested  and offered. Moreover, this inventory reveals which results from the  psychological research in genetics have proved to be most useful  in social work practice. It also reveals what issues we would like the  research to focus on in the next ten years. E",2002
A randomized trial of three approaches to  genetic counselling for late maternal age.,PS13.,"E. Allanson , M. Cappelli, T. Chiu, L. Humphreys, A. Hunter, D.  Moher, A. Zimak","Childrenâs Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada","Few outcome studies of genetic counselling for late maternal age  have been reported, yet a significant proportion of pregnant women  35 and over are offered prenatal diagnosis; most will have genetic  counselling prior to testing; these women must make complex  decisions; and considerable resources are committed to this service.  In our region, population 1.4 million, virtually all women are seen  by a genetic counsellor before their first prenatal test. In 2000,  1149 women were counselled. Before 1999, counselling occurred  in a one on one session. In the late â90s we developed a decision  aid to facilitate communication of facts about prenatal diagnostic  tests, focus patient views, and aid choice of testing. In a trial of that  decision aid, knowledge significantly increased, decisional conflict  significantly decreased, anxiety about testing did not change,  and acceptability was reasonably high. In 2000, we initiated a  randomized controlled trial to compare one on one counselling,  group counselling of 4 women/couples, and use of the decision aid.  All three approaches had the same content. We hypothesized that  counselling in any form would improve knowledge, reduce decisional  uncertainty and reduce levels of distress associated with prenatal  testing. Secondly, we hypothesized that there would be no statistical  or clinically significant difference between the three groups. Our  results demonstrate that each approach has itâs advantages: although  people prefer one on one counselling, they learn best in a group or  decision aid setting, and the least decisional conflict is found with the  decision aid. Importantly, we find no clinically significant difference  between the three approaches. EMPAG Concurrent Sessions E C 1. Screening Issues E",2002

Methods  A questionnaire developed by Hofman et al (Acad Med  1993; 68: 625 32) containing questions about knowledge and  attitudes towards genetics (tests) was adapted to the Dutch health  care system. Questionnaires were sent to randomly selected GPs  (n=200), GYs (n=300) and PEDs (n=265). Multiple logistic regression EMPAG Concurrent Sessions308 309 identified predictors of positive attitudes towards CF carrier  screening. Results  The response rate of GPs, GYs and PEDs was 64%, 69%  and 72%, respectively. Of the respondents 63% of GPs, 69% of GYs  and 71% of PEDs agreed that couples should be tested if they ask  for it. Of the respondents 32% of GPs, 40% of GYs and 32% of PEDs  favored routine screening when a hypothetical error free inexpensive  test would be available. However, after explaining limitations in the  test sensitivity (95% detection rate for individuals) these percentages  decreased to 16%, 19% and 25%, respectively. Predictors for  offering routinely CF carrier screening in the latter situation were [OR  (95%CI)]: considering the test sensitivity less important (GPs: [4.2  (1.4 12.3)]; GYs [6.2(1.9 20.7)]), high perceived risk of having a child  with CF (GYs: [4.0 (1.2 13.9)]), providing genetic counseling (PEDs:  [4.2 (1.2 15.0)]) and reassurance when both partners test negative  (PEDs: [4.3 (1.6 11.8)]).

Initial enthusiasm for  screening to increase early diagnosis has been modified since the  identification of the HFE gene. The risk of disease attributable to  the at risk genotypes, and disease progression in those diagnosed  is not established. Screening trials will identify individuals in whom  these questions can be evaluated. Evaluation of these programmes  should include evaluation of sensitivity and specificity and all the  components of the programme e.g. uptake, population characteristics  and effectiveness of treatment. Design : Randomised controlled trial of two screening strategies. a) Biochemical screening for iron overload followed by genetic  analysis and clinical assessment b) Genetic screening for the at risk genotype followed by biochemical  testing for iron overload and clinical assessment. Sample : General practice population aged 30 70 stratified by age  and sex Findings : 1438 individuals were invited; initial acceptance was  approximately 30%. Uptake was higher in females than males,  specifically in older females. Middle aged men who would be  expected to have a higher risk of expressing the at risk genotypes  were less likely to accept the offer of screening. The allele frequencies for the haemochromatosis associated alleles  were greater than would be expected from previous population  studies. Discussion: In this pilot of population based screening in primary  care, the low uptake of screening and the characteristics of the  population that accepted screening have implications for the design  of treatment or screening trials for haemochromatosis that merit  further investigation.

Coping strategies of pregnant women after âtriple  diagnosticâ and those of their partners,C03.,"Jahn , F. R. Kreuz","Technical University, Dresden, Germany","Objective:  To compare coping strategies of pregnant women after  the triple diagnostic and of their partners. To point out the importance  of the genetic counselling. Background:  The triple diagnostic has  become a standard prenatal screening method and involves a  combination of three serum parameters with personal data to define  the individualâs probability for a fetal trisomy 21. This screening often  takes place without giving sufficient information. A âbad resultâ is  mostly equated with a handicapped child. Methods:  Our investigation  was carried out by questionnaires. The answers of 92 women after  âtriple diagnosticâ, genetic counselling and prenatal diagnosis and  of 52 of their partners were evaluated. Results:  Only 2/3 of the women were given information about this screening method by  their gynaecologist. A quarter of the partners had been informed by  their wives or by the gynaecologist. Half of them had received this  information only at genetic counselling. After a pathological triple test,  86% of the pregnant women and 90% of their partners felt depressed;  2% felt activated. After genetic counselling, there was a significant  increase to the activated mood (women: 52% were depressed, 34%  felt activated; partners 58% and 40%). The coping strategies showed  the most significant variation in active coping: after risk information,  women 17%, partners 10%, and after prenatal diagnosis, 55%  and 45%. 25% of the pregnant women refused invasive prenatal  diagnosis after genetic counselling. Conclusion:  Genetic counselling  plays an important role in the development of positive coping  strategies. It should provide information and therapeutic support for  pregnant women and for their partners. E",2002
Serum screening uptake and attitudes towards  Downâs syndrome,C04.,"D. Bryant , J. M. Green, J.

However, very little is known  about the attitudes that women hold towards Downâs syndrome and  how such attitudes may influence screening choices. This paper  presents findings from a study based in an antenatal clinic in the  north of England where serum screening was offered to all women  attending for antenatal care. Over a six month period, women in the  first trimester of pregnancy were asked to complete a questionnaire  that incorporated measures of cognitive, emotional and experiential  aspects of attitudes towards Downâs syndrome. An objective measure  of the participantsâ serum screening uptake was then collected at a  later date from patient records. The findings suggest that regardless  of attitude towards Downâs syndrome most women accept screening  tests. All of the women with the most unfavourable attitudes towards  Downâs syndrome accepted screening as did 67% of those with  the most favourable attitudes   despite the latter group holding  unfavourable views towards termination for the condition. The  findings have implications for the issues of informed choice and the  perceived âroutinenessâ of prenatal screening tests. E C 2. Cultural and Ethical Issues E",2002

However, there is no published research on  whether women value informed consent for antenatal thalassaemia  carrier testing. Aims: To ascertain pregnant Pakistani womenâs perceived value of  âinformed consentâ for antenatal thalassaemia carrier testing and their  perceived pre test information needs. Methods: In study 1, 110 Pakistani women tested and not found  to be thalassaemia carriers completed a questionnaire, 14 of  whom were also interviewed. In study 2, 36 women identified as  carriers/possible carriers completed a questionnaire and were  interviewed. The questionnaires assessed womenâs knowledge and  understanding of antenatal tests; their attitudes toward antenatal care  and tests for fetal abnormality; their knowledge and understandings  of thalassaemia; and their pre test information preferences. The  interviews explored these domains in more depth and investigated  womenâs beliefs about âinformed consentâ. Findings: Women had received little or no pre test information and  said that they would have preferred to be informed that they were  being tested for thalassaemia carrier status, but they did not expect,  or express a desire, to be asked for their âinformed consentâ for  antenatal thalassaemia carrier testing. Discussion: While women wanted pre test information in order to  be âinformedâ of antenatal thalassaemia carrier testing, they were  less concerned about being asked for their âconsentâ.

Uses of the body and informed consent for  participants in predictive medicine research,C08.,Ducournau,"INSERM U558, Toulouse, France","On the occasion of the creation of a DNA bank for research in  predictive medicine in the south of France, this sociological study  deals with an ethical and juridical norm and its application: the  principle of free and informed consent of DNA donors participants.  This consent is often said to favour the expression of the patientsâ   âautonomyâ towards âmedical powerâ: it would make sure that  individual freedom in the uses of the body is put in confrontation  with the biomedical enterprise. Previous studies have addressed  the question of the quality of the consent given by participants. This  study rather addresses the way in which they âframeâ the consent  (they give a meaning and their position in relation to this meaning).  Not only their position regarding the procedure but also that towards  the concept of consent itself are investigated. The access to this  framing is achieved through thorough interviews (planed number =  50). This speech on consent is then mirrored with the participantsâ uses of the body (or elements issued from the body): these uses are  apprehended here through the meaning given by the DNA donors  to their involvement in research. The first results show different  typologies of the body usage: the body submitted to medical activity ,  the body medically auto supervised and âpropertyâ of the individual or  also the body subjected to collective interests. I will try to show that  these modalities of use involve different ways of understanding and of  using the principle of informed consent. E",2002
Am I My Brotherâs Keeper?: Outlining Rights and  Responsibilities in the Context of the Human Genome  Diversity Project,C09.,"K. Brewer1,2","1Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, 2De Paul College of Law,  Chicago, IL","There are many obstacles to continued scientific research, the  Human Genome Diversity Project (HGDP) specifically. The main  obstacles appear to be differing philosophies toward human rights  and responsibilities. On the one hand, Western researchers impute  ownership rights upon human body parts. This view is repugnant  to the culture and beliefs of many indigenous people. However,  indigenous peoples and some Western legal scholars maintain that  a duty exists for individuals to further the survival of others through  scientific research. Still, this duty conflicts with a duty that may exist  to future generations not to tinker with the common heritage. The  issue of human genetic diversity presents an interesting paradox:  genes are responsible for oneâs uniqueness, and simultaneously,  genes are an omnipotent component of every human being.  Achieving a balance between preserving the integrity of our genetic  heritage and granting ownership rights in furtherance of scientifi c  knowledge is a perplexing challenge. Yet, at least one group of  indigenous peoples has achieved such a balance, and they justified  their agreement by articulating a duty to others to help understand  and cure a particular disease. Perhaps if we all recognize that we  are our brotherâs keeper, we can work together to further the aims  of science while at the same time maintaining respect for proud  cultures. E C 3.

Myotonic Dystrophy and the marital relationship,C12.,"Rotteveel , A. R. Wintzen, A. Tibben","Leids Universitair Medisch Centrum, Leiden, Netherlands","Background:  Myotonic Dystrophy (MD) is a multi system disease with  symptoms including muscle weakness, especially in facial muscles  and distal extremities, cardiac and gastro intestinal problems.  Cerebral symptoms of MD include (daytime) sleepiness, loss of  energy, mental slowness and lack of initiative. Some studies suggest  a change of personality. Based on clinical findings 3 phenotypes have  been identified: mild, classical, and congenital. MD is inherited in an  autosomal dominant manner. Offspring of an affected individual have  a 50% chance of inheriting the causal mutation. These symptoms not only affect the patientsâ life but also that of their  spouses. Couples seem to respond to this variety of symptoms in  different ways. Some apparently cope with these problems and go  on living their (more or less adjusted) lives. Others express having  trouble in doing so and keep experiencing this trouble for a prolonged  period of time. Objectives: 1. How does MD influence the lives and relationships of patients? 2. Which factors contribute to peopleâs ability to overcome the  problems caused by MD? Methods:  100 patients of the outpatient clinic and their partners are  interviewed about their relationship and the way they feel it has been  affected by MD. Information on present symptoms of MD, personality,  coping style, family functioning, anxiety and depression is obtained  through questionnaires. While subjects watch funny pictures, facial  expressiveness is assessed by experienced judges. Results:  Until January, 57 patients (58% males) and their partners  (40% males) have enrolled.

Putting HD into words: exploring the virtual  narratives of the Italian HD support group online.,C13.,"Jacopini1, P. Zinzi1, A. Cordi2","1Institute of Psychology C.N.R., Rome, Italy, 2A.I.C.H. ROME, Rome,  Italy. ","Three years ago the Italian Association for Huntingtonâs Disease  (A.I.C.H. ROME) has developed a web site. It is a non commercial  service and is the result of patientsâand caregiversâ voluntary work. In  Italy it is the unique âinteractiveâ website for HD.  Beyond any expectation, this virtual community interested to/involved  with HD for many different reasons has been growing very rapidly:  from 6 contacts a week, when the site was started, up to 1600  contacts in one month (November 2001). Many messages have arrived: some messages are brief and simply  ask for information, other messages are rather long and are aimed at  sharing the intimate, emotional aspects of the individualâs experience  of the disease or at confronting with others about main life decisions  such as to be tested or not, having or not children, having or not  prenatal diagnosis, informing or not children about the disease in the  family and so on. These exchanges on line offer a unique opportunity of a glimpse  to the heart of a support group for a severe, incurable, hereditary  disease. A text analysis and a qualitative examination of the  messages are currently performed. Our first inquiries are aimed at: providing a description of this virtual community; analysing the  priorities given by the contributors to the different issues; exploring  the way they communicate their ideas and emotions about the disease.

Adult Survivors of child sex abuse in the genetic  counselling consultation,C14.,A. Falconer,"St James University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom","Given the prevalence of sexual abuse in our society, with a large  proportion of the abuse taking place within families, it is clear that any  health professional will be dealing with clients who are survivors of  childhood sex abuse. This paper explores how a pre history of childhood sexual abuse may  impact the genetic counselling consultation. The genetic counselling  situation is possibly the only one in which taking a family tree is such  a large part of the consultation. It can expose people to thinking  about their relationships within the family and bring forward painful  memories. A faulty gene running through the family can highlight the  legacy of abuse or the âinheritanceâ of the problems associated or  passed on with it. Implications for genetic counsellors discussed in this paper are: Disclosure of sexual abuse. The specific genetic implications of incest. Non disclosure of genetic information to family members because of  a history of abuse. Occasional cases of âmunchausens syndromeâ particularly where  prophylactic surgery may be considered have been reported.Could  some of these women have been sexually abused? One of the predictors of abnormal grief reaction following termination  of pregnancy is incest and sexual abuse. As genetic counsellors we  are often supporting women in this situation. E C 4.

Surveillance consists of bi annually physical examination  and yearly mammography and MRI scan. The estimated actual risk  of developing BC in terms of a cumulative life time risk (CLTR) is  trichotomiseda. Category 1 implies a CLTR of 60 85%, 2: 30 50%,  and 3: 15 30%. Objectives: Identify (a) the relation between CLTR, coping strategies  and psychological distress; (b) the relation between risk of developing  BC as perceived by the participant (adjusted for CLTR), coping  strategies and psychological distress. Methods: Participants completed a questionnaire 2 months prior to  their surveillance appointment, containing: the Hospital Anxiety and  Depression Scale, the Impact of Event Scale, the Psychological  Consequences Questionnaire and the Utrecht Coping List. The  participants perceived risk was measured in terms of cognition and affect. Multiple linear regression and polychotomous ordered logistic  regression analysis were used to identify the relationships between  actual and perceived risk on the one hand and psychological factors  on the other. Results: 241 women answered their baseline questionnaire (mean  age 40 years). 11% belong to category 1, 53% to category 2 and 36%  to category 3. CLTR is positively related to avoidance and negative psychological  consequences (p< 0.05). Perceived risk is positively related to a  depressive coping style (p < 0.02). Conclusion: Having a higher CLTR means displaying more avoidance  and experiencing more negative psychological consequences.  Women perceiving their risk of developing BC as high display a  depressive coping style.EMPAG Concurrent Sessions312 313 E",2002

However, there has been little research that  explores the meaning of risks for individuals who are deemed at  risk because of their family history, and none that has looked at how  women who have previously been affected with cancer make sense  of their (potentially) increased risks following DNA testing. This retrospective study of affected women who had undergone  BRCA1/2 mutation searching investigated their perceptions of  developing cancer. In depth interviews were undertaken with 30  women. These explored their risk perception and the impact of  genetic testing on their risk perception. The data suggest that following their initial diagnosisall women were  very aware of their recurrence risk. However, most reported that their  anxiety about developing cancer had decreased over time. For some  the probability of developing cancer was perceived as reducing over  time, whilst others described their risk of cancer as constant but their  ability to accommodate risk within their lives changed. Womenâs  understanding of their (potential) inherited risk of cancer involved  reconciling their previous experiences with their expectations of the  future. Thus, some women, did not regard genetic risk as a threat,  whilst others reported an increase in anxiety on learning their risks  of developing a second primary cancer. The implications of these  findings for theoretical accounts of risk perception will be discussed. E",2002

Evans3","1Regional Genetics Service and Academic Group of Medical Genetics, Manchester, United Kingdom, 2Oxford Regional Genetics,  Oxford, United Kingdom, 3Regional Genetics Service and Academic  Group of Medical Genetics, St Maryâs Hospital, Manchester, United  Kingdom","The theory of engagement emerged from grounded theory work  with HNPCC families having predictive genetic testing (McAllister ,  1999; 2001), and differs from existing general psychological theories  because it is grounded in the experiences of high risk families,  and makes specific predictions about adjustment to the results  of predictive genetic testing. According to the theory, it is not test  result per se, but prior engagement status in combination with test  result that predicts post test adjustment. Intense engagement prior  to predictive testing is associated with feelings of relief, and often  satisfaction with the discovery of mutation carrier status in HNPCC  families. These mutation carriers may feel that they are better  off than members of the general population because their carrier  status is perceived as a gateway to care. These feelings are not  always shared with their less engaged relatives. A proposed model  for pre test counselling for cancer predisposition is presented that  may enable more appropriate targeting of clinical resources, cost  effective practice, and the likelihood of decreased patient distress and  increased patient satisfaction. It may also prevent future difficulties in  adjusting to predictive test results. E",2002

There were four assessment times of participants: prior to, and 2  weeks, 4 months and 12 months after notification of test result. Results 104 people have completed the baseline questionnaire, of whom 56  are female and 45 male. Almost all have received genetic test results  and also completed the second questionnaire, 88 completed the third  and 76 the fourth. Measures of anxiety, depression, and intrusive and avoidant  thoughts about being at risk for colon cancer (as measured by the  Impact of Events Scale [IES]) were included in the questionnaires.  Results show marked differences between carriers and non carriers  two weeks post notification, particularly for the IES measure. The  difference between these two groups for IES scores remained  statistically significant at 4 and 12 months post testing, having  adjusted for age and baseline levels of IES. However, all measures  decreased between time 2 (two weeks after the result was given) and  12 months for both groups. Most non carriers appear reassured and did not have colorectal  cancer screening in the first year post genetic testing: 12% of non  carriers have had a colonoscopy, compared with 58% of carriers. Conclusion At this stage, there is no evidence that having a predictive test for  HNPCC is causing psychological distress and compliance with advice  related to screening is being observed. E",2002

The consultations were audiotaped, transcribed  verbatim and coded. Multivariate logistic regressions showed that women who had  prophylactic mastectomy (p=0.00) and oophorectomy (p=0.01)  discussed had significantly more expectations met and a greater  reduction in breast cancer related avoidant thoughts (p=0.07 and  p=0.09 respectively). Women who received a summary letter of  the consultation and reported reading it, experienced significantly  lower generalised anxiety (p=0.01), lower breast cancer specific  anxiety (p=0.08) and were significantly more likely to be accurate  in reporting their perceived risk (p=0.02). Women whose consultant  used more supportive behaviours experienced significantly more  breast cancer related intrusive thoughts at the four weeks follow up  (p<0.001). Women who received more supportive behaviours were  not significantly more anxious before to genetic counselling. Discussing prophylactic surgery led to better psycho social outcomes.  Providing women with a letter summarising the consultation reduced  anxiety, increased accuracy of risk perception and was a useful  adjunct to the consultation. Greater use of supportive and counselling  behaviours appeared to increase intrusive thoughts, at least in  the short term. Longer follow up may have shown a reduction in  emotional response.

Background:  Huntingtonâs disease (HD) and heredoataxias (HA) are  late onset neurodegenerative disorders with (HD) and without (HA)  dementia. Both are incurable. Hereditary cancer diseases (HC) can  be prevented by prophylactic methods. DNA analysis is available. Methods:  Our investigation was carried out by questionnaires.  Answers from 300 RP for HD, 30 for HA and 55 for HC were  evaluated. Results:  About 55% of RP for HD, 73% for HA and 85% for HC wish  to undergo PDD. The main reasons are to obtain certainty about  risk status (HD: 78%), to plan for the future (HA: 68%) and to obtain  prophylactic therapy (HC: 80%). 33% of the RP for HD, 13% for HA  and only 4% for HC refuse PDD. The main reasons against PDD  are psychological problems (HD: 79%; HA, HC: 50%). 2/3 of the RP   for HD, 1/3 for HA and only 1/5 for HC think that there are problems  in taking PDD generally. Most problems are seen in coping with the  result of PDD (psychological problems; HD: 77%; HA: 60%; HC:  45%), with insurance companies (40%, 20%, 55%) and with social  surroundings (36%, 20%, 18%). Psychotherapy would be accepted  by 93% (HD), 83% (HA) and only by 25% of RP for HC. Conclusions:  There are different attitudes towards PDD in the three  groups because of the different symptoms and the possibilities of  preventing in the case of cancer. Genetic counselling has to consider  these features. E",2002

In  these cases, the mutation is characterised by autosomal dominant  inheritance, with high penetrance. Thus, a test with high predictive  value can be offered to the at risk healthy relatives of patients. The present study is aimed at: i) evaluating the attitudes towards  genetic testing in relatives of patients with familial dementia; ii)  developing a specific protocol for genetic counselling, including  presymptomatic testing, for families with mendelian forms of  dementia. Thirty five relatives of patients with familial dementia were recruited.  Participants were tested by an extensive psychological assessment  including several rating scales; the attitudes towards genetic test  were evaluated by using a specific tool (Roberts, 2000). About  70% of participants expressed probable intentions to seek for the  test. Participants reported test benefits as more important than  limitations and risks (p=.0019). Staying on top of future treatment,  as well as planning the future, were considered the most important  items in favour of the test. Psychological and sociodemographic  characteristics do not seem to influence attitudes and intentions  towards genetic testing. Two families in which a MAPT gene mutation  segregates with frontotemporal dementia were identified; some  at risk relatives requested to be enrolled for the genetic testing  procedure. On this purpose, a multidisciplinary team is developing a  pilot protocol for genetic counselling. The preliminary experience will  be reported. E",2002

Multiple choice and open ended questions were  used. Sixty percent returned the mail questionnaire. One third of  them had at least one patient who had asked for information about a  predictive test and/or who had such a test performed. The following  pattern in the GPsâ judgments about the sense of predictive testing  was revealed: the test for thyroid cancer was considered as more  sensible than the test for breast cancer, both were more sensible  than the test for Huntingtonâs disease and all three were more  sensible than the test for Alzheimer disease. Predictive testing for  Huntington disease for an adolescent at his/her own request was  judged as more acceptable than for a child at the parentsâ request.

Prior to such a late termination, it is necessary to ensure  that the baby is dead prior to the induction of labour. In the United  Kingdom this procedure, feticide, is usually carried out in specialist  fetal medicine units. There are no published data concerning how  parents react to this procedure nor how it impacts on those health  professionals carrying it out. This paper will use questionnaire and interview data collected from  twenty eight women and their partners, whose pregnancies were  terminated with the use of feticide after the late diagnosis of a fetal  abnormality. We will describe the impact of this procedure for both  men and women, compared with parents undergoing termination for  abnormality at earlier gestations without the use of feticide. Attitudes  to and experiences of the procedure varied among parents. Overall,  no relationship was found between undergoing feticide or not and  maternal emotional well being although a year after a termination,  there was evidence of higher paternal grief in those men whose  partner had undergone a feticide.

Land2","1Dept.of Clinical Genetics, Academic Hospital Maastricht, Maastricht,  Netherlands, 2Dept. of Gynaecology, Academic Hospital Maastricht,  Maastricht, Netherlands."," Introduction. The Academic Hospital in Maastricht is the only centre in the  Netherlands that provides Pre implantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD).  Between 80 100 couples are referred each year. This gave us the  opportunity to investigate the characteristics and motives of the  couples seeking PGD counseling. The main question was: Which couples opt for PGD and which factors might influence the  course of treatment? Method. As part of the intake a Clinical Geneticist provides information about  PGD. After that a Psychologist interviews the couple. A descriptive  analysis of the first 50 interviews has been performed. Results. The presentation mainly deals with the first part of the question i.e.  which couples opt for PGD. Roughly 40% of the genetic disorders  that lead to the wish for PGD are autosomal dominant late onset  disorders, another 45% are X linked or autosomal recessive  disorders and 15% of the cases have frequent early abortions due  to translocations. Couples generally underestimate the impact of the  disorder on quality of life. Women and men mention similar motives  for parenthood. Couples feel medium to high time pressure in 60%  of the cases. Alternative options to get a healthy child are considered  in 50% of the cases but 70% express a strong preference for PGD.  Sufficient social support is reported by 80% of the couples and only  10% does not want to discuss their problems with others. After the  initial interview, 60% wants to continue, 10% declines to go on and  30% wants to reconsider their options.EMPAG Poster Session E",2002
Psychological adjustment of PKU children and the  family,P01.,"Jusiene1,2, L. Cimbalistiene3, R. Bieliauskaite1","1Department of Clinical and Social Psychology, Vilnius University,  Vilnius, Lithuania, 2Vilnius University Hospital, Human Genetics  Centre, Vilnius, Lithuania, 3Human Genetics Centre, Vilnius  University, Vilnius, Lithuania","Introduction: Phenylketonuria (PKU) is an inherited genetic metabolic  disorder in which the enzyme required to digest phenylanine (Phe) is  missing. If untreated, individuals with PKU develop high levels of Phe  in their blood which can affect brain development and function. Thatâs  why low protein diet must be introduced from the birth. Nevertheless,  several studies show higher incidence of behavioral problems,  especially internalizing, in early treated PKU children and suggest  psychological perspective explaining them. Parental maladjustment  to childâs chronic illness and everyday stress managment related to  the burden of special diet can be reasons for psychological problems  of PKU children. Aim: To evaluate the psychological adjustment of PKU children  (as compared to healthy controls) and analyze it in the context of  psychological impact of PKU on the family. Methods: Parents of 37 early treated PKU children (age 4 14 years  old) and of 37 matched controls were asked to fill the Child Behavior  Checklist (CBCL, Achenbach, 1991) and questionnaire on stress  coping strategies (Elklit, 1996). Parents of PKU children answered  the questionnaire on reactions to childâs disease and itâs impact on  the family. Results: PKU children have significantly more behavioral  problems than healthy controls. They are more withdrawn,  anxious/depressive, have more social and attention problems. The  higher rates of internalizing and overall problems are related to  parental maladjustment (feelings of guilty and anger) together with  maladaptive (emotion oriented) stress coping strategies. Two latter  factors further indulging the child, that also predicts the psychological  problems of PKU children. E",2002
Are experiences with HD related to the attachment  representation in adults at 50% risk for HD? An empirical  exploration,P02.,"Duisterhof1, R. W. Trijsburg1, H. J. Duivenvoorden1, A. Tibben2","1Department of Medical Psychology and Psychotherapy, Rotterdam,  Netherlands, 2Departments of Clinical Genetics and Neurology,  Leiden, Netherlands","Introduction: Huntingtonâs disease (HD) is a family disease. We  introduced the attachment theory as framework to study the effect  of childhood experiences with HD on adult functioning. According to  the attachment theory a child forms on the base of daily interactions  with his parents a mental representation of the relationship with  his parents. A child is securely attached when he approaches his  parents, especially when being frightened, tired or ill. He can also  be attached to his parents in a dismissing (insecure avoidant) or  preoccupied (insecure resistant) way. Once formed attachment  representations are relatively resistant to change. The Adult  Attachment Interview (AAI)1 allows assessment at adult age of  attachment representation, unresolved trauma and loss. We studied  the attachment representation in adults at 50% risk for HD and  explored its relation to HD experiences and family characteristics. Method: 30 adults at 50% risk, having had a parent with HD  in childhood, were administered the AAI. They completed a  questionnaire concerning family characteristics and HD experiences.  The differential qualities of the attachment categories were explored  by multivariate modeling of HD experiences and family characteristics  (i.e. optimal scaling techniques). Results: 11 subjects were securely attached, whereas 14 were  preoccupied attached and 5 dismissing attached; 16 out of them  were unresolved regarding trauma and/or loss. Compared to non  clinical samples2, fearful preoccupation and unresolved trauma were  overrepresented. The relation between attachment representation  and HD are currently being analysed. It will be discussed how the  attachment representation is related to HD experiences and family  characteristics.EMPAG Posters316 317 E",2002
The situation and attitudes of patients suffering  from a hereditary disease and those of their partners,P03.,"Hoelzel , F. R. Kreuz","Technical University, Dresden, Germany","DNA analyses can help to differentiate diseases and to make a  diagnosis certain. However, the psycho social problems may increase  with new diagnostics. One aim of our study was to investigate the  attitudes of patients suffering from a hereditary disease and those of  their partners. We wanted to investigate whether there are special  features in coping with a heredity disease. Method:  The study was  carried out by questionnaires. Results:  68% of the patients and 27%  of the partners had to restrict their professional life. About 20% in  both groups had conflicts with family members. 52% of the patients  considered that the difficulties of their situation had strengthened  the partnership, whereas about 25% reported conflicts with their  partner and, in 7%, the partnership was dissolved. For more than  70% of the patients, their partner is the most important person to  help them to cope with the disease. 65% of the patients and 71% of  the partners wished to undergo prenatal DNA diagnosis. More than  50% of both groups thought that the termination of pregnancy after a  positive prenatal diagnosis is justified. Almost all patients confirmed  that the doctor is important not only for giving information, but also  for discussions regarding coping with the disease. Conclusion:   Good family and social integration and close meshed consultations  by specialists form the basis for coping with a hereditary disease.  Genetic counselling can provide the frame for genetic analysis. The  partner has to be integrated into the counselling process and should  be paid the same amount of attention. E",2002

In contrast to routinely  published convictions of severe mental and behavioural incapacity  of children with CDC, more specific data on their abilities and  educational needs are not available. The main aim of our work was  a detailed qualitative study of the behavioural profile of CDC, starting  with a 6 year old boy with characteristic clinical features confi rmed  by cytogenetic findings. Our method is based on the analysis of  single picture observations taken from video documentation during  child directed therapeutic playwork in a Montessori structured  environment. The synthesis of our observations revealed a wide  range of abilities: the psychomotor skills include a very good manual  abilities, a good non verbal communication and partially expressed  verbal communication, the social abilities include a good eye contact  and participation in playwork and the emotional abilities concern the  childâs manifestation of happiness, proudness of managing with his  work by himself, anger, boredom and others. We believe that a more  detailed knowledge on the developmental and behavioural phenotype  of CDC should take an important part of genetic counseling. E",2002
"Discovering and disclosing the family disease:  stories from Huntingtonâs disease consultands, and their  partners.",P05.,"Forrest , S. A. Simpson, E. van Teijlingen, B. Wilson, N. Haites, L.  McKee, E. Matthews","University of Aberdeen, Aberdeen, United Kingdom","Background: Research suggests that some Huntingtonâs disease  consultands grow up knowing about the disease, whilst others do  not. Indeed, some only find out after the death of a parent or sibling,  or after a relative has been diagnosed. This issue is important for  several reasons: individuals might be disadvantaged emotionally,  socially, financially or medically by having genetic information  withheld or disclosed, and conflicts may arise within families if some  cannot accept a parentâs or siblingâs right to privacy or right not to  know. Methods: In depth interviews were undertaken with people who have  received genetic counselling for Huntingtonâs disease, and their partners. The interviews explored how participants found out about  the disease; whether subsequent relatives had or had not been told;  the factors which influenced telling or not telling; who should tell; and  views of the genetic counselling process. Results: We explored how and when participants found out about  Huntingtonâs disease and the effect this had on subsequent family  relationships and decisions to tell other relatives such as children.  Respondentsâ views about whose responsibility it is to pass on this  type of information were also examined. Conclusions: The impact of Huntingtonâs disease on family dynamics  may result in family secrets and/or living at risk. The level of  disclosure to relatives can at times be limited but also depends on  the psycho social, cultural and familial context. Ultimately, we hope  that this study will contribute towards a wider understanding into  the dynamics within families after someone in that family attends for  genetic counselling. E",2002

Biesecker3","1Pennsylvania State University, State College, PA, 2Westat Research  Institute, Rockville, MD, 3NHGRI/NIH, Bethesda, MD","As individuals with Marfan syndrome are increasingly diagnosed  prior to childbearing, there is opportunity to study factors related  to the diagnosis that influence their reproductive planning. Data  will be presented from an exploratory study of 174 adults with  Marfan syndrome regarding their reproductive plans. A majority  of survey respondents were Caucasian and well educated. Fifty  eight percent were female and 64% were members of the National  Marfan Foundation. Sixty percent of the cohort reported difficulties  with sex drive. Age (50+ yrs), striae, back pain, and low quality of  life were each independently correlated with a lack of sex drive.  Forty percent of the respondents had children, with 33% having  one or more children affected with Marfan syndrome. Approximately  62% of the total cohort agreed that having Marfan syndrome has  significantly affected their decisions about having children. Age at  diagnosis, mitral valve prolapse, and the view that Marfan syndrome  has adverse consequences on oneâs life were each independently  correlated with the perception that being affected had influenced their  reproductive plans. Of the total cohort, 69% reported that they were  interested in prenatal testing for Marfan syndrome. Clinical features  and psychosocial issues both contribute negatively to affected adultsâ  reproductive decision making and sexual well being. Genetics  professionals are ideally positioned to address concerns surrounding  reproduction with Marfan syndrome patients and to refer those with  significant sexual or reproductive concerns for further evaluation and  management.

Recent  data on better both somatic (eg. walking, general survival) and  behavioural (eg. communication, social functioning) development in  WHS give rationale to more detailed studies of the WHS phenotype.  We undertook a detailed qualitative study of the behaviour profile of  two children with WHS based on subsequent image analysis elicited  from a video sequence recorded of a therapist guided playwork,  which was featured in the environment structured according to the  principles of Maria Montessori. The focus was set on children abilities  and not defects. Based on the results obtained, we attempted to  elicit the needs of studied children in order to favour preventing of  secondary mental impairment in children with WHS and stimulating  their development by their families. Our results support the previous  communications on better abilities profile of children with WHS  (psychomotor, emotional, communicative, and social ones) than  commonly attributed to this syndrome.

There have  been less than 25 published process studies since 1977 with few in  the area of prenatal diagnosis. Other literature concerning prenatal  genetic counselling process describes retrospective, subjective  impressions of session content and decision making processes. The  process of prenatal genetic counselling remains largely unexplored. Following prenatal diagnosis parents have a choice to accept or  reject the pregnancy. Conditions detected range from lethal to mildly  disfiguring. Content of genetic counselling sessions appears to be largely  information giving (Michie, Marteau & Bobrow 1997) and exploration  of other issues may be ignored. The continuing adherence to non   directive counselling may minimise counsellor involvement with  decision making (Terrell White 1999) and possibly constrain moral  discussion for those who desire it. Research is needed to determine  whether clients wish to have a level of moral discourse available to  them. As the scope of genetic screening and diagnosis increases and  presents new and increasingly complex dilemmas, inclusion of a  client led moral discourse may be seen as a justifiable goal of future  genetic counselling practice.

Dinamic counselling in Haemophilia,P12.,"A. Zarri , D. Caprino, P. G. Mori",G,"Gaslini Childrenâs Hospital, Genova, Italy. It is now possible to identify carrier status and to perform prenatal  diagnosis of haemophilia. Therefore, the parents can choose  whether to have haemophilic children or not, and this choice will  condition the rest of their lives. Thus counselling is an important  aspect and it should not be a once in a lifetime event: the decision  making process is something that should be on going. Counselling EMPAG Posters318 319 should provides families the option of changing their mind. Rational  aspects and doubts they might have, even month or years after the  first consultation, must be considered. Nowadays it is possible to  get information easily from several sources even though it could be  inaccurate and contradictory, counselling allows people to discuss  and to exchange views concerning medical progress. Drawing up a counselling outline decreases the disagreements  regarding the medical and psychological aspects. If all the  centres provided the same information, the perception, about the  discrepancies among the various specialist would decrease. Counselling should be geared to the subject we are talking to, and  should take into account social and cultural levels, age and reasons  for counselling. The counsellor must be neutral and all the possible  strategies must be considered. The basis for a long lasting therapeutic alliance can be achieved  through counselling; the main advantages can be had by the patients  and their families as by the staff. The type of dynamic counselling we  are suggesting needs to be up to date. Everyone working in genetic  counselling must be involved, from laboratory staff to the consulting  physician. E",2002

Data on family functioning was collected at baseline and again at  6 9 months following the receipt of test results, or at the equivalent  time for those participants who chose not to undergo testing. 181  participants elected to undergo genetic testing (85%) and 47 (26%)  were identified as mutation carriers. The Family Relationship index  was used to measure changes in perceived cohesion, conflict and  expressiveness from baseline to follow up. Change was analyzed  for each measure between testers and non testers and between  those who tested positive and negative. Overall, there were positive  changes in expressiveness and cohesion and negative changes  in conflict. Individuals who opted for testing had lower feelings of  cohesiveness and expressiveness than those who declined testing (p  = 0.054 and p = 0.09 respectively). Expressiveness was significantly  lower in those who tested positive rather than negative (p = 0.005).  Results suggest that choosing to undergo BRCA1/2 testing and living  with positive results may cause less disruption in families in which  there are not strong feelings of cohesiveness or expressiveness.

Referral patterns for diagnostic genetic testing in  Huntingtonâs disease.,P19.,"Jackson1, A. Dodge2, E. Howard2, D. Craufurd2","1Blackpool Victoria Hospital, Blackpool, United Kingdom, 2Academic  Unit of Medical Genetics and Regional Genetic Service, Manchester ,  United Kingdom","Ethical guidelines for HD predictive testing are widely observed and appear to work well. However, genetic testing can also be used to  confirm or exclude HD from the differential diagnosis in apparently  affected individuals. There are no guidelines for âdiagnosticâ testing,  but anecdotal reports suggest considerably more problems than  with presymptomatic testing. Some UK laboratories require signed  consent for diagnostic testing, but practice varies considerably  between centres. 258 requests for HD diagnostic testing were received by the  molecular genetic laboratory in Manchester between 1993 and  2000. The number increased steadily from 18 in 1993 to 48 in  1999. Referrals originated from 33 clinicians in 8 specialties. The  percentage of positive test results varied between clinicians from  38% to 100%. Logistic regression analysis indicated a significant  difference between referring clinicians (p=0.0006) but no significant  effect due to specialty. Requests from clinical geneticists declined  from 90% in 1993 to 40% in 1999, while the proportion of positive  results decreased from 88% to 62%. Clinical information was  provided on 60% of request cards, and family history on 45%. Referring doctors with a low rate of positive results presumably use  the test to eliminate HD in cases with relevant symptoms but no  family history. The use of consent forms in such cases may arguably  raise patientsâ anxieties unnecessarily, but conversely may help to  reduce the risk of performing âdiagnosticâ tests on presymptomatic  at risk individuals who have not been referred for genetic counselling.  The implications for future policy will be discussed. E",2002

The scores of  depression  and anxiet y, reached through the application of two scales  (Clinical Evaluation Inventory of Depression,  Vaz Serra & Abreu,  1973 and Zungâs Anxiety Scale , Vaz Serra et al. , 1982),  were chosen  as indicators of the emotional state to of each subject and taken three  moments: before pre symptomatic testing, and at three weeks and at  nine months after disclosure of the results of the test. Our preliminary data shown that, (1) the scores of depression and  anxiety did not achieve pathological levels at any moment, for  the vast majority of subjects; and that (2) awareness of the test  results does not cause a negative psychological impact   mean  scores of depression and anxiety by the third moment were always  lower than those at the first moment of evaluation. This pointed to  psychologically healthy adaptation to the new genetic status (carrier  or non carrier), for all subjects studied, even in those cases where  anxiety and/or depression raised immediately after testing (three  weeks). Despite this small sample, the results are in concordance  with previous studies and helped us to delineate future research. E",2002

Life events and psychological risk in individuals  entering the protocol of pre symptomatic testing for FAP  TTRMet30.,P23.,"Albuquerque1, J. Sequeiros1,2, C. PaÃºl1,2","1UnIGENe IBMC, Univ.Porto, Portugal, 2ICBAS   Univ. Porto, Porto,  Portugal. ","Life events may have an important impact on psychological risk of  persons who are at genetic risk for a deleterious inherited disease.  We made a qualitative analyses of psychological interviews of 23  individuals at risk for familial amyloid polineuropathy (FAP), type  I or TTRMet30, the first to enter our protocol of pre symptomatic  testing for this disease. Thus, we chose 4 categories of history of  life events that might influence the present psychological conditions  of individuals at risk: (1) separation (emotional separation from  significant others); (2) change (change of environment   school,  home, other   e.g., due to the death of an affected parent); (3)  contact (contact with patients and knowledge derived about the  disease); (4) care giving (taking care of an affected relative).  We hypothesised that those events of personal history may turn  them more fragile, increasing their psychological risk during  the pre symptomatic testing process, as measured by the  âPsychopathological Symptoms Inventoryâ (BSI) (Derogatis, 1982).  The âpsychosis indexâ varies significantly (F(1,22)=4,169, p<0,05) with  the experience of separation (1); the âphobia/anxiety indexâ varies  significantly (F(1,22)=7,998, p<0,01) with the experience of change  (2); the âpositive symptom indexâ (F(1,22)=6.297, p<0.02) and the  âsomatisation indexâ (F(1,22)=6.924, p<0.02) both vary significantly  with the experience of care giving of that person (4). Contact did not  influence any indices studied. In conclusion, some life history events  seem to influence negatively the present psychological condition of  individuals at risk and may be an indication for being more cautious  in the procedures of the pre symptomatic testing protocol, namely in  delivering test results to those individuals.

Adverse effects of predictive testing for  Huntington disease underestimated,P24.,"Timman1,2, R. Roos1, A. Maat Kievit3, A. Tibben1","1Leiden University Medical Centre, Dept.of Neurology, Leiden,  Netherlands, 2Erasmus University Rotterdam, Dept. of Medical  Psychology & Psychotherapy, Rotterdam, Netherlands, 3Erasmus  University Rotterdam, Dept. of Clinical Genetics, Rotterdam,  Netherlands. ","Objective In general, studies on psychological consequences of predictive  testing for Huntington disease (HD) revealed few harmful  consequences for identified gene carriers and little relief in non  carriers. Little attention has been paid to the characteristics of individuals who were lost to follow up, as it is difficult to get access to  this group. Therefore, the adverse effects in carriers and non carriers  may be underestimated. Subjects and methods In the long term follow up of predictive testing for HD 180 test  applicants completed questionnaires which assessed future  expectancies (Beck Hopelessness Scale), intrusion of adverse ideas  and denial avoidance reactions (Impact of Event Scale) and general  well being (General Health Questionnaire). Results After receiving the DNA test result, 39 persons (22%; 18 increased  risk, 21 decreased risk) did not return for follow up and additional  counselling (dropouts). After 7 10 years, about 69% is lost to follow  up. There were no differences between non carriers who did return  (participants), and dropout non carriers. Dropout carriers had  reported at pre test significantly more hopelessness ( F(1,76)=6.5;  p=.013), more intrusive thoughts about HD ( F(1,76)=13.4; p=.000),  more avoidance behaviour ( F(1, 76)=10.1; p = .002) and a worse sense  of well being ( F(1,76)=7.0; p=.010), than participating carriers. Conclusions People who are vulnerable to psychological distress may have  reacted with extreme denial of an unfavourable test outcome and  avoidance of the messengers of the bad news (geneticists) and their  associates (psychologists researchers). Oral information by relatives  supports these speculations. Studies reporting few harmful effects  by identified carriers may have underestimated the real impact of the  test results. E",2002

The findings from the pilot study will also be  presented. Background: Advances in DNA technology mean that a wider range of prenatal  tests will soon become available. Obtaining separate informed  consent for each condition is likely to cause confusion and provoke  considerable anxiety amongst parents. A classification system is  therefore required and needs to be built upon parentsâ attitudes  to testing and their perceptions of the similarities and differences  between conditions. Research Design: The attitudes of several hundred postnatal Pakistani and indigenous  âwhiteâ women towards prenatal testing, for a range of conditions,  are being compared using quantitative and qualitative data. The  effect on attitudes of educational level is also being assessed. The  acceptability of the classification system will be assessed amongst  maternity service users, providers and voluntary organisations. The pilot study assessed womenâs ability to manage descriptions  of 30 conditions ranging in severity and age of onset. Twenty one  women completed the questionnaire and considered whether they  would a) want a prenatal test for the condition and b) consider a  termination of pregnancy if the test was positive.

Butler2","1St Jamesâs University Hospital, Leeds, United Kingdom, 2The  General Infirmary at Leeds, Leeds, United Kingdom","The birth of a baby with ambiguous genitalia is considered both  a medical and a psychosocial âemergencyâ. Sex assignment in a  newborn with ambiguous genitalia requires multidisciplinary team  effort. Reactions and attitudes to gender ambiguity may vary from  culture to culture. The lack of understanding about parentsâ attitudes  and cultural differences may lead to misconceptions, affecting the  desired outcome of such cases. Between 1997 to 2001, 44 cases of  genital abnormality were referred to the Yorkshire Regional Genetics  Service for chromosome analysis. Twenty of these cases were of EMPAG Posters320 321 Pakistani origin. This paper highlights the reactions and attitudes  of two Pakistani families, which was observed during genetic  counselling. In the Pakistani culture intersexuals are categorised as  âHijrasâ   a third sex or a third gender. They are not socially accepted  in the wider Pakistani society. These individuals lead their life as  outcasts, in their own socially isolated community. This paper will  show how intersexuals are conceptualised in the Pakistani culture.  This paper will also highlight an ethical dilemma arising from a  request of termination of pregnancy from one family with genital  ambiguity. The implications for genetic counselling arising from these  cultural differences in attitudes towards ambiguous genitalia will be  discussed. E",2002
Genetic counselling in oncology: the role of the  social worker,P27.,"Brouwer1, E. Kaats2","1VU University Medical Centre, Amsterdam, Netherlands, 2The  Netherlands Cancer Institute / Antoni van Leeuwenhoek Hospital,  Amsterdam, Netherlands","In this presentation we share our experience in the decision making  process of counsellees who present themselves with hereditary  breast and ovarian cancer (HBOC). Individuals at high risk for HBOC  are faced with a number of complex decisions concerning taking  (pre)symptomatic gene mutation testing. Visits to the social worker  provide assistance during this process. Studies show that issues to be addressed during these visits,  include perception of cancer risk, consequences of DNA testing and  compliance with screening. However, these studies do not indicate  which tools for psychosocial support may be used. Therefore,  we have developed an approach which includes assessment of  psychosocial concerns, the individualâs phase of life, relationships  with family members, social networks and present coping strategies.  Psycho educational interventions and methods for empowerment are  used and focus on highlighting various perspectives of the problem.  This approach aims to prevent negative effects to psychosocial well  being. Since 2000, 512 counsellees have been seen. Most of them are  emotionally healthy individuals, suddenly faced with the burden of  a genetic predisposition and/or a possible treatment for cancer. The  family situation may also be burdensome due to existing cancer or  a recent cancer related death in relatives. Combining the issues  extracted from the literature with our approach of addressing psycho  social concerns has resulted quite consistently in a well balanced  decision to take a screening test or to postpone the test, being  emotionally prepared to accept the consequences in both cases. We suggest that our approach to decision making may prevent  psychosocial problems in counsellees. E",2002

Orphanet  receives an average of 65 unsolicited emails each month with  requests for medical information and advice.

All unsolicited  e mails received between January 1, 2001 and June 30, 2001 were  included in the audit.

Skilled health  professionals are increasingly needed to interpret the benefits or  otherwise of genetic advances for the health of individuals. Non  medical genetic counsellors can provide services and so enhance  access and equity for the population. To ensure safety, standards of  professional practice must be established. In the United Kingdom  (UK) and The Netherlands, formal processes have been established  to ensure genetic counsellors can deal with the complex scientifi c,  ethical, social and psychological issues involved in genetic  counselling. In the UK, a profile of genetic counsellors in current practice has  provided a baseline for assessment of the new registration process.  Of 150 counsellors who provided data on their current post,  professional background, educational preparation and ongoing  training needs, 83% are educated to degree level, and 77% are  registered nurses or midwives. Fifty three percent have a generic  post in a genetic centre, while 24% work in disease specific posts.  Of concern is the finding that 32% consider they have current unmet  educational needs. Sixty nine percent intend to register formally as  genetic counsellors. The experiences of individual countries should contribute to building a  platform for the development of the genetic counselling profession in  Europe.

Biesecker1","1NHGRI/NIH, Bethesda, MD, 2NIDCR/NIH, Bethesda, MD, United  States","The teaching of bioethics often uses challenging cases. However,  these cases may cause harmful messages to be received by specific  communities. We present as an example the âCase of Dwarfism,â  developed shortly after the discovery of the common mutation for  achondroplasia in 1994. This case describes a couple, both affected  with achondroplasia and expecting a child, who plan to terminate  the pregnancy if prenatal diagnosis reveals the fetus is of average  stature. It is often employed as a teaching case for US health  professionals, designed to stimulate debate over their role as the  gatekeepers of access to genetic testing. It also compels audiences  to examine their views on reproductive freedoms and the limits  of parental autonomy. While this case may challenge stereotypes  about the appropriate uses of prenatal diagnosis, it potentially  fosters a more subtle stereotype about the community it intends to  serve. It presents people with achondroplasia as motivated to make  reproductive decisions based merely on perceptions of their physical  features. Yet, a recent study of people affected with achondroplasia  revealed that the majority considered knowing the prenatal diagnosis  of average stature unimportant and that only 2% would consider  termination based on this finding. Using this case to challenge the  view of what makes for a âhealthy babyâ may actually deny that those  with achondroplasia simply share the common parental desire for  healthy children. While such cases remain important teaching tools in  genetics, we should be aware of our own inadvertent messages and their potential for creating discriminatory attitudes. E",2002

As with  other ethnic minorities, genetic health professionals must be sensitive  to the social and cultural values of a particular ethnic group before  genetic counselling to ensure the accessibility and suitability of their  service.

Calabria  demonstrated a North South decreasing trend of frequencies,  according with the geography of the three ancient provinces:  Cosenza (CS), 5.6%; Catanzaro (CZ), 4.6%; and Reggio Calabria  (RC), 3.9%. The frequencies were significantly different among  the three provinces: CS vs. CZ, p<0.001; CZ vs. RC, p<0.025; CS  vs. RC, p<0.0005. The answers to a psychological questionnaire  (18 questions) from 831 colour blind students were significantly  different from those of the 34,309 orthocromatics chosen according  to statistical criteria. Statistical quantitative analyses were made by  Kruskal Wallis test, Friedman test, and Sign test; qualitative statistical  analyses were made by chi square test, and that of McNemar.  A pedagogical questionnaire (13 questions) of 3,082 teachers of  different disciplines confirmed their knowledge of colour blindness as  an anomaly (39%), with 58% confirming their knowledge came only  through hearsay, while the rest admitted to not know anything about  colour blindness Research financied by Fondazione Cassa di Risparmio di Calabria e  Lucania (Cosenza) E",2002

","Research in the area of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder  ( ADHD ) has emphasized three distinct subtypes including the  Inattentive Type, the Hyperactive/Impulsive Type and the Combined  Type. Within the Fragile X (FXS) research, the majority of boys  with the full mutation exhibit significant attentional problems with  hyperactivity, while females are more frequently described as having  attentional problems without hyperactivity. The profiles of males  and females with the premutation and mosaic status have not been  documented. 118 individuals affected by FXS were assessed for ADHD using the  SNAP IV symptom checklists obtained through spouse report or  parent report. Data was divided into comparison groups with regard  to gender and DNA status. Analyses were conducted to document  and describe the subtypes as they relate to gender and DNA and to  determine individual patterns of ADHD subtypes. Limited numbers of premutation females and males, and mosaic  males met clinical criteria for ADHD. Premutation female inattentive  scores were significantly greater than hyperactive/impulsive scores.

Emotional well being after a termination for  abnormality: the impact of obstetric and social factors,P40.,"E. Statham1, W. Solomou1, J. Green2","1Centre for Family Research, University of Cambridge, United  Kingdom, 2Mother and Infant Research Unit, University of Leeds,  United Kingdom","This paper will use data collected from 148 women during interviews  and through postal questionnaires in the year after they made the  decision to terminate a pregnancy after the diagnosis of a fetal  abnormality. Most of these parents were at no particular risk when  they became pregnant and malformations were discovered as a  result of routine antenatal care. The relationship between scores on  measures of grief and depression and obstetric, social and personal  characteristics has been investigated using multivariate methods. The grief response of mothers is variable but overall, emotional  well being improved over time. The principal obstetric variables,  gestational age, method of termination and severity of malformation  were not related to emotional well being at any time in the year  following the termination. We have found no relationship between EMPAG Posters324 325 aspects of care during and after a termination and womenâs  subsequent feelings. Aspects of how the diagnosis was made,  specifically satisfaction with getting the diagnosis and ease or  difficulty of getting a diagnosis were independently related to  mothersâ feelings after a termination. The emotional support that  women perceived they were getting from their partner was strongly  related to mood both in the short and long term after a termination. A  year after a termination, there was a significant relationship between  subsequent pregnancies and womenâs feelings. The implications of these findings for the care and support of women  undergoing a termination for abnormality will be discussed in this  paper. E",2002
Attitudes towards genetic testing in a  representative German sample. The influence of  sociodemographic characteristics,P41.,"Berth , A. Dinkel, F. Balck","UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Dresden, Medizinische Psychologie, Dresden,  Germany","Background: Pre  and postnatal genetic testing have become a  widely used means for the assessment of individual risk for hereditary  diseases. In Germany, virtually no empirical data concerning attitudes  towards gene tests have been available, so far. Purpose: In order to explore the attitudes of the German public, we  conducted a survey regarding general attitudes towards genetic  testing in a sample representative for the German population (N =  2.076). Methods: We used a subset of 13 statements out of a larger  questionnaire set used in a Finnish survey. The items related to  approval, disapproval, and concern for genetic testing. Results: The results reveal that there is wide acceptance of  genetic testing in the German population, about two thirds hold a  positive view. Yet, possible disadvantages are also recognised. A  factor analytic analysis of the items yielded three distinct factors  (approval, disapproval, concern for genetic testing). The MANOVA  model revealed differences concerning attitudes towards genetic  testing between various sociodemographic groups. The clearest  differences emerged for religious affiliation. Members of a religious  group consistently indicated a less favourable view of gene tests.  Furthermore, subjects who had attained a higher educational level  showed ambivalent attitudes, i.e. they scored higher on both approval  and disapproval. Discussion: In general, there is widespread support for genetic testing  in the German population, but the approval of gene tests is not as  high as in Finland. Similarly to a Finnish general population study ,  we found influences of sociodemographic characteristics on general  acceptance of gene tests. E",2002
Measurements of Breast Cancer Risk Perception:  An Ongoing Study in the General Public.,P42.,"Reitz , J. Barth, A. Helmes, J. Bengel","University of Freiburg, Institute of Psychology, Rehabilitation  Psychology, Freiburg, Germany","Breast cancer risk perception is an important predictor of the intention  to obtain predictive genetic testing for breast cancer risk. However ,  many women tend to overestimate their own risk. To understand  this bias it is necessary to take problems of measurement into  consideration. Many studies found that open ended probability scales  lead to an increased use of the 50% option, maybe as an expression  of having difficulties with understanding and using probabilities. This  could lead to problems in the comparison of empirical (i.e. Gail) and  personal risk estimates. In the context of the ongoing study AttRisk a random sample  of women of the general public recieved an information letter.  Women completed a brief telephone survey that assessed eligibility  criteria and risk status. Eligible participants were mailed a longer  questionnaire and a consent form with a return envelope. Four  different measurements were used for breast cancer risk estimates:  a) opend ended probability scale b) visual analog scale, c) 7 point  scale and d) 5 point scale to assess the personal risk in comparison  to peers. Additionally, they were asked how certain they were in each  judgement. To date, data from 218 respondents has been collected (response  rate: 59%). About 84% were women with neither FDRs nor BC.  About 20% reported a personal risk of 50%. There were strong positive correlations between the measurements (a c) except for the  comparison scale (d). Respondents reported a moderate level of  certainty for each response mode. They felt more certain in using the  comparison scale compared to the other measurements. E",2002
Understanding inheritance: kinship connections  and genetics,P43.,"M. Wilson , M. P. M. Richards","Centre for Family Research, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Discussions of lay and professional scientific knowledge suggest  a wide range of possible interactions between peopleâs existing  understanding of particular situations and those they may draw on  from scientific work (Wynne, 1991). Lay ideas about inheritance  may be developed early in childhood in the context of the family  and grounded in concepts of kinship, reinforced by everyday social  activities and relationships. Such ideas might be particularly resistant  to change and may conflict with Mendelian explanations, making the  uptake of these scientific accounts of inheritance difficult (Richards  1996, 1998, Richards and Ponder 1996). This hypothesis has  implications for genetic counselling, the teaching of genetics and  public knowledge in general. The hypothesis is being investigated in a qualitative study of  young peoplesâ connections between concepts of inheritance,  genetics, family and kinship. Interviews use open questions, which  encourage participants to explore, in their own words, the concepts  of inheritance, genetics and kinship; some specific questions focus  on participantsâ familiarity with genetic terms; a series of vignettes  examines issues of duty and obligations between family members.  Forty young people and parents of young children have been  interviewed to date. The main research questions are: a)What are the participantsâ concepts of inheritance and of the  processes by which inherited characteristics are transmitted by  parents to their children? b)What are the participantsâ concepts of kinship and how are these  related to concepts of inheritance? This poster will illustrate the findings from interviews so far  completed. E",2002
An appraisal of the German version of the Genetic  Knowledge Index (GKI),P45.,"Dinkel1, H. Berth1, F. Kreuz2, F. Balck1","1UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Medizinische Psychologie,  Dresden, Germany, 2UniversitÃ¤tsklinikum Carl Gustav Carus, Institut  fÃ¼r Klinische Genetik, Dresden, Germany","Background: As more reliable and low cost gene tests become  available, knowledge of genetic concepts is increasingly relevant.  Adequate understanding of gene technology is necessary to provide  informed consent to genetic testing. Furthermore, genetic knowledge  is necessary for participation in the public discourse about the further  advancement of gene technology. Purpose: In order assess lay peopleâs basic genetic knowledge,  Furr & Kelly (1997) developed the Genetic Knowledge Index (GKI).  We translated the items of the GKI, and we aimed to investigate its  usefulness in the German population. Methods: The GKI which comprises five true false items was  administered to N = 420 individuals. This complete sample consisted  of three subsamples: n = 131 persons from the general population, n  = 129 medical students, and n = 160 students from other faculties. Results: The total score of the GKI discriminated between the three  groups. However, the internal consistency of the GKI was very low.  There were no significant correlations between the GKI score and  external criteria (self reported interest in genetics, self evaluated  general knowledge of genetics, attitudes towards genetic testing,  and a genetic knowledge index based on questions from the medical  state examination). Furthermore, the factorial solution was different  from the original study. Discussion: Because of the weaknesses in reliability and validity , the  German version of the GKI seems not to be an appropriate tool for  assessing genetic knowledge. Further refinement is necessary. We  propose to add further items covering a wider range of genetics and  thus to increase the content validity of the questionnaire. E",2002

Charman1","1Institute of Child Health, London, United Kingdom, 2University  College London, London, United Kingdom, 3LaTrobe University,  Melbourne, Australia, 4St.Georgeâs Hospital, Hornchurch, Essex,  United Kingdom. ","Background: Although behavioural characteristics, including disinhibited behaviour ,  an inability to recognise social cues and obsessive and compulsive  tendencies, have been noted in individuals with Bardet Biedl  syndrome (BBS), to date no studies have systematically studied the  behavioural phenotype. Method: Parents of 21 children with BBS seen for a multidisciplinary clinical  assessment completed standardised measures of behaviour. Results: Children with BBS showed elevated levels of internalising problems  including feeling withdrawn and anxious/depressed. They also had  elevated levels of social, thought and attention problems. A significant  minority scored in the clinical range on a measure of autistic  symptoms, although none met clinical diagnostic criteria. The children  also had elevated scores on a measure of repetitive behaviour and  the majority was reported to be obsessive by their parents. Conclusions: These findings indicate considerable clinical need that had been  unmet in many families. Further, they suggest that BBS has a  characteristic behavioural phenotype that may be related to mutation  type. E",2002

Instrumentation: Self administered questionnaire assessing: 1)  factors involved in the decision whether to receive results; 2) basic  cancer genetics knowledge.Participants in a breast/ovarian cancer family study were offered  results from BRCA1/2 mutation analysis. 70 individuals (58%)  completed this survey of which 46% chose not to receive their test  results. The most important factor influencing the decision about  receiving results was the desire for specific cancer risk information,  followed by having information for children, concern about genetic  discrimination for children, and use of results to help with cancer  screening decisions. Using the information to assist in decisions  about chemoprevention, prophylactic surgery, childbearing,  concern about worry/anxiety, difficulty finding time to get results and  competing demands of caring for an ill relative were ranked as less  important. There were no differences in knowledge of basic cancer  genetic concepts between those who received and did not receive  results. Those who chose not to receive results considered concern  that results might cause worry/anxiety and difficulty finding time for  genetic counseling more important and obtaining specific cancer risk  information less important (p values <.02). These results suggest  that the desire to obtain more specific cancer risk information was  the most significant factor associated with the decision to obtain test  results. Concern about results causing worry/anxiety and finding  time for genetic counseling were not ranked as important but were  associated with the decision not to receive results.

Christophidou  Anastasiadou1,2","1The Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, Nicosia, Cyprus,  2Archbishop Makarios III Hospital, Nicosia, Cyprus","Cyprus is a small island in the eastern Mediterranean with a  population of approximately 700,000. This constitutes it a small and  rather closed society. In the past, differences were stigmatized and in  particular individuals with Down syndrome tended to be isolated and  institutionalized. Seven years ago the general genetics services were established  on the island and were offered primarily by a clinical geneticist and  a genetic counsellor. Also through these new services a program of  public education was developed. These two factors in conjunction  were responsible for the change in perception of Down syndrome  within society. The majority of babies born with Trisomy 21 were referred to  the genetic services so that support was offered initially and  subsequently guidelines for early intervention were established. Most of these children are now attending regular schooling as  opposed to being institutionalized. They are integrating well with their  peers and the education system is slowly, but surely adapting to cater  to their needs. We believe that the same factors that caused the stigmatization, the  size and closeness of the population, were beneficial to the rather  quick change in approach of this society. E",2002

This clinic covers the whole population of the Cyprus Republic  (population 700.00), and for a vast variety of disorders.

Concept and Understanding of Disease in the  Genetics Era,P51.,"Hoffmann , B. Press, J. Pelz","Reformstudiengang Medizin, CharitÃ© Campus Mitte, Berlin, Germany","The phrase âgenetic diseaseâ is heard on a daily basis, but the  concept âgenetic diseaseâ is far from clear. Most human diseases  have a complex aetiology, involving genetic, physiological,  psychological, etc. factors on their causal pathway. Genetic  explanations of a disease are highly context dependent (state of  knowledge, background of nongenetic factors, study population). Even with a complete knowledge of aetiology a classification of  diseases in terms of cause would not be satisfactory. Diseases have  to be described in terms of aetiology as well as in the pathology and  pathophysiology which results. Six groups of students of medicine differing in their level of clinical  and theoretical experience (1st, 2nd, 3rd and 6th year of medical  education, 300 from the regular curriculum, 100 from the reformed  curriculum) were interviewed by a structured questionnaire focussing  on their concept of disease in general and genetic disease in particular, the latter understood as a causally oriented classification  on the one hand and as an assignment to the specialty human  genetics within the realm of medicine on the other. Answers of study participants reflected the present prominence of  human genetics for the diagnosis of monogenetic diseases and  diseases with a well established mode of inheritance; they highly  overestimated the importance of human genetics in the diagnosis of  multifactorial diseases and in therapy and prevention of disease with  a known genetic aetiology. The teaching of medicine has to place  more emphasis on the development of a realistic estimation of human  genetics for medical practice in general. E",2002

Kievit","Leiden University Medical Centre, Leiden, Netherlands","Introduction Although genetic risk counselling improves the accuracy of womenâ s  perceptions of the risk of developing breast cancer, many women  still tend to over  or underestimate their risk. To understand the way  in which women perceive their risk, we collected interview data of  women who applied for genetic counselling. We assess how women  verbalise their personal risk. Furthermore, we investigate how the risk  information provided in the counselling influences the way women  spontaneously express their risk. Finally, we inquire what being at risk  for familial breast cancer means to these women. Method We collected data of 86 women who participated in a face to face  interview after their genetic consult on breast cancer. Women were  asked to describe their personal risk in their own words, and were  invited to reflect on the meaning of the risk. In addition, the clinical  geneticists completed a checklist to document the information  provided in each individual consultation. Results Preliminary analysis shows that the majority of the women chose  to use a verbal format to express their personal risk. Many women  spontaneously mention negative emotions  associated with the risk;  âIâm afraid to die young â; or â Itâs frustrating to go on living with an  uncertainty like this â. Furthermore, many women reflect on actions   to escape the risk: â no evening passes by, without me checking [my  breasts] â. Discussion We will discuss the results with respect to psychological distress  and coping with the risk for familial breast cancer, and whether this  implies recommendations for counselling.EMPAG Posters52 53 ESHG Abstracts Plenary Sessions PS 1.

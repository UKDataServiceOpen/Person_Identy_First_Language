Baranov1 1Ott’s Scienti ﬁc Research Institute of Obstetrics, Gynecol  ogy and Reproductology, St. Petersburg, Russian Federa tion, 2North Western State Medical University named after I.I. Mechnikov, Saint Petersburg, Russian Federation Introduction: According to GWAS, over 100 genes are associated with development of endometriosis (EM)   common gynecologic disorder. The present work wasdevoted to the study of exon 2 polymorphism in HOXA10 gene as well as the frequency of minor allelic variants of the WNT7A, WNT4, TWIST1 genes. Materials and methods: DNA samples extracted from peripheral blood of 41 patients with laparoscopically proved endometriosis and 43 ones from the control cohort wereused. Real time PCR was applied to analyze allelic variants of the WNT7A, WNT4, TWIST1 genes. Sanger sequencing of the 2nd exon of the HOXA10 gene was performed in 41 patients with proved endometriosis. Results: The frequencies of the minor variants: rs12639607 ( WNT7A ), rs4721745 ( TWIST1 ), rs7521902 (WNT4 ) corresponded its rate in European populations. In theHOXA10 gene, we identi ﬁed two variants: rs34957925and rs560654095. The frequency of the rs34957925 minor variant in the endometriosis group corresponded its rate in European populations. The frequency of the minor rs560654095 variant was 0.061 (G 0.00001, 1000 Genomes). Conclusions: We did not found statistically signi ﬁcant differences in allele frequencies of EM patients and control groups for the polymorphic variants the WNT7A ,TWIST1 and WNT4 genes. In endometriosis patients a high representation (6%) of the rs560654095 minor allele was found. The HOXA10 gene product binds to the β actin promoter and regulates its expression in the endometrium.Further studies are in progress to check this unusual ﬁnding.

 NFE2L2 and JUN transcription study in fetal andmaternal tissues of women with pregnancy loss in the ﬁrst trimester,P01.12,"E. Mashkina , K. Kovalenko","Southern Federal University, Rostov on Don, Russian","Federation Background: The cells constantly interact with many sig  naling molecules. This leads to dynamic changes in the spectrum of expressed genes. Nrf2 and JUN are transcrip  tion factors that are involved in maintaining intracellularredox homeostasis, which is necessary for cells proliferation and differentiation. These transcription factors activate the antioxidant defense of cells from oxidative stress. In currentwork, we investigated the expression of NFE2L2, JUN , SOD1 genes in chorionic and decidual tissues after spon  taneous abortion compared to normal ﬁrst trimester pregnancies. Materials and methods: Samples of chorionic tissue and decidua were taken after surgical termination of normallyprogressing pregnancies and spontaneous abortion in 5 9 week of gestation. RNA expression was analyzed using quantitative real time PCR method. Data were analyzedusing the 2  ΔΔCT method. Results: The transcription level of the NFE2L2, JUN, SOD1 genes is signi ﬁcantly higher in decidual tissue cells compared to chorion cells during normal pregnancy (p<0.0001). Thus, the tissue speci ﬁc transcription level of theNFE2L2, JUN, SOD1 genes has been revealed for physiological pregnancy. The correlation in the mRNA levels of the JUN, NFE2L2 andSOD1 genes was detectedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 799in decidua. In chorionic tissue during normal pregnancy, the level of mRNA of the SOD1 gene is directly proportional to the mRNA of the NFE2L2 gene (r,0.81 p,0.0002). With miscarriage the level of mRNA of the JUN gene in the chorionic tissue is signi ﬁcantly higher compared to the control. Conclusion: The results demonstrated that high JUN transcription level in chorionic tissue could be associated with miscarriage in ﬁrst trimester of pregnancy. E. Mashkina: None. K. Kovalenko: None.

 Prenatal diagnosis of Xq28 microdeletion including exon 10 of IKBKG gene in male fetus with increased nuchal translucency and hydrops and a family history ofIncontinentia Pigmenti,P01.14,S. Koka,"1, O. Lobel1, E. Zivi1, Z. Ben Neriah1, A. Frumkin2,","O. Weiss1, S. Zeligson1, R. Segel1 1Shaare Zedek Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel, 2Cytogenetics Lab, Department of Genetics, Hadassah Medical Center, Jerusalem, Israel Introduction: Incontinentia Pigmenti (IP), is an X linked dominant Male lethal disorder, caused by devastating mutations in IKBKG gene. A recurrent exon 4_10 deletionin the IKBKG gene accounts for 60 to 80% of IP causing mutations, but other point mutations along the gene as well as exon 10 (which include the zinc  ﬁnger domain) trun  cating mutation were described previously. Materials and methods: Chromosomal Microarray Analysis (CMA) was performed in chorionic villi sampleof aborted pregnancy of fetus with increased nuchal translucency and hydrops, and his 31 years old healthy mother. Results: CMA of the fetus found a 34kbp deletion on Xq28 chromosome including at least exon 10 of IKBKG gene   arr[hg19]Xq28(153,792,620 153,826,362)x0. Preli minary results show that the healthy mother carries the deletion in a mosaic state. Family history includes another termination of pregnancy of a male fetus with increasednuchal translucency, two spontaneous early abortions, a girl with suspected clinical diagnosis of IP and one health boy. The recurrent exon 4_10 deletion in IKBKG was previouslyexcluded in the symptomatic girl. Conclusions: Here we describe a 34kbp deletion on Xq28 chromosome including exon 10 of IKBKG geneinherited from a healthy mother as a cause for increased nuchal translucency and hydrops in male fetus with family history suspicious for familial IP. The deletion segregationin the family is now in progress and we believe it will explain the girl phenotype as well as the obstetric history.This report stresses the importance of molecular diagnosis in IP for genetic counseling of the entire family.

 Reciprocal 7p deletion 7q duplication in a malformed fetus due to maternal inversion of chromosome 7 cytogenetic and microarray analysis,P01.18,M. Hristova Savova,"1, R. Bozhilova2, V. Peycheva2,","E. Dimova3, K. Belemezova1, S. Yovinska1, M. Rizov1, P. Chaveeva1, A. Shterev1, R. Kaneva2, I. Dimova1,2 1SAGBAL ""Dr Shterev"", So ﬁa, Bulgaria,2Molecular Medicine Center, Medical University So ﬁa, So ﬁa, Bulgaria, 3RWTH, Aachen, Germany Pericentric inversions occur in human with a frequency of 1 2% of general population. These balanced chromosomal rearrangements do not cause an y problem for the carrier, but during meiosis there is a risk of inversion loop for  mation in the offspring leading to de novo duplication, deletion or a combination of bo th [duplication q/deletion p (dup q/del p) or del q/dup p]. Signi ﬁcant numbers of recombinants are produced when the inverted segmentsize is >50% of the total leng th of the affected chromo  some. We report here a case of prenatal diagnostics of a fetus with multiple anomalies: s evere growth retardation, enlarged third ventricle, agenesis of ductus venosus, and cyst of the blood cord. Cytogeneic analysis was performed after amniocentesis and pat hologic duplication of chro  mosome 7q was revealed. To clarify the aberration we made array CGH analysis; the results showed combined aberrations: 3.96 Mbp deletion of 7p (arr[hg19]7p22.3p22.2(54,185 4,017,864)x1) and 47 Mbp duplica  tion of 7q (7q31.1q36.3(111,668,521 159,118,566)x3). We tested the parents by cytogenetic analysis in ameantime. The mother was revealed to be a carrier of pericentric inversion in chromosome 7   46,XX,inv(7) (p22;q31). Thus, we clarify the genetic diagnosis in thefetus   the recombinant chromosome 7 [rec(7)dup(7q)inv (7)(p22q31)mat] must have arisen through meiotic crossing over between the inverted chromosome and thenormal chromosome 7 in the maternal germline. Conclu  sion: Array CGH is the most powerful technique in determining the exact size and boundaries of the unba lanced segments in case of rearranged chromosomes and, in combination with parental cytogenetic analysis, for providing the adequate genetic counselling.

 The impact of maternal inherited thrombophilia on intra uterine growth restriction,P01.19,"K. Kartvelishvili1,2, N. Pirtskhelani2,3, N. Kochiashvili2,",L. Makhaldiani4,"1Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia, 2National Forensics Bureau/Forensic Biology (DNA) Department, Tbilisi, Georgia,3Tbilisi Open University, Tbilisi, Georgia,4K. Eristavi National Center of Experi  mental and Clinical Surgery, Tbilisi, Georgia Introduction: Intrauterine growth restriction (IUGR) is deﬁned as estimated fetal weight below gestational age. Inherited thrombophilia is a blood coagulation disorder, which predisposes to thrombosis. Since the placenta is rich in blood vessels, it is reasonable to infer that clot formationwithin the placental vasculature may result in placental insufﬁciency, intrauterine growth restriction and other complications. Aim: The aim of this study was to determine the intensity of connection between inherited thrombophilia (Factor V Leiden, Prothrombin G20210A and MTHFR C677T genemutations) and IUGR. Materials and methods: 48 Georgian women with pregnancy complication (IUGR of unknown origin) and100 controls (women with three or more uncomplicated pregnancies) were investigated for detection of inherited thrombophilia by PCR analyses. Results: Relationships between IUGR and FVL (12.5% in patients and 0% in control; χ2(1,N,148),13.028, p,0.001) and Prothrombin (8.33% in patients and 1% in control; χ 2(1,N,148),5.343, p ,0.038) mutations were signiﬁcant. Relationship between IUGR and MTHFR mutation (6.25% in patients and 1% in control; χ2(1, N,148),3.399, p ,0.1) was weak. The combined double and triple mutations were seen in 4 cases, which was not seen in control group. It is important to note that 46(95.83%) patients had a history of other pregnancy complications and thrombosis, 19(39.53%) patients had a history of stillbirth. Conclusion: There are few studies concerning the association between IUGR and thrombophilia. Our study recon ﬁrms impact of studied mutations (totally 23%) on IUGR. Further research will help to clarify who should receive thromboprophylaxis to prevent adverse pregnancy outcomes in women with inherited thrombophilia.K. Kartvelishvili: None. N. Pirtskhelani: None.

Dimova2 1SAGBAL “D Shterev ”,S o ﬁa, Bulgaria,2SAGBAL “D Shterev ”; Department of Medical genetics, Medical University So ﬁa, Bulgaria, So ﬁa, Bulgaria We offered in our clinics different kinds of genetic analyses with the aim to clarify diagnosis in men with severe sper  matogenic failure. We have performed cytogenetic analysisin 770 men attending reproductive clinics (group I), 88 with con ﬁrmed diagnosis of oligoastenozoospermia (group II) and 43 with con ﬁrmed azoospermia (group III). Numerical sex chromosomal aberrations (incl. mosaicism) were found in 3.3% of group I, 3.4% of group II (mainly polysomy Y) and 9.3% of group III (mainly Klinefeltersyndrome); female karyotype was diagnosed in 0.6% of men. Structural chromosomal aberrations (mainly translo  cations) were detected in 1.2% of group I, 3.4% of group IIand none of group III. Chromosomal heteromorphism was revealed, respectively, in 13%, 13.6% and 11.5%. DNA analysis for 10 pathogens (CT, MG, MH, UP, UU, TV,NG, TP, HS1 and 2) was performed in ejaculate of men with oligoastenozoospermia and azoospermia. The test was positive in 61.5% of azoospermic men and in 21% of oli goastenozoospermic (p<0.01) as double infection was revealed in 38% and 12%, respectively (p<0.05). The sta  tistically higher frequency was established for Ureaplasmaparvum (54% vs 15%) and Herpes simplex (23% vs 3%). Genotyping for 24 mutations and IVS 8 intron poly  morphism in CFTR gene was performed in 52 men withsevere male factor. Both delf508 mutation and IVS 8 5T was found in 5.8% of the analyzed men. In conclusion, by applying all of the above mentioned analyses in 52 menwith severe male factor, we were able to make diagnosis in 60% of them. S. Yovinska: None. M. Hristova Savova: None. K.

The second pregnancy ended as a missed abortion. Karyotyping was perfomed to the couple and results were normal kar  yotypes. Couple negated the family burden, but X linkedand primary autosomal recessive microcephaly was suspected. Materials and methods: After fetal ultrasonogram showing recurrent primary microcephaly in the third pregnancy, fetal blood sample obtained by cordocentesis. The sample was used for standard cytogenetic analysis,aCGH and clinical exome next generation sequencing. Results: The fetal karyotyping showed a normal male karyotype (46,XY), con ﬁrmed by aCGH analysis. Clinical exome testing and bioinformatic analysis of the genes known to be associated with microcephaly and similar pathological conditions detected pathogenic and likelypathogenic variant in the ASPM (abnormal spindle like microcephaly associated) gene. Pathogenic variant was ASPM c.7324C> T, known stop gained mutation with conﬁrmed maternal origin. Likely pathogenic variant was newely described fremeshift deletion ASPM c.10148 delC, with con ﬁrmed paternal origin. Conclusions: Comprehensive genetic testing of affected fetus showed compound heterozygous mutations in ASPM gene, designed as MCPH5 (microcephaly primary heredi tary) locus. An autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance of the detected mutations is most likely involved in the formation of primary congenital microcephaly.Patients are genetically informed about the mode of inheritance of these mutations, possibility of prenatal testing, as well as of the possibility of in vitro fertilizationfor the purpose of preimplantation genetic diagnosis of detected mutations.

Polymorphic variations are known to occur in the general population. They include varying sizes of heterochromatin blocks, satellite or repeatsequence regions and inversions. However, previous stu  dies have reported that heterochromatin polymorphisms are more frequent in infertile men. This may be associatedwith infertility and unsuccessful pregnancy. Pre  implantation genetic testing for aneuploidy (PGT A) is a common method in the assisted reproduction techniques(ART) to determine the genet ic status of human embryos. In the presented case we report an infertile couple with recurrent implantation failures (RIF). Karyotyping by G banding of cultured peripheral blood lymphocytes was performed on both patients. Af ter the analysis, in the male partner was detected hetero chromatin polymorphism, karyotype  46, XY, 9qh +. After genetic counseling, PGD A was used. For detection of chromosomal imbal  ances a laser assiste d biopsy was performed on blastocyst stage embryos followed by whole genome ampli ﬁcation (WGA) and next generation sequencing (NGS) was performed according to manufacturer ’s instructions. 6 embryos were biopsied and analyzed. None of the embryos was euploid. Various aberrations   from single to complex monosomies and trisomies, were detected. Dueto the lack of an euploid embryo, transfer was not per  formed. This case report is a good example for the reproductive failures at carriers of chromosomal hetero chromatin polymorphisms. NGS allows screening of all 24 chromosomes. It ’s effective, ensuring a high level of conﬁdence in the results and subsequent selection of euploid embryos for transfer. M. Rizov: None. K. Belemezova: None. M. Hristova  Savova: None. S.

After dividing theresults by gender, a higher frequency of the chromosome 9 polymorphism was observed in women. The frequency of chromosomal polymorphisms in chromosome 1 and 16 werebroadly similar for both genders. As for the couples, we observed that appearance of chromosomal centromeric polymorphisms in both partners was signi ﬁcantly higher, reaching a considerable number of 74%. Conclusions: Increasing evidence from our research has conﬁrmed that infertility and subfertility are closely related to chromosomal polymorphisms as 80 % of the patients were identi ﬁed with a centromeric chromosomal variation.

Röpke1 1Institut für Humangenetik, University Hospital, Muenster, Germany,2Zentrum für Pränatalmedizin, Muenster, GermanyWe report on a non consanguineous couple who presented in the 25thweek of their second pregnancy. The fetus showed mild cerebral ventriculomegaly, hypoplasia of the cerebellum and a peculiar posture of the ﬁngers without further abnormalities. Family history revealed that his 1.5 year old sister postnatally showed a ﬁxed posture of theﬁngers and a general developmental delay but no diagnostics had been done so far. In order to exclude tris  omy 18, the couple decided for amniocentesis. Array ana lysis showed a gain of 14.7 Mb in the chromosomal region 3p25.1 p26.3 and a loss of 5.3 Mb in 6q27 not visible in conventional karyotype (GTG banding, 400 bands). Thesister clinically exhibits a striking similarity with features already described in partial trisomy 3p like hypertelorism, round face, short neck, down slanting palpebral ﬁssures, psychomotor delay and behavioral problems. Chromosomal analysis and array analysis were performed and revealed the same abnormalities as in the fetus. We there fore suspected a balanced translocation in one of the parents and indeed the mother carries a balanced reciprocal trans  location (46,XX,t(3;6)(p25.1;q27)). Despite the clinicalvariability, the parents felt reassured because they did not experience their daughter as a handicapped child. Therefore, they decided to continue pregnancy. Our case illustrates,that minor ﬁndings in prenatal ultrasound and detailed family history may be crucial in prenatal diagnosis. More  over, it stresses the importance of array analysis in theprenatal setting. We postulate that genetic counselling should be offered early in pregnancy to all families with retarded children. U.

The complement system, is a ﬁrst defense mechanism towards unwanted pathogens and host elements. Decay accelerating factor (DAF,CD55), MAC inhibitory protein (MAC IP,CD59) and membraneco factor protein (MCP,CD46) are major complement inhibitory proteins which are highly expressed in normal placenta. Herein, we had nine women with spontaneousabortion as our control group and seventeen women with RPL as our study group. TSH, T3, T4, and progesterone, also C3, C4 serum levels were determined. Since CD55,CD46 and CD59 of fetal trophoblast and maternal tissues are crucial to provide tissue homeostasis, we analyzed the expression of these genes using CFX real time PCR setting.The statistical analysis according to average CT values were done through Qiagen GeneGlobe assay tool. As a pre  liminary ﬁnding of this research, CD55 expression level was reasonably elevated at decidual tissues of our cases compared to that of controls.

As a preliminary ﬁnding, PGR gene expression level was diminished in our case group compared to that of controls. Conversely, ITPR3 expressionwas elevated and there was a slight increase in MAPK1 gene expression in patients compared to controls (p>0.05). As protective effect of progesterone on decidual tissue isstrongly associated with expression of PGR and its down  stream genes, possible future treatment targets could be identi ﬁed for RPL. P.

 Maternal pathogenic KCNQ1 variant and predisposition to recurrent fetal loss,P01.32,L. Kasak,"1, K. Rull1,2, T. Yang3, D. Roden3,M .L a a n1","1Institute of Biomedicine and Translational Medicine, University of Tartu, Tartu, Estonia,2Women ’s Clinic, Tartu University Hospital, Tartu, Estonia,3Departments of Medicine, Pharmacology and Biomedical Informatics, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN, United States Introduction: Recurrent pregnancy loss (RPL) concerns up to 5% of women of childbearing age. Up to 25% ofRPL cases remain idiopathic, suggesting a possible mono  genic origin. The study aimed to identify the genetic cause of idiopathic late RPL in a family with multiple mis carriages without fetal malformations or chromosomal abnormalities. Materials and methods: Exome sequencing was applied to three miscarried fetuses and the mother, who had experienced ﬁve live births, intersected by three early pregnancy losses, and six fetal deaths. Interestingly, 4/5karyotyped fetal losses had a normal female karyotype, whereas all but one live born children are male. Results: The miscarried conceptuses do not share any rare single nucleotide variants not detected in live born children. However, the mother carries a KCNQ1 p. Val173Asp substitution (rs199472695), previously reportedin a patient with long QT syndrome (LQTS; PMID:16414944). KCNQ1 protein forms potassium804 J. del Picchiachannels and regulates the cardiac action potential duration. Consistent with a recent epidemiological study (PMID:31520628), mothers carrying pathogenic heterozy  gous variants in LQTS genes have an elevated risk of fetal death regardless of the carrier status of the fetus. Functional assay con ﬁrmed pathogenicity of the p.Val173Asp variant. The mutant channel signi ﬁcantly reduced total activating and deactivating currents, with dramatically positive shift of voltage dependence of activation by ~10 mV. Conclusions: Dysfunction of KCNQ1 contributes not only to the risk of sudden death from LQTS, but also as a maternal risk factor to RPL. The exact molecular mechan ism behind this effect is still to be clari ﬁed. Funding: Estonian Research Council grant IUT34 12 L. Kasak: None. K. Rull: None. T. Yang: None. D. Roden: None. M.

 Prenatal diagnosis of a complex skeletal dysplasia case deciphered by exome sequencing and postmortem pathological examination,P01.33,G. Christopoulou,"1,A. Oikonomaki1, S. Samara1,","A. Xefteris2,A .Κonstantinidou3, P. Constantoulakis1 1Genotypos Science Labs MSA, Athens, Greece,2Euroge  netica S.A., Thessaloniki, Greece,3Department of Pathol  ogy, Unit of Perinatal Pathology, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens (NKUA), Athens, Greece Introduction: We present a prenatal and postmortem diagnosis of diastrophic dysplasia (DD) in a fetus conceived by a mother with hypochondroplasia. Materials and methods: Prenatal testing at 13 weeks gestation was requested due to a maternal hypochondropla  sia phenotype of unknown genetic background. Clinicalexome sequencing was performed on DNA extracted from chorionic villi and maternal blood, using Sophia Genetics ’ Clinical Exome Solution v2. Following preparationsaccording to the manufacturer ’s protocol, DNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 genetic analyser. Data processing, variant calling and pre classi ﬁca  tion were conducted by SOPHiA DDM ®bioinformatics pipelines. Results: AFGFR3 pathogenic variant was identi ﬁed in the mother, con ﬁrming her phenotype; this variant was not detected in the fetus. However, one maternally inherited pathogenic and one of unknown signi ﬁcance SLC26A2 variants were identi ﬁed, related, according to the literature, to four distinct genetic skeletal dysplasias of various severity and prognosis. On 2 ndtrimester ultrasound the fetus presented short long bones and, following clinical genetic counselling, the pregnancy was terminated.Postmortem radiographical and histopathological ﬁndings were consistent with Diastrophic Dysplasia. Discussion: Targeted FGFR3 mutation testing, based on the mother ’s phenotype, would have missed the Diastrophic Dysplasia diagnosis in the fetus, preventing informed decision for this pregnancy and proper genetic counsellingfor the family. Therefore, this case highlights the utility of exome sequencing for complex overlapping prenatal phenotypes such as skeletal dysplasia, and underscores thecontribution of postmortem pathological examination to the phenotype   genotype correlation, which is essential for the correct interpretation of exome sequencing results.

" Homozygous hypomorphic SOX9 mutation in two 46, XY sisters without skeletal malformations",P01.34,S. Ledig,"1, A. Tewes1, T. Özdemir2, A. Bohring1,","P. Wieacker1 1Institute for Human Genetics, Münster, Germany, 2Department of Medical Genetics, Izmir, Turkey Haploinsuf ﬁciency of the SOX9 gene in humans causes the skeletal malformation syndrome campomelic dysplasia (CD), which is a semilethal disorder characterised by con  genital bowing of the long bones, cleft palate, absence ofolfactory bulbs and tracts, heart and renal malformations, hypoplastic lungs, narrow thoracic cage, and delayed bone age. CD patients generally die from respiratory distress.Together with the bone disease 75% of CD patients show testicular dysgenesis leading to sex reversal. Here, we describe two sisters with the suspicion of non syndromicXY DSD (disorder of sexual development) and no signs of skeletal malformations. Causative mutations in SRY,NR5A1 andDHH have been excluded by Sanger sequencing before whole exome sequencing was performed and surprisingly revealed in both sisters homozygosity for undescribed var  iant c.1518C>G p.(Leu506Val) in SOX9 . The consanguine parents are heterozygous for c.1518C>G p.(Leu506Val) in SOX9 . Functional characterization of SOX9 c.1518C>G p. (Leu506Val) by luciferase assay showed no decrease oftransactivating function on Col2a1 promotor in contrast to two SOX9 mutations (c.347C>T p.(Ala116Val) and c.358C>T p.(Arg120Cys)) known to be associated with CD,explaining the non skeletal phenotype of our patients. Therefore, we suggest that SOX9 variant c.1518C>G p. (Leu506Val) is a hypomorphic mutation that causes XYDSD without raising any SOX9 related skeletal phenotype.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 805S.

Materials and methods. The serum concentration of VEGF by ELISA was measured among 24 pregnant women(term 20 30 weeks of gestation) with prenatally diagnosed congenital heart defects (CHDs) in f еtus. For control group we studied the serum of 45 pregnant women without com plicated genetic and obstetric history. For the analysis of rs2010963 VEGF the PCR   RFLP method was used. Results. Maternal VEGF 405GG genotype was signi ﬁcantly correlated with congenital heart defects of the f еtus (p,0.017, OR , 3.45 (95% CI: 1.22   9.72)). In the CHD group, compared with controls, VEGF serum levels were signi ﬁcantly higher (285.6±4.5 vs. 268,0±5,2 pg/mL, p ,0.029). The VEGF serum level in pregnant women with genotype VEGF 405GG was higher compare with another genotypes group 405GC and 405CC . Conclusions. Our study suggests that evaluation of VEGF serum level during pregnancy may provide prog  nostic data, and help identify patients who would have CHDof fetus.

González Ramírez2 1Servicio Andaluz de Salud (SAS)., Granada, Spain, 2FIBAO., Granada, SpainIntroduction: Wlaker Warburg syndrome (WWS) is clinically de ﬁned as congenital muscular dystrophy acom  panied by a variety of brain and eye malformations. Its represents the most severe clinical phenotype in a spectrum of alpha dystroglycan posttranslational proccesing abnormalities, wich share a defect in laminin bindin glycansynthesis. Homozygotics or compound heterozygotics mutations in several genes had been described as causative for WWS, but very low cases with complete homozygoticsdelections. Here we described two cases of prenatal diag  nosis in a couple with complete CRPPA gene delection. In theﬁrst pregnancy, amniocentesis was done for genetics prenatal diagnosis, when by eco at 16 gestation week, was detected absence of cerebellar vermis, megacisterna magna with occipital bone defects and. At a second pregnancychorionic villis sampling was performed at 12 gestation week. Materials and methods: Karyotype was performed with the standar methods. Comparative genomic hybridation (CGH Array) was performed with the Agilent platform, suplied by PerkinElmer. Results: In the ﬁrst fetus, the fetal Karyotype was normal (46,XX), but the CGH Array detected an homo  zygotic 354,58 Kb delecttion at 7p21.2. CGH Array ofboth parents presented the same chromosomal microdelec  tion in heterozygosis and was recomended genetic prenatal diagnosis for another pregnancies. In the nextpregnancy, chorionic villis sample was analided with de same reults; normal karyotype (46,XY) and homozygotic 354,58 Kb delection at 7p21,2. In both cases the gestationwasﬁnised. Conclusions : The use of CGH Array in prenatal diagnosis when ecogra ﬁcs anomalies are detected is the election method for detection of chromosomal microdelec  tions and microduplications. M.

In many cases, the chromosome806 J. del Picchiaconstitution of twin fetuses is discordant, so an accurate prenatal diagnosis is needed. We report two dichorionic/dia  mniotic twin pregnancies presenting with ultrasound anoma  lies affecting only one of the fetuses (fetus B). A chorionic villus sample (CVS) was obtained separately for each one of the fetuses, allowing individual analyses to determine possiblechromosomal abnormalities. In both cases, samples were ﬁrst analyzed by QF PCR to detect possible common aneu  ploidies. In three of the fetuses, an X chromosome aneuploidyin mosaic form was detected. Additional analyses by con  ventional cytogenetics, QF PCR and/or array were performed ﬁrst in CVS and later in amniotic ﬂuid (AF) samples in order to interpretate the results, detecting possible con ﬁned pla  cental mosaicism and allowing a de ﬁnitive diagnosis for each fetus.

Congenital ocular coloboma is a birthdefect caused by abnormal development of the eye during embryogenesis. We report on a 33 year old man with bilateral congenital coloboma of the iris at 6 o ‘clock. The patient has a high myopia and myopic astigmatism, BCVA of BE   0,7. Choroidal nevi of both eyes were also noticed. He has no other speci ﬁc complaints as photophobia or nictalopia, the color vision is full. There were no dys  morphic signs or developmental issues. Chromosomal microarray analysis using the HumanCytoSNP 12v2.1BeadChip (Illumina Inc., San Diego, CA, USA) was per  formed and revealed a 2.96 Mb in size deletion in the 16q23.1q23.2 region, arr[GRCh37]16q23.1q23.2(78473430_81434676)×1. The deleted region encompasses 12 protein coding genes, including 5 disease associated genes WWOX, MAF, GCSH, BCO1 andGAN . Three genes WWOX, GCSH and GAN are associated with autosomal recessive disorders. MAF is associated with Ayme Gripp syndrome and various types of cataracts. BCO1 encodes beta carotene oxygenase 1, which is a key enzyme in the production of vitamin A from carotenoids. De ﬁciency of this enzyme results in hypercarotenemia and secondaryvitamin A de ﬁciency. We speculate that haploinsuf ﬁciency ofBCO1 may be related to congenital bilateral iris colo  boma in our patient. B. Aleksi ūnienė: None. B. Tumien ė: None. R. Strupait ė– Šileikien ė: None. A.

Debut of vision loss oftenoccurs in mid early adulthood and the degree varies. A single mutation in EFEMP1 c.1033C>T p.(Arg345Trp) has been identi ﬁed as the cause. Materials and methods: We report a 57 year old Scandinavian woman of non consanguineous Danish Cau  casian parents presenting with vision loss and metamor phopsia. Ophthalmological examination revealed massive hard drusen on both eyes in the macular region and nasal to the disc as well as macular hyperpigmentation. Opticalcoherence tomography on the left eye showed partly affected foveal con ﬁguration with slightly increased foveal thickness. The patient was clinically diagnosed withDHRD/ML and followed annually with stable conditions. Ten years later reduced visual acuity primarily on the left eye and increased atrophy with subretinal ﬂuid were observed. Anti vascular endothelial growth factor (anti  VEGF) was administrated, but without effect. Family history revealed no other cases of reduced vision.Diagnostic next generation sequencing of seven genes (Amplexa FleckRet7 Panel) associated with ﬂecked retina was performed at Amplexa Genetics using NovaSeq 6000.The mutation was veri ﬁed by bidirectional Sanger sequencing. Results: A known pathogenic mutation NM_001039348 (EFEMP1 ): c.1033C>T, p.(Arg345Trp) previously seen in relation to DHRD/ML was identi ﬁed in a heterozygote state in the index.

XFS is a multifactorial disease with genetic and non genetic factors associated. LOXL1 and CACNA1A are the main genes associated with anincreased risk. Materials and methods: High resolution melting (HRM) is a simple and high throughput assay, which has beenwidely applied in sequence polymorphism identi ﬁcation. Our main goal was to test the suitability of HRM analysis as a genetic screening technique for XFS. We analyzed 26XFS patients and 52 controls. We analyzed LOXL1 (rs1048661, rs3825942, rs2165241, rs16958477, rs12914489, rs11638944, rs7173049) and CACNA1A(rs4926244) genes. Detected variants were con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Results: The allelic and genotypic frequencies of the SNPs are shown in the Table 1. Most XFS SNP were properly resolved by this technique, with the exception of rs1048661 and rs3825942. This is like due to the highpercentage of CG (~70%) surrounding these SNP. Conclusion: Our method provides a genotyping strategy for identifying individuals with XFS SNPs in a cost effective way for most variants analyzed.

We examined a group of patients withearly/prelingual nonsyndromic hearing loss (NSHL) in which we excluded pathogenic mutations in GJB2 gene. We examined 421 unrelated patients for deletions of STRC gene with quantitative comparative ﬂuorescent PCR (QCF PCR) and 201 unrelated patients with next generation sequencing by custom designed NSHL gene panel. We discovered thedisease cause in 54 patients, from which 43 we diagnosed with NSHL panel examination (21.4 %). The most frequent type of nonsyndromic hearing loss is DFNB16, caused bybiallelic mutations in the STRC gene and detected to be a cause of hearing loss in 23 patients, almost half of the clariﬁed patients (43%). The spectrum of STRC gene mutations was as follows; A) twelve patients werehomozygotes for STRC gene deletion, B) eight were com  pound heterozygotes for STRC gene deletion and point inactivating mutation and C) three were compound hetero  zygotes for point inactivating mutations. Other biallelic pathogenic mutations were detected in genes MYO15A (six patients), LOXHD1 (ﬁve patients), TMPRSS3 (ﬁve patients), CDH23 (four patients), OTOG (two patients).

 Whole exome sequencing in hearing loss Mexican family cases,P02.13,"M. Arenas Sordo1, P. Linares Mendoza1, J. Doll2,P .","Bahena2, M. Hofrichter2, B. Vona2, K. Peñuelas Romero1,","T. Haaf2 1Instituto Nacional de Rehablitacion, Mexico City, Mexico, 2Institute of Human Genetics, Julius Maximilians Univer  sity, Würzburg, Germany Introduction: Congenital hearing loss is one of the most frequent and genetically heterogeneous sensory diseases in humans. Its prevalence is 1 2 per 1000 live newborns.Globally, the GJB2 gene is responsible for almost 20% of congenital hearing loss but in Mexico it is lower. Mutations in about 200 other genes have been associated. Currentstudies of new generation sequencing (NGS) has a diag  nostic rate of about 40%. Material and method: Ten familial cases of bilateral sensorineural hearing loss, severe to profound, non  syndromic, with complete audiological studies and tomo  graphic image of the ear, were studied. Sanger sequencingof GJB2 was done and when no pathogenic variants were found in this gene, WES was performed. Results: 1 patient presented pathogenic variants of GJB2 (c.139G> T and c.551G> C), the rest of the results are shown in the table. In 4 patients, the origin of the hearing loss could not be determined. The results found, for themost part, are those expected according to what is reported in other populations, especially variants in genes that cause Usher syndrome. Conclusion: The aetiological diagnosis of hearing loss requires the clinical study of patients and their families and molecular studies, starting with the one with the highestprevalence to subsequently move to the different possibi  lities. It is not possible to date to know the etiology in 100% of cases. Gene Variant Protein Zygosity Related disease GPR98 c.5167C>G/ c.14939T>Cp.

Ammosov North East  ern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Mutations in the SLC26A4 gene (7q22 q31) lead to recessively inherited deafness (DFNB4) and Pendredsyndrome. More than 500 pathogenic SLC26A4  variants are currently revealed in deaf patients in different populations worldwide. This study aimed to investigate the SLC26A4 pathogenic contribution in deafness with unknown etiology in patients belonging to indigenous peoples of Southern Siberia: Tuvinians (the Tyva Republic) and Altaians (theAltai Republic). Materials and methods: The study included 232 patients (171 Tuvinians, 61 Altaians) with hearing loss of unknownetiology. Analysis of the SLC26A4 complete sequence including all 21 exons and ﬂanking regions was performed by Sanger sequencing. Results: High contribution of the SLC26A4 mutations in deafness was found in Tuvinian patients (28.2%) in contrast810 J. del Picchiato Altaian patients (4.3%). Both known (c.170C>A, c.919  2A>G, c.2027T>A, c.2034 +1G>A, c.2168A>G) and several novel pathogenic variants as well as a wide range of benign variants were found in the SLC26A4 sequences of patients. High frequency of mutation c.919 2A>G in Tuvinians (69.9% of all mutant alleles detected in patientsand carrier frequency reaching to 5.1% in controls) is probably due to the founder effect. Conclusion: This is the ﬁrst study to address the SLC26A4 mutations contribution in deafness in Siberian populations. Contrast differences in the proportion of deafness caused by SLC26A4 mutations were revealed in Tuvinians and Altaians despite of their related ethnicity and close residence of these indigenous peoples of Southern Siberia. Obtained data signi ﬁcantly contribute to the SLC26A4 allelic diversity worldwide.

Despite substantial progress in mass sequencing techniques, the genetic cause of 35 45% of the cases of IRD is stillunknown. Since the participation of CNVs is involved in at least 1 in 13 patients, here we present the results of ana  lyzing CNV in a cohort of Basque patients using 2 differentapproaches. Materials and methods: 48 IRD patients and 2 positive controls were analyzed. We compared 2 hybridizationarrays: Affymetrix CytoScan Xon arrays (ACX) and Agilent Custom arrays (ACA), with 123 IRD related genes.Results: Affymetrix CytoScan Xon array: A mean of 56 CNVs/patient, both positive control and 10 potentially disease causing CNVs were detected. Agilent Custom array: A mean of 8 CNVs/patient, only one positive control and 6 potentially disease causing CNVs were found. Conclusions: ACA are easier to analyze, since their results derive from only 123 IRD genes. Moreover, they include information from both exonic and intronic regions. In contrast, ACX delivers information of CNV throughoutthe whole genome, with most probes enriched on exonic regions. Therefore information from exons is more robust in ACX arrays. As a general conclusion, Affymetrix CytoScanXon arrays have more sensitivity but less speci ﬁcity than our customized Agilent CGH array.

Because all corneal layers are involved in disease progres  sion we aimed to establish a protocol for transcriptomicproﬁle based on three distinct corneal epithelium regions. Materials and methods: The 10 corneal epithelia before the corneal cross linking procedure were stampted tomaintain correct orientation for cutting on microscope slides with light microscope ’s control. As non keratoconus control 5 myopia patients undergoing refractive errorcorrection were included. From each corneal epithelium the central, middle, and periphery corneal region samplesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 811were proceeded based on epithelial thickness mapping and corneal tomography maps. The RNA samples were extracted using Norgen Biotek kits (Single Cell RNA Puriﬁcation Kit, RNA/DNA/Protein Puri ﬁcation Plus Micro Kit), and RNA quality/quantity were compered (RNA 6000 Pico Kit, Agilent). Results: Study design included evaluation of unaffected curvature of cornea and different physiological/functional states of epithelial cells from keratoconus cone and non cone corneal regions. After protocol establishment we obtained high quality RNA for RNA seq libraries preparation. Conclusions: The corneal material proceeded in accor  dance with the presented protocol will allow for detailed keratoconus epithelium study involving the phenotypicaland transcriptional assessments of keratoconus progression.

 Beta tubulin gene mutation in association with con genital Leber herediter amaurosis syndrome,P02.18,A. Maasz,"1,2, R. Ripszam1,2, A. Zsigmond1,2, J. Bene1,2,","A. Gyenesei2, B. Melegh1,2, K. Hadzsiev1,2 1University of Pecs, Department of Medical Genetics, Pecs, Hungary,2Szentagothai Research Centre, Pecs, Hungary Introduction: Beta tubulin 4B isotype is one of the sub  units of microtubules, which is responsible for the main tenance of microtubules stability. The beta tubulin 4B protein is encoded by TUBB4B gene located on chromo  some 9. Genetic defects of microtubules have been asso ciated with several disorders like tubulinopathies, which show huge heterogeneity. In TUBB4B gene, only a few mutations have been identi ﬁed to have implications in dis  orders, so far. Patients and methods: The authors report a Hungarian family with undiagnosed rare disorder. The family memberssuffer from also ophthalmologic and otologic impairments. The authors analyzed the proband and her affected children and the unaffected mother of the proband using wholegenome sequencing (WGS). The authors found that all of the affected family members carry the c.1171C>T missensemutation in TUBB4B gene, which causes Arg to Cys change at 391 amino acid position. The mutation was absent in the sample of the unaffected family member. The clinical evaluation of the ﬁndings reveals that the mutation ful ﬁlls the criteria of pathogenic mutation and the clinical symptoms of the affected family members matches toLeber congenital amaurosis syndrome, which has been previously correlated to this TUBB4B mutation. Conclusion: Our unique ﬁndings with three affected family members carrying the TUBB4B mutation highlights the importance of next generation sequencing in the discovery of new pathogenic variants and in diagnosis ofrare disorders; additionally, it will be important knowledge in gene therapy even in ophthalmology and otology.

 Mutational analysis of the most frequent genes in Romanian patients with congenital non syndromic hearing loss,P02.20,I. Resmerita,"1, S. Cozma2, M. Panzaru1, E. Gorduza1,","R. Popescu1, L. Radulescu2, L. Butnariu1, C. Rusu1 1University of Medicine and Pharmacy “Grigore T. Popa ” Iasi   Medical Genetics Department, Iasi, Romania,2Uni  versity of Medicine and Pharmacy “Grigore T. Popa ”Iasi   ENT Department, Iasi, Romania Introduction: Hearing loss is the most common congenital sensory impairment worldwide, with a genetic etiology in more than 60% of the cases. It is estimated that more than70 loci may contribute to non syndromic deafness, the most commonly involved genes being GJB2, GJB3, GJA1, MYO6, SLC26A4, POU3F4 . The knowledge on the pre  valence of mutations in a certain population allows the development of adjusted screening programs. Materials and methods: We included in this study 144 unrelated Romanians with non syndromic congenital severe to profound hearing loss (NSHL). All of the individuals were screened by Multiplex ligation dependent probeampli ﬁcation (MLPA) for mutations in GJB2, GJB3, GJB6 ,WFS1 andPOU3F4 genes, and Sanger sequencing for variants in GJB2 gene. Results: We found 54 homozygotes or compound heterozygotes individuals (38%) and 14 carriers of different mutations on GJB2 gene. In the study group we found a total of 10 different mutations in GJB2 gene. The 35delG was the most common form of mutation that was present in812 J. del Picchia23 out of 54 (43%) mutated alleles. The next frequent types of mutation were WT313del14, IVS1 and c.71G>A. We also found 2 patients with mutations in WFS1 gene. Conclusions: The etiology of deafness is an additional argument, besides audiological tests, for early treatment (best choice being cochlear implant) and an essentialelement for the correct management of the individuals. Moreover, identi ﬁcation of the genetic basis of hearing loss in a child facilitates correct genetic counselling withadequate molecular testing of the parents and subsequent prenatal diagnosis. I.

Kaneva","Genome Diagnostics Laboratory, Molecular Medicine Center, Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochem istry, Medical Faculty, Medical University of So ﬁa, So ﬁa, Bulgaria Introduction: Retinoblastoma is the most common pedia  tric ocular tumor affecting the retina, initiated mainly by mutations in the tumor suppressor gene RB1. Both heredi tary and sporadic forms of the disease are known. Materials and methods: In the current study we included two Bulgarian patients diagnosed with retinoblastoma. DNAwas isolated from blood. Next generation sequencing was performed on MiSeq/Illumina platform with TruSight Cancer panel including 94 cancer related genes. Results: We found two heterozygous probably pathogenic variants both in RB1, encoding RB transcription corepres  sor 1: c.2606C>T (p.Pro869Leu; rs775273085) in exon 25and c.1960 +1G>C in intron 19 of the RB1 gene. Conclusions: The missense variant c.2606C> T (p. Pro869Leu) in exon 25 is of low frequency in the population(one heterozygote C / T is detected in gnomAD, 1/251337). This mutation was also detected in a heterozygous condition in the mother of the patient, who was diagnosed with renalangiomyolipoma with focal hemorrhages and micro necro  sis. The other variant c.1960 +1G> C found in intron 19 is new for data bases. Single point replacements of G>A andG>T in the same position have been shown to be pathogenic in patients with retinoblastoma. According to the program used to evaluate the effect of intron variants, replacement ofc.1960 +1G> C would affect mRNA splicing (ADA score 0.99). All of the six commonly used programs to assess thepathogenicity of genetic alterations identify the variant as potentially pathogenic. Funding: NSP “Young Scientists and Postdoctoral Fellows ” D.R.

 The utility of whole exome sequencing in establishing speci ﬁc diagnosis in three cases with syndromic cataracts,P02.27,"P. Liskova , L. Dudakova, J. Moravikova, M. Magner,",T. Honzik,"First Faculty of Medicine, Prague, Czech Republic Introduction: Congenital and juvenile cataracts can be associated with a range of systemic signs. Herein we aim to report results of molecular genetic investigation in sixprobands with syndromic cataracts without a de ﬁnitive clinical diagnosis. Materials and methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed in all index cases. Variants with minor allele frequency less than 0.005 as per gnomAD v.2 were ﬁltered and those located in genes listed in database C a t   M a pw e r eg i v e nap r i o r i t y for further evaluation. Conventional sequencing was used to con ﬁrm the presence of the variants and for segregation analysiswithin the families. Variant classi ﬁ cation was based on the American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics guidelines. Results: One proband carried a heterozygous variant c.3491del in COL2A1 predicted to interfere with pre mRNA splicing. Subsequent re evaluation of his clinical dataconﬁrmed the diagnosis of Stickler syndrome, which was also present in the mother. One proband had a de novo arising heterozygous variant c.512T>G; p.(Leu171Trp) inMYH9 allowing to make a diagnosis of MYH9 related disease. The third case had a known heterozygous change c.284G>C; p.(Gly95Ala) in RIT1 causing Noonan syn  drome. His mother was subsequently found to be also mildly affected. No possibly pathogenic variant was identi ﬁed in three other probands. Conclusions: WES allowed for providing de ﬁnitive diagnosis in three probands with syndromic cataracts.

Shakola1, V. Mitev1, R. Kaneva1","1Molecular Medicine Center, Medical University –Soﬁa, Soﬁa, Bulgaria,2Department of Neurology, University Hospital Alexandrovska, Medical University –Soﬁa, Bulgaria, So ﬁa, Bulgaria Introduction: Usher syndrome (USH) is a rare disorder causing retinitis pigmentosa (RP), and sensorineural hearingloss. Due to the phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity of this disease, the best method to screen the causative muta  tions is by high throughput sequencing. By next generationsequencing of clinical exome including known USH cau  sative genes, we aimed to identify the disease causing mutation in two USH pedigrees. Materials and methods: Using Illumina ®platform, we identi ﬁed two pathogenic variants in two USH genes (PCDH15 and ADGRV1 ) segregating with vision and hearing loss in two unrelated Bulgarian families. Results: In a USH family, an affected woman was homozygous for a splice site mutation in PCDH15 (c.3983 +1G>T,p.?), predicted to cause splice error   a known mutation for USH type 1F. Ophthalmological examination of the patient con ﬁrmed typical RP and prompted a corrected USH t ype diagnosis. Patient ’s unaffected parents and brother were heterozygous for the mutation. In an un related clinical c ase, two siblings with RP were homozygous for a novel nonsense mutation inADGRV1 (c.5709G>A,p.Trp1903*), predicted to create a very premature stop codon and shortened protein.Clinical follow up subsequently con ﬁrmed pre existing hearing loss since early childhood in the two patients, resulting in a reassigned diagnosis of USH. Asymptomaticparents and brother were h eterozygous carriers of the mutation. Conclusions: We have recruited two pedigrees with USH and found homozygous mutations in PCDH15 and ADGRV1 . The proteins encoded by these genes are thought to interact with one another to form a network in the sensorycells of the retina and inner ear.

Isaev2 1Oftalmic, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Genetico, Mos  cow, Russian Federation,3Clinical bioinformatics labora  tory, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Usher syndrome is one of the most frequent reasons of combined blindness and deafness. There are three types of Usher syndrome, type 3 is mild and can beclinically evaluated quite accurately. There is no known effective treatment of Usher syndrome type 3. Materials and methods: 120 patients with isolated and syndromic retinitis pigmentosa participated in the study under NCT03901391 clinical trial protocol. Out of 120 cases six were CLRN1 con ﬁrmed. Complete ophthalmolo  gic, ENT, and vestibular medical tests were done for clinical characterization. WES, Sanger sequencing were provided for genetic analysis and diagnosis con ﬁrmation. Results: 6 patients (4 male, 2 female) aged 30.2±6.9 yrs were diagnosed with CLRN1 associated retinopathy which showed classical retinitis pigmentosa bone spicules inthe peripheral retina combined with hearing loss starting from early childhood. Four patients were having mild myopia and two were having emmetropia. Four of thesepatients were unrelated to each other and two were sibs (brother and sister). All of the patients had c.567T>G p. Tyr189* mutation in homozygous state, which probably candenote the founder effect on the territory of Russia. Conclusions: There were no previouslydescribed and published Usher syndrome type 3 clinical cases in Russiaconﬁrmed with CLRN1 gene mutations. There might be attractive perspectives for the treatment strategies for such group of patients not only because CLRN1 gene has only 6exonsand mRNA is relatively short (2,39 kb), but also because mutation is homogenous and includes only c.567T>G p.Tyr189* mutation in homozygous state.Funding: Charity fund Con nection.

" Hyperaldosteronism in a patient with ATP1A1 deﬁciency814 J. del PicchiaS. Gisladottir , H. Gisladottir, J. J. Jonsson, H. T. Bjornsson University Hospital of Iceland, Reykjavik, IcelandWe report a patient with episodes of hypertensive crisis and lactic acidosis from infancy. These episodes were found tobe related to hyperaldosteronism and ill treatable with conventional blood pressure medication. At four months old, she was diagnosed with pulmonary hypertension andrefractory seizures. She also has developmental delay compounded by multiple brain infarcts. She is treated with alpha agonists and ACE inhibitors and responds well. Sheis also receiving anticonvulsants and PDE inhibitors. WGS was performed for her in 2017 which identi ﬁed a hetero zygous missense variant, p.Asp897Asn, in the ATP1A1 gene (in the extracellular domain) that encodes for the Alpha 1 isoform of the Na( +)/K(+) ATPase, which helps establish electrochemical gradient over plasma membranes.In 2018 similar variants were described in the ATP1A1 gene in three children (all in the intramembranous domain). Their phenotype has been described as a new disease calledhypomagnesemia, seizures and mental retardation 2 (MIM#618314) but none of these patients have hyper aldosteronism. Our patient has demonstrated mild hypo magnesemia as well as seizures and developmental delay. Interestingly, somatic ATP1A1 disease causing variants, have been found in aldosterone producing adenomas.Additionally in 2018, variants in the gene were found to be a novel cause of Charcot Marie Tooth syndrome (all in the intracellular domain), so this gene can lead to multiplephenotypes, which could differ depending on the location of the variants in the domains of the protein. We propose that her episodes of hypertensive crisis and hyperaldosteronismmay be an expansion of the phenotype or a novel additional phenotype related to this gene.",P03.01,S. Gisladottir: None. H.

Chronic rhinosinusitis and bronchiectasis are very common in PCDpatients. Recently, it has been shown the presence of taste receptors in the respiratory tract and the possible involve  ment of bitter taste receptor TAS2R38 gene, in susceptibility to respiratory infections and rhinosinusitis. The aim of this study is to evaluate the frequency of TAS2R38 poly  morphisms in PCD patients and their possible correlationswith clinical outcomes of the disease. Genetic andAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 815phenotypic data of 35 PCD patients were collected. Clin  ical evaluation includes: number of respiratory infections per year and pathogens; Lund McKay score; number of lung lobes involved; modi ﬁed Bhalla score. As regards genetic data, 3 polymorphisms (rs1726866,rs713598, rs10246939) within TAS2R38 gene were analyzed and patients classi ﬁed as PAV/PAV, PAV/AVI and AVI/AVI. A signi ﬁcant difference in the distribution of TAS2R38 haplotype between patients with and without neonatalrespiratory distress emerged (p value ,0.01). In particular, a lower percentage of PAV/PAV individuals showed a high number of pulmonary exacerbations ( ≥2/year) (p  value,0.04) compared to those with AVI/AVI and AVI/ PAV haplotypes. Moreover, no patients homozygous for PAV/PAV haplotype presented with any chronic coloniza tion by Pseudomonas aeruginosa thus supporting the pos  sible role of TAS2R38 in susceptibility to respiratory infections. In conclusion , here we report, for the ﬁrst time, a possible association of TAS2R38 polymorphisms with PCD phenotype.

The last ﬁnding is novel and not described in databases. The clinical presentation of CF in all of them was with early onset (intheﬁrst year of life), meconium ileus, failure to thrive, pancreatic insuf ﬁciency, chronic obstructive lung disease and abnormal sweat test levels. Conclusion: We established that overall frequency of the large deletions in our patients is about 1% from all mutations that we found in CFTR gene. It must be kept inmind that >99% of all known point mutations have allele frequencies that are below 0.1%. Therefore we believe that it is suitable to use MLPA of CFTR gene for routinemolecular diagnostics of CF. N. Yaneva: None. M. Libik: None. G. Petrova: None. I. Bradinova: None. M. Nikolova: None. M.

 Differential molecular diagnosis of Cystic ﬁbrosis and Shwachman Diamond syndrom,P03.07,M. Kazaryan,"1,2, T. Adyan2,1, A. Polyakov2","1RNRMU, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Cystic ﬁbrosis (CF) and Shwachman Diamond syndrome (SDS) are autosomal recessive disorders, associated with mutations in CFTR andSBDS genes respectively. CF and SDS have general symptom   exocrine pancreatic insuf ﬁ  ciency. This study aims to describe the possibility of mis  diagnosis in case of conditions with common symptoms, such as CF and SDS. The ﬁrst cohort of 94 patients aged from 0 to 40 years with primary SDS diagnosis were investigated for the presence of 30 CFTR gene mutations that are most frequent in Russian Federation. The secondcohort of 361 patients with primary CF diagnosis was analyzed for the presence of 2 common SBDS gene muta  tions (this sample was divided into 2 groups: 246 probandsaged from 0 to 5 years and 115 probands aged from 6 to 10 years). MLPA method was used to determine point muta  tions; deletion/insertion mutations were tested by multiplexAFLP method and automated sequencing as well. We identi ﬁed one heterozygous carrier of F508del mutation in theCFTR gene in SDS sample (sequencing of the entire coding region of this gene and MLPA analysis did not reveal a second pathogenic variant in this patient). In a group of 0 5 years CF patients 4 probands were found tohave both mutations in the SBDS gene and one proband have 1 heterozygous mutation. In a group of 6 10 years CF816 J. del Picchiapatients only 1 proband had both mutations. Our results demonstrate that patients with suspected CF and undetected mutations in the CFTR gene are necessary to differential diagnosis with a SDS. M. Kazaryan: None. T. Adyan: None. A.

 Thyroid peroxidase (TPO) mutations in Macedonianpatients with congenital hypothyroidism,P03.08,N. Zdraveska,"1, V. Anastasovska1, N. Schoenmakers2,","A. Nicholas2, M. Kocova1 1University Children ’s Hospital Skopje, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of,2University of Cam  bridge Metabolic Research Laboratories, Wellcome Trust  Medical Research Council Institute of Metabolic Science,Addenbrooke ’s Hospital, Cambridge, United Kingdom Introduction: Congenital hypothyroidism (CH) due to thyroid dyshormonogenesis is a heterogenic disorder caused by impairment in any stage of the thyroid hormone bio  synthesis pathway. Mutations in seven genes may beassociated with thyroid dyshormonogenesis: SLC5A5 (NIS), SCL26A4 (PDS), TG, TPO, DUOX2, DUOXA2, and IYD (DHEAL1) . Defects in thyroid peroxidase (TPO) gene are reported as the most frequent cause of dyshormonogenesis with permanent CH characterized with permanent total iodide organi ﬁcation defect. Methods: A comprehensive, phenotype driven, approach was used to identify underlying mutations in Macedonian cohort of CH patients, by sequentially screening knowndyshormonogenesis associated genes. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood leukocytes, and Sanger sequencing was used to screen for TPO gene mutations in all coding exons and exon/intron boundaries ampli ﬁed by PCR speci ﬁc primers. Results: Analysis of the TPO gene revealed variants in 3 cases including 2 siblings who each harboured a hetero  zygous frameshift variant, p.A397Pfs*77, inherited from a euthyroid father. An unrelated case was compound hetero zygous for a maternally inherited missense mutation, p. R438H, and a paternally inherited frameshift variant, p. E17Dfs*77. All 3 cases exhibited severe CH at diagnosis,with signi ﬁcantly elevated serum TSH values (mean: 103mU/L, range >75 159mU/L) and low fT4 values (mean<4ug/dl). Goitre was diagnosed on the neonatalthyroid ultrasound and during foetal ultrasound examination in the third case. Conclusion: Finding TPO gene mutations in a neonate with CH indicates that the subject will require life longtreatment with thyroid hormone and that future pregnancies should be carefully monitored for the presence of prenatal goiter.

 Molecular investigation of Cystic Fibrosis: CFTR mutation spectrum among Greek population,P03.10,"M. Argyraki , M. Chatziapostolou, S. Vittas","DNA   Diagnosis N Analysis Laboratory, Thessaloniki,","Greece Introduction: Cystic Fibrosis (CF) represents the second most common congenital disorder among Greek population. Approximately 4 5% of Greek population representsasymptomatic CF mutation carriers. This in conjunction with the limited knowledge about this disease necessitates the implementation of carrier screening programs. Materials and methods: The study population consisted of 485 Greek individuals screened for CF mutations. We used a targeted NGS to sequence all CFTR gene codingregions, intron/exon splice sites and UTRs, combined with MLPA analysis. Results: Molecular analysis showed that 96 indivi  duals (19.8%) represent CF mutation carriers, consisting of 24 individuals (4.75%) carrying typical CF causing mutations, 38 individuals (7.52%) carrying CFTR RD(CFTR related disorders) mutations and 38 individuals (7.52%) carrying variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VOUS). Seven cases of complex alleles that carry two mutationswere also observed, a factor that can complicate CFTR diagnosis and clinical evaluation. The most common typical mutation identi ﬁed in 15 carriers was ΔF508, followed by 621+1G>T mutation occurring in 3 carriers. Likewise, R75Q mutation represents the most common CFTR RD mutation identi ﬁed (8 carriers), followed by L997F and R1162L (found in 6 and 4 carriers respectively). Lastly, c.2620 15C>G mutation was identi ﬁed in 11 carriers, representing the most common VOUS mutation in the population studied. Discussion: Aim of the current study was to estimate the CFTR mutation spectrum and the prevalence of CFmutation carriers among Greek population. Accurate knowledge of CF mutation spectrum provides information for CF prevention programs and may prove particularlyimportant for providing more suf ﬁcient genetic counselling to the Greek population.

More than 2000 identi ﬁed mutations have been previously described in the CFTR gene. Even in CF patients with identical CFTR genotypes, there are a large number of serious lung diseases and other symptoms. Environment and poly morphisms in other genes play a particularly important role in the phenotypic modi ﬁcation of disease. The main aim of our study was the correlation analysis of 10 SNPpolymorphisms/variants in selected modi ﬁer genes (TNF α,G S T M ,G S T P ,G S T Ta n dH F E )a n ds u b s e q u e n t correlation analysis with clin ical symptoms of patients, mainly spirometry measurements of lung function. To identify these polymorphisms, we used methods such as PCR and direct sequencing. Our results show a sig niﬁcant association of the TNF αgene polymorphism (rs1800629) with cardiomyopathy, another polymorph  ism (rs361525) with hypoalbuminemia and distalobstructive syndrome, and two other polymorphisms (rs1800630, rs1799724) with bacterial infections of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The GSTT1 gene show sig niﬁcant association with the nasal polyps, GSTP1 gene (rs1695) with a worse pulmonary function by vital capacity of lung (FEV 1), also HFE gene polymorphism (rs1799945) with worse pulmonary function (FEV 1).

 The c.7G>A variant in EHHADH associated with Fanconi renotubular syndrome is also responsible for hepatic failure,P03.14,"P. Rollier1,2, M. Barth1, V. Milon1, N. Gueguen1, C. Bris1,","L. Damaj2, A. Ryckewaert3, S. Odent2, V. Procaccio1,","A. Ziegler1, D. Bonneau1 1Department of Biochemistry and Genetics, Angers Uni  versity Hospital, Angers, France,2Department of Clinical Genetics, Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, France, 3Department of Pediatrics, Rennes University Hospital, Rennes, France Introduction: EHHADH wasﬁrst associated to a human disease by Klootwijk et al. in 2014 who reported that the pathogenic variant c.7G>A;p.E3K was responsible for anisolated Fanconi renotubular syndrome. This variant causes an addressing defect of this peroxisomal protein leading to its abnormal localization to mitochondria. We report asecond case harbouring the same mutation in EHHADH as that previously reported who was affected with a broader phenotype including recurrent hypoglycemia and hepaticcytolysis associated to Fanconi syndrome. Materials and methods: Recruitment of the patient, exome sequencing and functional analyses were carried outat the Angers University Hospital. Results: At 4 months of age, the individual presented with hypoglycemia, ketonuria, lactic acidosis and hepaticcytolysis. Subsequently, he presented recurrent episodes of vomiting and/or diarrhea with hypoglycemia after long fasting requiring glucose infusions. Additional featuresincluded severe Fanconi tubulopathy with glucosuria, tubular proteinuria, hypouricemia, and nephrocalcinosis. Mitochondrial respiratory chain analyses performed onhepatocytes showed a decreased activity of complex I and IV, including a 70% decrease in complex IV/citrate synthase ratio which was con ﬁrmed by the decrease of the same complexes using Western blot analyses. Exome analysis evidenced the missense mutation c.7G>A;p.E3K inEHHADH . This mutation was inherited from the father who was asymptomatic at age 54. Conclusions: We expand the phenotypic spectrum of the c.7G>A mutation in EHHADH with the description of hepatic failure, including cytolysis and hypoglycemic episodes, associated with Fanconi tubulopathy. This disease is an autosomal dominant disorder with a great variability inexpression. P. Rollier: None. M. Barth: None. V. Milon: None. N. Gueguen: None. C. Bris: None. L.

 Renal phenotype expansion in known syndromes using whole exome sequencing,P03.15,"I. Schüle1, K. Häffner1,2, J. Kracht1, G. Ruzaike1,","E. Lausch1, D. Matheisl1, R. Hentschel1, M. Pohl1,","M. Schmidts1 1Clinic for General Pediatrics, Adolescent Medicine and Neonatology, University of Freiburg, Freiburg im Breis  gau, Germany,2Clinic for Internal Medicine IV Nephrology and General Medicine, University of Freiburg, Freiburg,Germany Background: Patients with rare syndromes often have mutations in genes that are not covered by organ speciﬁc NGS Panels. Whole exome sequencing (WES) helps ﬁnding the underlying genetic cause of end stage renal disease (ESRD) especially in patients with extrarenal features. Methods and results: We report two cases with ESRD in patients with extrarenal organ involvement. A 14 year old boy with a history of perinatal asphyxia presented with a ﬁrst seizure and ESRD. In addition he showed a psychomotor developmental retardation, muscular hypoto  nia and facial dysmorphism. The second patient was a newborn with congenital kidney failure, cleft palate,microcephaly, hypothyroidism and also facial dysmorph  ism. WES revealed a heterozygous variant in the KANSL1 gene (c.1284delA:p.V428fs) in the 14 year old patient notdetected in the mother (father unavailable) and a hetero  zygous de novo variant in the KMT2D gene (c.C8434T:p. Q2812X) in the newborn. Both variants have not beenpreviously described in literature. Discussion: KANSL1 and KMT2D mutations cause Koolen de Vries and Kabuki Syndrome. While clinicalfeatures observed in our patients ﬁt well with those conditions, renal disease is extraordinarily severe in our cases: no ESRD has been previously reported for Koolen deVries Syndrome and likewise, congenital ESRD has not been described in the literature for Kabuki syndrome so far. Our ﬁndings extend the kidney phenotype in these syndromes and show the utility of WES to unravel the cause of ESRD in children that would be missed by gene panel based NGS. I. Schüle: None. K.

Constantoulakis1 1Genotypos Science Labs MSA, Athens, Greece,2Depart  ment of Nephrology and Renal Transplantation, Laiko Hospital, Athens, Greece Introduction: Renal failure is a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide and revealing a potential genetic background is essential for the patients ’management and families ’counselling. Materials and methods: A 17 year old female with tubulointerstitial nephritis was referred for whole exomesequencing (WES). WES was performed on DNA extracted from peripheral blood, using the Twist Human Exome Core v2 kit (Twist Bioscience). Following preparationsaccording to the manufacturer ’s protocol, libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 genetic analyser. Data processing, variant calling and pre classi ﬁcation were conducted by SOPHiA DDM ®bioinformatics pipelines. Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Ampli ﬁcation (MLPA) was performed (P387 C1, Coffalyser net, MRC HOL LAND) to further con ﬁrm results. Results: No pathogenic/likely pathogenic SNVs/Indels were detected, related to the phenotype. Gene coverageanalysis revealed a homozygous NPHP1 whole gene deletion, subsequently con ﬁrmed by MLPA. Deletions including at least NPHP1 are associated with Juveline nephronophthisis, which is in concordance with the phenotype. Parental DNA MLPA analyses revealed NPHP1 heterozygous deletions in both, whereas the proband ’s sister was completely normal thus, substantiating inheritance and further guiding the selection of the appropriate family member for possible kidneytransplantation. Discussion: Optimization in WES protocols allows greater con ﬁdence in calling copy number variations. By applying this approach, de ﬁnite diagnosis of the nephropathy was achieved, otherwise challenging with traditional methods.

Sechenov First Moscow State Medical University (Sechenov University), Moscow, Russian Federation,2The Loginov Moscow Clinical Scienti ﬁc Center of Moscow Health Department, Moscow, Russian Federation,3“Center of Strategic Planning ”of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Kidney stone disease (KSD) is an urgent problem of modern medicine due to high prevalence and recurrence rate of the pathology. The particular scienti ﬁc interest is currently focused on the genetic mechanisms of urolithiasis. The aim of this study was to investigate an association between polymorphic loci of the calciummetabolism genes and the risk of KSD development in Russian population. Materials and methods: Based on the analysis of scienti ﬁc literature and genomic databases, the list of genes and polymorphisms associated with KSD in different countries was formed. The information was obtained fromcase control studies and GWAS. Finally, we formed a genetic panel which included SNPs of VDR, CASR, CALCR, SLC34A1, CLDN14, TRPV5, TRPV6, KLOTHO,ORAI1, ALPL, RGS14, OPN, MGP, PLAU, AQP1, DGKH genes. The study group consisted of 77 patients with KSD. The control group included 76 persons without urolithiasis.Genetic analysis was carried out by next generation sequencing using the Ion S5 platform. We also studied the presence of familial cases of KSD in theobserved group. Results: Among patients with KSD 54% had family history of urolithiasis, 44% had recurrent course of thedisease. 9 SNPs in 4 genes showed statistically signi ﬁcant association with KSD: rs219781, rs219780, rs219779, rs219778, rs219777, rs1544410, rs731236, rs11746443,rs6486795. The odds ratio ranged from 1.2 to 2.5 depending on polymorphism. Conclusions: Targeted genetic panel for detecting the genetic predisposition to urolithiasis was designed and validated.

It is caused by mutations in genes that encode proteins involved in the function of pri  mary cilia, basal bodies and centrosomes, resulting in renaland extrarenal manifestations. Prenatal history of oligohy  dramnios and kidney cysts can be present. Infantile type of NPHP develops ESRD in the ﬁrst three years of age and is the most severe form. It is usually caused by mutations in NPHP2 andNPHP3 genes. Objective: We intend to demonstrate how dif ﬁcult the genotype/phenotype correlation in NPHP is, and reinforce the use of gene panel or exome in this disease. Materials and methods: Report of clinical manifesta  tions, laboratory examination and imaging data in family related foetus and child with different features of NPHP. A NGS panel for cholestasis was performed. Results: Previously healthy child presents pruritus and laboratory examination with renal/liver dysfunction at the age of 21 months. Ultrasound showed normal sized kidneyswith cysts and absent hepatobiliar, pancreatic or cardiac changes. The ﬁrst pregnancy of the parents was complicated due to nephromegaly with microcysts and anamnios   thediagnosis of NPHP was evoked. The NGS panel identi ﬁed a homozygous NPHP3 variant, c.3601G>T p.(Glu1201*), and molecular testing to her consanguineous parents isbeing performed.

 A novel pathological variant in the PHOX2B gene associated with a respiratory/ Hirschsprung phenotypein a three generation family,P03.21,I. Borg,"1,2, M. Pace Bardon3, N. Pace4,5","1Department of Pathology, University of Malta, Msida, Malta,2Medical Genetics Unit, Department of Pathology, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta,3Department of Medicine, Mater Dei Hospital, Msida, Malta,4Department of Anatomy, University of Malta, Msida, Malta,5Centre for Molecular Medicine and Biobanking, University of Malta, Msida, Malta Introduction: Mutations in the PHOX2B gene cause con  genital central hypoventilation syndrome (CCHS), a rare autonomic nervous system dysfunction disorder char acterised by a decreased ventilatory response to hypercap  nia. Affected subjects require lifelong ventilatory support, and develop hypoventilation during the non REM phase ofsleep where autonomic control of breathing predominates. CCHS may be isolated or associated with disorders char  acterised by defective migration/differentiation of neuralcrest derivatives, including aganglionic megacolon or milder gastrointestinal phenotypes, such as constipation. Most cases of CCHS are de novo, caused by heterozygosityfor polyalanine repeat expansion mutations (PARMs) in exon 3. The remaining 10% of cases are due to hetero  zygous non PARM missense, nonsense or frameshiftmutations. Methodology: We describe a three generation Maltese  Caucasian family with a variable CCHS/Hirschsprungphenotype, characterised by chronic constipation, three siblings with Hirschsprung disease necessitating surgery and chronic hypoxia requiring non invasive ventilation. Results: Bidirectional sequencing of PHOX2B revealed a novel heterozygous c.241 +2delT splice variant that segre  gates with the CCHS/Hirschsprung phenotype in the family.The deletion lies in the donor splice site of exon 1 and has not been reported in literature or genomic databases. Bioinformatic analysis predicts that the mutation will resultin skipping of exon 1 and the formation of a non functional protein product. The mutation is pathogenic according to ACMG, PVS1, PM2 and PP1 criteria. Conclusion: This report expands the mutational spectrum ofPHOX2B . It is signi ﬁcant as no splice site mutationshave been previously reported for PHOX2B , and highlights the variability in clinical expression and disease severity of non PARM mutations. I.

The timely awareness of a potential genetic etiology in kidney diseasepatients has profound implications for diagnosis and sub  sequent care pathways, for family members (e.g. in pre  symptomatic testing and family donation) and for optionsregarding establishing a family. Methods: We will set up the GeNepher Data  and Biobank. Dutch patients with known and suspected heredi tary renal disease are eligible for inclusion. Informed consent will cover use of available medical data, use of available DNA/sequencing data and in selected cases consent foradditional blood sampling, skin biopsy or urine collection. The GeNepher Data  and Biobank will be used to: 1. Answer questions regarding etiology. In unsolved cases we will perform add on analyses to identify new candidate genes for renal disease. In order tooptimally identify new candidates, and to gain new insights, we are developing a kidney speci ﬁc gene network using kidney derived RNA sequencing data.Ultimately we will perform functional studies to validate plausible candidates.

 Founder effect of SLC2A9 mutation p.(T125M) in Spanish families with hereditary renal hipouricemia type 2,P03.23,E. Córdoba Lanús,"1,2, A. Perdomo Ramírez1,","G. Mura Escorche1,3, S. Carinelli1, E. Ramos Trujillo1, F. Claverie Martín1 1Unidad de Investigación, Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain, 2IUETSPC, Universidad de La Laguna, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain,3Universidad de La Laguna, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain Introduction: Renal hypouricemia (RHUC) is a rare inherited disorder characterized by impaired urate reab  sorption in the proximal tubule. Some patients may present severe complications such as exercise induced acute renalfailure and nephrolithiasis. RHUC is caused by inactivating mutations in the SLC22A12 (RHUC type 1) or SLC2A9 (RHUC type 2) genes, which encode urate transportersURAT1 and GLUT9, respectively. Recently, we found that mutation c.374C>T, p.(T125M) is recurrent in Spanish families with RHUC2. Therefore, we hypothesized that thismight be due to a founder effect. Methods: Thirteen new patients with RHUC were analyzed by sequencing the SLC22A12 and SLC2A9 coding exons. To determine whether patients with the p. (T125M) mutation had a common p.(T125M) linked haplotype a SNPs haplotype analysis was performed. Atotal of nine patients from apparently unrelated families were included in this analysis. Six informative SNPs were analyzed by PCR ampli ﬁcation from genomic DNA and direct sequencing. Results: Seven patients carried SLC22A12 mutation p. (T467M), and six presented the recurrent SLC2A9 mutation p.(T125M). Alleles carrying the p.(T125M) mutation shared a common SNP haplotype. Every patient harboring this mutation in homozygous state had a common haplotype(0.7 frequency), G A C  T G T C T (mutant allele in bold). While the haplotype G G C C G T C was the most frequent between controls (0.42). Conclusions: Mutation p.(T125M) is the most common variant in Spanish patients with RHUC2.

Diagnosis is con ﬁrmed by molecular analysis of ATP7B gene. Materials and methods: 34 patients with WD were studied using two long range PCR (exon 2 9; exon 10 21 ATP7B gene). Fragmentation, indexing, library preparation (NEBNext Ultra DNA library prep kit) and sequencing in aMiSeq platform (Illumina) were performed. Exon 1 was analysed by Sanger sequencing. Results: Genetic diagnosis was achieved in 18 WD patients whereas only one pathogenic variant was found in 5. Familiar studies have allowed the identi ﬁcation of 2 WD patients before clinical manifestations. 86% of the variantswere described as pathogenic whereas 14% were not described previously. A prevalent ATP7B allelic variant, p.(Met645Arg), was found in 5 patients (28%), in trans withother allelic variants. The splicing mutation c.1708 1G>A was found in 3 patients (17%) whereas the c.1708 1G>C was found in one (6%), all in homozygous state. The mostprevalent pathogenic variant in Europe p.(His1069Gln) was found in heterozygosis in 2 patients, representing only the 4,4 % of pathogenic alleles in our cohort. Conclusions: The most common allelic variant among our WD patients was p.(Met645Arg) followed by the splicing variant c.1708 1G>A.

" Theﬁrst missense mutation in CSTA gene causes Acral Peeling Skin Syndrome in a Turkish family, Review ofthe literature",P04.02,A. C. Ceylan,"1, S. Emre2,G. G. Ceylan1","1Yildirim Beyazit University Medical School Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey,2Yildirim Beyazit University Medical School Department of Dermatology, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Acral Peeling Skin Syndrome (APSS) is a rare, autosomal recessive genodermatosis. The disease is characterized by super ﬁcial peeling of the corni ﬁed epi  dermal layer. Skin fragility often affects hands and feet. It is most commonly caused by mutations in the TGM5 (*603805). CSTA (*184600) rarely causes APSS. We intend to invest if there is a new mutation in genes related with APSS. Materials and methods: Two siblings were presented us because of chronic and super ﬁcial itchy skin lesions. After the dermatological examinations, clinical exome solution  was performed for the molecular diagnosis of one of thepatients. Sanger sequencing was performed for the other patient to ﬁnd if there is the same mutation. Results: A novel homozygote missense mutation was found in CSTA gene in both of the siblings. This variant fulﬁlls PM1, PM2, PP3 and PP4, and should therefore be regarded as a likely pathogenic according to the jointconsensus recommendation of the ACMG and AMP. Conclusion: Peeling skin syndromes appears to be heterogeneous clinically and genetically. Inhere, we reportsixth family with a novel homozygote missense CSTA mutation and clinical ﬁndings. It is shown that different type ofCSTA mutations can also cause APSS unlike previously reported cases, and will contribute to better illumination of the phenotype regarding with the literature review.

Results of previous research suggest that susceptibility to ACEi induced angioedema (ACEi AE) isdependent on a genetic predisposition and non genetic risk factors. However, as the biological mechanisms contribut  ing to these angioedema are still largely unknown, furtherresearch is needed. The aim of the present study was to investigate common and rare genetic variation in ACEi AE patients. In a targeted sequencing approach, we investi gated the occurrence rate of known pathogenic mutations associated with monogenic forms of angioedema in 69 German and 68 Danish patients with ACEi AE. All sam ples were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq platform using single molecule molecular inversion probes. InAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 823addition, all samples were genotyped on the Illumina Inﬁnium Global Screening Array to identify common genetic variants contributing to angioedema risk under ACEi. Analysis of the sequencing data revealed no known pathogenic mutations in genes associated with the mono  genic forms of angioedema. However, we identi ﬁed 19 other rare (MAF ≤0.05), non synonymous variants for which a contribution to ACEi AE risk cannot be excluded. Quality control and imputation of the array data is currentlyongoing. Furthermore, we are currently applying the above investigation strategies to an independent Swedish sample (n,77). Follow up of the variants identi ﬁed by targeted sequencing in larger patient samples as well as subsequent biostatistics/ informatics analyses of the GWAS data will help to gain further insights into the underlying molecularmechanisms of ACEi AE.

Borowiec Department of Clinical Genetics, Lodz, PolandThe congenital contractural arachnodactyly (CCA, Beals syndrome, OMIM: 121050) is an autosomal dominant condition including contractures, crumpled ears, arachno dactyly, dolichostenomelia, scoliosis and pectus defor mities. The congenital contractural arachnodactyly has overlapping features with the Marfan syndrome. Both syndromes result from mutations in genes from the ﬁbrillin family, FBN1 and FBN2 respectively. We identi ﬁed the c.4216T>C variant in the FBN2 gene in a Polish family with the congenital contractural arachnodactyly. The variation inphenotypic expression was high in the family. In some subjects there was only an arachnodactyly, but in others there were many features like severe kyphoscoliosis withdolichostenomelia, arachnodactyly, camptodactyly, talipes equinovarus and ureteropelvic junction obstruction. We found for the ﬁrst time a hydronephrosis in the congenital contractural arachnodactyly syndrome. There were no cru pled ear in the analysed family.

Their clinical diagnosis remains a challenge in face of overlapping in ﬂammatory symptoms. The previous guide  lines for genetic testing of AIDs were limited to Sanger based diagnosis of four prototypic recurrent fevers ( MEFV , MVK ,TNFRSF1A , and NLRP3 genes). Revised guidelines employing next generation sequencing (NGS) are needed to improve diagnosis and precision of AIDs treatment. Methods: B a s e do nas u r v e yr e g a r d i n gg e n es c o p ea n d available methodology in AIDs laboratories (Rowczenio et al, 2019), and on annotation of AIDs gene variants by experts ’ consensus (van Gijn et al, 2018; Infevers data base), a draft ofrecommendations was written by European Molecular Genetics Quality Network members. The recommendations were discussed by a panel of experts of the International Societyfor Systemic AIDs (ISSAID) during a consensus meeting. Results: Four additional disease genes are recommended for the core screen of auto in ﬂammatory diseases ( ADA2 , NOD2 ,PSTPIP1 , and TNFAIP 3). The initial screen, either a single gene or panel screen is oriented by the clinical autoin ﬂammatory suspicion. In overt cases complementary methods to identify large deletions or insertions (i.e. copy number variation) or search for somatic mosaicism are recommended. A genotype table based on the 5 categoryvariant pathogenicity classi ﬁcation with distinction between rare/novel or common variants of unknown signi ﬁcance, and consideration of dose effect, provides the clinicalsigniﬁcance of prototypic genotypes per gene and disease.

Hyperphalangism is caused by an accessory ossi ﬁcation center in the second metacarpo phalangeal joint leading to radial deviation and ulnar clinodactyly of the index ﬁngers. Individuals without one of the two major hallmarks or withadditional hand malformations have been described as aty  pical or Catel Manzke like syndrome. Biallelic pathogenic variants in TGDS have been described in nine individuals including one fetus with Catel Manzke syndrome. Material and methods: We performed trio exome sequencing in two individuals who presented with dis proportionate short stature, micrognathia as well as mild bilateral radial deviation and ulnar clinodactyly of the index ﬁngers, but without radiological signs of hyperphalangism. Results: We found known pathogenic variants in TGDS in both individuals. The two individuals described here are theﬁrst with con ﬁrmed TGDS pathogenic variants who present with almost normal hand radiographs and therefore do not show one of the clinical hallmarks of Catel Manzke syndrome. In addition, disproportionate short stature has notbeen described as a feature of Catel Manzke syndrome. Conclusion: Ourﬁndings extend the phenotypic spectrum of Catel Manzke syndrome.

So far, only 4 families havebeen reported. Materials and methods: Subjects. Two Spanish adult brothers (41/38 years old) born to consanguineous parentspresenting with a long history of hypohidrosis, dry skin, alacrimia and xerostomia, diagnosed as ectodermal dyspla  sia (ED). Complementary exams showed renal loss of NaClwith secondary hyperaldosteronism, hypercalcemia, hyper  magnesemia and hypokalemia. Genetic analysis. CLDN10 gene was designed with Primer3 software for all codingexons. Sanger sequencing was performed using BigDye terminator (Life Technologies), analysed in ABI3130 Genetic Analyser (Applied Biosystems) and aligned withhuman reference genome GRCh37/hg19; the identi ﬁed variant was segregated in progenitors. Results: The sequence analysis revealed a frameshift genetic variant in CLDN10 (NM_006984.4): c.322_329del8/p.Gly108fs, in exon 2, in homozygosity in both affected brothers and in heterozygosity in parents. Thisvariant, not previously described, was found in a highly conserved region by in silico prediction software, being categorized as pathogenic. Conclusions: 1.

Congenital cutis laxa is more common than acquired cutis laxa. The recessively inherited form is severe and more frequent. Cutis laxa affects all races and both the sexes equally. LTBP4, an extracellular protein that is closelyrelated to ﬁbrillins, consists of epidermal growth factor like domains interspersed with four 8 cys domains (including a hybrid domain). The third 8 cys domain covalently bindsthe small latent TGF β1 complex. A proline  rich hinge region provides ⋯exibility to the protein. The N terminus of LTBP4 binds to the microibrillar structures. A 4 month old full term normally delivered neonate was referred with complaints of respiratory distress from his birth. Physical examination revealed laxity of the skin and heart problemand swelling around the eyes. Length, weight, and head circumference percentiles at birth were 55cm, 4100 gr and36m respectively. whole  exome sequencing test was done for the patient. The results showed a novel homozygous mutation (c.533 1G>A) in exon 6 of the LTBP4 gene. After this observation we perform the Sanger sequencing for his parents. As a result, his parents have a heterozygous mutation in the same gene and same location. This ﬁnding can be useful in genetic counseling of cutis laxa in this family. M. Mazaheri: None.

There for genetic markers study of the congenital malformations is an important and urgent task. Materials and methods: The study of 200 children with congenital spine deformities (CSD) and 96 healthy children without pathology of the spine was carried out. Moleculardiagnostics was carried out by analysis of multiple polymorphic regions in the genes of detoxi ﬁcation and DNA repair. Genotyping of the gene polymorphism wasperformed using polymerase chain reaction. Results: The polymorphisms of the genes CYP1A2, GSTM1, GSTT1, GSTP1, NAT2, XRCC1, XRCC3 and their frequency distribution among patients with CSD and control group were investigated. Signi ﬁcant differences in the distribution of genotypes compared with the controlgroup were found in the polymorphic regions of the genes CYP1A2, GSTM1, GSTT1, NAT2, XRCC3 . However, in the GSTP1 and XRCC1 genes, no signi ﬁcant differences between the CSD patients and the control group was observed. Conclusions: All patients with congenital spine defor  mities had signi ﬁcant changes in some candidate genes alleles. It was found that the number of minor alleles in the genes under investigation correlate with the severity ofcongenital deformity and the variability of vertebral anomalies. It was determined that in children withAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 827combined defects in the spine development, there is a greater number of mutations compared to children with isolated vertebral anomalies.

EFNB1 encodes for ephrin B1, a transmembrane ligand of the EphB receptor with crucial roles in cell migration and pattern form ation during skeletal devel  opment. The phenotype is more pronounced in females, whocharacteristically present wit h frontonasal dysplasia and cor  onar craniosynostosis, while the manifestation in males is usually milder, often only characterized by hypertelorism. Case report: We, here, present an 11 week old girl who presented with dysmorphic facies. Leading characteristics were plagiocephaly, hypertelorism, a cleft palate, slantedeyes, dysplastic ears and a broad nasal bridge. Molecular genetic analyses of the girl revealed a pathogenic de novo nonsense variant in the EFNB1 gene, which triggers nonsense mediated decay. Background: Females with a heterozygous mutation in the EFNB1 gene usually display a more severe phenotype than hemizygous males. The embryonal X inactivation leads to a heterogenic population of cells either expressing the mutated or the wildtype allele, disrupting the correct formation ofboundaries within the frontal bone precursors during embryogenesis. Hemizygous males display a homogenous cell population, since no functional ephrin B1 can beproduced at all, in which case other ephrin B family members are likely to compensate by assuming ephrin B1 function. Conclusion: Due to cellular interference, craniofrontona  sal dysplasia does not follow a classic Mendelian mode of inheritance. Our case report is a good example for this mechanism and highlights the need to be aware of suchunusual modes of inheritance in genetic counselling. J. Ronez: None. S. Morlot: None. B.

Materials and methods: The female patient with psychomotor delay, intellectual disability and multiple CS and her healthy parents were subjected to standard karyotyping analysis. Next, we have implemented arraycomparative genomic hybridisation (array CGH) for the proband (SurePrint G3 Human CGH Microarray 4×180; Agilent Technologies), followed by microarray based genesexpression pro ﬁling (one color SurePrint G3 Unrestricted GE 8x60K microarray; Agilent Technologies). Results: Karyotyping analysis revealed a heterozygous deletion on chromosome 7 (der7). Furthermore, with the use of array CGH, we have shown, that the aberration was 12.782 M bi ns i z ea n dm a p p e dt ol o c u s7 q 3 2 . 3   q 3 5( H G 1 9 – chr7:131521826 144304164). The CNV encompassed 143 genes including the BRAF , that encodes B Raf. B raf belongs to one of the molecules involved in RAS/MAPK pathway. Conclusion: Ourﬁnding supports the contribution of CNVs to syndromic CS development. We also pointed to the existing interaction between RAS and FGFs signaling cascades andconclude that dysregulation of those intracellular pathways may give rise to CS. Finally, we strongly suggest screening of RAS associated genes in patients with Noonan like syndromeand skull abnormalities.

DDH increases the risk of osteoarthritis and is the cause of30% of all total hip arthropl asties in adults < 40 years of age (2). We aim to explore the genetic background of DDH in order to improve diagnosis and personaliztreatment. Materials and method: We conducted a structured PubMed search and added selected studies from ourarchives. A total of 66 papers were included for detailed review. In addition, we are conducting a heritability analysis in the Norwegian Twin Registry using Falconer ’s method. Results: The results of the heritability analyses will be presented at the conference. Similar studies have found aheritability of ~80%. The literature review revealed that the majority of published papers on the genetics of DDH were mostly underpowered for detection of any associa tion. One large genome wide a ssociation study has been published, establishing GDF5 as a plausible risk factor. This study found a single nucle otide polymorphism based heritability of 55%, however GDF5 only explains ~1.5% (3). Conclusion: DDH is known to be congenital and heritable, with family occurrence of DDH already included as a risk factor in most screening programs. Despite this, high quality genetic research is scarce, and no genetic riskfactors have been soundly established, prompting the need for more research.

Seven1,"1Department of Medical Genetics, Cerrahpasa Medical","Faculty, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Department of Skin and Venereal Diseases, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Ectodermal dysplasia is a rare hereditary disease that is characterized by elliptical nodules located on the hair shaft. Fragile hair ﬁbers are found in the temporal and occipital region, resulting in alopecia. Patients are usually normal at birth, but the hair becomes fragile in the ﬁrst few months of life. In severe cases, eyebrows, eye  lashes, and other body hairs may also be affected. The disease can be isolated to the scalp, and may be accom  panied by tooth and nail disorders. Ectodermal dysplasia isgenerally caused by mutations in KRT81, KRT83, KRT85 andKRT86 genes. Clinical Findings and Method: In the physical exam  ination of mother and her three children; localized alopecia, brittle hair body hair and nail dystrophy were detected and ectodermal dysplasia was considered. DNAwas isolated from peripheral blood samples of mother and her children. Due to the pre diagnosis of ectodermal dysplasia clinical exom analysis was performed in theKRT gene family. Result: As a result of the analysis, the change of c. G565A (p.D189N) in exon 2 of KRT85 gene in mother and her children was detected as heterozygous and con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. This change was evaluated according to the American College of Medical Genetics criteria andcompared with genetic databases. Conclusion: As a result of the evaluation, it is considered as a variant of unknown clinical signi ﬁcance (VUS) and as a pathological variant in silico databases. A. Ozaydin: None. G. Gencebay: None.

According to the clinical picture and underlying genetic mutation 13 subtypes are dis  tinguished. We saw our proband as a ﬁve year old girl with severe periodontitis and premature loss of several teeth.Moreover she displayed a short stature, joint hypermobility, chronic pain, recurrent luxation of knee caps, ﬂat feet, a soft and hyperelastic skin with multiple subcutaneous papules,easy bruising, and pretibial hyperpigmentation. Due to those signs and symptoms EDS was suspected and genetic testing brought about. NGS analysis of 44 connective tis sue related genes revealed a pathogenic frameshift mutation inCOL5A1 , conﬁrming the diagnosis Classical EDS. This diagnosis was consistent with the proband ’s joint and skin related phenotype, yet did not explain her severe dental phenotype. As the dental status was highly suggestive of periodontal EDS, analysis of the underlying genes C1R and C1S was performed. The detection of a pathogenic missense mutation in C1R conﬁrmed the additional diagnosis peri  odontal EDS. Analysis of the parents showed the COL5A1 mutation being maternally inherited whereas the C1R mutation occured de novo. Our patient ’s mother experi  enced many signs of Classical EDS already in her child hood, yet this diagnosis was never suspected in her before it was con ﬁrmed in her daughter. To our knowledge, this is theﬁrst reported case of Classical and Periodontal Ehlers  Danlos Syndrome in one single person. F. Stock: None. M.R. Hanisch: None. S. Lechner: None. S. Biskup: None. A.

 Role of TANGO1 gene in hypermobile type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome,P04.19,"A. Junkiert Czarnecka , M. Pilarska Deltow, A. Bak,","M. Heise, O. Haus","Department of Clinical Genetics Nicolaus Copernicus University, Bydgoszcz, Poland Introduction : Hypermobile Ehlers Danlos syndrome (hEDS) is a non in ﬂammatory, autosomal connective tissue disorder. It is perhaps the most common hereditary con  nective tissue disorder with a prevalence estimate at about1/5000. hEDS unlike other types of EDS, has no known genetic etiology. One of disfunctions in hEDS patients ’ cells is impaired transport of extracellular matrix proteinsfrom cells to intercellular space. Protein taking part in this process is TANGO1 encoded by TANGO1 gene. The aim of study is a sequencing analysis of TANGO1 gene and alsothe evaluation of the potential role of detected variants in830 J. del Picchiathese gene on their role in the etiology of the hypermobile type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. Methods : The study was carried out in a group of 100 patients with hypermobile type of Ehlers Danlos syndrome. Control group consisted of 100 persons from general population. Sequencing analysis of gene TANGO1 wasperformed using Sanger sequencing technique. Results Among 100 hEDS patients in two c.1099A>T (p. Thr367Ser) variant and in next three patients c.2637C>A(p.Asp879Glu) variant were detected. All patients were not mutation carriers of other connective tissue protein coding genes (previous study). According to ACMG guidelinevariants were evaluated as VUS. Conclusion: This study is the next small step in the recognition and understanding of the complex picture ofhEDS.

We want to present our diagnostic rate, distribution of frequencies between subgroups from classi ﬁcation of skeletal dysplasia and we try to give an answer about impact of diagnosis. Materials and methods: We present our results for pediatric patients with different skeletal dysplasia who were ﬁrst assessed in genetic outpatient clinic at Department of Clinical Genetics, University Children ’s Hospital in Bel  grade and referred for diagnostic whole exome sequencing (WES), from 2015 to 2019. WES was performed for all 51 patients. Results: Causative gene variants were identi ﬁed in 38 patients (74.5%, n ,38/51).

According to data obtained from the “register of hereditary and congenital pathology of the republic of Sakha (Yakutia) ”80 patients and their relatives from different ethnic groups were registered. Genetic analysis was conducted for 65 patients with MHE andtheir relatives from 30 unrelated families. Next generation sequencing (NGS) and Sanger sequencing methods were used. The EXT2 gene from a patient with MHE was sequenced using NGS method. The analysis revealed nonsense mutation c.751>T (p.Gln251*) in exon 5 of EXT2 gene in heterozygous condition and it also were con ﬁrmed in the rest 79 patients and their relatives by the Sanger ’s sequencing method. This mutation was found and con ﬁrmed in 16 patients from four families with MHE.

 Mosaicism in the PHEX gene. Is it more common than we thought?,P04.22,"J. Fortuño1, M. Oliva1, I. Royo1, M. Flores1, A. Torrents1,","F. Martínez2, N. Pérez2, C. Camprubí1","1Reference Laboratory, L ’Hospitalet de Llobregat, Spain, 2Hospital Universitario Nuestra Señora de Candelaria, Santa Cruz de Tenerife, Spain Introduction: Familial X linked hypophosphatemic rickets (XLHR) is de ﬁned as a group of disorders characterized by rickets with bone deformities, short stature, dental anoma  lies, hypophosphatemia and increased activity of serumalkaline phosphatases. According to the bibliography, pathogenic variants in the PHEX gene are the most common cause of XLHR and only a few cases of mosaicism havebeen described worldwide. We present two unrelated Can  ary Islands (Spain) family cases referred with XLHR clin  ical suspicion in whom mosaic variants have beenidenti ﬁed. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from EDTA blood using a standard protocol. NextGeneration Sequencing (NGS) was used to analyse PHEX gene in the probands. Sanger sequencing was used to perform the study in the mother ’s proband. Results: In one family, a nonsense pathogenic variant (p. Gln394Ter) was found in mosaicism in the proband. In the other family, the proband was hemizygous for a missensevariant of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VUS) (p.Ala267Glu). The family analysis reveals that his unaffected mother was mosaic. Conclusions: To our knowledge, the identi ﬁed cases are theﬁrst families with mosaic variants in PHEX gene reported in Spain. In the genetic counselling context, the“recurrence ”of mosaicism in PHEX gene, emphasize to consider unaffected males as possible mosaic carriers. The advantage of performing PHEX gene analysis by NGS is noteworthy: it allows detection of mosaic variants with highsensibility and reliability, as well as it enables discarding aneuploidy, for example a possible Klinefelter karyotype.

Kohlhase,"SYNLAB MVZ Humangenetik Freiburg GmbH, Freiburg, Germany Introduction: Mutations in ACVR1 cause ﬁbrodysplasia ossiﬁcans progressiva (FOP). The classical clinical feature of FOP is progressive heterotopic ossi ﬁcation, but affected individuals often display ﬁrst toe and thumb malformations. We report on a one year old patient with motor developmentdelay, corpus callosum agenesis, bilateral hand deformities, hypospadias and bilateral agenesis of the ﬁrst toes. Smith  Lemli Opitz syndrome had been suspected as the cause forlimb malformations and hypospadias, and the child was referred to genetics in order to rule out or to con ﬁrm this diagnosis. Material and Methods: normal results for 7 dehydro  cholesterol levels made Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome unlikely, and we suspected a submicroscopic chromosomalanomaly or an unknown syndrome as the underlying cause. We performed karyotyping and CGH, which revealed normal results, followed by whole exomesequencing (WES). Results: WES detected a heterozygous de novo variant in ACVR1 : c.1067G>A, p.G356D. A literature search showed that patients with absent ﬁrst toes and mild brain abnormalities were previously reported in FOP, but agenesis of the corpus callosum had not yet been observed.Furthermore, hypospadias was reported once in an atypical case of FOP. Conclusions: The combination of ﬁrst toe anomalies, especially agenesis of ﬁrst toes, in combination with hypospadias and brain malformations may be the clinical presentation of FOP before the characteristic heterotopicossiﬁcations appear. Agenesis of corpus callosum may be part of the phenotypic spectrum of FOP. The diagnosis of FOP prior to the ﬁrst heterotopic ossi ﬁcation can lead to an improved clinical management to prevent early heterotopic ossiﬁcations in the child. N. Meier: None. N. Knoll: None. S.

Mutations in GDF5 (growth/differentiation factor 5, MIM: 601146) gene account for a signiﬁcant amount of cases. A 3 generation family showing isolated brachydactyly was studied. The proband and hisgrandfather showed features of C and A1 brachydactyly types, his mother showed only subtle signs. Materials and methods: Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) was performed on the two affected individuals. An in depth analysis of GDF5 genotype phenotype correlations was performed through literature reviewing and retrievinginformation from several databases to elucidate GDF5 related molecular pathogenic mechanisms. Results: WES analysis disclosed a known pathogenic variant in GDF5 (NM_000557.4:c.157dupC), segregating with the phenotype. The frameshift variant was previously associated with Brachydactyly type C in heterozygosis andthe severe Grebe chondrodysplasia in homozygosis. We extended and updated the spectrum of GDF5 genotype  phenotype correlations. In total, ﬁfty pathogenic mutations were associated with nine clinical phenotypes and auto  somal dominant and recessive transmissions even for the same phenotype. Presentations range from severe defects inlimb morphogenesis to conditions with redundant ossi ﬁca  tion. We propose that this clinical gradient can be linked to a continuum of GDF5 activity variation, with variable lossof GDF5 activity underlying bone development defects, and gain of function mutations causing disorders with excessive bone formation. Conclusions: Our in depth analysis on GDF5 pathogeni  city mechanisms furtherly supports that mutation and zygosity backgrounds resulting in the same level of GDF5activity may lead to similar phenotypes. This informationcan aid in interpreting new variants and promote appropriate genetic counselling. D. Guadagnolo: None. M. Genovesi: None. E. March  ionni: None. S. Bernardo: None. A.

Familial GVMs (OMIM: 138000) are inher ited in an autosomal dominant manner and associated with loss of function germline variants in the GLMN gene. Material and Methods: We here describe the natural history of GVM disease in a three generation family and report on the identi ﬁcation and characterization of a GLMN splice site mutation by NGS gene panel sequencing andtranscript analysis. Results: Atﬁrst clinical examination, the 16 year old male index patient presented multiple, sharply de ﬁned bluish papules on various locations. His 35 year old mother had approximately ten papules clustering on her back and his 7 year old maternal half sister presented with two bluishpapules on her neck. The index patient ’s maternal aunt and grandfather were also reported to have one or two bluish spots each. Using NGS gene panel sequencing, weidenti ﬁed the heterozygous splice site variant c.1299 +1G>A in the GLMN gene of the index case which had not been reported in the literature before. Heterozygosity forthe substitution at the donor splice site of exon 14 was also shown for the index patient ’s mother and maternal half  sister.

Diagnosis of hEDS is only based on clinical criteria, due to the absence of anidenti ﬁed gene and a protein, thus the main objective was to identify possible molecular genetic causes of hEDS development. Materials and methods: For research, genomic DNA samples of unrelated patients with hEDS were used (9 females and 23 males). In all cases, the diagnosis wasestablished by international recommendations for 2017 EDS. Whole exome sequencing was performed on a HiSeq2500. Assessment of the pathogenicity of theidenti ﬁed variants was based on the recommendations of ACMG and Sherloc on the interpretation of data obtained by the next generation sequencing method. Results: As a result of the pathogenicity assessment, 7 pathogenic and 5 probably pathogenic variants were identi ﬁed in the encoding regions of the ABCA4, ABCC9, CBS, CCDC8, FIG4, GJB2, HGD, KRT14, LMNA, MEFV, PROM1, RYR1, SLC26A2 and USH2A genes in the heterozygous state. Also, 15 genes were selected withvariants of unknown clinical signi ﬁcance based on data on protein expression and high speci ﬁcity of physical interac  tions among themselves that may be involved in thedevelopment of hEDS.Conclusions: Considering the results of the study, we cannot exclude that the genes we identi ﬁed may have a pathogenic effect, forming the hEDS phenotype.

" Recurrent bone pain more than tumors and inﬂammation834 J. del PicchiaM. M. Khelifa1, S. V. Hardenberg1, B. Auber1,B . Schlegelberger1, S. Mukodzi2, J. Wiens2, A. K. Bergmann1 1Medizinische Hochschule Hannover, Hannover, Germany, 2Klinikum Wolfsburg, Wolfsburg, Germany Hyperostosis hyperphosphatemia syndrome (HHS) and hyperphosphatemic familial tumoral calcinosis (HFTC) are the clinical manifestations of a rare autosomal reces sive disease caused by the inactivation of the ﬁbroblast growth factor 23 (FGF23), Polypeptide N Acet ylgalactosaminyltransferase 3 (GALNT3) orKlotho genes, which in turn leads to an elevated blood phosphate level resulting mainly from an excessive proximal renal tubular phosphate reabsorption. We report the case of a 5 year oldfemale of healthy non consanguineous parents of German and Italian descent. She initially presented with recurrent lower leg pain. Bone biopsy was inconclusive, as well asinfectious work up. Imaging identi ﬁed a diaphyseal sclerosis and hyperostosis of the ribs. Hyperphosphatemia was observed. Thus, panel diagnostics of the genesFGF23 ,GALNT3 and KLwas performed. Two hetero zygous variants in GALNT3 (NM_004482.3) were identi ﬁed, one previously undescribed missense variant c.782G>A p.(Arg261Gln), classi ﬁed as a variant of uncertain signi ﬁcance. Protein modeling of this variant suggested the disruption of GALNT3 activity, leading toan increased inactivation of the phosphaturic hormone FGF23 causing HHS/HFTC. The second variant c.803dupC p.(Thr269Asnfs 3) was previously describedin a HHS/HFTC patient and classi ﬁed as likely pathogenic (ACMG guidelines). In HHS/HFTC, no genotype pheno type correlation was described so far, and suggestedtreatment regimes are heterogeneous. Thus, in addition to the detailed case, we present an overview of genotype phenotype correlation and a collection of follow updescriptions of disease courses on patients reported before 2015. In conclusion, we aim to raise awareness of HHS/ HFTC as a syndrome presenting primary with bone painand radiographic changes.",P04.28,M.M. Khelifa: None. S.V. Hardenberg: None. B. Auber:,None. B.

 Clinical and genealogical characteristics of hereditary forms of ichthyosis in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia),P04.29,"V. M. Sofronova , A. L. Sukhomyasova, N. R. Maksimova","North Eastern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Fed","erationIntroduction: Hereditary ichthyosis is common name for many dry and scaly skin disorders ranging in frequency from common to very rare. Clinical genealogical analysis of hereditary forms of ichthyosis (from 1989 to 2018) are conducted in the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia), Russia. Materials and methods: Data was collected from the genetic history of patients of the “Republican Genetic Register of Hereditary and Congenital Pathology of the Republic of Sakha (Yakutia) ”of the Medical Genetics Center of the Republican hospital №1“National center of medicine ”. Results: The number of patients with ichthyosis is 126 patients (104 families) according to the genetic register of Yakutia according to date of 2018. The frequency of ichthyosis was about 1/7675, prevalence is 13,0 to 100 000.Gender: 94 men (74.6%), 32 women (25.4%). Ethnicity: Yakut   109 (86.5%), Russian   17 (13.5%). In four families affected patients of both genders and in ten cases onlymales. All patients had dryness, peeling of the skin. In some cases, more severe symptoms were noted in the form of pityriasis peeling, follicular keratosis. The manifestationvaried from birth to adolescence. Conclusions: It is dif ﬁcult to establish the type of inheritance and further medical and genetic counselingbecause of genetic heterogeneity and the similarity of the clinical features of ichthyosis. Thus, there is a strong need in a highly speci ﬁc diagnostic method and in depth research study for precise diagnosis, treatment and prevention of these diseases.

The syndrome has a dominant inheritance and is caused by heterozygous pathogenic variants in the FilaminB encoding gene ( FLNB ). FLNB is an essential cytoskeletal protein which is thought to play a key role in bone mor  phogenesis. However, the skeletal phenotype of Larsen syndrome has not yet been characterized in details. Materials and methods: A case study. Two Caucasian women (mother and daughter; age 63 and 33 years) withLarsen syndrome carrying a novel FLNB c.688G>T, p. (Val230Phe) variant were included. A bone morphologic evaluation was performed including DXA scanning andhigh resolution peripheral quantitative tomography (HR  pQCT scan) evaluating their bone microstructure. Further  more, an iliac crest bone biopsy from the mother wasevaluated by µCT. Results: Both women showed signs of severe osteoporo  sis. The HR pQCT scan showed a low estimated bonestrength and volume density as well as decreased trabecular number compared to data from a population based group of Danish women. The µCT analysis of the bone biopsyshowed similar trabecular changes. The porosity of the cortical bone was found to be normal or decreased in both the HR pQCT and the µCT analysis. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings include an early onset of severe osteoporosis, which is likely due to structural changes in the trabecular bone compartment. On the otherhand, the cortical bone compartment shows no osteoporotic characteristics. This highlights that the investigated FLNB variant may have a very different effect on the trabecularand cortical compartments. T.M. Juul: None. C. Ejersted: None. L. Folkestad: None. K.

We present a case of a female with a typical clinical phenotype of Maffucci syndrome which was836 J. del Picchiaﬁnally deciphered as a compound heterozygote of Gron  blad Strandberg syndrome. Materials and methods: A 20 year old female suspected of Maffucci syndrome presented multiple cartilage defor  mities as well as hemangiomas and lymphangiomas disseminated along her body. Clinical exome sequencingwas performed on the DNA extracted from patient ’s blood, using Sophia Genetics ’Clinical Exome Solution v2. Following preparations according to the manufacturer ’s protocol, DNA libraries were sequenced on an Illumina NextSeq 500 genetic analyser. Data processing, variant calling and pre classi ﬁcation were conducted by SOPHiA DDM ®bioinformatics pipelines. Results: The patient carried wild type isocitrate dehy  drogenase 1 (IDH1) and isocitrate dehydrogenase 2 (IDH2)alleles related to Maffucci syndrome. Instead, she was found to be a compound heterozygote for ATP binding  cassette subfamily C member 6 gene (ABCC6) related topseudoxanthoma elasticum or Gronblad Strandberg syn  drome. In particular, she carried the pathogenic c.1652T>C (Phe551Ser) mutation and the c.2836C>A (Leu946Ile)mutation which is of debatable pathogenicity. Conclusions: Exome sequencing revealed a compound heterozygote with Gronblad Strandberg syndrome initiallysuspected to present a case of Maffucci syndrome. Pseudoxanthoma elasticum leads to mineralization of skin, eye, cardiovascular and gastrointestinal systems andcommonly present with papules in the skin and/or with angioid streaks of the retina.

Bronicki1 1Department of Genetics, Children ’s Hospital of Eastern Ontario, Ottawa, ON, Canada,2Department of Genetics, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, ON, Canada Marfan syndrome (MS) is an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the ﬁbrillin 1 gene (FBN1). It is aconnective tissue disorder characterized by a combination of cardiovascular, musculoskeletal, ophthalmic and pul  monary manifestations. The wide clinical variability of this disorder can make its recognition dif ﬁcult. Diagnosis is usually established based on the de ﬁned clinical criteria of the Ghent 2 nosology. Approximately 1800 pathogenic orlikely pathogenic variants have been identi ﬁed in FBN1, the majority of which are speci ﬁc to a single family, and 25% occurring de novo. Somatic and/or germline mosaicismhave been reported in rare cases. Here we describe an asymptomatic 50 year old female who presented for genetic counselling after her twodaughters, from different partners, were both diagnosed with MS. A known pathogenic variant, c.1693C>T, p. Arg565* in FBN1 (NM_000138.4), was con ﬁrmed in both affected half siblings. However, targeted Sanger sequencing for this variant was negative in the mother. Repeat testing via Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) of FBN1 wasoffered to the patient. NGS analysis of FBN1 revealed the presence of the variant in 9% of the sequencing reads. This is well belowthe allele frequency expected for a heterozygous germline variant (~50%). Based on the family history, this variant was reported at a mosaic level of 9%. These results are consistent with somatic and germline mosaicism in this patient. The recurrence risk for any future offspring is now known to be up to 50%. Additionally, shehas been referred to Cardiology and Genetics to assess for any clinical manifestations of MS in herself. A. Schaffer: None. L. Huang: None. O. Jarinova: None. S. Hewson: None. R.

 Next Generation Sequencing in Marfan syndrome: rare genetic variants improve genotype phenotypecorrelation,P04.37,"N. Marinakis , C. Sofocleous, E. Tsoutsou, D. Veltra,","M. Sviggou, J. Traeger Synodinos, E. Fryssira","National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece Introduction : Marfan syndrome (MFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder of connective tissue with a prevalence of 1 per 5000 individuals. MFS is characterized by early aortic thoracic dilatations/aneurysms, defects of the skeletal andocular systems, tall stature, arachnodactyly, pectus exca  vatum, joint hypermobility and ectopia lentis. Mutations in the Fibrillin 1 gene ( FBN1 ) are the most common cause of MFS. Nevertheless, mutations in other genes (e.g. TGFBR1, FLNA, COL5A1, SLC2A10, ADAMTSL4, CBS, SMAD3,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 837TGFB2, MED12, FBN2, PLOD1, BMPR2 etc.) have also been associated with MFS. New technologies, such as Next Generation Sequencing, contribute to the identi ﬁcation of known and novel mutations in these genes. Materials and methods: Clinical information and peripheral blood samples were collected from 25 patientswith Marfan or Marfan like phenotype and heart defects. DNA extraction and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES), analysing approximately 19.000 genes dispersed throughoutthe genome were applied. Results: WES analysis revealed positive results in 17 patients, accomplishing a diagnostic yield of 68%. Causa tive alterations included 14 known and novel pathogenic variants in the FBN1 gene, 1 in the FBN2 gene, 1 in the BMPR2 gene and 1 in the SLC2A10 gene. Conclusion: WES can support de ﬁnitive diagnosis in patients with Marfan or Marfan like phenotypes, contribut  ing to precise prognosis, systematic monitoring, and whenappropriate, identi ﬁcation of other family members.

She was bornsmall for gestational age with dysmorphic facial features, skeletal abnormalities, arthrogryposis, and hypoplastic labia majora, without typical webbing. Results: WES analysis was conducted after negative ﬁndings in karyotype, MLPA screening for microdeletions, subtelomeric deletions and duplications, urinary GAGs,NGS for congenital arthrogryposes. Two pathogenic variants were identi ﬁed in the CHRNG gene, c.241C>T previously reported in homozygous state in patient with asimilar clinical picture, and c.1143G>A which has not been previously described.

Common risk loci explain only some of their heritability. Rare, highly penetrant copy number variations (CNVs) encompassingpossible clefting susceptibility genes might partially explain the missing heritability. Aim of this study was to identify such genes by detecting de novo CNVs from whole exome sequencing (WES) trio data. CNVs were called from WES data of 50 nsCL/P and 43 nsCPO Central European patient/parent trios using XHMM, CoNIFER and EXCAVATOR2. Deﬁning XHMM as primary algorithm we established a ﬁltering pipeline considering sample wide frequency, de novo status, calling intersection (CoNIFER and/or EXCA  VATOR2), annotation to RefSeq genes, overlap with regions of segmental duplications and population fre quency. CNVs were validated using qPCR. Three interest  ingde novo CNVs were identi ﬁed: A 86kb deletion on Chr8 in an nsCL/P patient, a 16Mb deletion on Chr1 in an nsCPOpatient, and an 877kb duplication on Chr2 in an nsCPO patient. Interesting candidate genes at these loci are LHX8 , DLX1 andDLX2 , all suggested to contribute to craniofacial development: Targeted mutations of Lhx8 in mice lead to an isolated cleft palate. In embryonic mice Dlx1 andDlx2 are expressed in both the maxillary and the mandibular com ponent of the ﬁrst pharyngeal arches, and Dlx1/2  / mutant mice exhibit a cleft palate. Our results indicate that rare highly penetrant CNVs can contribute nsCL/P and nsCPOrisk.

Chondrocyte hyper  trophy is an essential process required for endochondralossiﬁcation in mammals and it is also plays a role in the development of OA. Furthermore, genetic factors have been found to be strong determinants of OA and are likely tooperate via chondrocyte function.

There might also be symptoms ashyperhidrosis, macerations and malodour due to secondary bacterial infections. Associated perioral erythema, brachy  dactyly, scaly plaques on elbows and knees as well as naildystrophy has also been described. The disease presents early in childhood and has a progressive cause. MDM is associated with variants in SLURP1 . The HGMD database includes 23 different variants in SLURP1 related to MDM or palmoplantar keratoderma. Material & methods: A 4 year old boy presented with an approximately two year history of erythema, scaling and diffuse, yellowish, transgredient keratoderma of palms and soles. He had associated interdigital macerations, dystrophiaof several nails and recurrent fungal and bacterial infections. He was born as the second child of non consanguineous parents and there was no family history of similar skindisease. The parents were from families living in different regions of Denmark. Genetic testing was performed using a next generation sequencing based gene panel targeting 28genes related to palmoplantar keratoderma. Results: A homozygous nonsense variant was identi ﬁed inSLURP1 (c.259del, p.(Ala87Profs*4)). The variant, predicted to result in a premature stop codon, has not previously been reported. A more distal frameshift variant has, however, been reported as disease causing supportinginterpretation of the variant as likely pathogenic. The parents were heterozygous for the variant.

Asmoniene1 1Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Lithua  nian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania, 2Department of Pediatric Surgery, Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Kaunas, Lithuania We present a case report of a 7 years old boy, the only child born to a man with osteogenesis imperfecta (OI) and a woman suspected to have pseudoachondroplasia, later on conﬁrmed to have COMP gene pathogenic heterozygous variant (c.1393G>C, p.Gly465Arg). Since birth, patient had seven spontaneous fractures, predominantly in the lower limbs. At the age of seven the patient exhibited dis proportionately short limb short stature with height mea  sured 96 cm; <3rd percentile. The patient had brachydactyly and ligamentous laxity with deformity of the lower limbs.He also had characteristic radiological changes of pseu  doachondroplasia: short tubular bones with widened and deformed metaphyses and vertebral anomalies. Dual energyx ray absorptiometry detected osteoporosis. Next generation sequencing was performed for the patient, OI genes and COMP gene known familial variant were analysed. It con  ﬁrmed the same pathogenic variant of COMP gene and in COL1A2 gene two heterozygous variants were found (c.2317C>T, p.Pro773Ser and c.2329_2331delCGT, p.Arg777del). The former was considered to be variant of uncertain signi ﬁcance because in silico predictors assessed it as benign, while the latter was assigned to be likelypathogenic because computational predictors assessed it as pathogenic. None of these variants were described in population databases. Both of COL1A2 variants were found in father ’sCOL1A2 gene, meaning that they locate in the same allele. It remains unclear if these variants are disease  causing since neither of fathers ’family members were affected with OI. Therefore, further sequencing of father ’s ﬁrst degree family members will be performed to con ﬁrm if these variants are truly de novo . L. Kievisiene: None. M. Sukys: None. R. Traberg: None. R.

Patients present with shortened trunk in proportion to height and signi ﬁcant scoliosis. Seven subtypes of SCDO have been identi ﬁed based on deleterious variants in one affected gene each (DLL3, MESP2, LFNG, HES7, TBX6, RIPPLY2, DMRT2 ), of mostly autosomal recessive inheritance. Most subtypes include only few cases, like SCDO3 ( LFNG ) where only two affected individuals are reported to date with a total ofthree variants. In a large study on genetic causes of skeletal dysplasia we recognized a 17 year old individual from healthy consan guineous parents with severe vertebral segmentation defects, rib and further non skeletal anomalies including solitary pelvic kidney, uterine dysgenesis, absence epilepsyand inner ear deafness. Performing WES we identi ﬁed a homozygous missense variant c.59C>T, p.(Thr20Ile) in LFNG , neither previously described in SCDO3 patients, nor listed in genetic databases. Both parents were heterozygous. The variant is predicted to destabilize a hydrogen bond leading to an impairment of protein function, likewisepreviously described variants inactivating the protein with altered Notch signaling. While the two previously reported cases had isolated skeletal anomalies the here reported individual presented with various additional symptoms. As no other variants were identi ﬁed neither in the exome nor in CMA we hypothesize that the phenotypic spectrum of this syndrome can be much broader, perhaps depending on the localization and nature of the affected variant, although we cannotexclude a blended phenotype due to an undetected additional variant.

Sixteen individuals with Steel syndrome, mainly Puerto Ricans (11/16), were previously reported to carry bi allelic mutations in the COL27A1 gene. Here, we present the ﬁrst patient with Steel syndrome in Europe and the sixth non Puerto Rican carrying a novel homozygous mutation in COL27A1 . The patient is a 4 year old boy born to non consanguineous healthy parents, with dysmorphic facial features, absent hip ossi ﬁcation centres, external rotation of both feet, relatively short stature, mild skinsyndactyly, short mid phalanges and bilateral sensorineural hearing loss. Whole exome sequencing (WES) revealed a novel homozygous missense variant [chr9.hg:19:g.116982108G>A; c.2409G>A; p.(Gly802Glu)] in COL27A1 (NM_032888.4).

Mortier3","1Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands,2University Medi","cal Centre Groningen, Groningen, Netherlands,3University of Antwerp, Antwerp, Belgium To diagnose a speci ﬁc lethal skeletal dysplasia purely based on ultrasound data can be quite challenging in a prenatalsetting. However, molecular testing of fetal DNA in com  bination with radiographic evaluation and autopsy post  delivery usually allows the clinician to come up with aspeciﬁc diagnosis. We report a case of platyspondylic lethal skeletal dysplasia, Torrance type (PLSD T) that was initi  ally diagnosed as achondrogenesis type 1A. Advancedultrasound at 20 weeks of gestation showed, in addition to generalized edema, shortened and curved long bones with a thoracic –AC ratio of 0.68. At 29 weeks of gestation a male neonate was born who died directly after birth. Achon  drogenesis type 1A was initially suggested based on the ultrasound abnormalities and clinical examination post natally. Radiographs showed skeletal abnormalities remi  niscent of achondrogenesis type 1A: severe micromelia with ﬂared and cupped metaphyses, relatively large head, short ilia and delayed vertebrae ossi ﬁcation. All genes ( TRIP11, SLC26A2 and COL2A1 ) causing the different forms of achondrogenesis (IA;IB;II) were sequenced. In TRIP11,only heterozygosity for a class 3 variant was identi ﬁed and no variant could be identi ﬁed on the other allele. However, a class 4 variant p.(lle1 389dup), in COL2A1 was identi ﬁed in the portion coding for the C propeptide of type II col  lagen. This ﬁnding led to the diagnosis of PLSD Torrance type. This case demonstrates the phenotypical overlapbetween achondrogenesis type 1A and Torrance dysplasia. M. van den Born: None. M. Joosten: None. P. Schut: None. J. Cornette: None.

Utkus1 1Department of Human and Medical Genetics, Institute of Biomedical Sciences, Faculty of Medicine, Vilnius Uni  versity, Vilnius, Lithuania,2Centre for Medical Genetics, Vilnius University Hospital Santaros Klinikos, Vilnius, Lithuania842 J. del PicchiaBackground: Overgrowth syndromes frequently share overlapping manifestations and are dif ﬁcult to diagnose based on clinical features. Accurate diagnosis is important for prognosis and correct tumour surveillance program and can be achieved with next generation sequencing. Results : A 4 year old girl presenting with excessive growth of prenatal onset, advanced bone age, macrocephaly, development delay, intellectual disability, generalized sei  zures and peculiar face was referred to our clinic. She was athird child in a healthy non consanguineous family, born prematurely at 36 weeks gestation with birth weight 3100 g and height 58 cm. Her karyotype revealed interstitialinversion 46,XX, inv(X)(p22;q28) which was inherited from her healthy mother. No pathogenic variants were observed in theNSD1 gene. At the age of 22 years, her height is 195 cm, weight 140 kg; limited shoulder, elbow and wrist movement, kyphosis, hypertrophic soft tissue around knees were observed besides previously mentioned features. Her IQscore is 40. Next generation sequencing for known over  growth conditions revealed a novel missense heterozygous EZH2 mutation c.373G>A (NM_004456.4:c.[373G>A] ; [373,], NP_004447.2:p.(Glu125Lys) within exon 5. Based on 11 in silico tools of pathogenicity prediction detected variant was characterized as pathogenic. In addition to thetypical ﬁndings of Weaver syndrome, our patient has polythelia, atrial septal defect and lumbar spinal stenosis. Conclusion : An increasing number of diagnoses with next generation sequencing helps to gather more phenoty  pic information, improve management and surveillance of overgrowth syndromes. This example also highlights theimportance of periodic case reviews for patients not diagnosed on initial testing as more information becomes available in the medical literature. E.M.

Prenatal ultrasound diagnosis has been reported in some cases afterdetection of asymmetric shortening of the long bones with cartilage stippling, representing foci of calci ﬁcation, usually in the second trimester of pregnancy. Materials and methods: A female fetus was diagnosed with asymmetric bilateral short long bones and stippling of the proximal epiphyses of the humerus by prenatal ultrasoundexamination at 21weeks of gestation. Absence of nasal bones was also observed previously at 13weeks. Amniocentesis was performed for molecular analysis through array CGH and a531 genes NGS panel for skeletal dysplasia. The pregnancy was terminated at 23weeks of gestation. Fetal gross examination, postnatal X rays and steroid chromatographyin amniotic liquid were performed to assist in the diagnosis. Results: The NGS skeletal dysplasia panel identi ﬁed a de novo heterozygous missense variant c.388G>A p. (Gly130Arg), in the EBP gene. This variant was not reported in the literature nor in gnomAD or other databases andin silico analysis predicts it as likely pathogenic. Conclusions: To our knowledge this is a novel EBP pathogenic variant, albeit missense variants changing the same Gly130 have been previously associated to CDPX2.CDPX2 should be a diagnosis to bear in mind when short fetal long bones and stippling are present in second trimester of pregnancy.

However, the understanding of the genetic contribution to ischemic heart diseases is very limited. It has been suggested thatvariants in genes related to pathways involved in athero  thrombosis could increase the risk of development cardiac events. Methods: Genetic variants in 24 genes which encoded proteins related to pathways involved in atherothrombosis were analyzed by next generation sequencing in 24 patientswith AMI. Mutation found was con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Visualization of the mutation using pdb viewer and in silico prediction of the effects produced by the mutation (Mutation Tester, SNAP2, SIFT2, Polyphen, PhD  SNP) were performed. Results: In one patient, p.Ala2058Gly was identi ﬁed in ABCA1 gene that encodes the ATP binding cassette transporter 1, which is crucial in the initial step of high  density lipoprotein (HDL) formation and in reversecholesterol transport. All the in silico tools used suggested a pathological role of this variant. Conclusion: Our results are in concordance with previously reports that associated different variants in ABCA1 gene with an increased risk of coronary artery disease and ischemic heart disease. Thus, mutationsinABCA1 gene could have a role in the development of AMI.

We describe a 53 year old male proband with a history of sudden death (maternal grandmother) and thoracic aortic aneurysm in the father. The proband bicycled regularly andexperienced aborted cardiac arrest at the age of 52 during a normal daylight activity. ECG showed transient ischemic patterns with increased troponin T values. A CT scandemonstrated a type A aortic dissection (AD) not involving coronary arteries, surgically corrected without complica  tions. During the follow up, occasional seizures wereobserved, successfully treated with Levetiracetam. Ajmaline challenge test resulted negative, no arterial tortuosity neither signs of intracranial vessel involvement have been demon strated by Angio MRI. The proband was studied with NGS including panels for Brugada syndrome, LQTS and AD genes. Only the c.1004C>T (p.Pro335Leu) heterozygousmissense variant in the ACTA2 gene was found. Proband ’s only daughter is asymptomatic, negative at clinical eva  luation and does not carry the paternal variant. No otherrelatives are available to date. The c.1004C>T (p.Pro335  Leu) in the ACTA2 gene is predicted to be “pathogenic ”by several bioinformatics tools, but to date its clinical sig niﬁcance is still uncertain.

Rueda Arenas, F. Arrieta,S. Rodríguez Nóvoa","INGEMM, Madrid, SpainIntroduction: Hypoalphalipoproteinemia primary 2 (# 618463), is generally an autosomal recessive disorderassociated with extremely low levels of apoA I and HDL C in serum and, in most of the patients, premature athero  sclerotic cardiovascular disease, xanthomas and cornealopacities 1. Currently, 30 families have been described. This disease is caused by pathogenic variants in APOA1 gene (MIM 107680) that code for the Apolipoprotein A I (apoA I), the major structural component of HDL. Herein we844 J. del Picchiareport a case of a male with suspicious of hypoalphalipoproteinemia. Materials and methods: A 58 year old woman with xanthomas, corneal clouding and familial history of isquemic cardiopathy, was remitted to our service for genetic testing. The patient had extremely low levels ofapoA I (<16.0 mg/dL) and HDL C (6 mg/dL) in serum. Genes involved in cholesterol metabolism were analyzed by Next Generation Sequence (NGS) using a customized panelof 411 genes related with metabolic diseases. Results: The frameshift mutation APOA1 _NM_ 000039.2: c.85dupC ;p.(Gln29Profs*29) was found in homo  zygosis in the patient resulting a truncated apoA I. In silico analysis showed damaging and conservation for this variant. Sanger sequencing con ﬁrmed the variant found in APOA1. Conclusions: This variant c.85dupC;p.(Gln29Profs*29) has been previously described as a cause of ApoA1deﬁciency 2. ApoA I de ﬁciency is generally associated with markedly increased risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. However, in this study we identi ﬁed a homozygous frameshift mutation of the APOA1 gene as the molecular basis of apoA I de ﬁciency in a 58 year old woman without isquemic cardiopathy.

Identi ﬁcation of mutation(s) in causative genes is one of the major diagnostic criteria of ARVC. Methods: Clinical, instrumental examination, medical and genetic counseling were performed for 70 ARVC probands (mean age 41,9 y. o.). Screening of 16 genes was performed by high throughput semiconductor sequencing combined with Sanger sequencing. Potential role of genetic variants was evaluated according to ACMG criteria. Mutational spec trum of desmosomal and non desmosomal genes in ARVC probands was studied in comparison with control group ofAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 84546 DCM probands. Results: Deﬁnite, borderline or pos  sible ARVC diagnosis based on the Task Force Criteria of 2010 was established for 70 probands. Some patients in our cohort had signs of dilated/restrictive cardiomyopathy (N,17), LVNC (N ,10), BrS patterns (N ,4). Likely pathogenic genetic variants and VUCSes were identi ﬁed in 46% of ARVC probands in desmosomal ( PKP2, DSG2, DSP, DSC2, JUP ) and non desmosomal ( LMNA, SCN5A, MYH7, MYBPC3, TTN, FLNC, LDB3 ) genes. Mutational spectrum of genes in ARVC probands with a pre  dominance of variants in desmosomal genes (64%) was different from one in the DCM control group.Genetic variants in non desmosomal genes prevailed in patients with ARVC overlapping phenotypes. Conclu  sion: Likely pathogenic genetic variants and VUCSes were identi ﬁed in 46% of ARVC probands.

The relation between several genes and AH have been investigated in different populations butresults were inconsistent and inconclusive. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether polymorphisms in two can  didate genes are associated with AH in Romania ’s adult Caucasian population. Materials and methods: We analysed data from 1660 unrelated Romanian Caucasian subjects (835 with AH and825 normotensive). The average age of the hypertensive patients and controls were 54.66±4.30 and 47.73±4.05,respectively. The ACE ID and MTHFR C677T polymorph  isms were genotyped using PCR based methods. Statistical tests were conducted with StatsDirect. The signi ﬁcance of the differences in observed frequencies of polymorphisms was assessed by chi squared test (p<0.05). The distribution of the genotypes in all lots respects Hardy Weinbergequilibrium condition. Results: Signi ﬁcant associations were detected between HA and the ACE DD (OR ,1.44, p,0.0007) and MTHFR TT (OR ,1.46, p ,0.0009). The ACE D allele was associated with earlier onset of AH in patients with AH (p,0.00005). ACE DD (OR ,1.88, p ,0.0006), ACE D (OR,1.92, p<0.0001), and MTHFR TT (OR ,2.28, p<0.0001) were signi ﬁcantly associated with AH among subjects whose parents also have AH. Smoking subjectswith MTHFR TT genotype (OR ,1.68, p ,0.0004) and those heterozygous (OR ,1.46, p,0.0002) or homozygous (OR,1.62, p,0.0005) for ACE D presented higher risk for AH. ACE DD and alcohol consumption predispose to AH (OR,5.6, p,0.0004). Conclusions: This study suggests that ACE and MTHFR genes are associated with AH in the studied population. C. Barbarosie: None. R.

 The in ﬂuence of the circadian genes CLOCK and ARNTL on myocardial infarction,P05.10,"I.Škrlec1, J. Mili ć2, R. Steiner3,2","1Hystology, Genetics, Cellular and Molecular Biology","Laboratory, Faculty of Dental Medicine and Health, JosipJuraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia, 2Faculty of Medicine Osijek, Josip Juraj Strossmayer University of Osijek, Osijek, Croatia,3Clinical Department of Cardiovascular Diseases and Intensive Care, Clinic for Internal Medicine, University Hospital Osijek, Osijek, Croatia Introduction: The circadian rhythm regulates various physiological mechanisms, and its disruption can promotemany disorders. Many cardiovascular events show morning circadian preferences, such as myocardial infarction (MI), dissection of aortic aneurysms, and stroke. Disturbance ofendogenous circadian rhythms enhances the chance of MI, showing that circadian clock genes could have a crucial function in the onset of the disease. It was hypothesized thatthe polymorphisms of one nucleotide (SNP) in two circa  dian rhythm genes ( CLOCK andARNTL ) could be asso  ciated with MI. Materials and methods: This case control study was performed on 1057 participants. The sample included 431 patients (243 males, 188 females) of Croatian origin withnon fatal acute myocardial infarction and 626 participants in the control group without MI. Three SNPs were analyzed inCLOCK (rs13124436, rs6811520, and rs11932595), and three in the ARNTL gene (rs12363415, rs4757144, and rs3789327). Results: Statistically signi ﬁcant differences, estimated by the chi square test, were found in the distribution of alleles and genotypes between MI and no MI groups of the CLOCK (rs6811520 and rs13124436) and ARNTL (rs3789327 and rs12363415) genes. Some of the tested SNPs were associated with cardiovascular risk factors in MI patients. Conclusion : According to the results of the present study, the polymorphisms in the CLOCK andARNTL genes couldbe related to MI. Polymorphisms in those clock genes might be an additional risk factor for myocardial infarction. Grant no. FDMZ 2019 IP8 I.Škrlec: None. J. Mili ć: None. R. Steiner: None. E",2020

Samilyk2 1National children ’s specialized hospital «OKHMATDYT» of Ministry of Health of Ukraine, The Center of Medical Genetics, Kyiv, Ukraine,2O.O. Bogomolets ’National Medical University, Kyiv, Ukraine Introduction: Among congenital malformations in children the greatest number is taken by defects of the cardiovascular system. According to Ukrainian and foreign researchers, congenital heart defects (CHD) occur at an average fre quency of 59 60 per 10000 newborns. The purpose of this study was to determine the frequency of CHD in newborns and genetic components of this pathology in Kyiv. Materials and methods: The following methods were used in this work: clinical genealogical, cytogenetic including cytomolecular (FISH), biochemical (TMS) andconventional clinical and instrumental methods. Results: The frequency of isolated CHD in newborns was determined based on medical genetic counseling (MGC)practice at the Specialized Center of Medical Genetics in Kyiv. In 2018 the frequency was 90 per 10000 live births, in 2019  93 per 10000. All cases were con ﬁrmed by cardiologist ultrasound diagnostics at specialized cardiac centers and maternity hospitals. During the study period (2018 2019) the weighted percentage of an isolated CHDwas 53% among all congenital malformations in live births in Kyiv. Analysis of genetic components including syndromes of various forms of the CHD (2018 2019), ﬁrst discovered during MGC, showed that the causes of the CHD were due to chromosomal pathology  52%, isolated forms  24%, genetic pathology  13%, undifferentiatedmultiple malformations  11%. Conclusions: Every child with a validated form of the CHD should pass the MGC and screening at a specializedgenetic institution to eliminate syndromal forms, calculate various genetic risks for the family and prevent them. The mean frequency of isolated CHD in newborns is 92 per10000 in Kyiv. V. Galagan: None. A. Dorokhina: None. M. Tsyhankova: None. S. Kulbalaieva: None. Y. Dudierina: None.

Materials & Methods: Whole exome sequencing was performed on two DNA pools set up of Alzheimer patients (n,70) and healthy individuals (n ,100), respectively. After reads quality ﬁltering, 143,493 genetic variants detected in both pools were annotated. A list of variants associated with CHD was compiled using the publicly available ENSEMBLdatabase (n ,1479). We surveyed the pool data for presence of CHD associated variants and selected those present in both pools. Results: Of the 92 CHD associated variants detected in our pool data, 24 variants in 22 genes were estimated to have signi ﬁcantly higher frequency in AD patients compared to the healthy individuals (FDR<0.05). Func  tional analysis was performed on the 22 genes using ToppGene platform. Results indicate lipid metabolism andlipoprotein transport associated pathways to be most signiﬁcantly overrepresented in AD patients compared to controls. Conclusion: The analysis of CHD associated variants in AD patients and healthy controls suggests shared herit  ability in genes involved in overrepresented lipid pathways.

 A DNA repair pathway polymorphism in angiographi cally proven coronary artery patients of southern Iran,P05.18,"M. Bijanzadeh , S. Seyedian, F. Ahmadi, S. Hosseini","Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences, Ahvaz,","Iran, Ahvaz, Iran, Islamic Republic of Introduction: Coronary artery disease (CAD) is among the most common causes of death and is based on the interac  tion between environmental risk factors and predisposinggenes. X ray repair cross complementing group 1 (XRCC1), a DNA repair protein involved in single strand breaks (SSBs) and base excision repair (BER) pathways,was reported to be responsible for the ef ﬁcient repair of single strand breaks and damaged bases in DNA. Arg399Gln (rs25487) is one of the common XRCC1 poly  morphisms that might be associated with increased risk for CAD. Materials and methods: A case control study was performed to investigate the relation between this poly  morphism and the CAD development. 290 patients and 216 controls were screened for the mentioned SNP by Restric tion Fragment Length Polymorphisms (RFLP) method. Results: The frequency of the GA genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln was signi ﬁcantly higher in CAD patients than in controls (p ,0.002, OR: 1.21, 95% CI (1.06 1.37)) and also dominant mode (AA +GA) genotype of XRCC1 Arg399Gln had a 1.851 fold increased risk for CAD(p,0.005). Conclusion: Ourﬁndings demonstrated that Arg399Gln polymorphism of XRCC1 has a signi ﬁcant relationship and a probable predisposing role in CAD. Our results support the role of DNA damages and the malfunctions of DNA repair system in CAD patients. Introducing of this candidategene along with other related genetic variants can help the development of early diagnosis and effective interventional strategies that are safe, necessary and individualized forCAD patients.

Originally, FLNC variants were described in myo ﬁbrillar myopathy (MFM) patients. Later, high throughput screening in cardiomyopathy cohorts determined a prominent role for FLNC in isolated hyper  trophic and dilated cardiomyopathies (HCM and DCM).FLNC variants are now among the more prevalent causes of genetic DCM. FLNC associated DCM is associated with a malignant clinical course and a high risk of sudden cardiacdeath. The clinical spectrum of FLNC suggests different pathomechanisms related to variant types and their location in the gene. Proper functioning of FLNC is crucial forstructural integrity and cell signaling of the sarcomere. The secondary protein structure of FLNC is critical to ensure this function. Truncating variants with subsequent hap loinsuf ﬁciency are associated with DCM and cardiac arrhythmias. Interference with the dimerization and folding of the protein leads to aggregate formation detrimental formuscle function, as found in HCM and MFM. Variants associated with HCM are predominantly missense variants which cluster in the ROD2 domain. This domain isimportant for binding to the sarcomere and ensure proper cell signaling.

 From genomics data to multiscale simulation portable pipeline for extracting cardiomyophaty speci ﬁc parameters,P05.21,"N. Ilic Raicevic , L. Lenhardt Ackovic, V. Kovacevic,","S. Stojanovic, J. Randjelovic, M. Mattioni, A. S. Yavuz,","M. Lazarevic, T. Borovski Seven Bridges Inc, Boston, MA, United States Introduction: Hypertrophic and dilated cardiomyopathy are the most common inherited cardiovascular diseases which lead to increased mortality and morbidity if not diagnosed in early stages. Design and development of newdrugs and therapies which would prevent initiation and progression of familial cardiomyopathies is achievable today due to improved simulation methods and genomicdata availability. The goal of this study was to establish a portable pipeline for annotating variants associated with familial cardiomyopathy and to determine induced changesat protein level. The outputs combined with the clinical data could then be used for simulation of structure and function of the heart. Materials and methods: Analyzing steps encompass variant calling, variant annotation with best ﬁtting tool using apposite databases, and ﬁnal re ﬁnement of the variants. The work ﬂow consists of BWA GATK best practices, Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor and bix2mus (custom made tool). In this study, 100 samples ofindividuals with diagnosed cardiomyopathy are processed giving a statistically powerful dataset. The work ﬂow was written in the CWL. Results: The composed work ﬂow produced a subset of annotated variants that are cardiomyopathy speci ﬁc. Selected annotated variants were further enriched withcustom parameters which can be used as inputs for the MUSICO heart function simulation. Conclusions: The developed work ﬂow for discovery and annotation of variants associated with analyzed forms of inherited cardiomyopathy is operating system independent, runnable on cloud or locally, ensuring portability, reprodu cibility and reliability.

HMC causes partialenlargement of the myocardium. Materials and methods: We report on middle aged patient with familial history and developed HCM. Exomesequencing was performed on the patient ’s extracted DNA, followed by a targeted analysis of genes from the “Cardio ” gene panel. Results were validated by Sanger sequencing. Results: The analysis resulted in detection of a hetero  zygous, probably pathogenic variant in the MYBPC3 gene (NM_000256.3: c.2965delG; NP_000247.2:p.Glu989 Serfs*3). This variant has not been previously reported in individuals with HCM. The MYBPC3 encodes for the Cardiac myosin binding protein C. The MYBPC3 has astructural role as it is located in striated muscle sarcomere A bands and binds myosin heavy chain in thick ﬁlaments and titin in elastic ﬁlaments causing muscle contraction. Pathogenic variants in the MYBPC3 gene account for approximately 15% of cases of familial HCM. The deletion that we detected leads to a frameshift resulting in an aminoacid substitution of glutamic acid to serine at codon 989. Furthermore, due to the new reading frame, a stop codon can be detected 3 codons downstream, likely affecting theprotein function because of a possible truncated protein form. The inheritance is autosomal dominant. No other known pathological or probably pathological variantsassociated to HCM were found. Conclusions: The genetic causes underlining HMC are complex and identifying novel variants may contribute tobetter distinction of this dysfunction and assessment of the risk of familial predisposition.

 Genetic structure of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy in Russia,P05.25,"E. V. Filatova1, N. S. Krylova2, I. N. Vlasov1,","M. S. Maslova2, N. Poteshkina2, P. A. Slominsky1,","M. I. Shadrina1 1Institute of Molecular Genetics RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) is the most common heritable cardiovascular disease, classically deﬁned as the presence of idiopathic left ventricular hypertrophy. HCM is predominantly a single gene disorder with an autosomal dominant pattern of inheritance. How  ever, pathogenic alleles are not identi ﬁed in at least 25% of patients with HCM. Moreover, the whole spectrum of genes and mutations that contribute to the development of this disorder in Russian population has not been fully described.Therefore, the aim of our study was to identify genetic variants associated with the HCM in patients from Russia. Materials and methods: The study cohort included 99 unrelated patients with HCM. We performed targeted exome sequencing and a subsequent bioinformatic analysis using the various algorithms for prediction of the potentialpathogenicity of variants, as well as the ClinVar database. Results: The frequency of pathogenic and potentially pathogenetically signi ﬁcant variants in the main HCM  related genes was 18% in our patients with this disorder. We also identi ﬁed 22 potentially pathogenetically signi ﬁcant variants, including novel ones, in other HCM genes and 52potentially pathogenetic variants in other 35 genes with known associations to 17 different inherited cardiac conditions. Conclusion: Thereby the prevalence of individual pathogenic variants in HCM related genes in Russian population is very low. Therefore, it is necessary tocontinue the search for new genes and genetic variants associated with the development of HCM.

I th a sb e e ns u g g e s t e dt h a tt h er i s ko fS Dd u et oV Fi nA M Iis the result of the interaction between genetic factors and environmental factors. Moreover, it has been proposed that variants in genes related to cardiac excitability,mainly SCN5A , could play an important role in VF during AMI. Methods: Genetic variants in 36 genes encoded proteins related to pathways involved in atherothrombosis were analyzed by next generation sequencing in 12 patients with FV during AMI. Mutations found were con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Visualization of the mutation using pdb and in silico prediction of the effects produced by the mutation (Mutation Tester, SNAP2, SIFT2, Polyphen, PhD SNP) were performed. Results: In one patient, p.Trp83Ser was identi ﬁed in KCNJ11 gene that encodes a forming KATP channel subunit, whereas in another patient p.Thr738Pro in SCN10A , encoding the forming subunit of the sodium channel, were identi ﬁe d .I nb o t hv a r i a n t s ,m o r et h a nf o u r in silico tools suggested deleterious function of the protein. Conclusion: Mutations in gene encoded forming channels subunits, as KCNJ11 andSCN10A , could have a role in the development of FV during AMI.

There areevidences that somatic mutations can play a role in endo  thelial dysfunction, and atherosclerotic plaques are char  acterized by increased level of DNA adducts. The aim of this research was to study the level of genotoxic stress markers; secretion and gene expression of proathero  sclerotic cytokines IL 6 and IL 8 by endothelial cellsexposed to alkylating mutagen mitomycin C (MMC). Materials and methods: Primary human coronary  (HCAEC) and internal thoracic artery endothelial cells(HITAEC) were used in this research. Cytokinesis block micronucleus assay was performed to score genotoxic stress markers in exposed and control cell cultures. Concentrationof IL 6 and IL 8 in culture medium and mRNA level of the corresponding genes were measured immediately after 6 hours of cell incubation with mutagen and 24 hours afterelimination of MMC from cell cultures, using ELISA and RT qPCR. Results: Exposed cells were characterized by increased level of all studied cytogenetic markers compared to control. After 6 hours of exposure, a signi ﬁcant decrease in the secretion and gene expression of IL 8, and decrease inthe mRNA level of the IL 6 gene in the exposed cultures was discovered. At the second time point (6 +24 h), on the contrary, the concentration and mRNA level of IL 8, as wellas expression of the IL6gene sharply increased in cultures exposed to MMC compared to control, and the HCAEC were more sensitive to mutagenic effects than HITAEC.This study was supported by basic research project №0546  2015 0012.

Their clinical presentation and aetiology are highly heterogeneous, which may cause a diagnosticdilemma. So far, ALG13 c.320A > G variant was reported in ten females and one male. Contrary to other known ALG13  CDG, in probands harbouring this mutation normal glyco sylation and mass spectrometry pattern were observed (two and one individuals, respectively). There is, however, one854 J. del Picchiaanother report, giving evidence of slightly reduced glyco  sylation with the absence of one glycan in MS. Since these laboratory data are not conclusive, and the number of reported patients is still very limited, we like to present novel individuals, pointing out their transferrin IEF results. Materials : Three female probands with de novo ALG13 c.320A>G variant (P3, with the most severe psychomotor impairment, also heterozygous for c.3433C>T in the CACNA1A gene). Methods : Transferrin isoforms examined by isoelectric focusing (IEF) of iron saturated serum in agarose gel in a pH gradient 5 7 with immuno ﬁxation, demonstrated as the percentage of each isoform fraction in a densitometric scan. Results : Transferrin isoforms showed normal pro ﬁles in P1, while in P2   slight elevation of asialo, monosialo,disialo fraction; P3   ﬁrst analysis: normal; second (in another sample): slight elevation of only disialo fraction.

It isinherited in an autosomal recessive manner caused by the mutations of CYP27A1 gene localized on 2q35. This gene encodes sterol 27 hydroxylase. Here we present a 8 year old male with attention de ﬁcit and hyperactivity disorder. He was born to non consanguineous parents. He was con  sulted to us for CYP27A1 gene analysis by the information of a homozygous deletion in exon 6 of CYP27A1 gene in his mother. Additionally, his 7 dehydrocholesterol and plasma cholestanol levels increased consistently with CTX.His father had epilepsy together with limited intellectual capacity.Material and Method: Genomic DNAs were extracted from the patient and his father, followed by CYP27A1 gene sequencing. Furthermore, in order to demonstrate the deletion, multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁcatio  nof the CYP27A1 gene was performed in the proband. Results: We found a novel heterozygous c.508_509ins16 (p.E170Vfs*16) mutation in CYP27A1 gene in the pro  band’s father. Consequently, a compound heterozygous mutation was detected in the proband. The effect of thisnovel point mutation on CYP27A1 function was predicted to be damaging by in silico analysis. After genetic counseling, his grandmother who was his legal guardian, consented tokenodeoxycholic acid (CDCA) treatment. Cholestanol decreased to normal levels and some symptoms improved at the end of two months treatment. Conclusion: Genetic testing for presymptomatic family members of affected patients should be suggested especially to offer an opportunity to prevent or decrease the diseasemanifestations with CDCA therapy.

Most of the human disease is characterized by marked genetic heterogeneity,far greater than previously appreciated. This degree of allelic, locus, and phenotypic heterogeneity has important implications for gene discovery and has important impli cations for development of molecular treatments for indi  vidual patients. Aim: Analysis of genetic heterogeneity of the most common lysosomal storage diseases in patients from Ukraine. Materials and methods: The frequencies and spectrum of causes mutations in patients with Gaucher (n ,62), Niemann Peak A/B (n ,16), metachromatic leukodystrophy (MLD) (n ,28), mucopolysaccharidosis type I (MPS I) (n,17), mucopolysaccharidosis type IIIA (MPS III A) (n,21), GM1 gangliosidosis (n ,32) were analyzed. Muta  tion analysis was performed using classical PCR analysisand Sanger sequencing. Comparative analysis of the common mutations in different populations was performed according to the published data. Results: Our research has shown that the frequencies of common mutations in patients with Niemann Peak A/B, MLD and GM1 gangliosidosis in Ukraine is signi ﬁcantly different from other European. Frequencies of common mutations in patients with Gaucher, MPS I and MPS IIIA isclose to that in the nearest neighbors   Poland, Hungary and Slovakia, but are lower than European average, and the genetic heterogeneity of these diseases in Ukraine is pronounced.

In 2014, Burrage et al. reported an MLASA  like phenotype (OMIM 500011) in a patient harboring anovel heteroplasmic point mutation in mitochondrial ATP synthase 6 (MT ATP6) . Pathogenic variants in MT ATP6 are a cause of NARP (neurogenic muscle weakness, ataxia,and retinitis pigmentosa) and Leigh syndrome. Case description: The proband is an 8 year old girl with an early infantile presentation of failure to thrive, side roblastic anemia, axial hypotonia, nystagmus and mild developmental delay. Slow growing, sparse and brittle858 J. del Picchiastriking hair was noticed since infancy. She evolved with developmental stagnation and severe ID. Recently, clinical deterioration occurred during acute illness. On physical examination she has tip toe ataxic gait, dystonia, bradyki  nesia, rigidity, and muscle weakness with atrophy. Ophthalmologic assessment showed salt and pepper retino pathy. Persistent hyperlacticaemia and respiratory chain complex V de ﬁciency in muscle were documented. WES and CNV analysis were negative. Mitochondrial genomesequencing in blood identi ﬁed a novel de novo homo  plasmic variant in MT ATP6 gene (NC_012920.1: m.9014A>G), classi ﬁed as uncertain according to ACMG guidelines, but considered likely pathogenic applying the ClinGen SVI Bayesian classi ﬁcation framework. Functional studies are ongoing. Conclusions: MLASA plus is a distinctive phenotype associated with MT ATP6 uncommon variants. MT  ATP6 –related disease is best de ﬁned as a mitochondrial disease spectrum disorder, as demonstrated by the presence of NARP and Leigh features in our patient. Hair abnormalities are distinctive and might lead the clinicianto suspect the diagnosis before multi organ involvement develops. J. Dupont: None. P. Janeiro: None. M.J. Palaré: None. S.

 Management and outcomes in pregnant women with GCK MODY and HNF1A MODY from Poland,P06.16,"M. Szopa , K. Zawadzka, K. Cyganek, P. Witek, M. T.",Malecki,"JUMC, Krakow, Poland Introduction: Mutations in the glucokinase ( GCK ) and hepatocyte nuclear factor1a ( HNF1A ) gene are the most common causes of maturity onset diabetes of the young (MODY). The management of both MODY types duringpregnancy is challenging and differs from other forms of diabetes. The aim was to assess clinical management and pregnancy outcomes among women with GCK MODY andHNF1A MODY. Material and Methods: We included 13 GCK and 14 HNF1A MODY patients. Results: There was no signi ﬁcant difference in age of pregnancy between GCK and HNF1A MODY women; those with the HNF1A gene mutation were diagnosed with MODY earlier (28vs.30years). HNF1A MODY patients preconception body weight was higher (67.28 kg) compared to GCK MODY (62.71kg), but the body weight gain duringpregnancy was signi ﬁcantly higher among GCK MODY patients (18.5vs.12.78 kg,p<0.005). Treatment modi ﬁcationduring pregnancy was more common among GCK MODY patients: most switched from only diet to insulin. Total insulin per day in the 1 sttrimester was signi ﬁcantly higher in GCK MODY (34.57vs. 30.5units,p<0.005) patients and the difference between percentage of basal insulin was also signiﬁcantly higher (34.99vs.20.87%,p<0.005), the latter of which remained signi ﬁcant until the end of pregnancy. There were no macrosomic or low birth weight neonates. Conclusions: GCK MODY pregnant women received a higher daily dose of insulin, especially in percentage of basal insulin, compared to HNF1A MODY patients. This could be due to attempts to achieve target fasting glucoselevels during pregnancy established for gestational diabetes despite different speci ﬁcities of GCK MODY. The higher dose of given insulin could be responsible for the greaterweight gain among GCK MODY patients. M. Szopa: None. K. Zawadzka: None. K. Cyganek: None. P. Witek: None. M.T. Malecki: None.

Taran2","1Reseach Center for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation,2Federal Research Centre of Nutrition and Biotechnology, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Peroxisome biogenesis disorders (PBD) are a heterogeneous group of autosomal recessive disorders that affect multiple organ systems. Approximately 80% of PBD patients are classi ﬁed in the Zellweger syndrome spectrum, which are caused generally by mutations in the PEX1, PEX6, PEX10, PEX12, or PEX26 genes. Materials and methods: We present two unrelated families of Dagestan origin with three 1 year old male members with cholestasis hepatopathy and development delay. Parents of one family were consanguineous. Allpatients were born at term, had appropriate birth weights for gestational age. From 2 months of age they have had poor feeding, development delay. Physical examination showedjaundiced, hepatosplenomegaly and coagulopathy. At 1year of age, they couldn ’t sit and stand on their own. Two sibs (monozygous twins) had very low cholesterol level andnormal GGT. The concentrations of C26 and phytanic acid in plasma were increased and made up respectively 13.2mM/ml (normal 0.22 2.2nN/ml) and 59.42mg/ml(normal 0 3.11mg/dl); ratio of C26/C22 was 0.149 (normal 0.009 0.018).

 BH4 de ﬁcient hyperphenylalaninemia in Russia,P06.21,P. Gundorova,"1, I. A. Kuznetsova1, A. A. Stepanova1,","A. V. Polyakov1, Y. S. Itkis2 1Federal State Budgetary Institution ""Research Centre for Medical Genetics"", Moscow, Russian Federation, 2Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Tetrahydrobiopterin de ﬁcient hyperphenyla  laninemia (BH4 HPA) is a group of heterogeneous diseases, caused by impaired synthesis or regeneration of tetra hydrobiopterin (BH4), a cofactor of the phenylalanine, tyrosine and tryptophan hydroxylases. Six different genes are known as responsible for BH4 metabolism. The pro portion of BH4 HPA and the mutation spectrum of BH4 synthesis and regeneration genes is unknown in Russia. Materials and methods: During the 20 years, more than 3,100 patients with PKU and HPA were diagnosed in the DNA diagnostic laboratory of “RCMG ”.A m o n gt h e m ,3 0 patients with BH4 HPA were identi ﬁed. Sanger sequencing of PTS and QDPR genes and custom panel NGS sequencing of all HPA genes and DNAJC12 were performed. Results: In 25 patients “HPA BH4A ”diagnosis was conﬁrmed, 18 different PTS variants were found on 50 alleles. The most common variant were p.Thr106Met (32,0%), p.Asn72Lys (20,0%), p.Arg9His (6,0%). Seven novel variant were found, including the whole PTS gene deletion. In 4 patients “HPA BH4C ”diagnosis was conﬁrmed, 5 different QDPR variants were found on 8 alleles. Three of them were not previously reported. Threepatients were homozygous and one compound heterozy  gous. In addition, one patient with DOPA responsive dystonia and homozygous variant с.524С>А (p. Ala175Asp) in SPR gene was identi ﬁed. Conclusions: The proportion of BH4 HPA in Russia is about 1% of all HPA. PTS gene mutations lead to the BH4  HPA in 86% of cases, QDPR mutations in 14%. The detection of BH4 HPA patients should be performed via differential diagnostic methods. Nowadays the reportedcohort is involved in setting up a pterin method into a practice. P. Gundorova: None.

CVD are theleading cause of morbidity and mortality among patients with diabetes. Our objective was to study the allelic and genotypic frequencies of genetic variants that have shown astrong association with CVD in diabetic patients with and without cardiovascular complications and to assess the additional contribution of genetic variation in determiningthe risk for such complications. We have used CVD Stri  pAssay kit (Vienna Lab) based on polymerase chain reac  tion (PCR) and reverse hybridization. The followingmutations were studied: FV G1691A (Leiden), FV H1299R (R2), Prothrombin G20210A, Factor XIII V34L, β Fibrinogen  455 G A, PAI 1 4G/5G, GPIIIa L33P (HPA  1), MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, ACE I/D, Apo B R3500Q, Apo E2/E3/E4. 36 diabetic patients divided in 2 groups were analyzed: 1) 20 diabetic patients with CVD and2) 16 diabetic patients without CVD. Results: We found higher than population frequency for the following alleles/ genotypes   5.5% for FV Leiden allele, 9.7% for FVR2allele, 38.9% for β Fibrinogen genotype  455G/A, 58.9% for PAI 1 4G allele, 36.1% for ACE D/D genotype. Sta  tistically higher frequency was established for β Fibrinogen  455 G A in the patients with CVD compared to non CVD (55% vs. 18.7%). Conclusion: We detected high frequency ofβ Fibrinogen   455 G/A genotype in diabetic patients, especially in these with CVD.

 Variant nonketotic hyperglycinemia due to novel compound heterozygous LIAS mutations: a case with a branchpoint mutation,P06.28,L. Pölsler,"1, B. Mühlegger1, S. Gang2, P. Traunfellner1,","A. Amberger1, K. Wimmer1, S. Rudnik1, J. Zschocke1 1Institute of Human Genetics; Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria,2Department of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine; Academic Teaching Hospital LKH Feldkirch, Feldkirch, Austria Nonketotic hyperglycinemia (NKH) results from defects in the glycine cleavage system and is characterized by neo natal seizures, psychomotor delay, and elevated glycine levels. It is caused by bi allelic mutations affecting the subunits of the mitochondrial glycine cleavage system(including GLDC ). The term “variant NKH ”refers to the deﬁciency of one of the glycine cleavage cofactors, such as lipoate. This organosulphur compound is also part of theoxoacid dehydrogenase complexes such as PDHC and requires lipoyl synthase ( LIAS gene) for its biosynthesis. NKH was suspected in a boy who presented with neonatal intractable seizures from day 2 and died at 6 weeks of age. Blood and CSF glycine concentrations were elevated, lactate was normal. Massive parallel sequencing showed heterozygosity for the known GLDC mutation c.2316 1G>A and the nonsense mutation c.985A>T, p.(Lys329*) in LIAS . Additionally, a novel intronic variant c.551 24A>T affecting a predicted branch point in LIAS intron 5 was found. Analysis of mRNA transcripts in lymphocytes of the heterozygous LIAS c.551 24A>T carrier father showed retention of the 82 bp intron. Presumably due to nonsense mediated mRNA decay, this splice effect, leading to the premature stopcodon p.(Asp184Glyfs1*), was seen only in a small proportion of the father ’s transcripts. A minigene experi  ment con ﬁrmed this effect in the majority of the minigene transcripts. This case report represents the 6th patient with variant NKH due to bi allelic LIAS mutations. It illustrates the difﬁculties encountered by identi ﬁcation of single hetero  zygous coding or splice donor/acceptor variants in more than one candidate gene for a recessive condition. L.

JAK2 gene variants serves as diagnostic criteria for polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET) and primarymyelo ﬁbrosis (PMF), while CALR gene variants   for ET and PMF. The aim of the study was to summarize molecular data and utility of CALR gene indel testing in a clinical MPN cohort. Material and methods : In the study 354 patients with MPN were included. All patients were tested for JAK2 p. V617F variant by qPCR and CALR gene indels by ﬂuorescent fragment length analysis (PCR FFLA). Sanger sequencing was performed to con ﬁrm and identify pre  viously detected variants. Results :JAK2 gene variant p.V617F was identi ﬁed in 208 (58.8%) patients.

In a large study of Turkish consanguineous families we identi ﬁed a family with 3 affected siblings (two males 11 and 8 y.o. and one 5y.o. female) all presenting with intellectual disability, severe verbal de ﬁciency (2 3 words), short stature (<3p), delayed walking, seizures and dysmorphic features including malarhypoplasia, broad nose, short philtrum, wide mouth and full lips. After excluding aneuploidies exome sequencing revealed a novel frameshift insertion c.475_478dup, p.(Lys160Ilefs*2) in the LARP7 gene. LARP7 is a negative transcriptional regulator of polymerase II, acting by means of the 7SK RNP system. Frameshifting variants in LARP7 have been associated with Alazami Syndrome (OMIM 615071) characterized by ID, severe growth restriction and characteristic facialdysmorphisms. To date, 15 patients were reported. By comparing this family with the previously reported cases, we strengthen the key features of AS: ID, growth restriction,and highlight the facial features including malar hypoplasia, broad nose, full lips and teeth abnormalities. Interestingly, no cases with seizures were described, so far. As we failedto identify in exome sequencing any variant in seizure associated genes and all three siblings are concordant we wondered if this symptom is part of the clinical spectrum ofAS. Although we cannot exclude an undetected cause independent of LARP7 , we propose that seizures are a so far undescribed symptom associated with Alazami Syndrome. E. Gumuslu: None. K. Karaer: None. E.

Application of novel “genotype  ﬁrst”diag  nosis is of great importance to the patient ’s health and medical outcome due to higher rates of chromosomal abnormalities detection compared to conventional kar yotyping and multiple ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁca  tion (MLPA) analysis. Materials and methods: The aCGH technique was used to determine the genetic background of developmental abnormalities in a 8 year old female Macedonian patient. The blood derived DNA sample was analyzed using theAffymetrix ®CytoScanTM 750K Array (Applied Biosys  tems) that includes 550 k non polymorphic and 200 k SNP markers. The data were interpreted by using ChromosomeAnalysis Suite (ChAS) Software (v4.0). Results: The patient showed the following clinical conditions: motor delay, deafness, lack of concentrationand several dysmorhological features (blepharophymosis, telecanthus, narrow palpebral ﬁssures, wide nose, low set ears, small mouth and arched eyebrows). Noteworthy, thegirl was operated from atrial septal defect and was previously diagnosed with Ohdo Sy. Karyotyping results revealed a normal female 46, XX karyotype, while theMLPA analysis for microdeletions was negative. The aCGH analysis detected a pathological microduplication occurring at the 10q26.3 cytoregion (787 kb, 26 genes included), aswell as mosaic presence of 3 copies of the Xq26.3q28 cytoregion (15,864 kb, 115 genes included). Conclusion: The present chromosomal abnormalities detected by aCGH analysis could be responsible for the developmental delay of the patient, considering their patholo  gical expression according to ClinVar database.

Only ﬁve patients have been reported to date and clinical data remains very scarce. We report a new patientwith COL4A3BP  related intellectual disability (ID) aiming to contribute to the recognition of this condition. Materials and methods: Clinical data was collected from the patient ’s medical records and compared with previous reports from scienti ﬁc literature and databases. Results: A 5 year old girl with unremarkable family history, pregnancy and delivery, presented with postnatal microcephaly, axial hypotonia, and severe global864 J. del Picchiadevelopmental delay. Short stature and facial dysmorphisms were noted and, at 24 months, she developed generalized seizures. Currently, she does not walk unaided, says only one word, and has poor visual contact and marked stereotypic behavior with bruxism.

These deletions usually containFOXP2 , in which loss of function mutations represent a major cause for speci ﬁc language and speech phenotypes. Recently, a single patient with developmental delay as wellas speech and language impairment carrying a 3.2 Mb deletion in 7q31.2q31.31 excluding FOXP2 was reported. By chromosomal microarray analysis we now identi ﬁed a similar microdeletion in three family members presenting with variable speech, language and neurodevelopmental phenotypes. The index patient presented with normal motormilestones but delayed speech development, reduced com  prehension and an incomplete sentence structure at age 5 years. At age 10 years he attended a school for children withspecial needs and presented with microcephaly, attention deﬁcits and slurred speech. His sister was referred at age 3 years with normal ﬁrst milestones but a delay in speech development. Linguistic testing revealed impairment of all language and speech levels with limited vocabulary and slurred and imprecise pronunciation. The mother hadattended a school focusing on speech and language de ﬁ  ciencies and now presented with slurred speech. Segrega  tion analysis in the healthy, maternal grandparents did notdetect the microdeletion, thus indicating de novo occurrence in the mother.

However, these duplications were concluded as benign variations based on inheritance from health parents. Aim: We report two unrelated patients with ASD, ID and facial dysmorphic features. Methods: Karyotyping, exclusion of CGG triplet repeats expansion in FMR1 and chromosomal microarray (CMA) were performed in both patients after informed consent collecting from their parents. Results: Chromosomal aberration and Fragile X syn  drome were excluded in both. 2q37 duplication including ALPP, ALPPL2, DIS3L2 was revealed by CMA. In patient 1 the duplication was inherited from father. Inheritance was unknown in patient 2. No other clinically relevant CNVs were observed.

We described two unrelated patients with ASD,ID and facial dysmorphia who carried the duplication of 2q37 including DIS3L2 . We suggest that this CNV might cause of abnormal phenotype with variable penetrance. Ofcourse, we cannot exclude a nucleotide level changes which could explain a variable penetrance of 2q37 duplication. Acknowledgment :Supported by MH_CZ_DRO_F  NOL_00098892, IGA_LF_2020_007 Z.

The identi ﬁcation of developmental delay patterns could accelerate the diagnostic of FXS in a population of children with development delay. Methods: We designed an online survey in which FXS patients ’caregivers indicated patients characteristics. We used the Haizea Llevant development scale as a reference ofnormalcy. Time of acquisition was expressed as months old (mo) and for each milestone timing it was calculated the median (M) and P25 and P75 (P25 P75). Results: Fifteen cases were considered for analysis: three females and 12 males. The median age for postnatal diagnosis was 48 mo: 36 mo for males and 72 mo forfemales. Male FXS patients showed a delayed acquisition of early milestones such as cervical control (M ,6mo, 2 12 mo) with normal median time of acquisition of the ﬁrst word (M ,13mo, 11.75 21mo), and delayed acquisition of autonomous walking (M ,22mo, 16.5 24 mo). Given the small number of female FXS in our study, it was notpossible to conclude if females had a characteristic pattern of developmental delay. Conclusions: FXS patients present a biphasic delayed development in the ﬁrst two years of life with an important delay on the acquisition of gross motor skills. Nevertheless, the clinical presentation was highly variable to allow thediscrimination these patients with FXS by their pattern of developmental delay. Notwithstanding, this work bring the attention to the early gross motor skills impairment in FXS,that can be improved with targeted interventions. C. Azevedo Soares: None. D. Gonzaga: None. I.

Zweier1 1Institute of Human Genetics, Friedrich Alexander Univer  sität Erlangen Nürnberg FAU, Erlangen, Germany, 2Department of Pediatrics, University Hospital for Children and Adolescents, Friedrich Alexander Universität Erlan  gen Nürnberg FAU, Erlangen, Germany Autosomal recessive spinocerebellar ataxia type 18 is a rare genetic neurologic disorder. It is caused by homozygous orcompound heterozygous mutations in the GRID2 gene, encoding an ionotropic glutamate receptor. So far, seven affected individuals from three unrelated families have been reported. The disorder is characterized by delayed psycho  motor development, intellectual disability, severely impaired gait due to progressive cerebellar ataxia, ocularmovement abnormalities, and progressive cerebellar atro  phy in brain imaging. By trio exome sequencing, we now identi ﬁed a novel homozygous variant (c.568C>T; p. Gln190*) in GRID2 in a four year old female patient from a consanguineous Iraqi family. Both parents were con ﬁrmed to be heterozygous carriers. The patient was born afteruneventful pregnancy and showed early onset severe delayed psychomotor development. At the age of 4 years, she does not sit, walk or speak and presents with severemuscular hypotonia. Further clinical characteristics are a distinct truncal and appendicular progressive ataxia and binocular vertical nystagmus with a high frequent horizontalcomponent, central hearing loss and incomplete loss of sight. She does not ﬁx objects or interacts with people. She is dystrophic with a weight under the third percentile of thecentral European standard. Eating hair and gnashing of teeth are striking behaviors. In addition, cerebral magnetic reso  nance imaging (MRI) showed cerebellar hypoplasia.

Since then only two novel case reports have been published. We presentAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 867the genotype, phenotype and developmental trajectory of a new patient, and review all previous cases. The 8 year old boy has hypotonia, microcephaly, failure to thrive, severe intellectual disability, absent speech, and seizures. His facial features include prominent upper lip and strabismus. Trio ES identi ﬁed de novo variant Chr2(GRCh37):g.197106886C>T, NM_001348768.1(HECW2):c.3572G>A, p.(Arg1191Gln). The variant has been reported in three previous patients, and is considered causal for the HECW2 syndrome. The pheno type of the patient ﬁts the previous cases; however, he also has a ventricular septum defect, and he neither has abnormal brain MRI ﬁndings nor requires gastrostomy tube feeding. Long term follow up shows regression of motor skills around 12 months, abnormal EEG ﬁndings since 14 months (prompting anti epileptic therapy), and self injurious beha viour and sleep disturbances since 45 months of age. Our analysis (including variants from large studies and databases) indicates that deleterious missense HECW2 variants cluster inexons encoding the HECT domain and its adjacent region (exons 20 29, with residues Arg1191, Arg1330 and Glu1445 being the hotspots), and possibly also the WW2 domain(exons 12 13).

Sixsubgroups of HPMRS were ide ﬁned in which pathogenic mutations affect genes involved in either synthesis (PIGV, PIGW, PIGO, PIGY) or remodeling (PGAP2, PGAP3) ofthe anchor proteins. Material and methods: A two year old girl patient was referred to our genetic clinic for intellectual disability andhypotonia. There was a ﬁrst degree consanguinity between the parents. This patient had microcephaly, facialdysmorphism including upslanting palpebral ﬁssure, bul  bous nose, cleft lip and palate, pectus excavatum, intellectual disability, developmental delay, hypotonia and increased alkaline phosphatase level. One out of three sisters of index patient had similar clinical features. The other family members were healthy. Whole exome sequen cing (WES) was performed to the index patient. Sanger seguencing analysis was used for family segregation analysis. Results: A novel homozygous mutation (c.715_717del TGG; p.Trp239del) of PGAP3 gene was detected with WES analysis in the index patient (NM_033419.5). Familysegregation analysis was performed and bioinformatic tools were used for the evaluation of this novel variant. The same homozygous mutation was noted by sanger seguencinganalysis in her younger sister, who had similar clinical features. Both parents and the other healthy sisters were heterozygous for this mutation. Conclusions: We report e novel homozygous mutation of PGAP3 gene.

There are 72 types of ARIDD described in OMIM. TMEM222 was once described as a candidate gene for ARIDD with moderate intellectual disability, speech delay, mild hypotonia, aggressiveness and body shivering. Materials and methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed using IlluminaTruSeq ®ExomeKit and IDT xGen ®Exome Research Panel on Illumina NextSeq 500. Results: We describe the Caucasian 31 year old men born from consanguineous parents. Birth weight was 4800 g, condition severe. He had infantile spasms when woke upduring ﬁrst 2 8 months. He walks since 3 years with ataxia, speaks few words, understands speech and uses computer. Phenotype: hypotonia, microcephaly, hypothelorism, bignose, short philtrum, big mouth, full lips, gingival hyperplasia, small chin, broad and short distal phalanges, narrow feet with valgus deformity, broad big toe. Hisbrother 11 years old has similar phenotype but with prominent incisors and seizures since birth. He cannot walk and speak. His birth weight was 4700 g. Their healthy sisterhad birth weight 3500 g. WES revealed homozygous splice variant c.539 +2T>C NM_032125 in TMEM222 . Sanger sequencing con ﬁrmed this variant as heterozygous in parents and sister, and homozygous in affected brother. Conclusions: Given the similarity of the phenotype with the previously described, the correspondence of segregationto the autosomal recessive type of inheritance, we suppose this variant to be causative.

Additional clinical fea  tures include dysmorphic features, obesity, musculoskeletal disorders (hypotonia, hypermobility, kyphoscoliosis) andbehavioural problems (autistic spectrum disorders) and afebrile seizures. The underlying cause of the syndrome is constitutive variants in the DNMT3 gene. We present an 11  old boy with recognized Tatton Brown Rahman syndrome and con ﬁrmed variant in the DNMT3 gene. Materials and methods: During molecular diagnostic procedure analysis of FMR1 gene for FRAXA syndrome and panel of 264 genes correlated with autism and mental retardation (NGS) were performed. Results: ForFMR1 gene expansion of CGG repeats was not identi ﬁed. NGS analysis allowed identi ﬁcation of known heterozygotic variant p.Pro904Leu (c.2711C>T) intheDNMT3A . This variant is reported in dbSNP database (rs149095705) and ClinVar Database as likely pathogenic. Molecular analysis of p.Pro904Leu was also performed forproband ’s mother and sister were mutation was not identi ﬁed. Unfortunately the father ’s material was not available for genetic analysis. There is high probability ofde novo character of identi ﬁed variant.

Several ultra rare NDD associated variants in numerousgenes speci ﬁc almost to single families have been identi ﬁed by unbiased next generation sequencing technologies. To determine the genetic component of NDD in a con sanguineous family from Turkey, we have performed SNP  based homozygosity mapping in the family along with whole exome sequencing (WES) in the affected sib pair. The SNP genotyping data generated on two different array chips was combined with PLINK to detect homozygous stretches common to the affected sib pair. The WES data wasﬁltered for rare alleles with predicted pathogenic impact on protein function in the homozygous loci. This collective effort has led us to identify a loss of function variant in NALCN in the homozygous state. Sanger sequencing has con ﬁrmed segregation of this variant with the NDD phenotype in the pedigree. NALCN encodes a member of sodium leak channel complex and is associated with a recessive OMIM phenotype; Hypotonia, infantile, with psychomotor retardation and characteristic facies 1 (MIM:615419) Our study presents the combined analysis of linkage and exome analysis as a powerful and precise tool to diagnose a clinically rare and recessively inherited condition onmolecular level.

Strikingly, recurrent pharyngeal lymphoid hyper  plasia has necessitated 17 surgical procedures; starting at age 15 months old. Her thymus is described as large for her age.Generalized lymphadenopathy / hepatosplenomegaly are absent. She has mild motor and language delay. Current measurements are height 25%, weight 4 kg > 97,5%, headcircumference 97,5%. WES trio detected a de novo nonsense variant in ZBTB7A , NM_015898.3:c.832G>T p.(Glu278*). The variant is not present in gnomAD, and the gene is LoF intolerant (pLI ,0.96; O/e ,0:07) and is predicted to result in NMD. No other SNVs of interest were detected, and a 180k array CGH analysis was unremarkable. Discussion: ZBTB7A (OMIM #605878) encodes the leukemia/lymphoma related factor, LRF ZBTB7A is a candidate gene for some phenotypic features reported inindividuals with microdeletions of chromosome 19p13.3; notably macrocephaly, obesi ty, sleep apnea, umbilical hernia, learning dif ﬁculties and developmental delay (1,2)   all features present in the girl we describe. Ohishi et al. (3) recently reported a boy with macrocephaly, intellectual disability and sleep apnea who had a de novo likely pathogenic heterozygous missense variant in ZBTB7A .

González","Gutierrez Solana, M. Jimémez Legido, V. Soto Insuga, M. Ruiz Falcó, J. García Peñas Hospital Infantil Universitario Niño Jesús, Madrid, Spain Neuronal migration is the key factor in lamination of cer  ebral cortex. At 12th day stage of development neuronal progenitors begin migration. Excitatory neurons are born inthe dorsal ventricular zone and migrate super ﬁcially to the cortical plate. These neurons migrate along the vertical ﬁbers of the radial glia. The layers of the cortex form in an “inside out ”sequence with later born neurons migrating past their predecessors in the cortical plate so that they are more super ﬁcial in their ﬁnal position than earlier born neurons(1). The neuronal migration disorders (NMD) include: lissen  cephaly, periventricular heterotopia, polymicrogyria (PMG)and cortical dysplasias(2). NMD present with: epilepsy, developmental delay (DD), intellectual disability (ID) and other malformation could be associated. Although themajority of this disorders have a genetic base, some environmental causes such as intrauterine infections could cause them(3). Today more than 100 genes have been relatedto NMD (3) including genes related to tubulinopathies (2). We did an observational study of NMD patients seen at the Clinical Genetic clinic from june 2018 until december 2019.We analyzed the results of NGS based genetic studies. Results: 29 patients were studied, the global diagnostic yield was 28%. We were able to detect large deletions usingNGS.

We present a case of a girl (*2016) from the 3 rdgravidity of healthy non con  sanguineous couple (mother *1984, father *1978). Shewas diagnosed a global developmental delay, micro  brachycephaly, severe dysplasia of brainstem and muscle hypertonia. She has a normal female karyotype 46,XXand normal array CGH pro ﬁle arr(1 22,X)x2. She was investigated by targeted NGS by gene panel ClearSeq XT Inherited Disease (Agilent Technologies) containing more than 2700 genes known to cause inherited dis  orders. We detected pathogenic variants in the TSEN54 gene in compound heterozygosity, NM_207346.2:c.[56+2T>G;160C>G];[919G>T]. The parents are healthy heterozygous carriers of these variants, as was con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. Pathogenic variants of theTSEN54 are causative in extremely rare pontocerebellar hypoplasia (PCH) type 2A, 4 and 5. The combination of splicing and missense variants has been describedin only one case of PCH5 so far, resulting in recurrent fetal lethality. Therefore, we suggest the TSEN54 pathogenic variants could have been the cause of pre vious recurrent abortions in the presented family. This case showed the usefulness and effectivity of our mole  cular diagnostics algorit hm enhanced by NGS approa  ches to elucidate the molecular genetic causes in heterogeneous neurodevelopmental disorders.

 Intrafamilial variability of Refsum syndrome,P08.33,"S. Geuer , I. Schwaab, R. König","Bioscientia, Ingelheim, GermanyA consanguine Pakistani couple with two daughters affec","ted by intellectual disability and developmental delay hasbeen investigated by genetic diagnostics. The younger girl has more severe development delay and shows in contrast to her sister microcephaly, craniosynostosis and autisticbehaviour. Whole exome sequencing of the more severe affected sister revealed a homozygous pathogenic variant in PEX5   a gene known to be causative for autosomal recessive Refsum syndrome. Segregation analysis con  ﬁrmed homozygosity of the variant in the other sister and heterozygosity of the parents. Whole exome sequencing didnot detect another potential pathogenic variant. Thus, it can be concluded that the detected PEX5 variant causes a Refsum syndrome with uncharacteristic features and a highintrafamilial variability. S. Geuer: A.

 A further patient with Skraban Deardorff syndrome: Presentation of the clinical and molecular phenotype ofa rare intellectual disability syndrome,P08.35,"A. Busche , M. Vockel, A. Bohring","Institut für Humangenetik, Westfälische Wilhelms Universi","tät, Münster, Germany The Skraban Deardorff syndrome (SKDEAS, OMIM#617616) is a rare genetic condition characterized byintellectual disability, a history of febrile and/or non febrile seizures, and a recognizable facial appearance. SKDEAS is caused by heterozygeous mutations in WDR26 (OMIM*617424) and is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern. To our knowledge only 15 patients have been reported so far. Here we present a 3 year and 3 months old boy with SKDEAS due to the heterozygous de novo mutation c.508G>T; p.(Gly170*) in WDR26 . He has moderate intellectual disability and shows the characteristic facial gestalt comprising prominent forehead, bitemporal narrow  ing, large appearing eyes with rounded palpebral ﬁssures, depressed nasal root, rounded nasal tip, anteverted nares, short philtrum, tended upper lips, full checks, and low setears. He has widely spaced teeth and elongated gums. Since the age of 8 months he has fever/infection associated seizures but needs no permanent medication. In this report we present detailed clinical and molecular data of a new patient with SKDEAS to raise awareness of this clinically recognizable rare intellectual disabilitysyndrome. A. Busche: None.

De novo mutations in CHD3 result in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome (#MIM618205), characterized by global developmental delays and/or intel  lectual disability, speech delay, macrocephaly, hypotoniaand facial dysmorphism. The vast majority (~95%) of pathogenic mutations reported so far are missense muta  tions. Interestingly, CHD3 is predicted to be extremely intolerant for loss of function variance. Non penetrance and/ or variable expressivity has not been reported. Here we describe two cases with seemingly pathogenic, but inher ited, protein truncating variants in CHD3 . In a 4 year old girl with global developmental delay, autism spectrum disorder, severe feeding dif ﬁculties, and facial dysmorphisms, ﬁtting with the spectrum of Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome, whole exome sequencing revealed a nonsense variant, p.(W1217*), in the CHD3helicase domain. The variant was inherited from her healthy mother and grandmother. In a 3 year old boy with developmental delays, pre  dominated by speech delay, another maternally inherited nonsense variant, p.(S1443*), was found. Facially, he resembled the gestalt previously described for SnijdersBlok Campeau syndrome. His mother, in whom the variant872 J. del Picchiawas de novo, had macrocephaly and was otherwise unaffected. These two cases exemplify that protein truncating variants inCHD3 may result in reduced penetrance and/or variable expressivity. We are currently collecting more families with inherited CHD3 variants to enhance our understanding of disease penetrance in Snijders Blok Campeau syndrome. Additionally, we will perform functional studies of these CHD3 variants to increase our insight in the underlyingpathogenic mechanisms. J. van der Spek: None. J. den Hoed: None. L.

We report on two brothers with non speci ﬁc DD and muscular hypotonia. The older, nine year old brother showed motor develop  mental delay, speech abnormalities, intelligence in the lower average range (total IQ 89), asthenic build with aborderline tall stature, long ﬁngers and toes, hyperextensible joints, and mild facial dysmorphism. The younger, two  year old brother showed motor and speech developmentaldelay and a similar facial gestalt. Family history comprised a cousin (son of the mother ’s sister) with global develop  mental delay (total IQ 50), muscular hypotonia and EEGabnormalities. An X linked ID syndrome was suspected. Whole exome sequencing (WES) of both brothers wasperformed within the TRANSLATE NAMSE care project. The resulting variants were prioritized using phenotype and image data (PEDIA / Prioritization of Exome Data by Image Analysis). A probably pathogenic hemizygous variant c.410A>G;p.(Asp137Gly) in the SMS gene was detected in both brothers and subsequently also in the affected cousin.The mothers are heterozygous carriers of the SMS variant.

Recently, X linked mental retardation 33 syndrome (MRXS33; MIM#300966) caused by patho genic variants in TAF1 was described, featuring intellectual disability (ID), hypotonia, neurological abnormalities, and dysmorphic features. To our knowledge, 36 missense and asplice site pathogenic variants have been reported so far. Case Presentation: A 10 year old boy with develop  mental delay was referred for genetic evaluation. He wasthe only child of non consanguineous parents with no relevant family history. Atrial septal defect, restrictive muscle ventricle septal defect, mild Ebstein malformation,and axial hypotonia, were documented in the neonatal period. He evolved with moderate to severe ID, limited speech (barely 20 words), hypertonic lower limbs, ataxicgait, midline stereotypies, self injurious behavior, and severe strabismus (surgically corrected). He had no autonomy for daily activities. Cerebral MRI was normal.On physical examination, he presented slight facial asymmetry, downslanted palpebral ﬁssures, sunken eyes, bulbous nose, downturned corners of the mouth, micro gnathia, and deep plantar creases.

One of the receptors of this pathway is encoded by TGFBR2 (MIM#190182) gene. Heterozygous pathogenic variants in TGFBR2 are the cause of Loeys  Dietz syndrome 2 (LDS2; MIM#610168), a disorder which mainly affects the connective tissue. Here we report a novel splice site variant in TGFBR2 gene and present its effect on mRNA level. Materials and methods : DNA of the proband was analyzed by next generation sequencing gene paneltechnology. In order to elucidate the pathogenicity of the identi ﬁed splice site variant in the TGFBR2 gene, total blood mRNA of the proband was isolated, template cDNAwas synthesized and quantitative PCR using TaqMan gene expression assay designed for TGFBR2 gene was performed. Results :TGFBR2 gene acceptor splice site variant NC_000003.12(NM_001024847.2):c.1600 2A>G was detected in proband ’s DNA. Using different bioinformatics tools, this variant was predicted to be pathogenic and affecting mRNA splicing. Quantitative expression analysis of several TGFBR2 exons revealed that c.1600 2A>G causes loss of 5 ’part of exon 8   the last exon of analyzed transcript, presumably leading to a frameshift and a loss of part of Ser/Thr kinase domain and C terminus of TGFBR2protein.Conclusions : According to the proposed analysis results, splice site variant NC_000003.12(NM_001024847.2): c.1600 2A>G in TGFBR2 gene disrupts mRNA splicing leading to a truncated protein and causing LDS2.

Only six previous patients have been reported (see Assoum et al PMID: 30244534). Three of the previous patients were noted to have proteinuria and one (a patientwith epileptic encephalopathy) was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome. Case Presentation : We describe an 8 year old boy with mild intellectual disability who was found to have proteinuria at 2 years of age. Renal biopsy ﬁndings were suggestive of focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Theproteinuria persisted and the patient ’s kidney function declined despite treatment. He had a renal transplant at 7 years of age. Prior to the transplant he had three generalizedseizures which were controlled with sodium valproate. Trio  based whole genome sequencing as part of the 100,000 Genomes Project found a de novo heterozygous frameshift mutation in TRIM8 (NM_030912.2) c.1198_1220del, p. (Tyr400ArgfsTer2).

Bene1,2","1University of Pecs, Medical School, Clinical Center, Department of Medical Genetics, Pecs, Hungary, Pecs,Hungary, 2Szentagothai Research Center, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary, Pecs, Hungary Introduction: Wieacker Wolff syndrome is an X linked recessive neurodevelopmental disorder presenting e.g. intellectual disability, developmental delay, characteristicfacial features and contractures of the feet. Relatively few cases have been reported so far with high clinical hetero  geneity, especially amongst heterozygous females. Thedisease is caused by mutations in the ZC4H2 gene, altering a zinc ﬁnger domain containing protein with four cysteine and two histidine residues. Materials and methods: Whole genome sequencing was performed in a 5 year old male patient to identify the disease causing mutation. Libraries were prepared usingTruSeq TMDNA PCR Free HT Library Prep Kit (Illumina) and sequenced on NovaSeq 6000 platform (Illumina) with 150bp paired end chemistry. The detected mutation wasvalidated by Sanger sequencing. Results: A recurrent hemizygous missense mutation (c.593 G>A) in ZC4H2 gene was discovered in our patient and not in his parents. This mutation leads to an arginine  glutamine amino acid change and so far it was found only in one large family. However, our patient shares commonhallmarks of the syndrome with the previously reported cases, the unique feature is that he does not present seizure and he has a severe speech delay. Discussion: Intra  and interfamiliar phenotypic variability is a well known phenomenon in several Mendelian disorders. Among patients with Wieacker Wolff syndromeonly one recurrent mutation was reported in the ZC4H2 gene until now. Here we report another recurrent ZC4H2gene mutation with diverse neurologic features.

Kubisch1 1University Medical Center Hamburg Eppendorf, Ham  burg, Germany,2Technical University Dresden, Dresden, Germany Introduction: Aicardi Goutières syndrome (AGS) is an inﬂammatory disease associated with a broad phenotypic spectrum although an infantile sub acute encephalopathyrepresents the classical manifestation. Mutations in seven genes have been identi ﬁed causing monogenic AGS: TREX1, ADAR, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C,SAMHD1, IF1H1 . The majority of patients carry biallelic mutations, however for speci ﬁc variants in ADAR, TREX1 andIF1H1 a dominant effect has been described. Case report: We report on a boy presenting with muscular hypotonia and global developmental delay at the age of 6 months, who further developed slow regression, secondarymicrocephaly and movement abnormalities. A brain MRI revealed a leukencephalopathy with severe hypomyelination of cerebral white matter. Blood interferon signature showedthe characteristic pattern of an interferonopathy type 1. Genetic results: Whole exome sequencing in the index and his healthy unrelated parents identi ﬁed a maternally inherited recurrent mutation in RNASEH2B (p.Ala177Thr) and a paternally inherited very likely pathogenic variant in ADAR (p.Arg892Cys). Neither a second coding variant in these two genes nor other variants explaining the phenotype could be detected. Genome wide CNV analysis did not show a relevant CNV, in particular not in AGS associated genes.RNA analysis from skin ﬁbroblasts veri ﬁed both variants in a heterozygous state but could not detect a second aberration affecting the RNASEH2B orADAR transcripts. Discussion: The patient reported here is affected by classical AGS. Extended genetic analysis revealed com  bined heterozygous mutations in RNASEH2B andADAR as the most probably cause of disease strongly suggesting a digenic inheritance of AGS in this pedigree.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 875M.

So it ’s important, to identify the predictors of relapse of alcohol drinking. To the predictors belong among others alcohol craving, which in some patients is the strongly connectedwith hunger before meal. It is consider that polymorphisms of COMT and DRD2 genes are associated with increase of alcohol drinking. Aim of study was evaluation of connec tion, feeling of alcohol craving and hunger in patients with alcohol dependence with polymorphism of DRD2 (c.2137G>A) and COMT (c. 472G>A). Material and Methods: Studied 184 patients during hospitalization due to alcohol dependence and 99 people with control group. In study, used the scales: PACS, scaleof hunger before meals and also molecular testing of COMT and DRD2 polymorphism. Results: Patients without COMT polymorphism, but with polymorphism of DRD2 (genotype G/A) felt high values of alcohol craving, which did not decrease during 4 weeks of therapy (7.18 vs. 7.00; p>0.05). At the same time, patientsfelt strongly hunger, which did not decrease during 4 weeks of therapy (13 vs. 11; p>0.05). The observation, suggest, that it can be extracted, based on the tested polymorphism,group of patients who feel chronic and co existing alcohol craving and hunger, and this patients have got risk of relapse alcohol drinking or nutrition disorders. Conclusions: The polymorphism of DRD2 can be connected with the strongly alcohol craving and hunger.The investigation was ﬁnanced by grant of Poland ’s National Health Program for 2016 2020 (no. 74/44/3.4.3/ 18/DEA).

One month before, he had two focal clonic seizures predominantly on the left side of the body, which led to hospitalization. The family history revealed no epilepsy orother relevant neurological or genetic diseases. An MRI scan of the brain revealed a severe myelination defect with white matter abnormalities. Genetic diagnostic workupincluded: cytogenetic analysis, array CGH and NGS based panel diagnostics for familial focal epilepsies, extended regarding GFAP. NGS identi ﬁed a likely pathogenic mutation in GFAP (c.235C>G (p.Arg79Gly) hetero  zygous). To our knowledge this speci ﬁc mutation has been reported in only one patient suffering from Alexanderdisease (AxD) (Gorospe et al., 2002). AxD is a very rare neurodegenerative disease which belongs to the leukody  strophies. Patients with AxD have unspeci ﬁc symptoms like progressive motor and intellectual retardation, devel  opmental regression and multiple other neurological symptoms including seizures. In most cases gain of func tion mutations in GFAP encoding the glial ﬁbrillary acidic protein underlie this disorder, which result in the accu  mulation of the variant protein in astrocytes, then calledRosenthal ﬁbers. The exact cellular pathogenesis remains unknown. Only about 500 cases of AxD have been reported worldwide. Survival time depends on the age atonset of AxD, a median of 14 years was found in a larger cohort (Prust et al., 2011).

Chromosomal microarray analyses (CMA) has offered a high detection rate of small and large CNVs associated with ASD, and ledto discovery of new autism genes. We report on the results of chromosomal CMA investigation in a group of ASDs patients. Eighty patients were referred to our laboratory forgenetic testing with ASDs as part of a broad phenotype including ID or other clinical features. A complete clinical evaluation was performed with focus on psychiatric exam ination and psychological evaluation with speci ﬁc ASDs tests (ADOS, ADI R). Array CGH completed with kar  yotyping, FISH and qPCR tests were performed. A total of21 pathological CNVs (14 deletions and 7 duplications), with a median length of 3.7 Mb were detected in 17 patients. The involved genomic regions overlap 550 OMIMgenes. Besides well described syndromic regions associated with ASDs (e.g. deletions of 1q21.1, 22q13.3, 22q11.2, MBD5; Xq28 duplication), other genomic regions, rarelyreported in patients with ASDs were identi ﬁed (deletion of 8p11.2p21.2, 9q34.1, 9p13, duplication of 7p22.2p22.1 , CHRNA7) ; thus having the potential to reveal new ASD genes.

Fteeh","Loma Linda University, School of Medicine, LOMA LINDA,","CA, United States Introduction: Beta propeller protein associated neurode  generation (BPAN) is a neurodegeneration with brain iron accumulation disorder. BPAN is very rare, with few than 60 cases reported to date in which the vast majority of cases arefemale and sporadic, resulting from a de novo mutation in the WDR45 gene located at Xp11.23. Here we report a new case of BPAN in a male. Case Description: This a 7 years old adoptive boy with history of autism, developmental delay, and seizures. He was not able to walk until age of 4 and nonverbal. He wasdiagnosed with Lennox Gastaut syndrome. EEG (during the sleep) showed frequent to abundant high to very high voltage sharp, spike and slow wave discharges present inright and left hemisphere. The brain MRI indicated prominent mineralization of the globus pallidi and sub  stantia nigra considering iron accumulation or mitochon drial disorder. Result: The initial workup of chromosome microarray was negative, the subsequent brain iron accumulation genepanel reported as WDR45, X linked, c.577C>T (p. Gln193*), zygosity (indeterminate, 46% allele fraction), pathogenic. Discussion/Conclusion: BPAN is phenotypically similar in both male and female which is characterized by clustered spasm, hypsarrhythmia patterns on EEG and developmentaldelay or regress. The similarity in both genders was explained by somatic mosaicism in surviving males and germline or somatic mutations in females, as well asskewing of X chromosome inactivation. Only a few male cases were reported and this is a new male case with a novel mosaic mutation and presenting with characteristic clinicalfeatures. H. Wang: None. G. Fteeh: None. E",2020

It affects about 1% of the world population and its estimated heritability is around 70%, similar to Schizophrenia. Materials and methods: A large autosomal dominant BP family with eleven affected subjects was included in the study. Mental health of seven family members wasascertained by clinical observation and by the use of speciﬁc tests. Exome sequencing was performed in all members. Variants prioritization was performed on the basisof the frequency (<5%), evidence of pathogenicity and association with BP. Results: Three members, the female proband, her mother and his maternal uncle, were diagnosed with BP and four members (two proband ’s sisters and two proband ’s male cousins) were categorized as healthy subjects. Exomeanalysis revealed one single variant that met the above given criteria present in all three affected members and in none of the healthy ones. It is a missense variant, absent incontrols (Exome Sequencing Project or 1000 Genomes Project). Multiple lines of computational evidence support a deleterious effect of the variant (CADD 35). The mutatedgene encodes for a protein involved in cell motility and extracellular matrix remodeling. A recent study revealed that this protein is downregulated in plasma samples of alarge cohort of patients with mood disorder and its expression was reduced in a C. elegans model of Alzheimer ’s disease. Conclusions: We were able to identify a gene that likely contributed to BP in our family. M.F. Rossi: None. D. Lopergolo: None. M.A. Trusso: None. E. Benetti: None. C. Fallerini: None. S.

" RASSF10 ,a new gene associated to hereditary forms of Bipolar Disorder?E. Dámaso 1, A. Culiáñez Casas2, I. Lara Espejo2,",P09.11,"M. Castillejo1, A. Castillejo2, M. García Escudero2,",J. Soto2,"1Elche University Hospital   FISABIO, Elche, Spain,2Elche University Hospital, Elche, Spain Introduction: Bipolar disorder (BD) is a complex psy  chiatric condition with high heritability. Extended familieswith high prevalence of BD provide an opportunity to identify novel risk genes. We present ﬁndings from whole exome sequencing (WES) obtained from a Spanish familywith high density of BD cases and dominant autosomal pattern of inheritance. Materials and  Methods: Blood DNA was obtained from 8 family members: ﬁve patients diagnosed of BD, another patient with other mental disorder and two healthy individuals. WES was performed using SureSelect Human AllExonV6 +UTR (AgilentTechnologies) libraries and sequencing on Illumina NovaSeq6000. Alignment and variant calling was performed by SureCall and variantﬁltering by a custom pipeline for cohort analyses on Alissa Interpret softwares (AgilentTechnologies). Results: The total size of captured region was 90Mb. An average of 87% of the target regions had 30X coverage or better. The within family association of rare coding and splice site variants with predictable loss of functionpresent in cases and absent in controls was investigated. We found an unreported stopgain candidate variant (NM_001080521.3:c.161C>A) at RASSF10 gene, co seg  regating with BD (p ,0.036). RASSF10 plays an important role in regulating embryonic neurogenesis. It is expressed in normal brain tissue and epigenetically inactivated in braintumors. These evidences might suggest an important role of RASSF10 in normal brain function. Conclusions: RASSF10 could be a new candidate gene associated to BD, although further studies are needed to be validated. New associated BD genes could shed light on understanding the molecular basis of mental disorders anddeﬁning possible targets for new treatments. E. Dámaso: None. A. Culiáñez Casas: None. I.

We report on the results of a study focused on diagnosis and clinical management of BMs in a Romanian pediatric population. One hundred and twentypatients with BMs and complex phenotype were selected from those referred for developmental delay and/or epilepsy, between 2010 2019, to our departments. General clinicalexamination, neurologic, dysmorphologic, psychiatric/psy  chologic evaluations and brain imaging studies were per  formed for all the children. Genetic investigations includedarray based comparative genomic hybridization (Agilent Technologies), and classical and molecular cytogenetics. Gyration anomalies, corpus callosum defects, cerebellarmalformations, and heterotopia, isolated or in different com  binations, associated with complex clinical presentations were detected in our patient group. Genomic imbalances, 4 dele tions and 3 duplications, were detected in 7 patients. Syn  dromic regions (17p13.3, 1q21.1, 1q43 q44, 22q11.2) were prevalent in our study group; however, some of these regionsare known to be clinically heterogeneous, thus our patients might contribute to further delineation of the phenotypic spectrum. In our study group, chromosomal defects weredetected with a high incidence in patients with BMs as part of complex phenotypes. Epileptic seizures and/or developmental delay were the most common clinical features. Brain imagingand genetic studies were instrumental in the diagnostic algo  rithm, with impact on prognosis and genetic counselling of these cases.

Most of them are extremely rare and therefore, poorly studied, dif ﬁcult to diagnose and symptomatically treated. Introduction of next  generation sequencing in clinical practice provides a fast and effective decision for precise genetic diagnosis. Materials and methods: We performed whole exome sequence (WES) to search for disease causing variants in 13 patients with complex clinical phenotypes involvingcerebellar ataxia and one or more of the following symptoms: spasticity, peripheral neuropathy, epilepsy, dysmorphic features, intellectual disability. Results: WES data analysis led to the identi ﬁcation of the potentially disease causing variants in 10 families. They include ﬁve novel and four already known pathogenic variants in the SACS, PNPLA6, PRNP, SCN8A, SPG7, CoQ8A andKIF1A genes. After additional genetic analysis and thorough patients ’phenotyping we were able to con ﬁrm genetic diagnosis in 9 families. Conclusions: Our study enriches genetic and clinical databases with novel genetic variants and clinical cases ofseveral rare genetic disorders that will help to delineate their molecular mechanisms. It added a new spot to the geographic distribution worldwide of the spastic ataxia ofCharlevoix Saguenay that has been previously limited to a speciﬁc geographic region.

 A novel mutation of GDAP1 associated with severe form of Charcot Marie Tooth disease,P09.14,N. BENSLIMANE,"1, F. Miressi1, C. Magdelaine1,2,","P. Faye1, F. Sturtz1,2, F. Favreau1,2, A. Lia1,2 1EA6309 Neuropathie périphérique et Maintenance Myéli  nique, Limoges, France,2Laboratoire de Biochimie et Génétique Moléculaire CHU DUPUYTREN, Limoges,France Introduction: Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) is the most common hereditary neuropathy with a prevalence of 1/ 2500; also known as sensory motor neuropathy. There are several forms of CMT which are differentiated by theirmode of transmission (recessive, dominant, autosomal or X  linked), and their electrophysiological aspect (demyelinat  ing or axonal forms). Currently, more than 90 genes areinvolved in CMT. Material and Methods: A 47 year old patient presenting CMT disease was sampled with peripheral blood collectedin EDTA tubes after giving her informed consent. Genomic DNA was extracted by standard methods. Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) strategy was performed using a 92 genescustom panel designed for CMT and associated neuropa  thies diagnosis. Results: The patient was a 47 year old woman, present  ing a severe demyelinating form of CMT disease. The disease onset was in early childhood with a loss of walking around the age of 11 and since then a wheelchairdependence. Molecular biology analysis highlighted the presence of a new GDAP1 mutation, never described to date. This mutation, c.165T>G, located on exon 2, waspresented in the homozygous state and leads to the replacement of an aspartic acid in position 55 by a glutamic acid (p.Asp55Glu) and it is predicted pathogenic by twoprediction softwares. Splicing involvement is underinvestigation. Asymptomatic parents presented the GDAP1 mutation in the heterozygous state. Conclusion: The homozygous c.165T>G detected in GDAP1 in our patient is likely responsible for her CMT disease. This result is important in terms of diagnosis for molecular biologists and geneticists. N. Benslimane: None. F. Miressi: None. C. Magdelaine: None. P. Faye: None. F. Sturtz: None. F. Favreau: None.

Bus3 1Praxis für Humangenetik, Tuebingen, Germany,2Medi  cover Human Genetics Berlin Westend MVZ, Berlin, Germany,3Humangenetik Tübingen, Tuebingen, Ger  many Cofﬁn Siris syndrome (CSS) is a rare genetic disorder characterized mainly by developmental delay, intellectualdisability and characteristic fa cial features. Hypoplasia or absence of the ﬁfthﬁnger and toe nails are most common in affected individuals. Until now, ten responsible genesfor CSS have been identi ﬁed. Recently, de novo variants in the gene SOX4 were identi ﬁed in four patients with typical features of CSS, particularly ﬁfthﬁnger clin  odactyly (Zawerton et al., 2019). This new CSS type 10 is characterized by intellectual disability, microcephaly and facial abnormalities. SOX4 belongs to a family of SRY  related transcription factors, which are playing a key role in multiple developmental pathways. Expression studies showed that SOX4 is highly expressed during neurogen  esis. All four pathogenic SOX4 variants identi ﬁed before were located within the SOX family speci ﬁcH M G domain of the protein, which is crucial for DNA binding.Here we report on a mildly affected female patient car  rying the de novo variant c.278T>A; p.Leu93Gln in the SOX4 gene, which is also located in the HMG domain.She could sit at the age of 4 months and started walking on his own with 15 months. She had delayed speech devel  opment and learning disability, was restless and agitated,and was diagnosed with ADHD at the age of 8 years. At the age of 21, she presented with mild dysmorphic features (e.g. long face; deep set, dysmorphic ears; low palpepralﬁssures; diffuse inserted eyebrows; wide mouth; long ﬁngers; slight brachydactyly of the ﬁfthﬁngers; broad big toes) and displayed anxiety and a lack of motivation.

 Clinical features of three familial cases of Neuronal Intranuclear Inclusion Disease (NIID),P09.18,"H. Furuya , Y. Miyamoto, T. Furushima, S. Ohtsuru,","Y. Morita, Y. Osaki","Kochi Medical School, Kochi, Japan Background: Neuronal intranuclear inclusion disease (NIID)(MIM 603472) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by eosinophilic intranuclear inclusions inneuronal cells. Such inclusions are also found in non neu  ronal cells. The clinical features and pathological ﬁndings in patients with NIID are highly varied. Here, we present threefamilial NIID cases accompanied with parkinsonism, which is not so common in this disorder. Objective: Cases: All cases are adult onset NIID with Parkinsonism with dementia and severe psychosis. Results: In MRI imaging, diffuse cerebral atrophy was observed in all cases. High intensity of the cortico medullary junction in diffusion weighted imaging (DWI), which is characteristic ﬁndings in NIID, was seen in all NIID. In neurological examination, all NIID showedlaterality or severely increased Pulmomental Re ﬂex (PMR). Ante mortem diagnosis was made by identi ﬁcation of intranuclear inclusions with skin biopsy in all NIID.Neuroimaging diagnosis for usual Parkinsonism shows normal with DAT scan and MIBG scintigraphy. Conclusion: Intranuclear accumulation of abnormal proteins and/or dysfunction of protein degradation might underlie in the pathogenesis of NIID. However, NIID is considered as a heterogeneous disease entity andshows various clinical features. Although dementia is common in NIID, Parkinsonism is also often observed in this disorder.

 The Complex Molecular Basis of Dystonias in a Turkish Cohort,P09.20,S. Tekgul,"1, G. Simsir1, Z. Yapici2, A. Basak1","1Koç University, Istanbul, Turkey,2Istanbul University, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Dystonias are neurological conditions in which abnormal movements or postures are observed, thatare caused by sustained or intermittent muscle contractions. The major feature is over activity of muscles required for movement. Dystonias can clinically vary in their manifes  tation and severity affecting all age groups and leading to considerable disability and impaired quality of life. With its high throughput capacity and proportionally low cost, nextgeneration sequencing is now being extensively used in research/diagnostic settings to determine novel genes and mutations associated with dystonias. Materials and methods: Genomic DNA was isolated from whole blood. Whole exome sequencing (WES), followed by family segregation analysis using Sangersequencing, was performed on 21 probands with hetero  genous dystonia phenotypes. The pathogenicity of the variant was scored by the prediction tools DANN, GERP,SIFT and MutationTaster. Results: WES revealed 10 dystonia genes with varying frequencies and 12 variants, 4 of which are novel (Table 1).The diagnostic rate is 62%.

" Genetic study of early onset parkinsonism in Thailand:targeted next generation sequencingAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 881P. Phowthongkum Faculty of Medicine, Bangkok, ThailandBackground : Early onset Parkinson disease (EOPD) is deﬁned by PD with the onset age of less than 50 years. Patients may present predominantly with lower limb dys tonia rather than typical resting tremor in late onset patients which is the challenge in making the diagnosis in youngerpatients. Many patients apparently are responded dramati cally with dopamine replacement but developed early motor complications, in contrast, to consistently respond to thetreatment in DOPA Responsive Dystonia (DSD). Molecular diagnosis, therefore, helps in diagnosis EOPD, facilitates genetic counseling and treatment customization. Methods : A total of 51 patients with early onset parkinsonism from 49 families referred to Neurogenetics Center at King Chulalongkorn Memorial Hospital. Genetictest was performed with targeted next generation sequen cing panel containing 34 genes causing PD or dystonia. Results : Eleven patients with EOPD (21.5%) were found to carry likely pathogenic or pathogenic variants in GBA (5/ 51),PARK2 (4/51 from 2 families), PINK1 (2/51 from 2 families). Familial EOPD (2 families) harbored 3 differentpathogenic variants in PARK2 (one family with homo zygous deletion of exon7 and the other family with one heterozygous deletion of exon 5 and one heterozygousmissense variant). They all have onset of less than 30 years. Conclusions: Ourﬁndings add an understanding of the genetic architecture of EOPD in Southeast Asia. Targetednext generation sequencing is an effective and affordable method for making genetic diagnosis for PD. Heterozygous GBA deﬁnitely increases risk of EOPD in the Southeast Asian population. Individual seeking carrier testing includes GBA should be informed about the risk of parents to develop neurological disorders.",P09.21,P. Phowthongkum: None.,E,,2020

However, despite a compre  hensive molecular analysis, a molecular diagnosis can onlybe established in 50% of cases. The aim of this project is to use whole exome sequencing to determine the molecular etiology of EEs in molecularly undiagnosed patients with apedigree suggestive of an autosomal recessive single gene disease. Three EEs families, having either consanguineous parents of an affected individual and/or having more thanone affected offspring were enrolled in the project. Prior to this project, the families had been evaluated using a next generation sequencing panel which included 16 EE genes;however, no molecular diagnosis could be established. In 5 cases from the 3 selected EEs families in our study genetic882 J. del Picchiaetiology was investigated using WES, with segregation analysis then being performed using Sanger sequencing. All patients in the study group had infantile onset epileptic seizures and severe developmental delay.

Matías Guiu Guía1,2 1Institute of Neuroscience, Health Research Institute of San Carlos Clinical Hospital, Madrid, Spain,2Neurology department, San Carlos Clinical Hospital, Madrid, Spain, 3NIMGenetics, Madrid, Spain Introduction : Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an in ﬂammatory autoimmune disease of the central nervous system (CNS)which causes demyelination and axonal damage. MS is considered a polygenic disease where genetic risk factors can be more likely detected in familial MS. The aim of thestudy is to analyse genetic variations of signalling pathways and genes related to MS. Materials and methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) with Ion Proton technology was performed in 138 individuals from 23 families including at least 2 MS patients. We compared patients with MS, patients with otherautoimmune disease and healthy individuals. Signalling pathways and genes related to MS were analysed. Variant ﬁltering and prioritization were performed with an own pipeline using criteria to include relevant and functional variants associated to MS. Results: In our cohort, some variants matched criteria to be considered as a possibly pathogenic variable. The associated genes ( NOD2 ,NLRP7 ,CYP24A1 ,TNFAIP3 , TNFRSF13B ,LRP2 ,CIITA ,ACE) were mainly involved in the immune system as well as in vitamin D regulation.These genes have been previously reported in literature associated to MS. Conclusions: These ﬁndings support the idea that familial MS could present a genetic background. The variants found in this research require further study and could lead to a better understanding of MS. L. Torre Fuentes: None. J. Matías Guiu Antem: None. V. Pytel: None. P.

 Spontaneous rescue of a FMR1 repeat expansion,P09.30,"E. Erbs , M. Rasmussen, D. L. Lildballe","Department of Clinical Genetics, Lillebælt Hospital, Vejle,","Denmark Introduction: Fragile X syndrome (FXS) is usually caused by CGG repeat expansion in the 5 ’UTR region of the Fragile X Mental Retardation 1 ( FMR1 ) gene of >200 repeats causing methylation of the region. Rare cases are caused by pathogenic variants within the coding region. Materials and methods: Genetic testing for FXS was requested in a male infant born to a mother known to harbour a FXS full mutation (>200 CGG repeats). Thematernal grandmother was a carrier of a FXS premutation. Analysis of CGG repeats of the FMR1 gene was performed using PCR, RP PCR, and Sanger sequencing. STR markerswere used in linkage analysis. Results: An unexpected very short PCR fragment was detected in the male infant. Subsequent Sanger sequen cing con ﬁrmed an 88 bp deletion (c.1 156_1 69del) in hemizygous form. The deletion included all CGG  repeats and ﬂanking sequences. However, the deletion did not include FMR1 exons. Linkage analysis revealed that the allele, which has b een expanded in the mother and the maternal grandmother, was passed on to the maleinfant. Conclusion: Grønskov et al. previously reported a ~150 bp deletion of all CGG repeats and ﬂanking sequences in a normal female patient, who was hemizygous for the FMR1 gene due to a large deletion of the other X chromosome. Western blot showed that the FMR1 protein level was unaffected. This reported deletion comprises the deletion detected in the male infant. Based on this report, we expect our patient to be unaffected. In conclusion, a male infant was rescued from FXS by a spontaneous deletion. E. Erbs: None. M. Rasmussen: None. D.L.

The present case control study aims to broaden the understanding of the molecularpathogenesis of FTD by whole exome sequencing (WES) of pooled DNA samples. Materials and methods: The analysis was undertaken on 140 FTD patients grouped in two DNA pools (original and replicate) and a control DNA pool of 100 age matched healthy subjects. The WES was performed in BGIGenomics at a mean coverage of at least 250 x per sample and the obtained variants were ﬁltered by stringent criteria. Results: The number of biallelic autosomal variants found in the control DNA pool is 180 692. The original and replicate patient DNA pool contain 18 003 and 21 555 variants not found in the control pool, respectively. Amongthese variants 2344 are found in both patient pools, as 175 have less than 1% frequency in non Finish Europeans in GnomAD. These variants are located in 174 genes and canbe considered as FTD associated. The pathway enrichment analysis of these genes using Reactome software platform showed over represented pathways mainly in extracellularmatrix organization. Conclusion: The detection of over represented extracel  lular matrix organization pathways in FTD contributes tothe understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms under  lying neurodegeneration.

 Characterization of the PRNP gene mutations and the genotype phenotype correlation in Hungarian patientswith prion disease,P09.33,H. Zeke,"1, Á. Palásti1, B. A. Fekete1, V. Molnár1, A. Gál1,Z .","Grosz1, G. G. Kovács2, M. J. Molnár1 1Institute of Genomic Medicine and Rare Disorders, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary,2Department of Laboratory Medicine and Pathobiology, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Abnormal accumulation of prion proteins are responsible for several fatal neurodegenerative diseases.PRNP is the only gene in which pathogenic variants are known to cause genetic prion disease. However, several pathogenic mutations of PRNP with heterogeneous type and position were published with disease causing or modifying effect on other neurodegenerative disorders. In a signi ﬁcant portion, genetic cause can be explained with the mostcommon pathogenic mutation E200K in the PRNP gene. Materials and methods: Hundred twenty six patients were referred (age at referral: 57 +13,7years) to our institute with clinically suggested prion disease during 2015 2019. Sanger sequencing was applied to analyze the entire coding region of PRNP gene. Results: Altogether 25 unrelated prion positive cases were detected during the 4 year observational period. Heterozygous c.598G>A (E200K) variant was detected in22/25 cases. Besides this most common variant in one case the previously described c.350 C>T (A117V) variant was found. In one family a rare, 168 bp octapeptid repeatinsertion was observed, which is known to be associated with a very slow disease progression. In addition, a novel mutation c. 490 A>G (R164G) has been also identi ﬁed which associated to a slow progression as well. Conclusions: In our cohort 88 % of the genetically conﬁrmed prion disorders were associated to the most common E200K PRNP mutation. The type and location of the alteration of the PRNP gene may have an important role in the determination of the phenotype, which makes thegenetic counselling challenging.

It accounts for around 10% of recessive axonal Charcot Marie Tooth disease (CMT) in European popula tions. A single case has been reported to date in the Greek population. We presently report a case series of 3 Greek patients with ARAN NM identi ﬁed during screening of undiagnosed recessive axonal CMT cases with a combina  tion of whole exome and Sanger sequencing. Patient 1 was a 19 year old female presenting with walking dif ﬁculty at the age of 8 years. She gradually developed lower limb atrophies and at 15 years old was also diagnosed with myoclonic epilepsy. On EMG she showed motor axonalneuropathy with neuromyotonia. She was compound het  erozygous for mutations c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) and c.250T>C (p.Cys84Arg) in HINT1 . Patient 2 was a 20 year  old woman presenting with walking dif ﬁculties at the age of 14 years. She gradually developed foot drop and upper limb distal weakness. On EMG she showed a motor axonalneuropathy with neuromyotonia. She was homozygous for the c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) mutation in HINT1 . Patient 3 was a 49 year old male presenting with walking dif ﬁculties at the age of 15 years. He gradually developed foot drop and upper limb distal weakness. On EMG he showed a pre  dominantly motor axonal neuropathy with neuromyotonia.He was homozygous for the c.110G>C (p.Arg37Pro) mutation in HINT1 . We conclude that HINT1  related CMT may be relatively common in Greece and should be furthersystematically screened for in appropriately selected populations. Z. Kontogeorgiou: None. D. Pandis: None.

 Trio whole exome sequencing con ﬁrmsKCND2 de novo missense mutations as a cause of autosomal dominantly inherited severe seizures and developmental delay,P09.38,"U. Zechner , D. Rosenkranz, H. Bolz","Senckenberg Centre of Human Genetics, Frankfurt, Ger","many Trio whole exome sequencing was carried out in a female proband with epileptic encephalopathy (delayed myelina  tion, hypoplastic corpus callosum, abnormal EEG) and severe global retardation noticed from the age of 3 months(no psychomotor milestones acquired, muscle hypotonia, irregular eye movements and lack of ﬁxation, stereotypic hyperkinetic arm and leg movements) and her healthy par ents. The patient manifested intractable epileptic seizures from the age of 1 year; there was no signi ﬁcant psychomotor development. She died at the age of 21 years. A hetero zygous de novo missense variant, c.1210G>C (p.(Val404  Leu)), was detected in KCND2 , the gene encoding Kv4.2, a major pore forming subunit in somatodendritic subthresholdA type potassium current (ISA) channels. The variant has not been described in the literature or in disease  and population speci ﬁc variant databases. It leads to the exchange of an evolutionarily highly conserved residue in the S6 transmembrane segment which is part of the chan nel’s central pore for ion permeation. All 11 applied in silico prediction algorithms categorized the variant as deleterious. In a previous report on KCDN2 as a disease gene, a monozygotic twin pair with epilepsy and developmentaldelay carried a heterozygous de novo missense variant affecting the same residue (Lee et al., PMID: 24501278). This p.(Val404Met) mutation (c.1210G>A) was shown tolead to enhanced inactivation of closed Kv4.2 channels and impaired inactivation of open channels (Lin et al., PMID: 29581270). Thus, our ﬁnding supports dominant de novo KCND2 missense variants as a cause of intractable, early  onset epilepsy with severe global retardation. U. Zechner: None. D. Rosenkranz: None. H.

The pathology underlying the disease is a diffuse cerebral microangiopathywith development of micro , macrocysts, tumour like vas  cular hyperplasia, calci ﬁcation, glial proliferation, demye  lination, necrosis, iron deposition and haemorrhage.Mutations in the SNORD118 gene were associated with Labrune syndrome in 2012. Since then only individual cases have been presented. We report a normally developing 10 years old girl suffering from chronic headaches without neurological symptoms. Initially, Aicardi Goutieres syndrome wassuspected. We performed retrospective analysis of three annual brain MRI with MR angiography. In all MRI we found diffuse symmetrical white matter areas of increasedsignal with U  ﬁbers sparing. Deep nuclei were affected. Cystic areas, enlarging in consecutive examinations were observed in thalami, with mass effect in last MRI. Multiples i g n a l sw i t hb l o o m i n ge f f e c tw e r es p r e a db o t hs u p r a  a n d infratentorially. Partial peripheral contrast enhancement was seen in supratentorial changes.

 Early onset of complex seizures as a ﬁrst sign of 16p11.2 deletion syndrome,P09.42,"E. Sukarova Angelovska , V. Anastasovska, F. Duma,","L. Muaremovska, D. Nestoroska, G. Ilieva, M. Pesevska, M.Velkov","Pediatric Clinic, Skopje, Macedonia, The Former Yugoslav Republic of Background: Recent technologies enabled clari ﬁcation of some previously undetected causes of intellectual disability and autism spectrum disorders. There are reports of 16p11.2 deletion in the literature, describing variable clinical pre sentation in patients. Most of them describe developmental delay, autism and seizures, however phenotypic pattern is undistinguishable and variable. There is still no suf ﬁcient clinical data of this CNV in babies. Case report: We report on a patient with developmental delay and complex seizures. This is a second child in afamily, the pregnancy and delivery was uneventful. Microcephaly, foramen ovale and generalized hypotonia were noticed shortly after birth. At the age of 3 months hedeveloped infantile spasms, followed by profound devel  opmental delay within the next several months. He has microcephaly, early closure of the fontanel, high forehead,bitemporal narrowing, wide nasal root, narrow palpebral features, upper lip notch, short neck, cryptorchidism. Karyotype was normal. aCGH analysis (using Affymetrix ® CytoScan TM750K Array) showed deletion of 16p11.2 (1.430 kb), also deletion on chromosome 14q11.2 (433 kb), both are considered as pathogenic according aDGVdatabase. Discussion and conclusion: Deletion of the 16p11.2 is mostly described in older children that developed autisticspectrum of disorder, ADHD, etc. Wide clinical variability is described between patients, mostly due to the variations on size and breakpoint of the deleted region. There are someinconsistencies in phenotype described in literature, how  ever this could be a part of a changing phenotype with age.

Recent advancementsin genomics have enabled scientists to identify numerous mutations underlying NDD. Materials and methods: We used whole exome sequen  cing (WES) to identify the causative genes in 22 patients with NDD. Consanguinity was reported in all families. Genomic DNA was extracted using the QIAamp DNABlood Mini QIAcube Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). The DNA libraries were created by the Nextera DNA Exome kit (Illumina) and sequenced on NextSeq500 sequencer using 2x150 bp sequencing kits (Illumina). Bioinformatic analyses were performed on Seqgenomize platform including an automated variant classi ﬁcation tool. Results: In series of patients with NDD studied by WES, we found pathogenic/likely pathogenic variants in 17 different genes, which consist of 2 frameshift duplication,4 frameshift deletion, 6 nonsense, 9 missense and a splice site variants in WDR62, CLP1, IGHMBP2, ADSL, GJC2,EXOSC3, B4GALNT1, GBA2, WWOX, ERCC6, CHKB, TBCK, GLDC,TRAPPC9, CYP7B1, MID1 and TTN genes. CLP1 and GJC2 genes were found mutated twice. A total of 6 novel variants were identi ﬁed. Interestingly, clinically relevant TTN and MID1 variants were detected in the same patient, explaining the combinatorial effects of thegenes may contribute to phenotype complexity and variability. Conclusions: Identi ﬁcation of pathogenic/ potentially pathogenic variants and novel variants may lead to the design of personalized therapeutic strategies and the implementation of genetic counseling of NDD as well asto monitoring and early intervention, even before the onset of the disorder.

Chronic neuroin ﬂammation contributes to the pathogenesis of PD. Activation of microglia andincreased levels of pro in ﬂammatory mediators such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF  α), interleukine 1 beta (IL 1 β), and interleukine 6 (IL 6) have been reported after post mortem analysis of the substantia nigra from PD patients. This study aimed to estimate the association of TNF  αrs1800629, IL 1 βrs16944, and IL 6 rs1800795 with the disease progression in the initial motor stage, after ﬁve  year follow up. Material and methods: Our study included 64 con  secutive PD outpatients at Hoehn and Yahr disease stage 1. The severity of PD, depression, anxiety, and cognitive impairment were evaluated using rating scales: Uni ﬁed Parkinson Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) Part (I IV), Mini  Mental State Examination (MMSE) score, Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HAM D), and Hamilton AnxietyRating Scale (HAM A). Patients completed the same protocol at Years 1, 2, 3, and 5. Genotyping of TNF  αrs1800629, IL 1 βrs16944, and IL 6 rs1800795 was performed using TaqMan real time PCR assays. Results: IL 1βrs16944 G allele in females has been associated with faster PD progression on UPDRS motor examination (Part III, p ,0.014), on motor complications (Part IV, p ,0.026), and on UPDRS total (p ,0.005).

At the moment, there is no single picture of the etiopathogenesis of this disease. Materials and methods: Toxic models of PD in rodents and various samples of patients with PD were studied using sequencing of full exome, transcriptome, and RT PCR. Results: An analysis of patients with a presumed autosomal dominant form of PD revealed eight new genes, mutations in which can lead to the development of the disease, was carried out. Three different variants weredetected in the SCN3A gene in three patients. Analysis of toxic models of PD revealed new ones that can play an important role at different stages of pathogenesis (vesiculartransport, projection of neurons, RNA splicing and myelination processes). A detailed analysis of the mRNA level of individual genes in the peripheral blood of patientswith PD revealed several genes, the level of which speciﬁcally varied in untreated patients with PD.888 J. del PicchiaConclusion: Our data indicate a consistent involvement of the transcriptome in the pathogenesis of PD and highlight the independent role of various brain structures and individual parts of nerve cells in the formation of a response to the development of neurodegeneration.

Ammosov North Eastern Federal University, Yakutsk, Russian Federation,2Laboratory of Molecular Genetics, Yakut Scienti ﬁc Centre of Complex Medical Problems, Yakutsk, Russian Federation Polymorphism of the functional promoter microsatellite locus of the arginine vasopressin receptor (AVPR1A) can cause theformation of personality traits cha racterized by impulsivity, poor control of one ’s impulses, extravagance, anxiety, exaggeration of the expected danger and an acute reaction to social dis approval. In this paper, we evaluated the effect of the RS1 locus in the AVPR1A gene, in the formation of personal character  istics in 121 individuals of Yakut men, and also conducted acomparative analysis of the frequency distribution of alleles and genotypes. The study revealed the involvement of the poly  morphic marker RS1 in the formation of such personal traits as""avoidance of damage"" and ""dependence on reward"". The data obtained indicate a modulating e ffect of ethnicity on identifying associations of the AVPRA1 gene with personality traits. Thefrequencies of RS1 alleles differed in Yakut (Asian) volunteers compared to white (Finland, Ir eland, Israel), and European white populations had a higher range of GATA track diversity.We identi ﬁed seven different alleles of the RS1 marker. At the same time, short and long alleles (R8, R14, R15, R16) were absent in our sample in homozygous form. The Yakut popu lation is characterized by a pronounced de ﬁcit of heterozygotes and a low level of actual heterozygosity, which can be explained by the founder effect in the Yakut population.

The patients show a broad clin  ical spectrum from epileptic encephalopathy to severeintellectual disability and treatable epilepsy with later age at onset. Patient and Methods: Illumina ®TruSight™One clinical exome was performed in a 4 year old girl with MiSeq next  generation sequencing platform in order to explore a profound developmental delay associated with severehypotonia, seizure, and nystagmus. Results: The analysis revealed a homozygous missense variant in PIGT (NM_015937.6): c.1519C>T (p. Arg507Trp). Segregation analysis supports the recessive pattern of inheritance. The pathogenicity of p.Arg507Trp was estimated as deleterious by web based prediction tools.So far 26 patients with a GPI anchor de ﬁciency due to recessive PIGT variants have been described. Our patient shares the most common features associated with PIGT CDG: intellectual disability/development delay, seizures, nystagmus, and brain MRI anomalies. Most of the published PIGT deﬁcient patients had evident cortical and cerebellar atrophy. Our patient demonstrated severe atrophy of the cerebral hemispheres with slight atrophy of the cerebellum at the age of 4 years.

Safra Program in Parkinson ’s Disease and the Morton and Gloria Shulman Movement Disorders Clinic, Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, ON, Canada,3Division of Neurology, Department of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada Introduction: Primary familial brain calci ﬁcation (PFBC) is a hereditary disorder characterized by calcium deposits in the brain and presenting clinically with neuropsychiatric symptoms, cognitive dysfunction, or a variety of movementdisorders. Currently, changes in six genes are known to cause PFBC, with SLC20A2 ,PDGFB ,PDGFRB ,XPR1 variants related to autosomal dominant forms and MYORG andJAM2 variants to autosomal recessive ones. Patients and Methods: We identi ﬁed a 26 year old female patient, presenting with periodic involuntary postur ing of her limbs and symmetrical bilateral brain calci ﬁca  tions. Genetic testing was performed for PRRT2 ,SLC20A2 , PDGFB ,PDGFRB ,XPR1 ,a n d MYORG . Her parents also underwent targeted MYORG sequencing. Results: In our patient, the paroxismal kinesigenic attacks ﬁrst appeared at eight years of age, became more frequent in her teenage years (up to ten attacks per day) and were completely absent during her pregnancies. Neurologic examination was normal between episodes. Neuroimagingrevealed symmetrical bilateral calci ﬁcations involving the cerebellum, basal ganglia, thalamus, midbrain, and the frontal and occipital cortical and subcortical areas. Inaddition, in her pregnancies, the placentae were noted to have widespread calci ﬁcation. Our genetic analyses identi  ﬁed a homozygous previously reported and likely patho  genic missense variant in the MYORG gene (c.1831C>T; p. Arg611Trp) and no PRRT2 changes in our patients. Herfather carried the same heterozygous MYORG variant and showed no brain calci ﬁcation. Conclusions: We report a homozygous MYORG change as the most likely cause of PFBC presenting as paroxysmal dyskinesia in our patient and thus expand the known phenotypic spectrum of MYORG  associated PFBC.

 A Portuguese family based exome sequencing in pri mary headaches,P09.57,A. Dias,"1,2, M. Alves Ferreira1,2, J. Sequeiros1,2, J. Pereira","Monteiro1, A. Sousa1,2,C. Lemos1,2 1i3S –Instituto de Investigaç ão e Inovaç ão em Saúde, Porto, Portugal,2ICBAS   Instituto Ciências Biomédicas Abel Salazar, Porto, Portugal Introduction: Primary headaches comprises migraine with or without aura (MA/MO) and cluster headache (CH).During the last 17 years, our group has been able to clini  cally characterize more than a thousand patients, relatives and controls and we performed several candidate geneassociation studies in different pathways. Moreover, we found several variants involved in the vascular component, trigeminal nociceptive plasticity, neurogenic in ﬂammation and in the release of neurotransmitters. However, these complex diseases are caused by several genetic factors. Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a powerful approach toexplore coding regions, particularly low frequency variants. Our aim was to perform a WES in three families to unravel genetic factors involved in migraine and CH susceptibility. Materials and methods: We gathered clinical informa  tion and DNA samples from 3 families with primary headaches and associated phenotypes. Afterwards, a WESwas performed. Results: We analysed 20 patients from the 3 families and we found common and rare variants in genes alreadyassociated with migraine subtypes as CACNA1A and PRRT2 and in new genes that may open new pathways of study. Conclusions: These preliminary results need to be further explored and interactions among these variants need to be understood to deepen the pathophysiological pathways ofmigraine. In the future, we will also correlate epigenetics and brain activity data to assess the risk of chronic and episodic migraine in women. Understanding the mechan isms underlying primary headache pathophysiology could lead to the development of more effective and better 890 J. del Picchiatolerated therapeutic approaches to avoid the overlay of painful events.

Mutations in this gene cause PTEN Hamartoma Tumour Syndrome (PHTS). However, PHTS often goes undetected especially in children since the manifestations of the diseaseare variable and subtle and guidelines for testing are few. Studies show 1 to 17% prevalence rates of PTEN mutations in children with ASD and macrocephaly. The varying resultson prevalence suggest the need for further studies. The aim of our study is to ﬁndPTEN prevalence in Turkish children with ASD and macrocephaly and increase awareness of thissyndrome in Turkey. To the best of our knowledge this will be the ﬁrstPTEN prevalence study done in Turkey and South Eastern Europe. This is also the largest pediatriccohort for PTEN prevalence study in patients with ASD and macrocephaly. Materials and methods: PTEN sequencing were done for 128 patients with ASD and head cir cumference size more than 97% on growth charts between the ages of 3 to 18 recruited from ﬁve different child and adolescent psychiatry clinics in Turkey. Result: We found 2known pathogenic, 1 new pathogenic and 2 variants of insigni ﬁcance (VUS) mutations out of 128 patients. The prevalence is 2,3% (VUS mutations are excluded).

Itspathogenic mutation is an abnormal expansion of the CAG repeats over 55 triplet repeats within the ATXN3 gene which encodes for an excessively long polyglutamine (polyQ) tractin the disease protein ataxin 3. Patients show a widely spread variation in age at onset and clinical variability of phenotype. Until today this phenomena is not fullyexplained. In the past, it was shown that the age at onset inversely correlates with the expanded CAG repeats. Within the wide range of age at onset between 5 75 years only 45 60% can be explained by the CAG repeat expansion. Aim: The aim of our study is to identify genetic modi ﬁers which can explain the wide range of age at onset as well asthe clinical heterogeneity of SCA3. Methods: Previously several genes (ATXN3, ATXN2, APOE, CACNA1A ) were described as candidate genes in literature. We are genotyping two big cohorts EUROSCA (Europe) and EUSAge (Israel, Brazil, Peru) in terms of single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) within candidate genes. Results and Conclusion: A variation in polymorphism can lead to different isoforms of the genes, functional changes of the encoding proteins and different interactions with mole cules. A SNP in ATXN3 has already been found to in ﬂuence the pathophysiology of SCA3. Therefore, SNPs of candidate genes seem to have an in ﬂuence on the pathophysiology of SCA3 and may be promising genetic modi ﬁers to observe further in order to learn more about the disease. R.M.

Sousa","Serviço de Genética Médica, Hospital de Santa Maria,","Centro Hospitalar Universitário de Lisboa Norte EPE,Centro Académico de Medicina de Lisboa, Lisbon, Portugal, Lisbon, Portugal Introduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) is a pow  erful tool to identify the genetic causes of rare mendelian disorders and can be particularly useful in patients withcomplex and genetically heterogeneous phenotypes. The authors describe a patient with phenotypic manifestations of two rare genetic diseases: autosomal recessive cerebellarataxia type 23 (SCAR23, OMIM #616949) and con  tractures, pterygia, and variable skeletal fusions syndrome  1A (CPSKF1A, OMIM #178110). Methods and results: We report a 21 year old male patient born to non consanguineous parents, with irrelevant family history. He has language delay, mild to moderateintellectual disability (ID), refractory epilepsy, ﬁne motor skill de ﬁcits, short neck, narrow shoulders, mild facial dysmorphisms, hypoplastic hypothenar eminence andhypoplastic ﬂexion creases. His skeletal survey showed C4 C5 fusion. Brain MRI, karyotype, array CGH and FMR1 testing were normal. WES revealed two variants in TDP2 gene: c.345_348del, p.(IIe117Profs*7) (likely patho  genic) and c.949C>T, p.(Arg317*) (variant of uncertain signiﬁcance). These variants have not been previously reported and are in a compound heterozygous state. WES also showed a heterozygous deletion encompassing at least exons 4 7 of the MYH3 gene (likely pathogenic). Discussion and conclusions: The presence of variants c.345_348del and c.949C>T in TDP2 gene may justify the neurological ﬁndings in our patient, namely ID and epilepsy, establishing the diagnosis of SCAR23. On the other hand, the heterozygous deletion of exons 4 7 of the MYH3 gene might explain the dysmorphic and skeletal ﬁndings of the patient, whose features are more suggestive of CPSKF1A. This case illustrates the challenge of diagnosing two genetic disorders co occurring in the samepatient. M. Rodrigues: None. M.P. Soares: None. P. Dias: None. A.B. Sousa: None. E",2020

Type II deiodinase enzyme (DIO2) has a critical potency on thyroid metabolism that converts prohormone thyroxine (T4) to the active hormone triiodothyronine (T3)also it seems that can particular relevance in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to investigate the genetic con  tribution of the DIO2 gene to SCH by the genotype analysisof DIO2 Thr92Ala and ORFa Gly3Asp polymorphisms and to compare the serum levels of free triiodothyronine (FT3), free thyroxine (FT4), and thyroid stimulating hormone(TSH) concentrations in 290 unrelated Turkish SCH patients and 198 healthy controls. Method and Results: We genotyped two single nucleo  tide polymorphisms (SNPs) Thr92Ala and ORFa Gly3Asp located on DIO2 gene, and performed SNP association analysis along with the thyroid hormonal status in SCHpatients and healthy controls. The distribution of Thr92Ala genotypes in SCH was signi ﬁcantly different compared to controls (p ,0.045). In men cohort, both allele and genotype frequencies were found signi ﬁcantly different than controls (p ,0.03). However, neither allele and nor genotype frequencies of ORFa Gly3Asp poly morphism were statistically signi ﬁcant in the study group. Decrease of mean FT3 (p<0.001) and TSH (p,0.004) concentrations were observed in SCH patients compared to controls. Thr92Ala genotypes were found to be signiﬁcantly associated with FT3 and TSH levels (p<0.05, respectively).

Results: Genomes of SP contain increased levels of rDNA CN and decreased levels of f SatIIIcompared to HD: 532 ± 118 copies with 18,0 ± 5,9 pg/ng of f SatIII and 413 ± 105 copies with21,6 ± 6,9 pg/ng of f SatIII,respectively, p < 10 80. Amount of f SatIII depends on rDNA CN:DNA of HD and SP containing low (200 350) or high (>700) CN of rDNA contained 10 30pg/ng of f SatIII. 55% of SP have 500 600 CN of rDNA and 15 20 pg/ng of f SatIII.

Several causal genes have been identi ﬁed today but the understanding of underlying genetic mechanisms has proved challenging. Many of the affected families remain genetically unsolved. Methods : In this study we use molecular techniques to investigate a large pedigree with many affected individuals from an isolated village in central Greece affected by a high incidence of Parkinson ’s disease. We utilized whole exome sequencing and linkage analysis to identify coding variants that are of putative signi ﬁcance. We then apply association analysis across a wider population to highlight thesigniﬁcance of these variants in sporadic cases. Results : Linkage to chromosome 11 was found with a LOD score of 2.2. The phenotypic spectrum of our patientswas not uniform: 3 presented with Parkinson ’s disease without dementia, while another 2 presented with dementia that was later classi ﬁed as Alzheimer ’s disease. All patients carried a novel heterozygous variant in SORL1 segregating with disease in the family. Conclusions : This is the ﬁrst report of the discovery of a likely pathogenic variant in SORL1 in a large family with some of the affected individuals presenting with Parkin  son’s disease without dementia at disease onset.

We present a case study of the patient with the MIC CAM phenotype with a homozygous pathogenic variant in the STAMBP gene. Material and methods: The full term newborn presented with microcephaly ( 3.3SD) and small capillary malforma  tions in different areas of the body. Focal myoclonic spasmsdeveloped from the 3 rdmonth of age. At the 6thmonth, the focal EEG abnormalities, brain atrophy and profound developmental delay with hypotonia led to suspicion ofthe early infantile myoclonic encephalopathy. Similar clinical ﬁndings were documented in her older sister deceased at the 9 thmonth of age. Consanguinity was recorded in the family pedigree. The molecular diagnosis was found by whole exome sequencing (Illumina NextSeq platform) using Human Core Exome Kit (Twist Bioscience)and con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing. The detected variants were annotated by Ingenuity Variant Analysis (Qiagen) and classi ﬁed according to the ACMG criteria.

Mancini","Erasmus MC, Rotterdam, Netherlands Microtubules play an important role during cortical devel  opment by regulating mitosis and neuronal migration. TUBB2B codes for one the β isoforms of tubulin and dominant negative mutations in this gene result in mal formations of cortical development (MCD) like poly  microgyria, pachygyria, dysmorphic basal ganglia, epilepsy and intellectual disability. However, phenotypic hetero geneity has been reported in cases with isolated congenital ﬁbrosis of extraocular muscles (CFEOM3A) and myoclo  nus dystonia. Here we show three individuals in one familywith a missense variant in TUBB2B , who exhibit an unusual phenotype. At 21 week of gestation advanced US revealed a foetus with relative small head, enlarged lateral ventricles,borderline hypoplastic cerebellum and a thin corpus callo  sum, which were less pronounced at MRI. Given the uncertain prognosis, the couple decided to terminate thepregnancy. Exome sequencing on foetal material identi ﬁed a heterozygous maternally inherited variant in TUBB2B (c.530A>T, p.Asp177Val), not present in GnomAD andpredicted damaging.

 An infant with two de novo variants causing recessive and dominant disorders: Diagnostic challenge,P09.69,A. Sezer,"1,Ö. B. Gündo ğdu Ö ğütlü1, Z. Türky ılmaz2,","K. Gücüyener3, G. Kayhan1, F. E. Perçin1 1Gazi University Department of Medical Genetics, Ankara, Turkey,2Gazi University Department of Pediatric Surgery,Ankara, Turkey,3Gazi University Department of Pediatric Neurology, Ankara, Turkey Introduction: Inherited Glycosylphosphatidylinositol de ﬁ  ciencies (IGDs) are a subclass of Congenital Defects of glycosylation. Most common ﬁndings of IGDs are devel  opmental delay, seizures, and persistent hyperphosphatasia. Moreover GRIN2B mutations cause another rare neurode  velopmental disorder which has overlapping ﬁndings with IGDs, e.g. developmental delay, intellectual disability and epilepsy. Herein, it is aimed to present a case diagnosed with two de novo variants in PIGO andGRIN2B genes: one is causing a dominant and the other is causing a recessive disorder. Material Method: A seven month old girl was presented with hydronephrosis, seizure, microbrachycephaly, bilateral hypoplastic ﬁfthﬁngernails, abnormal distal phalanx morphology of ﬁngers on radiography and persistent hyperphosphatasia. There was no consanguinity of her parents. Whole exome sequencing (WES) analysis was performed to evaluate genetic etiology. Results: Two rare variants in PIGO (NM_032634.4) gene; c.1944C>G (p.Cys648Trp) and c.2708_2710delTCT (p.Phe903del) were shown by WES analysis. Sangersequencing performed to the parents, and unveiled that those two variants was maternal and de novo respectively. The variants were evaluated as in trans position, by usinga heterozygous polymorphism (rs505297) and NGS read  ings of WES data. Further, a rare de novo variant was detected in GRIN2B (NM_000834.5) gene: c.1852G>A (rs1428234478) (p.Val618Ile). Conclusion: Some prospective and retrospective studies have been shown the underestimated number of multiplemolecular diagnosis of which results in phenotypes over  lapping or separated. In our case phenotypes of two diagnosis were overlapping. If one of multiple geneticdiagnoses had been overlooked, this would change the present or future management options of disorders and genetic counseling to families. A. Sezer: None. Ö.B.

Several of the genes (TREX1, RNASEH2A, RNASEH2B, RNASEH2C, IFIH1, ADAR,SAMHD1) mutations can cause AGS. The syndrome can be seen as autosomal dominant/recessive. Generally, the onset of AGS occurs within the ﬁrst few days or months of life. In our case, the most severe neonatal form of AGS1 is typi  cally due to mutation in the TREX1 gene. In addition to our patient, SPTAN1 gene mutation was detected. This genemutation can cause Early infantile epileptic encephalopathy type 5 which inherited autosomal dominant. We thought that the common point of the two mutations might be severeepilepsy and cerebellar atrophy for our patient. Her epileptic attacks started at about 4 months of age. On the physical examination microcephaly, joint stiffness, dystonia, abnor mal eye movements, tetraplegic spasticity, and neuromotor developmental retardation were presented. In cranial MR, cerebral atrophy, intracerebral calci ﬁcations, and calci ﬁca  tions of the periventricular area were observed. Epilepsy attacks started at the age of 3 months. We performed RNASEH2B gene sequence analysis in the patient andcould not detect a mutation. We detected two mutations with whole exome sequencing. One of them was homo  zygous c.13_15dupATC mutation in the TREX gene andthe other was heterozygous c.2882 C> T in the SPTAN1 gene. AGS is a very rare disease of unknown frequency. Our aim in presenting this case is to see two rare mutationstogether and think that the disease can change its severity. F. Duymus: None. B. Goksel Tulgar: None. D. Esin: None. G. Turkoglu: None.

" Penetrance of Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy in Huelva. One of the most important foci in worldwide Á. Gragera Martínez 1, L. Herranz Arriero2, C. Borrachero Garro1, F. Muñoz Beamud1 1Juan Ramon Jimenez University Hospital, Huelva, Spain, 2Badajoz University Hospital, Badajoz, Spain Introduction: Hereditary amyloidosis mediated by trans thyretin (hATTR) is a hereditary, neurodegenerative,progressive, highly disabling and life threatening disease in short term if an early treatment is not established. It is a rare disease, with prevalence less than 1 / 100,000 habitants in worldwide. Huelva is one of the most important endemic foci of the disease worldwide and the second in Spain. Inherited with an autosomal dominant pattern characterizedby a reduced penetrance, which varies according to age and geographic area. This poses big problems and big chal lenges to monitoring patients and their families. Objectives : To know the penetrance in the endemic focus of Valverde del Camino, Huelva Methodology : A retrospective, observational study was performed. For this work, medical records have been collected and statistically analyzed. Demographic details (sex, age at diagnosis of the disease, age at the onset ofsymptoms) were obtained Results : Data from 112 patients have been analyzed Conclusions : The prevalence obtained in our population is quite different between mens and womens. A higher proportion of men develop symptoms, most women with the pathogenic variant are asymptomatic. This could beexplained by the presence of polymorphisms in the TTR gene that modulate disease expression as well as clinical symptoms. This is a very interesting ﬁeld of study that will allow us to better understand the disease.

In 5 10% of cases, a family history is identi ﬁed. Although the inci  dence of ALS in the Faroes is similar to other European countries, we have observed an overrepresentation of cases originating from the small geographically isolated island ofSuðuroy, which lead to the study aim: estimation of familial ALS in the Faroese population. All ALS cases have been registered since 1987. In this study, 43 patients wereincluded. First, familial ALS was recognized when occur  ring between ﬁrst  or second degree relatives. Secondly, the Faroese Multi Generation Register, which contains infor mation about familial relationships since 1650, was used to construct pedigrees amongst patients to identify risk families ( ≥3 cases within 3 generations). Fifteen cases ori  ginated from Suðuroy where the prevalence of ALS was more than 3 times higher than the nationwide prevalence. Six patients had familial ALS (13.9%) of which four ori ginated from Suðuroy. Through pedigrees, we identi ﬁed six additional patients with possible familial ALS (28%). This study is suggestive of familial clustering in excess ofexpected for ALS in Suðuroy and the proportion of familial ALS in the Faroe Islands was high. High levels of inbreeding and genetic substructure have been demonstratedin the Faroese population. Combined with these results, there is strong support of a genetic contribution to ALS in the Faroe Islands and further genetic studies are warranted.Funding: Aage og Johanne Louis Hansens Fond, Minister Erna Hamiltons Legat for videnskab og kunst, Sjúkra  kassagrunnurin, Betri Stuðul, Aase og EjnarDanielsens Fond.

 Efﬁciency of the MPS panel of 15 genes associated with genetically heterogeneous hereditary neuropathies,P10.05,"M. D. Orlova , O. A. Schagina, O. P. Ryzhkova,","G. E. Rudenskaya, E. L. Dadali, A. V. Polyakov","Research Centre for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Charcot Marie Tooth disease is a genetically heterogeneous pathology related to hereditary peripheral neuropathies. The purpose of the research is to evaluate the efﬁciency of panel sequencing for a highly genetically heterogeneous pathology.Materials and methods: We have studied the DNA of 43 Russian CMT patients (25 myelinopathy, 18 axonopathy) after excluding the most common cause of CMT –PMP22 duplications. MPS libraries were prepared with the use of Ion AmpliSeq ™reagents and sequencing by Ion S5 ™Sys  tem. Panel includes 15 CMT genes: MFN2, MPZ, EGR2, FGD4, LITAF, PMP22, PRX, MORC2, SH3TC2, HINT1, HSPB1, NEFL, NDRG1, GDAP1, GJB1 , mutations in which were previously identi ﬁed as the cause of the disease for at least 2 unrelated Russian families. Results: After the targeted MPS sequencing, a de ﬁnite molecular diagnosis de ﬁned as a pathogenic or a likely pathogenic variant, was reached in 16% of cases (n ,7). Variants of unknown signi ﬁcance were found in 16% of cases (n ,7). 68% (n ,29) of cases were molecularly undiagnosed. In most cases variants were found in the SH3TC2 (5) and MFN2 (3) genes. 6 patients had variants in the following genes: MPZ, GDAP1, HINT1 ,LITAF ,PRX, MORC2 . Conclusion: Diagnoses by the MPS panel were con  ﬁrmed for 16% of the patients, while the WES is ef ﬁcient in 19 45% of cases. Thus, small MPS panel is a useful tool for highly genetically heterogeneous pathology. It helps to avoid consequent tests of frequent genes associated withCMT with the Sanger sequencing while having the efﬁciency comparable to WES. M.D. Orlova: None. O.A. Schagina: None. O.P.

Kósa1,3 1PentaCore Laboratories, Budapest, Hungary,22nd Department of Pediatrics, Semmelweis University, Buda  pest, Hungary,3Department of Internal Medicine and Oncology, Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: The hereditary motor and sensory neuro  pathies are a heterogenous disease group which could becaused by several gene mutations, such as deletions, duplications and single nucleotide substitutions. The com  plex genetic etiology could harden the differential diag nostics and lengthen the path to identify the genetic background. Material and methods: In our case, a four year old boy was examined, who born with hypotonia and showed delayed motor development. At the age of three, EMGAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 897analysis showed axonal polyneuropathy and motor nerve conduction could not be detected in his legs. After the analysis of copy number variations of PMP22 and SMN genes, further neuropathies associated genes were sequenced without any results. Finally, whole exome sequencing was performed, and the results were analysedby focusing on primer neuropathy associated genes. Results: A pathogenic heterozygous S72L mutation (rs104894621) was identi ﬁed in the PMP22 gene, which was previously associated with Charcot Marie Tooth dis  ease. Sanger sequencing also con ﬁrmed the result. Conclusions: Based on our result the clinical diagnosis was con ﬁrmed and the genetic counsellor could provide adequate information to the parents before the birth of the second child. It is important to highlight that in case ofneuropathies, after screening copy number variations, performing whole exome sequencing could shorten and make easier the identi ﬁcation of potential pathogenic mutations in the background of the symptoms. The fast identi ﬁcation of causal variants could contribute to the selection of speci ﬁc therapy and family planning. A. Illés: None. K. Árvai: None. B. Kocsis Deák: None. Á. Herczegfalvi: None. P.

Biallelic pathogenic variants of DYSF gene is known to be responsible for dysferlinopathies. The pre valence of the disease is unknown but incidence is higher in the populations that consanguineous marriage is observed frequently. Here we report a 17 years old female patient thatwas referred to our outpatient clinics for proximal muscle weakness. She had dif ﬁculty in walking and climbing stairs for the last 6 months. In her physical examination; her deeptendon re ﬂexes of the lower extremities were diminished, her muscle strength was normal and she could walk on the tip of her toes and stand on her heels. Her serum creatinekinase levels were detected over 20.000 U/L repetitively therefore muscle biopsy was planned. Quadriceps femorismuscle histology revealed positive sarcoglycan proteins but reduced dysferline. Due to the muscle biopsy result we have planned DYSF gene sequence analysis and a novel c.754A>G (p.Thr252Ala) variant was detected in homo  zygous state.

 The retrieval of candidate genes of inverse comorbidity between cancer and neurodegeneration consideringapoptosis as a key process,P10.12,D. Gomboeva,"1, O. Saik2, E. Bragina1, V. Ivanisenko2,","V. Puzyrev1 1Tomsk National Research Medical Center, Tomsk, Russian Federation,2Federal Research Center Institute of Cytology and Genetics, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation Introduction: Epidemiological studies have revealed the reduced cancer incidence in patients with Huntington dis  ease (HD), indicating a presence of inverse comorbidity ordystropy of HD and cancer. The one of promising biolo  gical process, which unites these two groups of diseases, is apoptosis. Cancer is characterized by inhibited apoptosis,while in HD, on contrary, apoptosis is up regulated. Thus, identi ﬁcation of pro  and anti apoptotic genes and study of their regulation is hopeful for investigation of inversecomorbidity mechanisms of HD and cancer. Materials and methods: The genetic network was reconstructed using ANDSystem (Ivanisenko, 2015). Net work included all genes and proteins associated with HD (n,140). The list of genes of apoptosis was retrieved from KEGG (hsa04210 identi ﬁer, n,136). Prioritization was carried using ToppGene and functions of ANDSystem. The special criteria were calculated, including: betweenness centrality, stress centrality, closeness centrality, cross talkcentrality and cross talk speci ﬁcity (Saik et al., 2018). The search of miRNA was conducted using MirTarBase database. Results: 10 genes were identi ﬁed: APOE, BDNF, HSPA4, HTT, IL6, INS, LEP, PSEN1, SP1, SQSTM1 . Through the analysis at the miRNA level, we retrieved 5common miRNA (let 7c 5p; miR 1 3p; miR 149 5p; miR  22 3p; miR 223 3p) regulate of expression of protein898 J. del Picchiacoding genes ( SP1, HSPA4, BDNF, IL6 ). All genes are important for neurodegeneration and associated with cancer: play different roles in carcinogenesis, cancer progression dependent on type of cancer.

MPV17 encodes a channel forming protein of the inner mitochondrial mem brane. In this case, it is aimed to present the ﬁrst clinical report of MPV17 related axonal sensorimotor neuropathy with compound heterozygous mutation. The patient was a 16 year old male and these second child of healthy, consanguineous parents. He had severe distal muscle atrophy, pes cavus deformity, foot drop, hammertoes, atrophy of the intrinsichand muscles and bilateral thenar and hypothenar muscles. Hypore ﬂexia of upper limbs was observed. The ﬁrst symptom of the patient was the loss of balance and walking dif ﬁculty starting at the age of six. c.122G> A and c.376 9T> A mutations in the MPV17 gene was detected by whole exome sequencing. The MPV17:c.122G>A variant has already beendescribed as a pathogenic variant. The MPV17:c.376 9T> A variant described as a variant of uncertain signi ﬁcance. To the best of our knowledge, the coexistence of these two hetero zygous mutations was not found in the literature review. In this case report, we emphasize that a novel compound het  erozygous MPV17 mutation can cause non syndromic per ipheral axonal neuropathy and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of juvenile adult onset severe axonal sensorimotor neuropathy.D.

Material and Methods: A clinical case of LGMD 2E in a 9 year old child. Clinical, genealogical, laboratory and instrumental and molecular genetic methods were used. Results: Girl K., up to 8 years old, developed in accordance with age norms. At age 8, the mother began to notice motor impairment in the child; at age 9, a duck walk appeared. It became dif ﬁcult for the child to climb the stairs, squat and jump; there was pain in the calf muscles. The girl complained of fatigue during normal physical activity. Objective data: stimulation neuromyography   adecrease in the muscles of the lower extremities (47% on the right and 61% on the left); a 35 fold increase in creatinekinase levels. To clarify the diagnosis, a molecular genetic examination was assigned: analysis and testing of the removal/duplication of 123 strength genes (Los Angeles, 2019). Two pathogenic variants c.2T>C andc.341C>T (p.Ser114Phe) were identi ﬁed in the SGCB gene. The SGCB gene is associated with an autosomal recessive LGMD type 2E. Final diagnosis: LGMD 2E(sarco glycanopathy). Conclusions: Signi ﬁcant dif ﬁculties arise in the diagnosis of genetic variants of neuromuscular diseases only on thebasis of a clinical study. The use of sequence analysis makes it possible to clarify the type of muscular dystrophy.

The prevalence of SMA in the Republic of Moldova constitutes 8.43±0,15:100000 population which is signi ﬁcantly higher than the data from Orphanet (2,93) and Russia (0,31  3,91). 95% of SMA is caused by deletion of exon 7 of SMN1 . If both persons in a couple are carriers, they have a 1 in 4 chance of having a child with SMA. Materials and methods: 30 persons that formed 15 couples who addressed for family planning, without a family history of SMA were diagnosed for determining the status of exon 7 SMN1 by qPCR method, melting curve. The DNA concentration was measured by spectrophoto  metry. For PCR reaction each DNA sample was used as 2 replicates for SMN1 exon 7 and 1 replicate for the external standard ( ALB, exon 12). EvaGreen was used as a DNA  binding dye. Results: For all DNA samples, ampli ﬁcation occurred for both exon 12 ALB and exon 7 SMN1 . According to the melting curves, for 22 persons the exon7 SMN1 was determined to be present and for 8 persons was determinedheterozygous status (5 women and 3 men). Among those who are heterozygous, 2 people form the same couple. Conclusions : Following the Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (0,23) for 26% of the patients, the status of carriers of the deletion was established. Screening of SMA carriers is an important step in assessing the risk of giving birth to anaffected child. I. Coliban: None. N. U șurelu: None. V. Sacar ă: None. E",2020

Pizzuti1 1Sapienza University of Rome, Rome, Italy,2Casa Sollievo della Sofferenza IRCCS Foundation, San Giovanni Rotondo, Italy Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy with congenital bone fractures 2 (SMABF2) is a rare autosomal recessiveneuromuscular disorder characterized by arthrogryposis multiplex congenita and prenatal fractures. Reported patients present biallelic loss of function single nucleotidevariants in ASCC1 gene, encoding a subunit of the tran  scriptional coactivator ASC 1 complex. We describe the ﬁrst SMABF2 case with documented prenatal disease evo  lution, caused by an in frame microdeletion and a nonsense nucleotide variant in a stillbirth. Materials and methods: The stillbirth, born from non  consanguineous parents, presented hydrops, lower limbs hyperextension with bending of the hips, bilateral club foot and congenital fractures. Prenatal ultrasound had showedbilateral club foot, closed ﬁsts and fetal biometric para  meters at middle lower limits. Microarray analysis was performed on DNA extracted from umbilical cord. Datawere analyzed by CytoGenomics software. Next Generation Sequencing analysis was performed using the TruSightOne sequencing panel kit. NGS data were processed andanalyzed using an in house implemented pipeline. Results: A 64Kb microdeletion, involving four exons of ASCC1, was detected by microarray analysis. NGS discloseda single nucleotide variant of the same gene (c.1027C>T; p. Arg343*), resulting in a premature termination codon. Conclusions: This is the ﬁrst case of ASCC1 due to an exonic microdeletion and a nucleotide variant in compound heterozygosity, expanding the mutational spectrum of this gene. This case provides further evidence that exonic copynumber variants are an underestimated cause of disease  alleles and that the integrated use of the last generation genetic analysis tools, together with careful clinicalevaluations, are fundamental for the characterization of rare diseases even in prenatal setting.

Some features include skeletal muscle weakness and myotonia. The age at onset is extremely variable in DM1, and inversely correlates with the expansion size andindividual speci ﬁc differences in somatic instability (2 4). Materials and methods: We want to present most interestingly our patient male (30 years) with MyotonicDystrophy Type I disease, the exact number of repeats of the CTG trinucleotide for both alleles of the DMPK1 gene was detect by PCR Fragman analysis. Afterwards, the ageof the disease, the clinical severity of the disease, radiological and laboratory ﬁndings were compared with these patients. In addition, detailed pedigree analysis of thepatients was performed and thus anticipation and variable expressivity of the disease was determined. Results: Weﬁnd a result of the important in terms of myotonic dystrophy; he has got clinically myotonic discharges in EMG(electromyography) diagnosed as myo tonic dystrophy, but when examined in terms of the numberof repeats, the DMKP1 gene was a normal number of repeats in terms of 8/17 for both alleles. Conclusions: Myotonic dystrophies represent the most variable clinical phenotypes, so treatment strati ﬁcation is key for any modern therapeutic approach.

" Identi ﬁcation of clinical features to predict 22q11.2 deletion syndrome, proven by multiplex ligation depen dent probe ampli ﬁcation",P11.005,K. Rojnueangnit,"1, T. Khetkham1, P. Onsod2,T .","Chareonsirisuthigul2 1Thammasat University, Klong Luang, Thailand,2Mahidol University, Bangkok, Thailand Introduction : 22q11.2 deletion syndrome (22q11.2 DS) is the most common microdeletion syndrome with a wide variety of clinical features. However, there are no clinicalcriteria for diagnosis; con ﬁrmation is solely by genetic tests. Normally, these tests are only performed if clinicians recognize signs and symptoms; therefore, we aimed toidentify any clinical features that may help clinicians be aware of 22q11.2 DS. Materials and methods: Participants with at least two anomalies were enrolled from June 2015   May 2018 at Thammasat University Hospital. Complete patient history and physical examinations were done; multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁcation analysis for 22q11.2 were performed with blood samples. Results: Out of 48 participants, we identi ﬁed 11 (23%) with 22q11.2 DS. Palate anomalies, hypocalcemia, and ≥3 affected body systems were highly signi ﬁcant presentationsin the 22q11.2 DS group versus the group without deletion (p<0.05). Conotruncal cardiac defects alone were insuf ﬁ  cient for 22q11.2 DS prediction but suf ﬁcient when accompanied with other anomalies. Conclusion: A comprehensive physical examination is crucial at identifying any subtle features which may lead totesting and a de ﬁnite diagnosis.

Stangler Herode ž1, A. Osterc Kopriv šek1, N. Kokalj Voka č1,2 1University Medical Centre Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia, 2Medical Faculty Maribor, University Maribor, Maribor, Slovenia Introduction: 22q11.2 duplications may be largely unde  tected, as a result of less distinct, unpredictable, and/or milder phenotype. Double duplications 22q11.2 are extre  mely rare. We describe the family of six, all with 22q11.2duplication or double duplication. The boy proband with duplication had a global developmental delay, seizures and dysmorphic features. The girl proband with double dupli cation, had sensorineural hearing loss, mild intellectual disabilities, mild speech delay and minor dismorphic fea  tures. Other relatives were unaffected, except for very mildpossible manifestations in the mother. Materials and methods: aCGH analysis using 8x60K array, microsatellite segregation analysis and QF PCR forthe informative marker on peripheral blood for all family, were performed. Clinical exsom analysis by NGS of the affected boy and the girl, were done. Results: aCGH revealed 3 copies, approximately 2,8Mb, of 22q11.2 in both parents, affected boy and one unaffected girl and 4 copies of the same region in one affected girl andanother unaffected girl. Segregation microsatellite analysis and QF PCR con ﬁrmed that both parents carry the duplication (2:1), two children inherited duplication fromtheir mother, another two daughters inherited two copies of 22q11.2 (2:2) from each parent, it ’s a double duplication. NGS analysis didn ’t identify any additional mutations that would be clinically characterized as being pathogenic. Conclusions: The family described illustrates the pheno  typic variability associated with 22q11.2 duplication ordouble duplication. It provides support for the view that the 22q11.2 duplication/double duplication may not be902 J. del Picchiapathogenic on its own and require additional genetic, epigenetic or nongenetic factors, to express the phenotype.

Molecular bases of some cases suspected of 3C syndrome remained identi ﬁed. Patients and methods: We report 4 fetuses with 3C syndrome from a unique consanguineous family. Case 1 had a fetal hydrops with hygroma coli, cerebellar hypoplasia, severe tetraventricular hydrocephalus withmacrocephaly, facial dysmorphia and interventricular septal defect. The 3 other cases have been suspected with fetal hydrops during the ﬁrst trimester associated with brain abnormalities. Results: ES performed in case 1 identi ﬁed a homozygous WDR91 nonsense variant (NM_014149.3:c.240C>G, p. Tyr80*) in a homozygous region. Family segregation conﬁrmed the homozygous status of this variant in all affected fetuses and in the heterozygous status in bothparents, as well as two healthy children and absence in the third healthy child. International datasharing and targeted sequencing of a cohort of 3C syndrome patients have so farfailed to identify other patients with WDR91 variants. WDR91 interacts with WDR81 in the endosome lysosome pathway for early to late endosome conversion. WDR91appears to be essential, particularly for neuronal and brain development. Conclusion: Identi ﬁcation of a homozygous WDR91 nonsense variant in several fetuses with 3C syndrome in a consanguineous family suggests that WDR91 is a new gene responsible for this syndrome. Identi ﬁcation of new similarcases thanks to international datasharing would allow us to conclude on the implication of this gene in a severe form of 3C syndrome. N. Bourgon: None. M. Lefebvre: None.

 Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome due to a novel pathogenic variant in the SLC16A2 gene,P11.008,"T. N. Delchev , H. M. Kathom, D. M. Avdjieva Tzavella","Medical University So ﬁa, So ﬁa, Bulgaria","Introduction: Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome (AHDS) is a rare, X linked condition caused by various pathogenicvariants in the SLC16A2 gene. In hemizygous males AHDS is characterized by dysthyroidism, hypotonia and feeding difﬁculties (in infancy), developmental delay and drug  resistant seizures. Additional ﬁndings may include pyr  amidal and extrapyramidal signs as well as intellectual disability. Heterozygous females are rarely affected. Materials and methods: We present a 9 month old boy with facial dysmorphism, psychomotor delay and myoclo  nus in addition to hypomyelination ﬁndings on brain MRI. Dysthyroidism (elevated T3, low T4, fT4 levels and normal TSH) alongside poor weight gain, irritability and axial hypotonia were also found. Based on those ﬁndings a targeted SLC16A2 gene sequencing was performed. Results: A novel hemizygous variant, c.695del (p. Asn232Metfs*35), was identi ﬁed in SLC16A2 conﬁrming the diagnosis   Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome (MedGen UID: 208645). This variant is neither present in population databases (ExAC no frequency) nor reported in theliterature in individuals with SLC16A2 related conditions. This sequence change creates a premature translational stop signal and has been classi ﬁed as pathogenic. Conclusions: Allan Herndon Dudley syndrome, however rare, should be considered in children manifesting the typical clinical, phenotypic, laboratory and imaging ﬁnd  ings. In our case we found a speci ﬁc constellation of developmental delay and dysthyroidism which lead to targeted sequencing analysis and the correct diagnosis. Wehope that this novel pathogenic variant in SLC16A2 will provide additional information about AHDS and its genotype phenotype correlations. T.N. Delchev: None. H.M. Kathom: None. D.M.

" Clinical characterization of Aicardi Goutières Syn drome 7 in an extreme preterm infant, due to a recurrent IFIH1 variant",P11.009,"E. Phillips , M. Kerr, A. Khan","Departments of Medical Genetics and Pediatrics, University","of Calgary Cumming School of Medicine, Alberta Chil dren’s Hospital Research Institute., Calgary, AB, Canada Introduction: Aicardi Goutières Syndrome (AGS) is a genetically heterogeneous disorder of interferon 1 upregu  lation. Approximately 10% of patients present at birth with a congenital infection like syndrome with hepatosplenome galy, thrombocytopenia, neurologic abnormalities and brain calciﬁcations. Characterization of this disorder in premature infants is limited, and diagnosis in this group is challenging.We present a case of AGS type 7 in an extreme preterm infant, and highlight the role of whole exome sequencing (WES) in providing a timely diagnosis. Materials and methods: A female infant was delivered at 27+2 for pre eclampsia, IUGR, and abnormal Dopplers. From birth, she had refractory thrombocytopenia necessitat ing almost daily transfusions, as well as anemia, progres  sive hepatosplenomegaly, cholestasis, pulmonary hypertension, respiratory insuf ﬁciency, poor feeding, and punctate brain calci ﬁcations. Screening for TORCH infec  tions and autoimmune thrombocytopenia was negative. She was treated twice for presumed culture negative sepsis, withminimal clinical improvement. In the face of worsening multi organ dysfunction, palliative measures were instituted and she died at 54 days. Results: Singleton WES identi ﬁed a likely pathogenic variant in IFIH1 : c.2159G>A, p.(Arg720Gln). This mis  sense variant has been reported twice in ClinVar, andpublished in 6 individuals with variable AGS. Pathogenic variants in IFIH1 cause autosomal dominant AGS7, and account for 3 5% of cases. Conclusion: AGS7 presents with a variable phenotype, including a neonatal onset form. Phenotypic overlap with common disorders of prematurity complicates diagnosis incritically ill, extreme preterm infants. Rapid WES in such cases can provide a timely diagnosis, and inform counsel  ling on prognosis, recurrence, and end of life decisionmaking. Grant: MITO FIND, funding from MITOCANADA E. Phillips: None.

We report the sixth patient from a third family with additionalocular and behavioral features. Clinical Report: The proband was evaluated after family members with congenital nystagmus were referred. He is an18 years old male with moderate intellectual disability, mild dysmorphic features and stereotypic behaviors. His movements stop when verbally distracted and he respondswith single words. Bilateral nystagmus was noticed in childhood. Flash electroretinogram recordings of cone and rod function were normal. Ophthalmological evaluation ofother family members with congenital nystagmus demon  strated decreased visual acuity and impaired cone and rod function. Results: Whole exome sequencing (WES) in family members revealed two different causative genetic condi  tions. Homozygous missense pathogenic variant,c.323T>C;p.(Ile108Thr) in TAF6 (NM_001190415.1) and heterozygous missense variant of uncertain signi ﬁcance, c.1708G>A;p.(Val570Met) in PDE6C (NM_006204.3) were identi ﬁed in the proband. His sister and her son were both homozygous for the variant in PDE6C gene. Conclusion: The proband shares the same homozygous missense variant, c.212T>C;p.(Ile71Thr) in TAF6 , pre  viously reported in a Saudi family by Alazami et al. Three siblings from the same Saudi family and a Turkish patientwere simultaneously published by Yuan et al. Comparison of WES data from the proband and the published Saudi family revealed a shared haplotype of 3Mb in the regionincluding TAF6 gene.

Sozer",Tokdemir2,"1Department of Medical Genetics, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Department of Genetics, Aziz Sancar Research Institute of Experimental Medicine, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Isotretinoin is categorized as X group of drug by Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Teratogeniceffects are well de ﬁned and mainly includes: craniofacial abnormalities, cardiovascular, central nerve system, thymic/ parathyroid anomalies and ear abnormalities [1]. Asym metric crying face (ACF) is very rare ﬁnding of 0.2 0.6% and mimics the sign of peripheral facial paralyses. Gen  erally, associated with left sided predominance. Clinical Findings and method: 28 day baby referred to our clinic for dysmorphological examination. Her mother was followed up in our teratology clinic for isotretinoinusage during the pregnancy. On baby ’s physical examina  tion; congenital ptosis in the right eye, ACF, nevus ﬂammeus in the glabella, cleft in the right earlobe, retro  micrognathia, bilateral sandal gap, radial deviation in wrist and metatarsus adductus were detected. The right lower lip of the patient was observed to be moving down, whencrying. ACF was identi ﬁed. In order to exclude facial nerve paralysis, electromyelography (EMG) was performed. His karyotype was normal. Conclusion: In the literature, there is only one case report about isotretinoin embryopathy with ACF which was not conﬁrmed by EMG. Congenital ptosis is a common sign and maybe associated with many abnormalities, however, to the best of our knowledge coexistence of congenital ptosis and ACF with isotretinoin embryopathy is the ﬁrst reported case in here.

 Au Kline syndrome due to a de novo missense variant in HNRNPK,P11.015,C. Fauth,"1, U. Albrecht2, E. Maurer1, J. Zschocke1","1Institute of Human Genetics, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, Austria,2Department of Pediatrics I, Medical University Innsbruck, Innsbruck, AustriaIntroduction: Haploinsuf ﬁciency of HNRNPK , which encodes the heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein K, has recently been identi ﬁed as cause of Au Kline syndrome (MIM #616580). Major ﬁndings include muscular hypoto  nia, developmental delay, intellectual disability, cardiac, urogenital and skeletal abnormalities, and a characteristicfacial gestalt. With one exception, all patients with Au  Kline syndrome published so far have loss of function mutations. There is only a single patient with a de novo missense variant (p.L155P) which is located in KH2, the second of three K homology RNA binding (KH) domains of HNRNPK which ensure sequence speci ﬁc RNA and DNA binding. Due to the limited number of patients, the phenotypic consequences of missense variants in HNRNPK remain to be de ﬁned. Methods and results: We report a second patient with a de novo missense variant in HNRNPK and typical features of Au Kline syndrome. The 10 year old girlhas severe global developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, cleft palate, a branchial cyst, hydronephrosis, vertebral segmentation anomalies and facial dysmorphism. Basedon the clinical phenotype Au Kline syndrome was suspected and con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequencing which revealed a de novo missense variant c.146C>T, p. L49P in HNRNPK [NM_0021404]. This variant affects a moderately conserved amino acid, locates to KH1, theﬁrst K homology RNA binding domain of HNRNPK, is not listed in GnomAD and is predicted to be pathogenic by in silico tools. Together with the typical clinical phenotype this strongly suggests that the variant isdisease causing. Conclusion: Our observation con ﬁrms that HNRNPK missense variants affecting KH domains can lead to thecharacteristic clinical phenotype of Au Kline syndrome. C. Fauth: None. U. Albrecht: None. E.

BBS 12 gene mutations are responsible for 5 6% from molecular diag  nosed cases. Clinical spectrum is highly variable in  and between families. The main features are: rod cone dystro  phy, polydactyly, obesity, cognitive impairment, renalanomalies and urogenital malformations. We report on a new case of BBS caused by BBS12 mutation. The 7 years old girl is the ﬁrst child, born at 42 weeks from healthy, unrelated, gypsy parents. Physical parameters at birth were normal. Post axial polydactyly in all four members, bra  chydactyly and 2 3 ﬁngers syndactyly, were noted. Last physical exam reveals macrocephaly (OFC >2SD), obesity (weight >6SD), dysmorphyc features, rod cone dystrophy, genital malformations, severe intellectual disability, andbehavior abnormalities (self aggressive behavior, hyperki  nesia, food intake abnormalities). Over the last year, renal dysfunction and hypertension have occurred. Clinicaldiagnosis was established due to presence of more than four primary features included in consensus criteria. Molecular genetic tests con ﬁrmed the diagnosis, identifying an homozygous nonsense mutation in BBS12 gene (c.1063C>T; p.Arg355*). The mutation was reported ﬁrst in 2007 in two French gypsy families. Later, other two patientswere reported. Our patient brings new evidence in the phenotype caused by this rare mutation. Further studies are needed for a better understanding of genotype phenotyperelation. Albeit there is a little experience in predicting the phenotype severity taking into account the mutational load, an early clinical and molecular diagnosis may be helpful fora good management of these patients.

Since 2015, 17 patients have been described with common clinical features and homozygous variants intheMED25 gene, leading to a better de ﬁnition of the phe  notype associated with BVSYS. Materials and methods: Here we report two young sisters, of consanguineous parents, presenting typical dysmorphic features and neuroimaging ﬁndings of BVSYS, plus polymicrogyria. Patient 1 showed features of BVSYS at physical examination (strabismus, large and overhanging nasal tip, short philtrum, down turned corners of the mouth, micro gnathia, bilateral 2nd 3rd toe syndactyly Y shaped) and a delayed psychomotor development. Brain MRI showed bilateral perisilvian polymicrogyria, thin corpus callosum,temporal and parietal atrophy, cyst of the cavum septum pellucidum and cavum vergae, enlargement of the third and lateral ventricles. Patient 2 (patient 1 ’s sister) show similar clinical features at physical examination and brain MRI; she died at 1 year of age and authoptic investigations were not performed.Results (patient 1): Karyotype and array CGH were normal; WES identi ﬁed an homozygous frameshift variant c.1778_1779delAG in MED25 . The variant leads to stop coding formation and results in a loss of function protein. Conclusions: Our cases showed among neuroimaging ﬁndings also perisilvian polymicrogyria. which has never been described before in BVSYS.

BWS incidence ranges from 1 in 10,000 15,000 newborns with 85% of the cases sporadic. Genetic or epigenetic alteration within two domains ofimprinted growth regulatory genes on chromosome 11p15, IC1 (H19DMR) or IC2 (KvDMR), lead to deregulation and BWS phenotype. Other known causes of BWS areuniparental disomy (UPD), trisomy 11p15, mutations in the CDKN1C gene, as well as small deletions and translocations. Materials and methods: We describe a 2 year old girl, referred because of global developmental delay. On examination we noted macrosomia, midface and scalphemangiomas and a protruding tongue. She suffers of choking episodes. Speech is limited. She is the ﬁrst child and a product of sperm donation. Macrosomia was noted onprenatal ultrasound. Neonatal hypoglycemia was not reported. MS MLPA analysis (MRC Holland) was per  formed to look for epimutations in the imprinted 11p15region associated with BWS (IC2 loss of methylation or IC1 gain of methylation). The results were con ﬁrmed with a second sample from the proband. Results: Concurrent hypomethylation on both imprinting loci, IC1 and IC2, was observed on chromosome 11p15. No copy number chromosomal abnormalities were detected.

We would like to report two new cases of Cantu syndrome: 33  year old patient and her 3 month old daughter. Motherduring adolescence was diagnosed with hypogonadotropic hypogonadism. She had distinctive facial features, hyper  trichosis on the face and polycystic ovaries. Neither signs ofcardiomegaly nor osteochondrodysplasia were observed. Her daughter had similar coarse facial features, generalized hypertrichosis and enlarged tongue. She was born on timewith normal length and weight parameters. After genetic consultation Whole Exome Sequencing was performed. Materials and methods: The sequencing of isolated, enriched genomic DNA was performed on NovaSeq 6000. Raw sequences in fastq format were mapped to hs37d5 reference. The following in silico prediction software programs were used to assist with interpretation of pathogenicity of detected variant: SIFT, MutationTaster, PolyPhen 2 as embedded in Alamut visual v 2.9.0. Thepresence of the variant in control populations was checked in 1000Genomes, the ExomeVariantServer, and the Exome Aggregation Consortium and gnomAD. Sanger sequencingwas also performed.

Ozkinay Ege University Faculty of Medicine, Department of Pediatrics, Izmir, Turkey Developments in the genomic era and large scale exome/ genome sequencing studies have identi ﬁed mutations in several members of the CHD (Chromodomain Helicase DNA binding protein) gene family in neurodevelopmentaldisorders. Especially the group III CHD family consisting of CHD6, CHD7, CHD8 and CHD9 has well documented roles in transcription regulation, impacting in organogenesis.These four enzymes are similar in their constituent domains. While mutations in the CHD2 and CHD8 have been linked to autism and intellectual disability. Additionally, CHD7 hasbeen found to be associated with CHARGE syndrome which is a well known congenital malformation syndrome. Here in this report, we present a case having intellectual dysability,autism and several congenital anomalies and a de novo nonsense mutation in CHD8 gene as a possible cause of the clinical phenotype. A 5,5 year old boy with macrocephaly,autism, intellectual disability and congenital anomalies including severe hypospadias, ventricular septal defect, inguinal hernia, cryptorchidism, anal atresia and hemi vertebrae(T12) was referred to our department. He has also been treating for hypothyroidism. Trio whole exome sequencing(WES) was performed, and a de novo hetero zygous nonsense c.727C>T(p.Arg243 ) mutation in the ﬁrst exon of CHD8 was detected and it was found to be likely pathogenic according to ACMG 2015 criteria. We considerthat the mutation found in the patient could be responsible for a congenital malformation syndrome similar to CHARGE syndrome, causing a disruption in CHD7 CHD8complex. Further functional analysis is planned. As a con clusion, mutations in CHD8 gene, especially disrupting CHD7 CHD8 complex, could be responsible for a con genital malformation syndrome similar to CHARGE.",P11.024,T. Atik: None. S.

One of themodels discussed is chromoanasynthesis, a replication  based process that forms complex rearrangements during numerous cycles of fork stalling and template switching(FoSTeS) and microhomology mediated break induced replication (MMBIR). A commonly acknowledged mechanism for catalyzing these events is DNA polymeraseslippage, which could lead to both inter  and intrachromo  somal rearrangements. Case report: We report on a 22 year old man with moderate global developmental delay, short stature, micro  cephaly, severe hearing impairment and dysmorphic features resembling patients with Down syndrome. BrainMRI and echocardiography results were normal. Methods and results: Chromosome analysis revealed a derivative chromosome 21. CGH array analysis coulddelineate one duplication on 21p and ﬁve duplications on 21q. Follow up analysis using short read paired end whole  genome sequencing (WGS) revealed a complex rearrange ment consisting of a total of seven duplications on chromosome 21. Four out of the total seven breakpoint junctions could be delineated on the nucleotide level andprovided evidence of DNA polymerase slippage and errors during DNA replication as the underlying mechanism of formation. Chromosome analyses and WGS data for bothparents were unremarkable, thereby indicating a de novo rearrangement. Discussion: The patient described here is affected by a complex chromosomal rearrangement consisting of multiple partial duplications within chromosome 21. Duplications were mostly rearranged and one was inverted. J. Lisfeld: None. M. Pettersson: None. S. Rudolph: None. S. Fuchs: None. J. Eisfeldt: None. M. Hempel: None. A. Lindstrand: None. E",2020

Chromosome 15 likely contains 600 to 700 genes that provide instructions for making proteins. These proteins perform a variety of different roles in the body. Changes in the number or structure of chromosome 15 can causeintellectual disability, delayed growth and development, hypotonia, and characteristic facial features. These changes include an extra copy of part of chromosome 15 in eachcell, a missing segment of the chromosome in each cell, and a circular structure called ring chromosome 15. Sixteen patients who have a CNV on 15th chromosome as a resultof the arrayCGH analysis made using 180K CGH +SNP oligoarray after they had been directed to Trakya University Hospital, Genetic Diseases Diagnosis Center between 2016 2019, were included in our study. The indications of the patients were intellectual disability, hypotonia, micro  cephaly, developmental delay, increased nuchal translu cency, intrauterine growth retardation etc. Nine patients had 15q partial deletion and 7 patients had 15q partial dupli  cation. As a result of the segregation analysis, 3 patientswere diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome, one patient was diagnosed with Ring15. It was determined that 4 patients (del. in 2 patients, dup. in 2 patients) with CNV on chro mosome 15q had inherited the CNV from a parent.

The phenotype usuallyconsists of brachycephaly, epicanthus, anteverted nostrils, short neck, vertical chin dimple, and congenital heart defect or murmur. Some cases have development growth, speech,motor, and social interactions delay. The authors present a case of partial trisomy 20q. Clinical Report: 8 year old girl with short stature, minor dysmorphic features and global developmental delay. Blood culture and cytogenetic analysis were performed according standards protocols. Cytogenetics analysisrevealed a chromosome marker in all metaphases analyzed. Parents karyotype were normal. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) technique identi ﬁed the extra material as chromosome 20. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridi  zation (aCGH) technique revealed a gain in the 20q13.33region: three copies of 400Kbp (without genes), four copies of 406Kbp (involving CDH4 gene), three copies of 543Kbp (containing three genes: CDH4 ,MIR125 ,TAF4 ) and four copies of 2.304Mbp, comprising TAF4 and 86 more genes. Discussion: In the present case conventional and molecular cytogenetics detected a marker chromosome derived from chromosome 20. The array clari ﬁed the amount and the segment involved. The extra chromosomecomprised a complex duplication/triplication in the 20q13.3 region. The girl has some dysmorphic features and global developmental delay consistent with 20q duplicationsyndrome. Nevertheless, to our knowledge this is the ﬁrst case involving only this region. Every new case of a rare chromosomal alteration should be reported in order toobtain a more precise genotype/ phenotype correlation, improving risk evaluation and genetic counselling. M. Souto: None.

Seven1","1Department of Medical Genetics, Cerrahpasa Medical Faculty, Istanbul University Cerrahpasa, Istanbul, Turkey, 2Department of Medical Genetics, University of Health Sciences, Bakirkoy Dr. Sadi Konuk Training and Research Hospital, Istanbul, Turkey Introduction: Clove(s) syndrome (CS) is one of the rare syndromes characterized with congenital adipose tissueexcessive size, vascular malformation, epidermal nevus and scoliosis/ spinal malformation. Although the etiology of the disease is not fully understood, it usually occurs as a resultof post zygotic mutations that function in the PIK3CA gene. CS syndrome can affect soft tissue, blood vessels, bone, and internal organs. Its symptoms vary widely between mild andsevere anomalies. Clinical Findings: A 3 year old girl was referred to our outpatient clinic with a preliminary diagnosis of vascularmalformation. In her physical examination, there was progressive growth in the abdomen, pigmented skin lesions in the left half of the body from birth, and capillarymalformation (nevus ﬂammeus) in the right lower limb and perivulvar region. Scoliosis, left hemihypertrophy, sandal gap and macrodactyly were detected in the toes. Results: In the Clinical Exom DNA sequence analysis from the blood sample taken from the patient, a Hetero  zygous c.436G ˃A p.(Val146Ile) mutation was detected and conﬁrmed by Sanger sequence. The PIK3CA gene is named910 J. del Picchiaas an oncogene encoding 23 exons, located on the PI3K/ AKT signal pathway. Conclusion: As a result of changes in the PIK3CA gene, congenital lipamatosis has been reported to cause anomalies and syndromes such as overgrowth, vascular malforma  tions, epidermal nevus. Applying the diagnostic criteria ofKeppler  Noreuil et al., our case was found to be compatible with the diagnosis of CS. CS is the ﬁrst case reported in our country supported by molecular analysis.

CS is caused bymutations in ERCC 6 and in ERCC8 gene. Studies per  formed thus far have failed to delineate clear genotype  phenotype relationships. We present a one year old girl, from consanguineous parents, referred due to congenital cataracts, microcephaly, short stature and arthrogryposis. She had a history of reducedfetal movements, intrauterine growth restriction and hydram  nios. At 6 months of life she had microcephaly ( 3,0SD), growth failure and severe developmental delay. Brain MRIshowed diffuse hypomyelination of the cerebral white matter, hypoplastic corpus callosum and small lens. We performed a broad gene panel analysis that identi ﬁed a probably pathogenic missense variant [c.611C>T (p.Thr204Lys)] in homozygous form, on ERCC8 gene. Parental study con  ﬁrmed that they are heterozygous for this variant. CS belongs to the family of NER (nucleotide excision repair) related disorders existing a large variation in severity. Our patient has CS type 2, which is a neonatalsevere form, typically lethal in the ﬁrst decade of life. Our patient has a homozygous probably pathogenic missense variant in the ERCC8 gene that was already described in a compound heterozygous state (c.611C>A; c.1122 +1delG) who has CS type I, without congenital cataracts, small lens,severe arthrogryposis and intrauterine growth restriction.

While phenotypic ﬁndings may differ among patients, it may appear normal in the neonatal per iod, as facial features are not evident. The ﬁrst clinical signs include nutritional dif ﬁculties, hypotonia, microcephaly, neuromotor developmental retardation and joint hypermo bility. Due to neutropenia, upper respiratory infections and oral aphthae could be observed. The disease has an auto  somal recessive inheritance pattern and is caused bymutations in the VPS13B gene. Clinical Findings and Method: In this study, we present two twin sister cases with hirsutism ﬁndings and neuro  motor developmental retardation, microcephaly, mega sisterna magna in cranial MR and prominent antihelix, low hairline, camptodactyly and dysmorphic ﬁndings such as narrow forehead. DNA were isolated from peripheral blood samples taken from two siblings. The mutation was detected as a result of clinical exom analysis and con ﬁrmed by Sanger sequence. The results were evaluated with American College of Medical Genetics (ACMG) criterias and compared with genetic databases. Result: As a result of the analysis, c.412 +1G> T pathogenic variant was detected homozygous in the VPS13B gene in both sisters.

It results from incomplete midline division of the prosencephalon between 18thand 28thday of gestation, affecting both the forebrain and the face. The clinical spectrum is very wide, ranging from severe HPE with a single cerebral ventricle and cyclopiato clinically unaffected carriers in familial HPE. The full spectrum of HPE includes als o microforms characterized by midline defects, with cleft lip/palate, hypotelorism,coloboma and/or single maxillary median incisor (SMMI). HPE is phenotypically and genetically hetero  genous and was previously considered as a dominantdisease with variable expression and incomplete pene  trance. From the use of High Throughput Sequencing Technologies, it emerges that the penetrance and thephenotypic variability have digenic or oligogenic origin.

Additional ﬁndings include high pain tolerance, febrile seizures, brain malformations, strabismus, feeding dif ﬁculties, scoliosis, genitourinary anomalies, short stature, perseverative social behaviours and motorstereotypies. Herein, we report on a 19 year old female patient with a de novo likely pathogenic heterozygous variant in EBF3,c.487C>T, p.(Arg163Trp). Our patient shows many symp  toms of EBF3 related disorders, including cognitive delay, mental health concerns, hypotonia, strabismus, autonomicdysfunction, poor feeding, complex renal anomaly, neuro  genic bladder, febrile seizures, unstable gait, and an unusual coronal pattern of sulcation in the cerebellar tonsils.Additionally, she had two unexplained episodes of signiﬁcant elevation in AST and ALT (4000 6000 U/L), not previously reported. Our report provides further expansion of the phenotypic spectrum of EBF3  related disorders. Long term outcomes are not well described; our patient represents the third oldestindividual in the literature. The elevated liver transaminases remain unexplained and could be related to her EBF3  related disorder, but the possible underlying mechanism isunknown.

Stumm2 1Medicover Human Genetics Berlin Westend MVZ, Berlin, Germany,2Medicover Genetics GmbH, Berlin, Germany, 3Praxis für Humangenetik Tuebingen, Tuebingen, Ger  many Introduction: Feingold Syndrome Type 1 (FS1   OMIM #164280) is a very rare syndromic microcephaly entity for which MYCN is the major disease causing gene. The inci  dence of FS1 is currently unknown. About 10% of FS1 patients have deletions encompassing all or part of the MYCN gene. We report an additional FS1 case, carrying a 4.9 Mb de novo microdeletion of the chromosomal region 2p24. Clinical data: The boy is the only child of unrelated parents. He was born in the 32th (31 +5) gestational week by Caesarean after preeclampsia. At the age of two days, aduodenal stenosis was treated surgically. Ultrasound revealed an agenesis of the left kidney, and a pancreas anulare. At the age of 9 months, he presented with microbrachycephaly, triangular facies, iris coloboma on both eyes, low set ears, and partial cutaneous syndactyly of the 4th and 5the toes on the left foot, consistent withprevious reports of patients with FS1. Methods: Conventional chromosomal analysis (CA), array CGH, quantitative PCR (qPCR) and Whole TrioExome Sequencing (Trio WES) were performed. Results: GTG karyotyping showed a normal male result. Array CGH detected a 4.9 Mb microdeletion of chromo some region 2p24.3 to 2p24.1, resulting in haploinsuf ﬁ  ciency of MYCN . qPCR segregation analyses of the index patient and his parents demonstrated a de novo deletion. No pathogenic variants beside the 2p24 microdeletion were revealed by Trio WES of the patient and his parents.

Furthermore, this patient also has a homozygous missense variant in MCCC1 (c.1394C>T p.T465I) that represents 3 methylcrotonyl CoA carboxylase de ﬁciency. The 3 MCC de ﬁciency was con  ﬁrmed enzymatically. Another heterozygous Hemoglobin E variant of codon 26 (GAG>AAG) [HBB c.79G>A] thatrepresents HbE trait was also identi ﬁed, consistent with patient ’s clinical presentation of splenomegaly. We there  fore conducted a deep phenotypic analysis to segregate thecontribution of each genetic variant with a focus on her ocular phenotype which involves high myopia. We also set out to study the impact of the GNB5 variants on geneexpression, translation and protein protein interaction using primary ﬁbroblast culture from the patient. With increased use of WES in genetic diagnosis, more patients are found tohave multiple molecular variants in syndromes with over  lapping phenotypes.

" Mutations in SALL1, TCL1 and TCL1B genes inpatients with Goldenhar syndrome",P11.045,"B. A. Marszalek KrukDepartment of Genetics, Wroclaw University of Environ","mental and Life Sciences, Wroclaw, Poland","Introduction: Goldenhar syndrome (GHS) is a rare inher  ited syndrome. The incidence of this disease is between1:5600 to 1:25000. Syndrome is a multiple congenital dis  order characterized by malformed ears, micrognathia, oral cavity malformations and dermal cysts. Due to malforma tion patients usually have problem with airway. Materials and methods: DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes from the patients. Exons ofgenes SALL1 TCL1 and TCL1B were ampli ﬁed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) under optimal conditions, using speci ﬁc primers. The PCR products were subjected to RFLP analysis and were puri ﬁed on the DNA Gel Out columns followed by direct sequencing method. Results: During examination were detected 3 substitu  tions. The c.3720G>A mutation in exon 3 of the gene SALL1 which is a silent mutation (A1240A). Another of the described mutation is c.166G>A in exon 2 of TCL1causing the conversion of V56I and c.277G>A in exon 2 of TCL1B causing G93R. Additionally 4 polymorphisms wereidenti ﬁed in introns: deletions c.76 +36delAC in intron 1 SALL1 gene, c.120 +42G>T in intron 1 of TCL1 and c.298_34C>T in intron 2 of TCL1 gene and substitution of c.393+36T>A in intron 3 of TCL1B gene.

Case presentation: The patient had short stature (150cm), obesity, coarse facial features, mild male pattern hair loss, primary amenorrhea and borderline intellect. Her short stature and primary amenorrhea were never investi gated. She was ascertained following a diagnosis of follicular lymphoma during a preventive mammography. Cytogenetic examination of the bone marrow detectedcomplex changes including 46,XY clones prompting a request for genetic examination with following results: Karyotype from peripheral blood:45,X [12]/46,XY[38](24% monosomy X), FISH native peripheral blood: ish (DXZ1x1)[40]/(DXZ1x DYZ3x1)[160] (20% monosomy X), FISH buccal smear: ish (DXZ1x1)[68]/(DXZ1xDYZ3x1)[132] (34% monosomy X). Her gonads were removed, and presence of both 45,X and 46,XY clones was detected by FISH. Patients with ""45,X/46,XY mixedgonadal dysgenesis"" syndrome can present with small stature have an increased risk of gonadoblastoma and congenital abnormalities of heart and kidneys (similar likeTurner syndrome). Conclusion: Early diagnosis of gonosomal mosaicism 45,X/46,XY enables multidisciplinary cooperation andtreatment.

Material and methods : Description of a new case of BBS caused by two novel mutations in IFT172 gene. Results5 years old boy, ﬁrst child of healthy non con  sanguineous parents. He had retinosis pigmentosa, myopia, language delay, obesity (weight p>99 +4.8SD), OFC p>99 (2.7SD), generalized brachydactyly, abnormal palmarcreases, round face, short palpebral ﬁssures, small teeth and one cafe au lait spot. Cardiac and renal anomalies were ruled out and the hearing was normal. ArrayCGH andmolecular study of Prader Willi were normal. Firstly, commom mutations associated with BBS were studied without positive result.

We report here a woman resulting from a forced incestuous conception (father daughter incest). For many years, herdiagnosis had been Seckel syndrome due to extreme pri  mary microcephaly ( 10 SD), pre  and postnatal growth retardation ( 5 SD), prominent nose, and severe develop mental retardation. Upon re examination at age 30 years, she also displayed profound intellectual disability, absent speech, most severe behavioral abnormalities resulting inblindness (due to head banging and eye scratching) as well as tetraplegia. Microarray analysis revealed a highly increased loss of heterozygosity (LOH 25.3%), consistentwith incest. Of note, LOH >50% was detected for eight chromosomes. Whole exome sequencing revealed a homozygous variant c.3377A>G p.Tyr1126Cys in theSTIL gene. Pathogenic S TILvariants result in non syndromic auto  somal recessive primary microvephaly type 7 (MCPH7,OMIM #612703). The degree of intellectual disability among reported patients is very variable, ranging from mild to severe, and seems not to be genotype speci ﬁc. Several features observed in the proband (including stereotypic behavior, tetraplegia, and profound global retardation) are not typical ﬁndings in MCPH7, suggesting that additional unrecognized recessive variants could possibly have con  tributed to the more complex phenotype in the patient, adding to the classic form of MCPH7.

 The problem of identifying syndromes with a high degree of genetic heterogeneity and clinicalpolymorphism,P11.054,"V. A. Galkina , A. V. Marakhonov, R. A. Zinchenko","Research Center for Medical Genetics, Moscow, Russian","FederationDiagnosis and veri ﬁcation of multiple congenital dys  morphism (MCD) syndromes is often dif ﬁcult due to the variety of clinical forms and inter  and intrafamilial clinical polymorphism. It is known that in sporadic cases, the diagnosis will be most reliable with the full range of phe  notypic sings. Differential diagnosis of MCD syndromescan also be dif ﬁcult due to the similarity of phenotypic features in different syndromic forms. In such cases, the problem of clarifying the diagnosis and resolving the issueof the possibility of conducting a prenatal diagnosis of the disease in the fetus in the family during subsequent preg  nancy can be solved by the use of high throughput DNAsequencing methods. Proband, a boy born in 2013, was ﬁrst consulted with the aim of diagnosis at the age of 2 years old regarding complaints of short stature, congenital ptosis,nystagmus, severe hypotrichosis, renal hypoplasia, violation of pronation supination (radio lunar synostosis?), lobar holoprosencephaly, delayed development. Cartilage hairhypoplasia and Noonan syndrome were excluded clinically. CMA was negative. The NGS revealed a small deletion in KIAA0556 gene (c.2373delC) in a homo  or hemizygousstate. Thus, the diagnosis of Joubert syndrome (JS) type 26 was established.

The disorder is predominantly caused by biallelic mutations in more than 30 genes encoding proteins with a pivotal role in mor  phology and function of the primary cilium. Oligogenic inheritance or occurrence of genetic modi ﬁers has been suggested to contribute to the variability of the clinicalphenotype. We report on a family with peculiar clinical spectrum Joubert syndrome molecularly and clinically dis  secting a complex phenotype, in which hypogonadism,pituitary malformation and growth hormone de ﬁciency occur as major features. Case Description and Methods: A 7 year old male was enrolled in a dedicated “Undiagnosed Patients Program ”for a peculiar form of Joubert syndrome complicated by iris and retinochoroidal coloboma, hypogonadism pituitary malfor mation, and growth hormone de ﬁciency. The molecular basis of the complex phenotype was investigated by whole exome sequencing. Results: The concomitant occurrence of homozygosity for mutations in KIF7 andKIAA0556 was identi ﬁed, and the assessment of major clinical features associated withmutations in these two genes provided evidence that these two independent events represent the cause underlying the complexity of the present clinical phenotype.

Kammoun, UR17ES36 members Medical University, Sfax, Tunisia Objective: Kabuki syndrome (KS) [MIM: 147920] is linked to dysregulated lysine degradation and chromatin organization pathways. Here, we report four Tunisianpatients, who ful ﬁlled clinical criteria of KS, including neurodevelopmental de ﬁcits. Clinical Presentation: During our genetic couselling at the medical university of Sfax (Tunisia), we recorded fourpatients with KS distinct face, neurodevelopmental de ﬁcit, congenital heart disease, and skeletal/dental malformations. Our patients have respectively partial atrio ventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, left ventricular hypertrophy and atrio ventricular septal defect with atrial isomerism. Neurodevelopmental de ﬁcits were constant but variable with respectively developmental delay, behavioural troubles with autistic traits, perceptive sensory deafness, mental retardation and delayed speech with abnormal voice;learning disabilities and behavioural troubles; developmen  tal delay, psycho motor retardation, delayed speech, and mental retardation; and ﬁnally learning disabilities and hypernasal speech. Conclusion: KS is a clinically recognizable syndrome and most patients have a pathogenic variant in the KMT2Dor KDM6A genes. The ﬁve cardinal manifestations of KB deﬁned in 1988 have been revisited recently (2018). The new consensus diagnostic criteria propose that a de ﬁnitive diagnosis can be made in an individual of any age with a history of infantile hypotonia, developmental delay and/or intellectual disability, and one or both of other major criterialike pathogenic molecular variant. In fact, either with or without molecular genetic con ﬁrmation, it seems to be possible to go on toward a correct clinical diagnosis. Thephenotypic variability is linked to the nature of the involved protein in the epigenetic machinery (readers, writers, erasers, or chromatin remodelers). N.B. Abdelmoula: B.

Rolfs3","1Tbilisi State Medical University, Tbilisi, Georgia,2Givi Zhvania Pediatric Academic Clinic, Tbilisi, Georgia, 3CENTOGENE AG, Rostock, Germany Background: Lacrimo auriculo dento digital (LADD) syndrome is extremely rare genetic disorder with only about 100 cases reported worldwide. LADD syndrome occurs dueto pathogenic changes FGFR2 ,FGFR3 orFGF10 genes. Clinical signs and severity may vary, but almost uniformly there is involvement of the lacrimal systems, cup shapedears, dental and digital abnormalities. Case Report: Here we report of a 9 years old girl with LADD syndrome from Georgia. At birth she presented withmalformed left hand, ventricular septal defect, congenital inguinal hernia and kidney aplasia. Dysmorphic features include lacrimal duct obstruction, low set and cup shapedears, dental aplasia and salivary gland malformation. Her hearing loss started from 2,5 years and is slowly progressive. Interestingly she developed generalized sei zures from 2,5 years which is not a common feature of LADD syndrome. Patient was on anti epileptic treatment for 3 years and is now seizure free and drug free for already4 years. Methods: Whole exome sequencing (WES) was per  formed and c.1547C>T p.(Ala516Val) variant was identi ﬁed in FGFR2 gene. In silico tools predict the change disrupts normal function of the FGFR2 protein. Addition  ally, parental testing con ﬁrmed de novo status of the variant.Discussion: This is the ﬁrst genetically con ﬁrmed case of LADD syndrome in Georgia, presenting with epilepsy as a new feature. Genetic testing lead to more accurate genetic and recurrence risk counseling. Our case expands the phenotypic and mutational spectrum of FGFR2 and conﬁrms application of WES as a ﬁrst line diagnostic test in individuals with multiple congenital anomalies.

Lamellar icthyosis (LI) which is one of the phenotypic features of ARCI presents with dark brown, plate like scale with noerythroderma. TGM1 mutations is the most common cause of the classic LI phenotype. In this study, we investigated the clinical and molecular ﬁndings of eleven LI patients who had mutations in TGM1 gene. Method: Ten patients clinically diagnosed as LI and two consangineous carrier parents (their child with LI had died)having mutations in TGM1 gene were included in the study. All patients (including death child) were examined by an experienced dermatologist and clinical geneticist. Patienthistories; including demographic, clinical and laboratory ﬁndings, were obtained from hospital records. TGM1 gene analysis was performed using a next generation sequencingplatform (Illumina MiSeq). Results: Six patients were female, ﬁve male. Plate like scale with no eritroderma, the typical features of LI, wasdeﬁned in all patients. Eleven different mutations were identi ﬁed; eight were missense, two frameshift and one nonsense. While ten patients carried the same mutations inboth alleles, one was compound heterozygous (c.160C>T; c.1469A>G). Three of the eleven mutations (c.1148T>G, c.889G>A.

Costeas1 1Molecular Hematology oncology, Karaiskakio Founda  tion, Nicosia, Cyprus,2Pediatric Oncology Hematology, Archbishop Makarios III Hospital, Nicosia, Cyprus Introduction: The LIG4 syndrome is a rare hereditary disorder associated with impaired DNA double strand break repair mechanisms. Patients show unusual facial features,microcephaly, growth and/or developmental delay, various skin abnormalities and pancytopenia, which is associated with combined immunode ﬁciency. Case Description: 12 year old patient with obvious syndromic features with sever e microcephaly, very short stature and a very low body weight. Bird like facial features,resembling Seckel ’s syndrome or Fanconi anemia patients. He had no signs of acute illness nor malignancy. The patient is of Syrian descent and is the second child of a six member family.Parents are ﬁrst degree relatives, both reported healthy. Methodology: A custom HaloPlexHS (Agilent) NGS panel was used to investigate mutations in genes involved inBone Marrow Failure/Severe Combined Neutropenia, Anemias and Chromosome Breakage Syndrome. Sanger sequencing performed parental carrier status. Interpretation: Two variants in the LIG4 gene were identi ﬁed, c.2440C>T p.(Arg814Ter) and c.1273_1278delAGAGAA p.(Arg425_Glu426del). LIG4c.2440C>T is a nonsense heterozygous variant which prematurely terminates the protein and is classi ﬁed as pathogenic and LIG4 c.1273_1278del is an in framedeletion classi ﬁed as likely pathogenic according to ACMG recommendations. Compound heterozygous mutations in the LIG4 gene have been associated to LIG4 syndrome, anautosomal recessive disorder caused by homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations. Parental testing revealed that LIG4 c.2440C>T variant was maternallyinherited and the LIG4 c.1273_1278delAGAGAA variant was paternally inherited. Conclusion: The patient is compound heterozygous for the pathogenic (c.2440C>T) and likely pathogenic (c.1273_1278del) variants in the LIG4 gene, consistentwith LIG4 syndrome diagnosis.

On fetal MRIat 27 weeks of gestation, no brain malformation or gastrointestinal obstruction was noted, but the bladder was large. She had been treated with amnioreduction six times intotal, but the fetus died suddenly in utero at 31 weeks of gestation. The child was a girl weighing 1980 g, and she had no apparent morphological abnormalities. Genetic testing: Sequencing of DNA from the frozen umbilical cord of the third child revealed a de novo nonsense MAGED2 variant with heterozygosity. Skewed X  chromosome inactivation was observed via HUMARA assay. Conclusion: We believe that our case showed a severe phenotype of antenatal Bartter ’s syndrome due to MAGED2 truncating variant and skewed X chromosome inactivation. M. Nagasaka: None. S.

Among mutations of the pre replication complex(ORC1 ,ORC4 ,ORC6 ,CDT1 ,CDC6 ),ORC1 andORC4 mutations appear to be responsible of the most severe phenotypes. However, ORC6 mutations can lead to a severe abnormal embryological development. We present the case of an intrauterine fetal death at 32 weeks during dichorionic diamniotic twin pregnancy.The fetus had a compound heterozygous ORC6 mutation, inherited from both parent. At 16 weeks, a severe inadequate intra uterine growth associated with a genu recurvatum and oligohydramnios were observed for one of the twins (ultrasound identi ﬁcation of the fetal sex: female). There was no family backgroundaside the mother which presented neuro ﬁbromatosis type I. The parents were unrelated. Fetal karyotype by amniocentesis on the pathological fetus was 46,XY. The genetic exploration was completed by MLPA. No quantitative chromosomal abnormalities were detected. After caesarean delivery at 37 weeks, the fetal anatomo  pathological examination observed a male fetus with major inadequate intra uterine growth, bilateral microtia, externalgenital hypoplasia and probable hypospadias, associated with abnormal joint morphology and skeletal malformations evoking a MGS. His twin brother was healthy. A panel of genes responsible for primary microcephaly was performed and highlighted 2 ORC6 heterozygous VUS: c.449+5G>A variant, previously described in patients with Meier Gorlin syndrome, and a new c.360 1G>T variant, never described before and that could also be responsible for Meier Gorlin syndrome according to splicing predictionsoftware.

Vahabi","Urmia University of Medical Sciences, Urmia, Iran, Islamic","Republic of Background : One of the challenging pitfalls in the genetic counseling of patients with syndromic microcephaly is adeﬁnite clinical diagnosis to determine its etiology. Any unknown syndromic microcephaly necessitates piling up of clinical and molecular genetics data in the hope of getting agenotype phenotype correlation. Materials and methods : In this study, we identi ﬁed a novel splice site mutation in the GTPBP2 gene by WholeExome Sequencing in two siblings with microcephaly and progressive generalized muscular atrophy associated with hypotrichosis. Results : This splice site mutation in the GTPBP2 gene is predicted to disrupt the highly conserved acceptor splice site of exon 4 in the GTPBP2 gene.

A 4 years and 11 months old boy with a cMRI showing large bifronto temporal arachnoidal cysts and multifocal white matter lesions involving theperiventricular, deep, and subcortical cerebral white matter. The phenotype of the boy included mild developmental delay, strabism, slightly dysmorphicfeatures and mild hearing impairment. Molecular karyotyping detected a ~ 3,9 Mb heterozygous microdeletion in 6p25.3   6p25.2deleting 34 genes, 18 of which were OMIM annotated including the transcription factor FOXC1. 2. A 13 year old girl with Axenfeld Rieger anomaly who developed glaucoma at the age of 12 years and had surgery for ASD II in the ﬁrst year of life. The phenotype of the girl included typical dysmorphicfeatures. She performs extremely well at high school (Gymnasium) and in sports. Molecular karyotyping detected a ~ 2,35 Mb heterozygous Deletion in6p25.3 6p25.2 deleting 17 genes, 8 of which are annotated in OMIM, including FOXC1. From our cases and from review of the literature we conclude that a microdeletion in 6p25 should be considered as the cause in patients with unclear multifocal cerebralwhite matter abnormalities or Axenfeld Rieger syndrome when additional dysmorphic features and congenital anomalies are present, even when intellectual abilities arewithin the normal range (Vernon et al. 2013).

It is known that most patients with MOWS have heterozygous mutations in the ZEB2gene. We encountered a 3 year old female patient with distinctive facial appearance (narrow bifrontal diameter, frontal bossing, telecanthus, epicanthal folds, prominent antihelices, prominent ears, uplifted earlobes, prominent nasal bridge), intellectual disability, delayed motor devel  opment, hypotonia and short stature. She was clinicallydiagnosed with MOWS. However, since direct sequencing forZEB2 coding exons displayed no pathogenic variants in the patient, we performed whole exome analysis for trio inthe family. No pathogenic SNVs in ZEB2 but biallelic fra  meshift variants (p.Thr282fs from mother and p.Ala503fs from father) in CNKSR1 were identi ﬁed in the patient. There are two reports that a recognizable autosomal reces  sive intellectual disability was caused by disruption of CNKSR1. The p.Thr282fs was recurrent and the p.Ala503fswas novel. However, clinical manifestations of the patient did not match the phenotypes of CNKSR1 mutations, which were previously reported. In addition, a homozygous var iant of p.Pro284HisfsTer74 in CNKSR1 was registered 224/ 273,674 in the gnomAD. Thus, copy number analysis was performed using whole exome data. We found anapproximately 360kb deletion around intron 7 of ZEB2 in the patient, which was de novo . The deletion was con ﬁrmed by the brakepoint analysis using PCR and direct Sanger sequencing.

Morlot, B. Auber","Department of Human Genetics, Hannover Medical School, Hannover, Germany Introduction: The Hermansky Pudlak syndrome (HPS) is a multi system autosomal recessive disease that results from adysfunction of lysosome related organelles. HPS manifests as oculocutaneous albinism, bleeding diathesis and variable additional symptoms. Based on the causative gene, ten HPSsubtypes have been described. HPS type 9 (HPS9) being caused by loss of function variants in BLOC1S6 is an exceedingly rare HPS subtype, and up to now, only threepatients have been reported to be affected by HPS9. Materials and methods: A DNA sample of the index patient was analyzed by whole exome sequencing and arraycomparative genomic hybridization (array CGH). Results: The 19 year old female patient presented with oculocutaneous albinism, a bleeding disorder, and suscept ibility to infections; however, the patient was neither affected by gastrointestinal nor pulmonary symptoms. On clinical examination, the patient presented with pale skin,blond hair as well as fair eyebrows and eyelashes. Nystagmus and photophobia were noted. Genetic analyses using whole exome sequencing identi ﬁed a novel splice site variant of BLOC1S6 , c.83 2A>G p.? (ENST00000220531), in combination with a deletion of the second BLOC1S6 allele, which was con ﬁrmed as novel interstitial microdele  tion using array CGH (arr[GRCh37] 15q21.1 (45821145_46319127)x1). Based on the genetic analyses, the patient was diagnosed with HPS9 (MIM#614171). Conclusions: Our case suggests that immune de ﬁciency may be associated with HPS9 and thus expands the clinical spectrum of HPS9. Rigorous genetic testing, includinganalyses for copy number alterations, is recommended for patients suspected for HPS to guide the clinicalmanagement and to de ﬁne follow up examinations based on the clinical spectrum of the HPS subtype.

There are signi ﬁcant problems with maintaining balance due to disturbances in the vestibular system of the internal ear. Case: The patient is a32 year old woman with rheuma  toid arthritis, rheumatoid factor, ANA and anti CCP antibodies present in high titers, HLA B27 negative. Patient has Hashimoto ’s disease, hyperinsulinemia with insulin resistance, problems with balance and permanent ear implants due to congenital hearing loss of unexplained cause. The 35delG heterozygote status was detected at theage of 18. Diagnostics was expanded adding exclusion of other deletions and insertions in the 12 72bp region of the 2nd exon of the GJB2 gene, with a particular indication ofthe exclusion of the 167 T deletion, the 314 deletion and the 333 deletion. The 1555A> G mitochondrial mutation was not found. The patient at the time was in good condition,with full verbal contact, actively working professionally. Due to presence of goiter, Hashimoto ’s disease, hyperinsu  linemia and vestibular dysfunction, periodic dizzinessPendred ’s syndrome was clinically suspected. Genetic testing to con ﬁrm the syndrome is ongoing. Conclusions: The pedrina protein mutations occurs in the thyroid follicles, internal ear, kidneys, brain, liver, as well as in semen. The disease picture can be very diverse. One should always remember to think about Pendred syndromeafter excluding the most common genetic causes of hearingdefects, because through adequate iodine supplementation, the development of goiter can be prevented or regress.

Here we report clinical and mole  cular ﬁndings of individuals from a family with a pericentric inversion of chromosome 3. Materials and methods: The family was revealed as part of a study of CNVs in a cohort of patients with intellectualdisability and/or multiple congenital anomalies. According to the study protocol genetic tests included karyotyping, MLPA and arrayCGH. Array CGH analysis was performedusing custom designed whole genome oligonucleotide arrays (OGT, UK) with a median probe spacing of about 2.5 kb and median resolution of about 10 kb. CytoSureInterpret (OGT, UK) software was used for CNV detection. Results: In the reported family several relatives in four generations were found to carry an apparently balancedpericentric inversion of chromosome 3   inv(3)(p21;q21). Four inversion carriers presented complex clinical features including mild/moderate intellectual disability, epilepsy,occult spina bi ﬁda and facial dismorphism. By arrayCGH the affected family members were found to carry a heterozygous 4.35 Mb interstitial microdeletion(arr3p21.31p14.3(50,963,804 55,318,121)x1) encompass  ing a total of 79 genes and disrupting the DOCK3 gene. Conclusions: Unusual ﬁndings in this family are that no carrier reported reproductive problems like infertility or miscarriages, all affected family members share the same interstitial microdeletion which occurred as de novo eventin progenies of four different inversion carriers.

Since the name was given by Gorlin (1975), fewer than 50 cases have been reported in the literature. About 10 heterozygous pathogenic variants of the PIK3R1 gene in patients with SHORT syndrome have been reported to date. Here we report a Japanese girl with clinically and genetically diagnosed as SHORT syndrome. A patient is17 year old girl born to non consanguineous parents at 40 weeks and 6 days with birth weight of 1,484g, height of 37.5 cm and head circumstance of 34 cm. She had most ofthe clinically typical features of SHORT syndrome. Extensibility of joints were mild. Her face was triangular with telecanthus, deep set eyes, wide nasal bridge, down turned corners of the mouth and large ears. Speech delay and hearing loss were also observed. Her bone age was equivalent to her age. Partial lipodystrophy of the face andupper limbs were recognizable. She had insulin resistant diabetes whose blood glucose was dif ﬁcult to control by biguanide treatment. A novel heterozygous missense variantin the PIK3R1 gene (NM_181523) was identi ﬁed in the patient by whole exome analysis. It was de novo. The variant was located in PI3K regulatory subunit P85 inter SH2 domain. A recent report shows that biguanide worsen insulin resistance in SHORT syndrome with a PIK3R1 mutation.

Greig cephalopolysyndactyly andPallister Hall syndromes are the two main syndromic forms. Several isolated forms of postaxial or preaxial polydactyly are also recognized. We report three unrelated individuals, all from consan  guineous parents. An Afghan 10 year old girl, presented bilateral postaxial polydactyly of the hands associated withdevelopmental delay and multiple malformations. NGS disclosed a homozygous variant, c.668G>A (p.Ser223Asn), inGLI3 . A newborn boy of Tunisian origin presented with an apparently isolated bilateral hand and feet postaxial polysyndactyly. He was found to have a homozygous variant c.1673C>T (p.Ser558Leu) in GLI3 . Finally, an adult male was diagnosed with bilateral mesoaxial polydactyly of the hands associated with intellectual disability and multiple malformations. NGS disclosed an homozygous variant inGLI3, c.565_567delinsTCT (p.Pro189Ser). To the best of our knowledge, only GLI3 monoallelic variants have been implicated in “GLI3 morphopathies ”so far. Given (1) the similarity of the polydactyly phenotypes in our patients to those of classic GLI3 morphopathies, (2) the rarity of the variants observed, and (3) the absence of otherpathogenic variants, we suggest that these homozygous variants in GLI3 could be causative. Of note is that the parents of these children, who are heterozygous for theseGLI3 variants, are clinically unremarkable. This would indicate when monoallelic, these variants do not reach a pathogenic threshold necessary for clinical expression. G. Van Winckel: None. A. El Mouatani: None. T. Attie  Bitach: None. K.

Asmoniene","Lithuanian University of Health Sciences, Medical Acad","emy, Department of Genetics and Molecular Medicine,Kaunas, Lithuania926 J. del PicchiaWe report a 6 month old boy who was referred to clinical genetics consultation because of global development delay and failure to thrive. He was 4th child of non consanguine Lithuanian couple. Older brother died due to sudden infant death syndrome at 12 months of age. The pregnancy was non complicated, full term and ﬁnished with caesarean section due to placental abruption. Muscular hypotonia and feeding dif ﬁculties noticed soon after birth. Basic bio  chemical blood tests, abdomen ultrasound scan, brainultrasound scan were normal. Neurologic examination showed normal tendon re ﬂexes but muscular hypotonia. On physical examination (6 months old): height 67 cm (25 ‰), weight 6400 g (<3 ‰), head circumference 42 cm (10 ‰). The patient was dysmorphic: almond shaped eyes, narrow bifrontal diameter, narrow nasal bridge and thin vermilionof the upper lip, small hands and feet, unilateral cryp  torchidism. We performed methylation speci ﬁc multiplex ligation dependent probe ampli ﬁcation (MS MLPA) (SALSA MLPA Probemix ME028 Prader Willi/Angelman kit, MRC Holland ) of 15q11 q13 region. The analysis showed 3 7 exons deletion of SNRPN gene with maternal methylation pro ﬁle. Based on symptoms, clinical exam  ination and molecular testing results the diagnosis of Pra  der Willi syndrome was con ﬁrmed. The patient died at 8 months of age due to infection complications and there is no further data about clinical course of that case. There are only few reports about intragenic SNRPN gene variants that cause Prader Willi syndrome. We present 3 7 exons dele  tion of SNRPN gene as novel, not reported in scienti ﬁc literature, possible cause of Prader Willi syndrome. R. Traberg: None. I. Nasvytiene: None. M. Sukys: None. V.

Vieira1 1Department of Medical Genetics and Genomic Medicine, School of Medical Sciences, State University of Campinas,Campinas, Brazil, 2Department of Human Genetics, Radboud University Medical Center, Nijmegen, Nether  lands Introduction: Regions of homozygosity (ROH) in thegenome may be due to uniparental disomy or identity by  descent and may be clinically relevant. The aim of this study was to report the frequency of ROH ≥10Mb or >1% in the autosomal genome of individuals with intellectual dis  ability (ID) and (or) multiple congenital anomalies (MCA), and compare these data with a control group from theBrazilian population, including individuals from the BIPMed repository ( www.bipmed.org ). Materials and methods: Calls of homozygosity from 265 patients and 289 controls tested with CytoScan ™750K, CytoScan ™HD orSNP 6.0™arrays (Thermo Fisher Scienti ﬁc Inc., Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA) were analyzed using the Chromosome Analysis Suite   ChAS (version 4.0.0.385 (r28959)   Affymetrix ®) (hg19) with ﬁlters set as a minimum of 500 markers and size of 1,500kb. For complementary investigation, to date, whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed for 4 individuals with increased ROH in the genome. Results: Single large ROH ≥10Mb were detected in 1.9% of patients compared to 0.3% in the control group. ROH >1% in the autosomal genome was detected in 7.2% ofpatients compared to 1.4% in the control group. WES revealed three pathogenic homozygous variants ( ASPM, CTNS and DHCR7 ) in one patient with 5.56% of ROH. Conclusion: We found a higher proportion of ROHs in individuals with ID and (or) MCA. These results highlight the importance of investigating ROHs in this group ofpatients which with complementary tests, such as WES, can improve diagnostic yield.

Although BPS isAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 927described lethal, review of the literature reveals individuals who survive into childhood with this condition. Case presentation: The patient was born after induction due to preeclampsia at 36 weeks gastation. The patient had cleft limb, small nose, cloudy cornea, popliteal and inguinal pterygia, complet syndactyly of all ﬁngers and toes, absent of nails, pes equinovarus and ambigious genitale. Abdom  inal and transfontanelle ultrasonography was normal and no congenital heart malformation was detected on echocardio graphic examination. Percutaneous gastrostomy tube was placed due to feding dif ﬁculty and tracheostomy was performed for apropriate follow up. BPS was consideredwith clinical ﬁndings. Next generation sequencing of RIBK4 revealed a novel homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 (c.425T>C; p.Leu142Pro). Conclusions: BPS is rare and lethal form of popliteal pterygium sendrome, characterized by cutaneous webbing across one or more major joints, cleft lip/palate, syndactyly,genital hypoplasia, ankyloblepharon, and ectodermal defects, absent eyelashes and eyebrows, and brittle nails. Our patient had a novel missense c.425T>C mutation inRIBK4 gene. This mutation is predicted as pathological by in silico programs. Missense and nonsense mutations cause both the lethal and nonlethal recessive forms of multiplepterygium syndrome, characterized by severe organ anoma  lies of ectodermal origin. Although supportive treatments can be done life span is short so detection of mutation inlethal genetic diseases is very important for prenatal diagnosis and patient management in subsequent pregnancies.

YAMMINE,"1,2","1Medical Genetics Unit, Beirut, Lebanon,2Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon Cofﬁn Lowry syndrome (CLS) is an X linked rare disorder, characterized by cognitive impairment, craniofacial dys morphism, digit abnormalities, skeletal malformations, paroxysmal movement disorders and cardiac abnormalities. The gene altered in this disease is RPS6KA3 (ribosomalprotein S6 kinase), located on Xp22.12. Previously identi  ﬁed mutations are distributed throughout the 22 exons of the gene. A large Lebanese family with several affected mem bers, was referred to our Medical Genetics Unit for genetic evaluation. Analysis of RPS6KA3gene revealed thepresence of a novel likely pathogenic variant, c.1784A>G, p.Tyr595Cys in exon 19. This variant is located in the catalytic and ribosomal domain of the protein with a highly conserved amino acid. The physico chemical difference between Tyrosine and cysteine are very signi ﬁcant. The variant was identi ﬁed in all affected males and carrier females all displaying clinical features of variable severity, consistent with CLS. It is noteworthy that most of the affected or carrier individuals in the family developed dia betes type 2; further studies are required for a better deli  neation of the disorder and in order to investigate the correlation between type 2 diabetes and CLS.

Popa ”, Medical Genetics Department, Iasi, Romania,2“St. Spir  idon”Hospital, Endocrinology Department, Iasi, Romania, 3University of Medicine and Pharmacy ""Grigore T. Popa"", Bioethics Department, Iasi, Romania Introduction: Silver –Russell syndrome (SRS) is a rare disease associated with prenatal and postnatal growth retardation, characteristic craniofacial dysmorphic features (relative macrocephaly, prominent forehead), body asym metry and feeding dif ﬁculties (Netchine Harbison Clinical Scoring System). SRS is characterized by genetic hetero  geneity because it could be determined by: hypomethylationof the imprinted control region 1 (ICR1) at 11p15.5, maternal uniparental disomy of chromosome 7 (mUPD7), duplications, deletions or translocations involving theimprinted region of chromosome 7. We present a case with molecularly con ﬁrmed diagnosis of SRS at the age of 23 years. Materials and methods: The patient was clinically diagnosed at 3 years of age with SRS based on delayed prenatal and postnatal growth, relative macrocephaly,triangular face, prominent forehead, dental malposition, facial and limb asymmetry, bilateral ﬁnger V clinodactyly. The karyotype was normal 46,XX. In time, bone changes ofosteoarthritis of the elbow joint, osteopenia, and hypothyr  oidism were added. At age of 23 years, the patient was molecularly tested by MLPA technique. We used SALSAMLPA kit ME030 BWS/RSS (MRC Holland, Amsterdam, The Netherlands). The MLPA result con ﬁrmed the hypomethylation of H19/IGF2 IG DMR at 11p15.5. In thissituation, the recurrence risks in sibs of the proband and in offspring of the proband are low. Conclusions: Although the Netchine Harbison Clinical Scoring System is a sensitive diagnostic scoring system, molecular testing is especially important in adulthood forgenetic counseling and the risk of recurrence, also for establishing the optimal prenatal diagnosis methods depending on the mechanism of disease.

So far, 22 patients have been reported. We present two novel patients with likely patho genic RBM10 variants. Case reports: Theﬁrst male proband was born preterm with average low birth parameters. Postnatally, a VSD,aspeci ﬁc brain abnormalities and optical nerve hypoplasia was noted. He displayed facial dysmorphism with tele  canthus, upslanting palpebral ﬁssures, a large mouth with downturned mouth corners and retrognathia. There was a growth and development delay. An RBM10 frameshift variant (c.413_416del, p.Ser138Trpfs*60) was identi ﬁed, which was inherited from a mosaic (13%) mother. The second male proband was born preterm with average birth measurements. After birth, limb contractures, a pectuscarinatum, scoliosis and arachnodactyly were noted. Facial features included frontal bossing, crumpled ears and microretrognathia. A diagnosis of congenital contracturalarachnodactyly (CCA) was made based on a FBN2 missense mutation. Upon follow up, he displayed severe growth and developmental delay and brain abnormalities,atypical for CCA. Further investigations revealed aAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 929maternally inherited c.1888 +4A>C splice site variant in the RBM10 gene, that caused exon 15 skipping. Conclusion: Initially RBM10 mutations were described in patients who featured the four cardinal features of TARP syndrome. However, recurrent clinical characteristics appear to include severe developmental delay, growthdeﬁciency, heart defects, central nervous system, vision, skeletal and facial abnormalities.

The incidence of this chromosomal abnormality is 1:2500 livefemale births. Their phenotype can be very variable. Common is low stature, congenital heart defects, renal abnormalities etc. Some of these defects correlate withkaryotype   karyotype 45,X is the most severe. Other hypothesis is focused on parental origin of chromosome X. Speci ﬁc defects can correlate with paternal or maternal origin of gonosome. We used molecular genetic analysis for detection microsatellite DNA markers on chromosome X to reveal the origin of these gonosome inTS patients. We selected cohort of 50 TS patients (plus their parents) with 45,X karyotype con ﬁrmed by karyotype and native FISH. We also tested patients with 46,XX karyotype (but Turner phenotype), for hypothesis of maternal X chromo  some homology. DNA was isolated from peripheral blood of the patients and the cells of the buccal mucosa of the parents. We used the Argus X 12QS forensic kit for the X chromosomeanalysis, which was optimized for our genetic testing. The method is based on detection of 12 STR markers from chromosome X. Results suggest that 70 % of X chromosomes are of maternal origin and 30 % cases of paternal origin. The origin of X chromosome in 46,XX cohort was biparental.The next part of our project will be a correlation speci ﬁc heart defects and renal abnormalities with the origin of gonosome.

In literature there is not a speci ﬁc phenotype associated with upd(16)mat and few follow up data arereported. Materials and methods : We present the case of a 1 y.o. male of a healthy non consanguineous parents. In prenataldiagnosis IUGR, polydramnios and single umbilical artery was reported. He born late preterm, small for gestational age, and showed facial dysmorphisms and congenitalmalformations (esophageal atresia, cardiac defects, mild bone alterations, hypospadias). Transesophageal echocar  diography detected persistency of left superior vena cavadraining into the left atrium through an unroofed coronary sinus. Brain ultrasound showed dilated and asymmetric lateral ventricles. At present, cognitive and languageabilities are adequate for age but he has mild gross motor delay. Genomic DNA was extracted from peripheral blood and analyzed by SNP array (Cytoscan HD; Thermo FisherScienti ﬁc). Results : SNP array analysis showed a 147 Kb homo  zygous 16p13.3 microdeletion and a 114 kb 16q24.3microtriplication, both segregated from the mother. Region of Homozigosity (ROH) analysis showed two ROH of 7 and 13 Mb on chromosome 16 compatible with thepresence of UPD(16) of maternal origin. The possiblepresence of a residual mosaic trisomy 16 was excluded by karyotype analysis and FISH. Conclusions : This is an additional case of the phenotypic characterization of UPD(16)mat.

We evaluatedtwenty two cases resulted negative to aCGH and kar  yotyping and found the causative lesion in four of them. Herein, we describe two paradigmatic solved cases: onewithout any de ﬁnite clinical suspicion (F1), and the other in which the diagnosis was suggested (F2). Libraries were prepared using the SureSelect QXTClinical Research Exome V2 kit (Agilent) on blood samples collected from patients and family members, and were run on NextSeq550 instru  ment (Illumina). F1: the female proband presents delayedpsychomotor development, polymicrogyria, gastro  esophageal re ﬂux and facial dysmorphisms. The analysis identi ﬁed the novel de novo missense variant c.C625G:p. H209D in the DDX3X gene, an ATP dependent RNA helicase involved in neurogenesis. Mutations in DDX3X were described as causative of X Linked Dominant MentalRetardation (OMIM #300958) and variants mapping in the same domain are associated to the speci ﬁc phenotypic traitsof the proband (Lennox et al., bioRxiv, 2018). F2: two siblings were suspected to have Ochoa Syndrome (AR), characterized by congenital urinary bladder dysfunction. In both sibs, the analysis revealed the novel homozygous splicing variant c.1478 2A>G in the LRIG2 gene (OMIM #608869), associated with Ochoa Syndrome. This variantprobably alters the proper splicing mechanism, leading to an aberrant mRNA maturation and unfunctional protein (ongoing experiments). Our report expands the genotypicspectrum of the pathogenetic variants of DDX3X andLRIG2 disease genes. In these cases, WES approach allowed us to get closer to the end of these diagnostic odysseys.

Hadzsiev1,2, B. Melegh1,2 1University of Pecs, Clinical Center, Department of Medical Genetics, Pecs, Hungary,2Szentagothai Research Center, University of Pecs, Pecs, Hungary Introduction: Cornelia de Lange syndrome (CdLS) is a clinically heterogeneous developmental disorder character  ized by malformations affecting multiple systems. CdLS have been reported in children with mutations of NIPBL , SMC1A, SMC3A, RAD21 , and HDAC8 genes. Although, the appearance of classic CdLS is well characterised, the phenotypic traits of individuals with various SMC1A mutations have some similarities, but have other features that make them different from classic CdLS (e.g., small hands but no limb reductions or oligodactyly, prominentintellectual disability and seizures despite milder structural malformations, and a high rate of isolated cleft palate). Materials and methods: We present a patient with CdLS2 features, including progressive microcephaly, severe psychomotor retardation, feeding dif ﬁculties, therapy resis  tant epilepsy, lack of expressive speech, nearsightedness,high arched palate and abnormal palmar creases. Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) analysis was performed using Agilent SureSelectXT library kit and Illumina sequencingtechnology. Sanger sequencing con ﬁrmed the presence of the pathogenic variant. Results: WES analysis identi ﬁed a c.3237_3238insT (p. Asn1080*) pathogenic variant in SMC1A gene in a heterozygous state. This alteration is a frameshift variantAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 933with a resulting stop codon leading to nonsense mediated mRNA decay and loss of function, has never been reported. Conclusions: The features of Cornelia de Lange syndrome vary widely, there are 5 distinct subgroups (CdLS1 5) according to the phenotype and affected genes. Here we report a pathogenic frameshift SMC1A mutation in a Hungarian patient with ﬁtting but unique phenotype characteristics of Cornelia de Lange syndrome 2, still representing a novel phenotypic variant, as well.

Materials & Methods: Tumour samples from 66 patients, staged pTa   T4 were collected. The epidemiolo  gical data related to age, gender, recurrence, smoking habitsand occupational exposure were taken from patients ’ questionarie. RT PCR for mutation detection in EGFR(exones 18, 19, 20, 21) and PIK3CA (A3140T, A3140G, C3139T) SensiScreen ®as well as SNaPshot multiplex assay for activating FGFR3 mutations and MLPA for CDKN2A CNVs were performed. Results and discussion: For the EGFR andPIK3CA only wild type of the tested genetic variants were detected.Mutations in FGFR3 were found in 50 % from the tested tumors: 65%   S249C, 30% Y375C and 5% G372C. Mutations in CDKN2A were detected in 37,5 % from the tested tumors: 53,3%   homozygous deletions, 40% heterozygous deletions and 6,7% duplications. Conclusion: The overexpression of the EGFR and PIK3CA was not found to be related to tested mutations and so far these two molecules are not convenient for bladder cancer targeted therapy. On the other hand theoverexpression of FGFR3 andCDKN2A could be due to detected mutations. Acknowledgements: BG NSF Grants No KP 06 OPR01/ 3 2018, MANU BAN. O.S. Antonova: None. S. Rangelov: None. B.

The knowledge of speci ﬁc mutations in cancer associated genes may alter the management of the cancer, offer novel tar  geted therapies and enable early detection of other malignancies. Patients and Мethods: Twenty four patients with brain tumors aged 5 22 years were enrolled in the study, 15 boys and 9 girls. Astrocytoma was the most common histologicaltype (n ,10), followed by medulloblastoma (n ,6), low  grade glioma (n ,3), ependymoma (n ,2),934 J. del Picchiacraniopharyngioma (n ,1), ganglioglioma (n ,1), pine  oblastoma (n ,1). Genomic DNA was isolated from peripheral blood leukocytes and next generation sequencing on the NextSeq500 Illumina platform was performed. A multigene panel included coding sequences of 132 cancer  associated genes. The library was prepared using enrich ment by hybridization with NimbleGen probes (Roche). For the analysis of NF1 large rearrangements MLPA assay was performed. Results: In total, six patients carried NF1 mutations: frameshift deletions (n ,3), nonsynonymous missence (n,2) or nonsense (n ,1) mutations. Patients with NF1 mutations had optic pathway glioma (n ,3), pylocytic astrocytoma (n ,2) and brain stem tumor (n ,1). Three patients also had clinical features of neuro ﬁbroma  tosis type 1, but no NF1 variants were revealed. Other ﬁndings included likely pathogenic variants in APC and CHEK2 genes. The results were validated by Sangersequencing. Conclusion: Germline variants associated with cancer were found in one third of our patients, one fourth had themutations in NF1 gene. Thus, molecular analysis is important to reveal NF1 associated brain tumors for accurate diagnosis of the disease and personalized approachto treatment including targeted therapies. T.S.

BRCA genes are associated with %10 15 of all breast can cers. Six hundred four patients which 169 of them had family history and 435 had breast and/or ovarian cancer, applied to our clinic. After anamnesis, pedigree analyses and physicalexaminations, BRCA genes were sequenced via Next Gen  eration Sequencing(NGS) for all patients. Except from 67 patients with pathogenic mutations in BRCA genes, MLPAanalysis was planned for all patients. Among patients that had pathogenic mutation, 36 had BRCA1 and 31 had BRCA2gene mutations. The most common pathogenic mutations were c.5266dupC, c.3624dupA and c.5444G>A in BRCA1 and c.67 +1G>A in BRCA2. Sixty one variants with unknown signi ﬁcance(VUS), mostly missense variants, were identi ﬁed and the vast majority of them were in BRCA2 gene. In MLPA analyses seven gross deletions in BRCA1were detected. The most common gross deletion in BRCA1 gene was exon 18 19 deletion. No gross deletion was detected in BRCA2 gene. Four novel mutations in BRCA1andﬁve novel mutations in BRCA2 gene were identi ﬁed. In two of 5 patients with both breast and ovarian cancer, BRCA1 pathogenic mutation was detected and this was thehighest mutation rate group. Among ten postmenopausal sporadic breast cancer patients, one had BRCA1 pathogenic mutation. This rate was higher than premenopausal breastcancer patients ’rate with family history. This study deter  mines the variants of BRCA genes, their frequencies and their clinical signi ﬁcance in Turkish population.

Curcumin derived from rhizome of Curcumin longa modulates key signaling pathways in cellular processes, therefore, it is recently considered in cancer related researches for its cellAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 935growth inhibition properties against human tumors. It is evidenced that p53 is the most common tumor suppressor gene involved in human cancers. Its mutation not only inhibits tumor suppressor activity but also promotes oncogenic activity. Toxicity of DNC was studied using MTT assay and cell cycle distribution, apoptosis study.Real time PCR and Western blot analysis were used to analyze the expression of p53, and other apoptosis related proteins. DNC treatment during the time increased thecells in the SubG1 and gradually decreases them in the G1, S and G2/M phases, the percentages of early apoptosis also indicated the inhibition of cell growthin early phase. Real Time PCR showed an increased mRNA expression of BAX, Noxa and p21 during the time with decreased expression of Bcl 2. The expressionof p53 mutant decreased in SKBR3, and the expression of p53 wild type increased in MCF7 cells. Consequently, DNC can drive the tumor cell lines toward the apoptosisby modulating the expression of genes involved in apoptosis and proliferation, furthermore, this study sug  gest p53 plays an important role in mediating the survivalby DNC.

The EAF1 & the EAF2 tumor suppressor genes belong to the ELL family, locating onchromosome 3 in the human genome, which antagonize the Wnt/β catenin signaling pathway in different cell lines by suppressing the tumorigenic activity. The change of theexpression level of the EAF1 & the EAF2 genes is reported in other cancer types such as intestinal and blood. Here, we investigated the fold change of these mentioned genes inbreast cancer (invasive ductal carcinoma: IDC) in Iranian patients. Forty Tumor and marginal normal tissues from breast cancer patients (grade I 16%, grade II 58%, and gradeIII 25%) were collected during surgery with immediately treatment of RNA later. All selected patients were HER2 positive, with an average age of 56 years old. Seventypercent of affected individuals were ER/PR[1] positive, and the other 30% ER/PR negative.

Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) rs1042522 within the codon 72 ofTP53 and rs2279744 within MDM2 promoter genes are plausible factors that could have impact on cervical carci  nogenesis conferring increased attenuation of p53 pathway.We investigated the association of these SNPs with the CINand CCa among women from Republic of North Macedonia. Methods: Using a multiplex PCR SNaPShot analysis we genotyped rs1042522 and rs2279744 in 131 women with CIN or CCa and 110 cytologicaly negative women. Results: No signi ﬁcant difference in either genotype or allelic frequencies for rs1042522 and rs2279744 between cases and control was found. Strati ﬁcation of the cases based on grade of the lesion, revealed lower frequency ofCC genotype and C allele of rs1042522 in CIN2 +and CCa compared to CIN1 [GG vs CC; p ,0.001, OR ,0.4; CG vs CC; p,0.04, OR ,0.03 and CG +GG vs CC; p ,0.004, OR,0.2]. Furthermore, GG genotype and G allele of rs2279744 showed signi ﬁcantly lower frequency in CIN2 + and CCa cases then in CIN1 [G vs T p ,0.02, OR ,0.52; GG vs TT; p ,0.04, OR ,0.29;ТТvsТG+GG; p,0.007, OR,0.34].

 Analysis of PPARG and UCP2 gene polymorphisms in colorectal cancer patients,P12.24,E. M. N. D. Ajaj,"Institute Of Human Genetics, Belgrade, SerbiaIntroduction: Altered lipids metabolism is a hallmark","characteristic of colorectal cancer (CRC). Peroxisome pro liferator   activated receptor gamma (PPARG) and uncou  pling protein 2 (UCP2) act as transcriptional regulators of lipid metabolism. Recent studies have shown that PPARGand UCP 2 could represent biomarkers for prognosis in CRC and possible target for cancer therapy. We aimed to investigate the association between PPARG Pro12Ala(rs1801282) and UCP2 45 bp +3474 ins/del polymorph  isms with clinicopathological factors of tumor progression in CRC patients. Material and methods: Our study included 160 CRC pateints, mean age 65,39±8.55 years. Among them, there were 98 men (61.3%) and 62 (38.8%) women. PPARGPro12Ala genotypes were detected by PCR RFLPs while UCP2+3474 ins/del polymorphism was detected by PCR. all patients, data about tumor location, histologic differ entiation, preoperative serum carcinoembryonic antigen level, the presence of lymph node metastases, distant metastases and stage of the disease were recorded. Results: Analysis of PPARG Pro12Ala polymorphism has shown that carriers of Pro/Pro genotype had moderatelyand poorly differentiated tumor cells more frequently than patients with Pro/Ala genotype (p ,0.01). Our analysis also revealed that colon cancer was more frequent than rectal in carriers of UCP2 +3474 ins allele (p ,0.02). Also, carriers of ins allele had distant metastases more frequently than patients with del/del genotype (p ,0.024). Conclusion: Our ﬁndings indicate that there is an association between PPARG gene Pro/Ala polymorphism and tumor cells differentiation and UCP2 gene +3474 ins/ del polymorphism with tumor location and the presence of distant metastases in CRC patients.

Affected patients harbor pathogenic variant in BRCA1 orBRCA2 genes, which increases lifetime risk for women of developingbreast or ovarian cancer to nearly 80%, for men breast cancer   8%. Detection of such variant allows early screening and monitoring for better cancer management. Methods: We report BRCA1 andBRCA2 analysis results of the Hospital of Lithuanian University of Health Sciences Kauno Klinikos from year 2015 till 2019. Analysis wasperformed for patients who were at increased risk of having BRCA1/2 genes pathogenic variants according to the local laws. Analysis was performed in two steps: ﬁrstly, it was analyzed with pyrosequencing kit for 6 common variants. Later, If needed, analysis on Sanger sequencing or Next generation sequencing for coding genes regions wascontinued. Results: BRCA1 and BRCA2 analysis for 6 common pathogenic variants was performed for 1737 patients(including familial BRCA1 and BRCA2 variant cases). Pathogenic variant was found for 12,95 % patients. Coding region sequencing was performed for 647 cases, as otherpatients testing is still ongoing, 10 % pathogenic variants were found. From all pathogenic variants, most frequent were BRCA1 : c.4035delA 43,4 %; c.5266dupC   23,1%; c.181T > G   10%; BRCA2 : c.657_658delTG 4,8%. Conclusion: The c.4035delA might be the most frequent variant in Lithuania, whereas in neighboring countriesc.5266dupC is more common M.Šukys: None. V. A šmonien ė: None. D. Čereškevičius: None. I.

" Aberrant methylation of CDH13 and RASSF1 as classi ﬁers of muscle invasive, high grade bladder cancer.",P12.41,M. Pietrusinski,"1, E. Borkowska1, M. Constantinou1,","Z. Jablonowski2, J. Salamunia1, M. Borowiec1 1Medical University of Lodz, Department of Clinical Genetics, Lodz, Poland,2Medical University of Lodz, 1st Clinic of Urology, Lodz, Poland Introduction: The mortality among men due to bladder cancer is approximately twice as high in Poland as in other European countries. Bladder cancer is a result of multistep accumulation of genetic and epigenetic alterations andexposure to environmental factors. Aberrant methylation ofCpG islands has been recognized as a potential early bio  marker of carcinogenesis. Additionally, these changes affect tumor stage and grade, which may have an impact on the choice of the right treatment method. Materials and methods: We aimed to investigate the methylation pro ﬁles of selected tumor suppressor genes to ﬁnd out whether aberrant methylation can be signi ﬁcantly correlated with tumor stage and/or grade. Tumor DNA from carefully selected 44 patients diagnosed with NMIBC andMIBC was analyzed. Methylation pro ﬁles were examined by MS MLPA technique. The capillary electrophoresis method provided data for calculating the percentage ofmethylation of particular genes. A value above 15% was considered as a positive result. Results: Among the analyzed genes, the most frequently hypermethylated genes were CDH13 ,APC and RARβ. RASSF1 methylation showed a signi ﬁcant correlation with the invasive stage. Hypermethylation of CDH13 (AUC, 0,75) and RASSF1 (AUC ,0,67) has been statistically signiﬁcantly associated with the histological high grade bladder cancer and both genes are good classi ﬁers for this condition. Conclusions: This study con ﬁrms the association of CpG island methylation of CDH13 and RASSF1 with bladder cancer and suggests its potential role in the assessment of bladder cancer aggressiveness.

" A retrospective study of patients with Multiple Myelomatested in Laboratory of Medical genetics, Varna, Bulgaria",P12.44,"V. Miteva , T. Ruseva, M. Hachmeriyan, M. Levkova,",L. Angelova,"Medical University Varna, Varna, Bulgaria Introduction: Multiple myeloma (MM) is a clonal bone marrow disease of B cells, at the last stage of differentiation and is the second most common hematologic neoplasia. MМis a heterogeneous disease characterized by very complex cytogenetic and molecular genetic aberrations. Materials and methods: We performed a retrospective review of patients with MM referred to Laboratory ofMedical Genetics, Varna, Bulgaria between 2017 and 2019. Bone marrow (BM) samples of 65 patients with MM at different stages of the disease were evaluated for cytoge netic analyses and 19 of them for interphase ﬂuorescent940 J. del Picchiain situ hybridization (iFISH). Chromosomes were classi ﬁed according to the International System for Human Cytoge  netic Nomenclature 2016 (ISCN 2016). FISH was performed on BM samples and 200 interphase nuclei were evaluated per sample. The iFISH was performed using commercially available probes (KreatechTMFISH probes) for the detection of two oncohaematological markers: deletions of 17p13 (TP53) and rearrangements involving immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) region on 14q32chromosome. Results: Cytogenetic analysis was successful in 57 of the 65 patients (87.7%). Six patients out of these 57 (9.23%)had different abnormal karyotypes sustainable with the diagnosis MM.iFISH analysis was successful in all 19 patients. Deletion del17p13 was detected in seven patients(36.84%) and rearrangements involving 14q32 in one (5.26%). Conclusion: The detection of chromosomal abnormalities in MM by conventional cytogenetics is limited due to the low mitotic index of malignant plasma cells. This disadvantage can be overcome with the use of FISH, whichcan detect speci ﬁc target arrangements and chromosomal copy number changes. V. Miteva: None. T. Ruseva: None. M. Hachmeriyan: None. M.

The aim of our study was to analyseof major genes, anticancer drug targets based on whole transcriptome sequencing data for Kazakhstani patients. Materials and methods: Tissue samples were collected from 25 ESCC affected patients immediately after Ivor  Lewis esophagectomy in Oncology Center. Whole tran  scriptome sequencing was performed regarding the TruSeqRNA Protocol. STAR software and DESeq2 package have been used for mapping and de ﬁning differentially expressed genes. Results: 25 male and female (14 and 11 respectively) patients with ESCC were recruited for study. Average ageof patient was 65.5±7.7 years diagnosed with ESCC stages T1 T4. Expression level of 24 genes, targets of the main antitumor drugs was investigated in our research. Over  expression of metalloproteinase genes MMP1, MMP9, MMP10 during cancer progression (stages 2 4) was signiﬁcantly found among patients with T2, T3 stages of ESCC (p value<0.05). MMP1, MMP9 and MMP13 genes identi ﬁed as up regulated in patients with T4 stage (p  value<0.05). According recent publications matrix metallo proteinases is frequently up regulated and correlates with vascular invasion, metastasis and poor outcomes among patients with ESCC. Conclusion: Our research study showed that metallopro  teinase genes (MMP1, MMP9, MMP10 and MMP13) were overexpressed among patients with ESCC.

 Resveratrol can miss laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells from immune response,P12.56,B. Goksel Tulgar,"1, M. E. Sar ı1, G. Turkoglu1, F. Duymus1,","D. Esin1, E. Marzioglu Ozdemir2, T. Cora1 1Selcuk University Faculty of Medicine, Medical Genetics Department, Konya, Turkey,2Konya Education and Research Hospital, Genetic Diseases Diagnosis Unit, Konya, Turkey The epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is a receptor tyrosine kinase that mediates intracellular signals in response to various extracellular stimuli. Previous studieshave been shown that EGFR is activated and overexpressed in many types of human epithelial cancer. In a limited study on epithelial cancer cells, resveratrol has been shown tohave an inhibitory effect on EGFR tyrosine kinase activity in vitro. Programmed death ligand 1(PD L1) is normally expressed in healthy cells, is also expressed in cancer cellsduring cancer development and leads to the concealing of cancer cells from the immune system. In this study, we aimed to investigate the effect of resveratrol on EGFR andPDL 1 in Laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma cells(HEP2), which is epithelial cancer. We cultivated HEP2 and HEK293 (human embryonic kidney cell) cell lines as acontrol cell line. We determined the IC50 value as 100 uM. EGFR, MYC, and PD L1 gene expression levels wereAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 941evaluated by gene expression studies. GAPDH and ACTB genes were identi ﬁed as housekeeping genes. As a result of the study, gene expression relative change levels for EGFR, MYC, and PD L1 were determined as 1.145, 0.475, 2.695, respectively. According to these results, resveratrol did not cause a signi ﬁcant change in EGFR and MYC expression levels in the LSCC cell line, while it signi ﬁcantly increased PD L1 levels. It has been found interesting because the resveratrol, which is normally included in the literature asan anticancer, increases levels of PD L1 because it is likely to support escape from the immune response.

Mamedov1 1Shemyakin Ovchinnikov Institute of Bioorganic Chemistry of Russian Academy of Science, Moscow, Russian Federa  tion,2Dmitry Rogachev National Medical Research Center Of Pediatric Hematology, Oncology and Immunology,Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Retroelements (RE) are interspersed repeats that comprise a suf ﬁcient part of the human genome. The majority of them are currently inactive but functional copies can be a source of genetic instability associated with sometypes of cancer. Currently, there is very limited data about retrotranspositions in hematological malignancies. In this study we perform analysis of RE activity in childhood acutelymphoblastic and acute myeloblastic leukemia. Materials and methods: Digested DNA obtained from paired tumor/normal samples was ligated to adapters withUnique Molecular Identi ﬁers. Primers speci ﬁc to young RE were used to selectively amplify sequences ﬂanking RE insertions in the genome. These sequences were used toidentify new insertions by custom pipeline. To test method sensitivity, we prepared a mixture of cells from 4 healthy donors, with different cell concentrations. Results: Polymorphic RE insertions, distinguishing donors from each other, were used to determine method ’s sensitivity. We were able to detect 95% of insertions of aperson, whose cells comprised 1% of the mixture at sequencing depth of 2,000,000 reads per Alu library and 300,000 per for L1 library. Using our method and pipelinewe analyzed 14 T ALL, 34 B ALL and 18 AML paired tumor/normal samples.Conclusion: We designed a sensitive method and sophisticated pipeline for tumor speci ﬁc RE insertion detection in as little as 1% of cells.

Approximately 10 to 30% of cases aredue to mutations in the TSC1 gene. TSC2 gene mutations frequency is consistently higher and are associated with more severe phenotype. Case Description: Newborn with prenatal diagnosis of heart tumor. Suspected Tuberous Sclerosis. Methodology: A custom HaloPlexHS (Agilent) NGS panel was used to investigate mutations in Syndromic associated genes as per manufacturer ’s instructions. Sanger sequencing performed for parental carrier status and RNAinvestigation for exon skipping. Interpretation: A heterozygous novel splice site muta  tion in the TSC2 gene was detected in the patient sample.The c.139 2A>T (NM_000548.5) mutation is located two nucleotides from the splice acceptor site between exons 2 and 3 of the TSC2 gene. It is classi ﬁed as pathogenic according to ACMG recommendations and Bioinformatics tools predicted that this novel mutation have pathogenic effects on splicing machinery. RNA investigation revealedthat this variation leads in exon 3 skipping. Parental testing showed that this is a de novo mutation in the patient as neither of the parents were carriers. Conclusion: More than 1,100 mutations in the TSC2 gene have been identi ﬁed in individuals with tuberous sclerosis complex. This study highlighted the presence of anovel de novo splicing mutation in the TSC2 gene that leads in exon 3 skipping and is responsible for the loss of 29 amino acids, which causes the production of an aberrantprotein isoform.P.

An 8 month old boy with aniridia and his parents were analyzed for possible genomic variations. Methods: Cytogenomic microarray testing using a CGH array (135K [hg18], Roche NimbleGen) was performed to evaluate copy number variations (CNVs). We employedmetaphase FISH analyses usi ng selected BAC clones to identify the chromosomal rearra ngements related to the CNVs. Results: Copy number losses of 11p14.3 p13 (chr11:25,784,386 32,872,519; 7.1 Mb) including the PAX6 andWT1 genes and of 11p13 p12 (chr11:33,555,357  42,819,900; 9.3 Mb) were detected by the CGH array in thepatient. And the FISH signals of the probes mapping the normal copy number region between the two copy number loss regions were absent in the abnormal chromosome 11,as were the probes mapping the distal and proximal copy number loss regions. Additional microarray analyses of the parents uncovered a copy number gain of 11p13(chr11:32,910,676 33,522,409; 0.6 Mb) in the mother. Conclusion: Comprehensive genomic evaluation of a case of WAGR syndrome ultimately revealed a hetero zygous deletion of 11p14.3 p12 (chr11:25,784,386  42,819,900; 17.0 Mb) on one chromosome 11 and a heterozygous duplication of a part of 11p13 (chr11:32,910,676 33,522,409; 0.6 Mb) on the other chromosome 11.

Today, the Turkish Cypriots and the Greek Cypriots constitute two major ethnic groups in Cyprus,along with some minor groups. Even though Turkish Cypriot paternal lineages have an autochthonous quality, some Y DNA haplotypes are shared between the Turkish Cypriots and theGreek Cypriots. It should be no surprise that the genetic char  acteristics of the current Turkish Cypriot population have been determined by the interactive forces of migrations, admixture,genetic drift, etc. We aimed at elucidating the path from the interesting or unusual clinical phenotypes of rare diseases to potentially novel gene variants. In the present study, the mostrecent high throughput genomic technologies were employed to study the genetic etiology of such diseases. Accordingly, WES was used to sequence trios.

Sophia DDM platform was used as a interface to evaluateSNVs and CNVs. HumanCytoSNP 12 v2.1 Bead Chip Kit at Illumina SNP array platform was used for follow up detection of CNV events. Analysis of NGS data for CNV events hasrevealed one copy loss at chromosome 22q11 including the gene TBX1 . The loss had exactly the same boundaries as deduced from SNP genotyping. Although, haploinsuf ﬁciency ofTBX1 is associated with DiGeorge syndrome, we have interestingly identi ﬁed a novel missense pathogenic SNV in TBX1 in the NGS data.

While the deletions cause well described clinical unit with speci ﬁc phenotype called RCAD (renal cyst and diabetes mellitus), the phenotypecaused by reciprocal duplications of the same region still remains unclear especially due to variable expressivity and incomplete penetrance and fact, that they are often detectedin healthy patients. Here we present unusual case of family where the mother is carrier of duplication (paternally inherited) and also deletion (inherited from mother withRCAD) of the identical 17q12 region. All of her children were diagnosed with 17q12 microduplication syndrome. Except of the mother and grandfather, all her children car rying duplication express variable degree of neurodeve  lopmental problems, such as epilepsy, mild intellectual disability, delayed speech development or attention de ﬁcit disorder, that correlate with the hypothesis of incomplete penetrance and variable phenotype published by many studies. As a potential causative genes are considered LHX1 for neurodevelopmental problems and gene ACACA for epilepsy. The simultaneous occurrence of deletion and duplication of the same chromosomal region in one familyis very rare.

Materials and methods: aCGH analysis was performed in a child with clinical signs of dysmorphia and severe hypotonia using the Affymetrix ®CytoScan TM750K Array (Applied Biosystems). Each array was consisted of 200 k SNP and 550 k non polymorphic markers. The data wasanalysed and interpreted using Chromosome Analysis Suite (ChAS) Software (v4.0). Results: 7 month old child had hypotonia, was unable to hold his head, to sit and did not develop ﬁne motor skills. The clinical conditions included asthenia, frequent respira  tory infections and atypical convulsion. Dysmorphologicalfeatures followed wide forehead, protruded eyes, long eyelashes, triangular face, slender extremities and dimin  ished fat tissue. Karyotype results were typical for a normalmale (46, XY). The array CGH analysis revealed a pathological microduplication of a 10q segment   arr 10q22.2q23.1(75,709,593 80,912,470)x3 that was 5230 kblong and includes 44 genes. Conclusion: Application of array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) in patient with severe hypotonia,dysmorphia and neurological disability represents a great diagnostic marker compared to conventional karyotyping. The results suggest that the main reason for the variousclinical and dysmorphological features of the child has genetic background.

 Chromosome instability index: a potential humancancer biomarker?,P14.07,T. Sylaidy,"1, E. Lialiaris2, T. S. Lialiaris3","1Demokritus University of Thrace, Dept of Mol. Biology and Genetics, Alexandroupolis, Greece,2Aristotle Univer  sity of Thessaloniki, Dept of Biology, Thessaloniki, Greece, 3Demokritus University of Thrace, Medical School, Dept of Genetics, Alexandroupolis, Greece Introduction: Chromosome Instability Index (CII) is a biomarker that has been remarkably increased in cancerpatients and it consists of three parameters: Sister Chro  matid Exchange (SCE) frequencies, Proliferating Rate Index (PRI) and Mitotic Index (MI). The most important ofthe above is SCEs because they showed the most signi ﬁcant difference between patients and controls. The aim of the study was to investigate the CII as possible biomarker indifferent types of cancer. Material and Method: We used our data of the SCE methodology as it is a simple, sensitive and rapid detectiontechnique used to evaluate chromosomal fragility. Increased SCEs mean increased unspeci ﬁc damage to the DNA molecule, which was caused by various mutants inlymphocyte cultures.Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 945Discussion: A signi ﬁcant alteration in both SCE frequency and PRI was observed in patients with different types of cancer, such as breast and stomach cancer or leukemia. Speci ﬁcally, SCEs in cancer patients were almost twice than in controls. Additionally, as far as PRI is concert, there was a signi ﬁcant reduction in cancer patients compared to normals. We believe that, the co calculation of SCEs, PRIs and MIs in an index, can predict the chromosomal instability in human cancer. So, CI Index wascreated as CI ,20*SCEs +10*(3 PRI) +2/10*(60 MI). From the results it is revealed that CII (cancer)>>CII (control). Conclusions: The results of the present study demon  strate that SCEs can offer reliable results for the studies of chromosome instability and so CII could be used as biomarker for cancer and this is of great importance inpremature diagnosis.

 Genotoxicity of thimerosal and paracetamol in human lymphocyte culture Genotoxicity of thimerosal andparacetamol in human lymphocyte culture,P14.08,M. Mackic Djurovic,"1, D. Klepo2,H .N e ﬁć2, D. Rukavina3","1Center for Genetics, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, 2Faculty of Natural Science and Mathematics, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina,3Veterinary Faculty, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Introdaction: Although its use has been reduced, thimer  osal is still present as conservans in multidose containers of some vaccines or as a trace from pathogen inactivationprocess in vaccines production. Paracetamol, as widely used analgoantipyretic, is most often used for treatment of postimunisation pirexy. Pro ﬁlactic use of paracetamol upon vaccination is still present, despite the fact that in this cases paracetamol decrease immune response on some vaccines. Materials and methods: Blood samples of three healthy donors were included in the study. Tested substances were added 24 hours after culture were started and following concentration were examined: thimerosal (1 µg/ml and0.5 µg/ml), paracetamol 20 µg/ml, thimerosal with para  cetamol (0,5 µg/ml/20 µg/ml and 0.5 µg/ml/ 20 µg/ml). Cultivations were lasted for 72 hours, and analysys ofstructural chromosomes aberations was performed. Results: Results shown that frequency of chromosomal structural aberation was signi ﬁcantly incresed in all tretaed cultures in comparission with negative control. Number of chromosomal structural aberations was highest in culture treated with 1 µg/ml of tiomersal. In cells treated withthiomersal 1 µg/ml with presence of 20 µg/ml of paracetamol, the number of aberation was signi ﬁcatly decreased.Conclusion: It is shown induction of chromosomal structural aberation as sign of genotoxicity for examined concentration of thimerosal and paracetamol and their common treatment of lymphocites cultures. Suppresing effect of paracetamol on thimerosal genotoxicity in lymphocytes culture treated with 1 µg/ml of thimerosalwas shown as indicative for furter examination of paracetamol use in prevention of genotoxicity.

 Genetic diagnosis of true hermaphroditism; case report in an Angolan patient,P14.09,N. Calumbuana,"1, C. Correia2,I. C. Capuepue1,","J. C. V. D. Van Dúnem1, M. M. P. Chimpolo1 1Faculdade de Medicina da UAN, Luanda, Angola,2Syn  labHealth Medical Genetics, Porto, Portugal Introduction: The present work reports a case of marked gynecomastia, ambiguous genitalia and female body fat distribution in a young boy of 14 years of age with nofamily history of hermaphroditism. Scan tests have shown the presence of a uterus and a right ovary. Laboratory exams (FSH, LH and Testosterone levels) were also added to theclinical investigation. Objectives: To report the case of a genetic diagnosis of an individual with sex differentiation disorder, seen by aurology consultant in Luanda. Materials and methods: Initially, sexual markers were analysed by capillary electrophoresis followed by conven tional cytogenetic analysis. 200 nuclei were analysed by FISH with a probe for the SRY gene and another for the X chromosome centromere for exact determination of the % ofeach line. Results: The results of the molecular examination by capillary electrophoresis showed an atypical genotype, withtri allelic markers, similar to those of mixtures. The cytogenetic analysis of 50 metaphases indicated 35 metaphases 46,XX and 15 metaphases 46,XY. Theexamination of FISH con ﬁrmed the presence of 70% of the nuclei showed two signals for the X chromosome centromere and none of the SRY and 30% showed one signal for the X chromosome and one SRY centromere. Conclusion: We present a true chimera hermaphroditism with a 46XX/46XY karyotype and hypothesize that thepatient is a tetra gamete or chimera due to early post  zygotic error and fusion of two distinct zygotes that gave rise to only one embryo.

Apostol2,1Emergency Hospital “Sfantul Ioan ”Bucharest/ Clinica,"Sante Bucharest, Bucharest, Romania,2Clinica Sante, Bucharest, Romania,3Fundeni Clinical Institute, Buchar  est, Romania Introduction: Miscarriage is a common event in a woman ’s life. Most occur before 12 weeks and it has been estimated only 2 3% of pregnancies end spontaneously in the second trimester. Second trimester pregnancy loss has been de ﬁned as miscarriage diagnosed between the duration of gestation 12 24 weeks. Material and methods: We report the case of a teenager who suffered a miscarriage in the second trimester (19 weeks). She was referred to our medical genetics department for further testing due to fetal malformation ofthe central nervous system, meningocele diagnosed by ultrasound. We performed karyotype analysis of the product of conception and analysed 70 cells. Results: Theﬁnal cytogenetic result according to ISCN 2016 was: mos 46,XYqh ,inv(7)(p12q21)[61]/46,XX[9]. The structural modi ﬁcation identi ﬁed in the majority of cell lines (the male line), the inversion, has the break points most likely in the regions 7p12 and 7q21 and it could be the cause of the malformation discovered by ultrasound. Thenormal cell line (the female line), might be the result of vanishing twin syndrome, possible sexual ambiguity of the fetus or maternal contamination. Conclusions: Considering even the possibility of mater  nal contamination, the diagnostic value for this case is of great importance, since it still offers the explanation for thepregnancy loss. To conclude, we consider karyotyping analysis of the product of conception to be of a great value when diagnosing the causes of miscarriages. D. Sabau: None. F. Ni țu: None. S. Grigore: None. C.

The microarray analysis of gene expression in human lymphocytes revealed the correlation ofADAMTS1 ,RBFOX2, THBS1 and WHSC1 gene expression with the spontaneous γH2AX foci level and the radiation induced micronuclei frequency. The aim of this study was to assess the possibility of predicting individualradiosensitivity using analysis of ADAMTS1, RBFOX2, THBS1 andWHSC1 gene expression and methylation level of their promoters. We analyzed the blood lymphocytesobtained from 47 individuals, included 20 male and 27 female after exposure to 2 Gy of γ rays in vitro . The micronucleus frequency was assessed using FISH basedmicronucleus test with pancentromeric probes. The gene expression level was analyzed by real time PCR. Targeted bisulﬁte analysis by NGS was used to estimate the methy  lation level of gene promoters. The micronucleus frequency was correlated with expression of ADAMTS1 (R, 0.52, p,0.033), THBS1 (R, 0.52, p ,0.03) and WHSC1 (R,  0.37, p,0.032) in non irradiated cells and with expression ofTHBS1 (R, 0.53, p ,0.033) and RBFOX2 (R, 0.30, p,0.027) after irradiation. Simultaneous use of expression levels of all analyzed genes allowed to identify individuals with increased radiation induced micronucleus frequency in groups of male (p ,0.00026), female (p ,0.048) and all individuals (p ,0.0009). DNA methylation level was cor  related with expression of RBFOX2 only (R , 0.58; p,0.009). It is possible to identify individuals with increased radiation induced micronucleus frequency using gene expression level of analyzed genes, but not the methylation level of gene promoters.

Paediatricians, frequently trainees,usually choose the indication and take consent. This is often without speci ﬁc training in how to consent for genetic tests. Materials and methods: We conducted a retrospective study over one year on our tertiary neonatal unit to assess the indications, consent process, diagnostic yield and results delivery for microarray testing. Results: Of 98 neonatal microarrays there was documen  ted evidence of consent in 62% of cases and in only 2% was consent informed with documented discussion aboutprognostic information, variants of uncertain signi ﬁcance (VUS), incidental ﬁndings and possible implications for family members. Nearly a quarter of microarrays wererequested for intra uterine growth restriction without congenital anomalies, and in this group no likely pathogenic variants were identi ﬁed. Four times more VUS were identi ﬁed than likely pathogenic copy number variants. In 41% of cases, there was no documentation that the results had been communicated to the parents. However, all caseswith clinically actionable ﬁndings were referred to clinical genetics. Conclusions: There is a need to build greater consensus on the indications for microarray testing in neonates, and training for paediatricians regarding how to take adequately informed consent for genetic testing.

Although cytogenetic abnormalities (e.g. the presence948 J. del Picchiaof a supernumerary marker chromosomes) represent an important cause of abortions, for some of couples the etiology remains unexplained. A couple, both partners of 38 years old, was refereed to our center for genetic investigations. In their history a pregnancy loss in the ﬁrst trimester due to foetal cardiac defects (ultrasonographically detected) is described. A peripheral blood sample was collected and karyotype was performed from two independent cultures. Chromosomeanalysis was performed using the classical G banding method (650 bands resolution). Cytogenetic analysis, done by two observers, shown a normal karyotype for the wife (46,XX), while the husband was found to have a mosaic karyotype: mos 46,XY,22pstk +[78]/47,XY, 22pstk +,+mar[8] (according to ISCN 2016). For this case 86 metaphases were analysed –78 metaphases with a normal polymorphism 22pstk +and 8 metaphases with a supernumerary marker chromosome with unknownchromosome origin. Further studies, including molecular analyses to highlight the breakpoint, are necessary in order to identify the origin of this marker chromosome. Few casesof supernumerary marker chromosome are described in the literature, most of them of small size and associated with different phenotypes, including infertility. In conclusion, although only 9.3% of the investigated metaphases had the chromosome marker, proper genetic counseling is recommended for the couple. Although thepotential risk of this supernumerary marker chromosomes for pregnancy loss cannot be de ﬁned, it should be considered for further pregnancies and prenatal genetictests should be done. P.

 Towards Next Generation Phenotyping (NPG) for cat eye syndrome,P15.04,"T. Liehr , A. Al Rikabi","Jena University Hospital, Institute of Human Genetics,","Jena, Germany We presently work together with the company FACE2  Gene, ( https://www.face2gene.com/ ) to establish the possi  bility to recognize cat eye syndrome just by analyzing facial pictures of an individual patient. Forms of next generationphenotyping (NPG) are needed to increase further the value of any kind of genetic approaches, including timely con  sideration of (molecular) cytogenetics during the diagnosticquest. As NGP we used in this study the facial dysmor  phology novel analysis (FDNA) technology. Toautomatically identify facial phenotypes of patients with small supernumerary marker chromosomes we already established successfully Emanuel (ES) and Pallister Killian Syndrome (PKS) identi ﬁcation from 2D facial photos. The comparison between ES or PKS and normal individuals expressed a full separation between the cohorts. Theseresults show that NPG is able to help in the clinic, and could reduce the time patients spend in diagnostic odyssey. The same development is currently undertaken for cat eye syn drome. It became possible thanks to a grant from NORD. The link for the present project to upload pictures of cat eye syndrome will be provided on the poster. NPG also helps todifferentiate ES or PKS from each other and other patients with small supernumerary marker chromosomes and most likely also from patients with cat eye syndrome. Thus,especially in countries with no access to more sophisticated genetic approaches apart from banding cytogenetics NPG is a very timely approach. Inclusion of more facial pictures ofpatient with sSMC, like cat eye , isochromosome 18p  syndrome or others may contribute to higher detection rates in future.

Institut de Biochimie et Biologie Moléculaire CHU de Lille, Lille, France Introduction: Neonatal cholestasis is a heterogeneous group of rare disorders of impaired bile ﬂow in the newborn and young infant, some of which might be fatal if not identi ﬁed and treated rapidly. More than 100 inherited etiologies were identi ﬁed to cause cholestatic liver diseases with the initial presentation of jaundice. Clinical diagnosis of neonatal cholestasis is considered to be an extremely challenging process. With the advent of next generationsequencing (NGS), it becomes possible to rapidly identify the genetic cause of such disorders in a high throughput manner. We report on a case of neonatal cholestasisinvestigated by an expanded panel based NGS, revealing arare association of citrin de ﬁciency and progressive familial intrahepatic de ﬁciency (PFIC 2). Material and methods: The proband is a 3 month old boy, born from consanguineous union. He presented with intermittent jaundice from 15 days after birth, with elevated transaminase and alpha fetoprotein serum levels, very highserum bile acid concentration, and normal serum gamma  glutamyltransferase (GGT) activity. An expanded panel  based NGS was performed on genomic DNA from theproband, including 29 genes implicated in PFIC, and additional 224 other genes for cholestasis. Results: Two different homozygous variants were identi ﬁed in the child: A c.1062T>A in ABCB11 gene responsible for PFIC2, and a novel probably pathogenic variant in SLC25A13 gene responsible for citrin de ﬁciency. Both parents were heterozygous for both variants. Conclusions: Using large panel based NGS allowed the identi ﬁcation of a combination of two rare intricate inherited causes of neonatal cholestasis, needing an appropriate treatment and dietary management to avoid complications.

 Investigation of the DNA methylation pro ﬁle in children presenting emergence delirium,P15.09,V. Quintao,"1,2, Y. Gasparini2, V. Almeida2, A. Dias2,","M. Montenegro2, M. Carmona1, L. Kulikowski2 1Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medi  cina, Universidade de Sao Paulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil, 2Laboratorio de Citogenomica, Hospital das Clinicas HCFMUSP, Faculdade de Medicina, Universidade de SaoPaulo, Sao Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Among cognitive changes related to anes  thesia, emergence delirium is frequent in children and could be observed in up to 30% of cases. The occurrence of delirium may be related to postoperative cognitive andbehavioral changes. Recent studies demonstrated the involvement of epigenetic processes in the behavioral changes related to anesthesia. Thus, performing the DNAmethylation pro ﬁles is an important tool for studying the role of epigenetic factors in these events. Materials and methods: After IRB approval, children between 1 and 12 years old, submitted to general anesthesia for endoscopic procedures, were recruited. Emergence delirium was considered as Pediatric Anesthesia EmergenceDelirium Scale score ≥10. DNA from blood lymphocytes were extracted by QIAamp DNA BloodMidi Kit (QIA  GEN ®). The genomic array was performed using iScan (Illumina ®) with HumanCytoSNP850K and In ﬁnium MethylationEPIC BeadChips. Arrays data were treated and analyzed using Bluefuse ®, GenomeStudio ®, and speciﬁc packages in R environment.Results: We included 53 patients. Twenty three children (43.4%) presented emergence delirium. Eight children with emergence delirium and eight controls (after age and gender matching) were selected for methylation pro ﬁle evaluation. Copy number variation analysis demonstrated no presence of pathogenic deletions or duplications. Analysis ofmethylation raw data showed a difference in the average beta value between cases and controls in selected chromosomes. Conclusions: Our results suggest that DNA methylation proﬁles may present signi ﬁcant differences between chil  dren with emergence delirium and controls, includingspeciﬁc genomic regions. Therefore, we emphasize the importance of investigating and identifying epigenetic alterations to understand this relevant clinical adverse event. V. Quintao: None. Y. Gasparini: None. V.

 Gene expression pro ﬁling of RNA samples from frozen blood and optimization of sample storage conditions,P15.10,"E. Koh , S. Yu, S. Hwang","Hanyang University, Ansan, Korea, Republic of","Gene expression pro ﬁling is one of the most powerful technologies to understand bio molecular alterations which are affected by external stimulus such as environmentaltoxicants. In order to obtain reliable interpretation of these data, integrity of RNA should be primarily quali ﬁed, which is determined from the very moment of sample collectionand storage conditions. In the meantime, whole blood can be obtained with less invasive way compared to others such as tissues. However, blood is vulnerable to freezing andoften loses its availability for RNA downstream applica  tions. In this study, we compared changes of RNA quality according to the several sample storage conditions includingtemperature and duration of incubation before freezing, long term freezing and types of collection tubes. After simple QC steps, we performed mRNA seq to comparegene expression patterns of RNAs from various storage conditions. We found that quality of RNA samples is obviously affected by storage conditions leading to changesin gene expression patterns compared to control (Fold changes>|2|). Differentially expressed genes in this study are grouped as snoRNA family, which is involved instructure of rRNA, tRNA and so on. As a results, we set the guideline for optimal blood sample storage. By proceeding to further study, it is expected to set the markers for RNAsample quality by inducing whether these genes take charge in RNA degradation in some ways.

 Quick assessment of antioxidant effects in combined treatments measuring catalase gene activity in vitro,P15.12,"N. Tomic , M. Hadzic, N. Lojo Kadric, J. Ramic, L. Pojskic","University of Sarajevo, Institute for Genetic Engineering","and Biotechnology, Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina Luteolin is the bio ﬂavonoid with known protective roles. It inhibited genotoxicity experimentally induced by haloge  nated boroxine (HB). Statistically signi ﬁcant decrease in the frequency of micronuclei and nuclear buds was observed before, but mechanism of its anti genotoxic activity is not clear. Since HB is recognized as inhibitor of catalaseactivity as a major antioxidant enzyme, we designed experiment to assess antioxidative effects of luteolin on level of relative expression of catalase ( CAT) gene. Cell cultures from peripheral blood lymphocytes of ﬁve healthy donors were established and treated with luteolin, HB, and luteolin and HB combined. After 72 hours incubation, totalRNA was isolated from harvested cells and reverse tran  scribed. SYBR based Real Time PCR ampli ﬁcation method for analysis of relative gene expression in treated cultureswas used. Analysis of results included normalization of ratio of target ( CAT) and housekeeping ( GAPDH ) gene and statistical analysis (REST ®). Signi ﬁcant up regulation of CAT expression on transcriptional level was found in simultaneously treated cultures when compared with cul  tures treated with each substance individually. In luteolin treated cultures when compared to HB treated cultures CAT expression was down regulated but not statistically sig  niﬁcant. In comparison to control (DMSO), CAT expression was up regulated in simultaneously treated cultures but in individually treated cultures it was down regulated, with no statistical signi ﬁcance. Obtained results may indicate that new approaches to the treatment of skin changes with HB should include luteolin and monitoring corresponding antioxidant system. For more precise determination ofluteolin effects and potential, more treatments and genes should be explored. N. Tomic: None. M. Hadzic: None. N. Lojo Kadric: None. J. Ramic: None. L. Pojskic: None.

Rost1,"1Institute of Human Genetics, Wuerzburg, Germany,","2iCoSys, Fribourg, Switzerland,3Phenosystems SA, Braine le Chateau, Belgium Introduction: Whole genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more and more meaningful not only in humangenetic research but also for future molecular genetic diagnostics. The main challenges in WGS lie in data ana  lysis and variant interpretation rather than in the sequencingtechnology itself. The detection of disease causing variants in those extensive genome data requires the application of appropriate software tools. Materials and methods: Here we present the data analyses of four genomes from patients with muscular dystrophies (without mutations using gene panel or exomesequencing) by applying the software GensearchNGS (PhenoSystems). We used integrated variant calling, CNV tools and anomaly scans together with external tools (e.g.cnMops, Alamut, CADD) to analyze and validate the patient ’s data (see table).

Recent works endorse RNA Seq as a complementary technique that would provide more evidences to lead to a diagnostic. Although promising results, methodological and quality issues must be determined to ensure clinical validity/utility of the study.

 Try to ﬁnd the somatic mutation in the brain!,P15.20,"J. KártesziGenetic Laboratory, Zalaegerszeg, Hungary",It was demonstrated in recent years that somatic mutations,"happen in neuronal stem cells. However, the effect of somatic mutations during tumorigenesis had been provenlong time ago. We also know that some clue oncogenes have important role in neurodevelopment and maintenance of brain integrity. Based on common regulatory pathways inboth tumorigenesis and neurodegeneration I discuss the possible use of oncogenetic research evidences in the explanation of devastating neurogenic diseases. “Loss of heterozygosity ”is widely used in tumour genetics. On the other hand, plenty of neurogenic disorders were described with “dominant negative effect ”which meant loss of function of the effected genes. Data were collected that until the normal allele functioned well this effect didn ’t work. Somatic mutation in neuronal stem cells containing agermline mutation may destroy the function of the normal allele. I propose that neurodegeneration can be clonal dis  order in some instances. The complicated pathogenesis ofParkinson disease is highly studied and GBA (beta gluco  cerebrosidase) gene heterozygous mutations were found more frequently in the familial form of the disease. Gaucherdisease is an autosomal recessive lysosomal storage dis  order caused by glucocerebrosidase de ﬁciency. It was detected that Parkinson disease is more frequent in Gauchertype I patients but also in the carrier parents. Liquid biopsy is well known in tumour research. Let ’s try to use it to ﬁnd the somatic mutation in the brain! The ﬁrst successful step in this direction may also lead to the understanding of a subset of autosomal dominant neuronal diseases with incomplete penetrance. J. Kárteszi: None.E",2020

Currently, there are no screening methods for asses  sing genetic predisposition to UCEC, so the development of anapproach to analyzing the results of genetic testing, devoid of the previously described shortcomings and providing identi ﬁ  cation of variants characterist ic of multifactorial pathology, is an actual problem. Objective: to develop an approach to identify patterns in the results of genetic testing that are typical for patients with multifactorial cancer and to develop a geneticpanel for screening for predisposition to UCEC. Materials and methods: For a set of genes, the analysis of refereed scienti ﬁc articles on the following keyw ords was performed:"" Uterine Corpus Endometrial Carcinoma "","" predisposition"","" muta  tion"",""SNP"". Data from TumorPortal was used to evaluate the model ’s performance ( http://www.tumorportal.org/ )a n dt h e Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA). Based on the data, two groups were formed: patients with UCEC (n ,248) and a control cohort of patients with other nosologies (n ,6498).

 The ﬁrst Albanian case of Waardenburg syndrome type 4A,P15.22,A.Laku   Babameto,"Service of Genetic Laboratory, University of Medicine,","University Hospital Cenetr “Mother Teresa ”, Tirana, Albania954 J. del PicchiaWaardenburg syndrome type 4 (WS4), is a very rare con  genital disorder with variable clinical expression, char  acterised by Hirschsprung disease, and abnormal melanocyte migration, resulting in pigmentary abnormalities and sen  sorineural deafness. Three disease causing genes have been identi ﬁed: mutations in the SOX10 ,END3 ,o rEDNRB genes are known to cause WS type IV. Variants in the endothelin   B receptor (EDNRB) gene on 13q22 region have been found to cause the Waardenburg syndrome type IVA (WS 4A),that combines clinical features of pigmentary abnormalities of the skin, hair and irides, sensorineural hearing loss, and Hirschprung disease. We report a 15 months   old albanianboy who was diagnosed as WS IVA. He presented clinical manifestations as skin and hair hypopigmentation, hyperte  lorism, broad nasal bridge, epicanthal folds, bilateral bluehomochromatic irides, mild developmental delay, muscular hypotonia, short stature and constipation. The entire exome has been evaluated for variants clinically relevant to thedescribed phenotype by the whole exome sequencing, but it was not detected any variant indicative of the genetic diag  nosis of the patient. The diagnosis was con ﬁrmed by chro  mosomal microarray analysis. It was detected a 23153 kb one copy loss on the long arm of chromosome 13.

 Generation of whole exome libraries with a wide rangeof fragment length with the Nextera Flex bead linked transposome approach to improve genotypability,P15.23,B. Iadarola,"1, M. Rossato1, M. Paterno1, D. Lavezzari1,","C. Degli Esposti1, C. De Quattro1, B. Giovannone1, G. Bhattacharjee2, R. Tim2, M. You2, M. Delledonne1 1University of Verona, Verona, Italy,2Illumina, San Diego, CA, United States Introduction: Short read sequencing in targeted resequen  cing prevents the identi ﬁcation of clinically relevant genetic variants within or in close proximity to duplicate genomic regions. We recently found that the analysis of fragments longer than standard size improves mapping quality andthus genotypability of many clinically relevant genomic regions. However, modulating fragment length in enzy  matic based library preparation is challenging, as optimalratio between DNA/enzymes is not easily identi ﬁable or because bead linked transposome chemistry is setup for astandard DNA size. In this study we tested the possibility to modulate fragment length in exome libraries using the standard or a modi ﬁed version of the Nextera Flex for Enrichment bead linked transposome (Illumina), extending fragment length up to 550bp. M&M: Genomic libraries were obtained with the standard Nextera Flex for Enrichment Library Prep kit or its new modiﬁed version (not commercially available yet), and subsequently enriched in exonic portions with the IlluminaExome Panel. Libraries have been sequenced in 150PE to 80X mapped coverage. Results: Genomic libraries with different fragment lengths (200, 300, 400, 500bp) have been successfully generated by adjusting simple experimental conditions such as bead based size selection and PCR extension time.Exome enrichment did not change the different fragment sizes, that were subsequently con ﬁrmed by sequencing. Target coverage and number of variants across the multiplefragment sizes are being evaluated. Conclusions: The availability of two distinct bead based transposome library prep kits will allow to generate librarieswith a wide range of fragment size, thus permitting to modulate/improve genotypability in targeted resequencing.

Gemelli IRCCS, Rome, 00168, Italy,3Catholic University of the Sacred Heart, Rome, ItalyAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 955Introduction: Most of the commercial sequencing methods use blood as primary sample source of genomic DNA (gDNA). Buccal swab is an emerging sample collection device due to convenient and non invasive characteristics. This study assesses the suitability of buccal swab as gDNA source and evaluates the performance of Next GenerationSequencing (NGS) Devyser kit for detecting BRCA patho  genic variants (PVs). Materials and methods: Swabs and blood samples were collected from 5 healthy and 3 BRCA PVs carriers. Buccal swabs were obtained using FLOQ Swab (COPAN, Brescia, Italy) placed with NAO basket. Both sample types wereextracted using the QIAmp DNA Mini kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). NGS Devyser BRCA kit (Devyser, Hägersten, Sweden) was used for the BRCA ampli ﬁcation. Sequencing was performed on MiSeq platform (Illumina, CA, US). Quality parameters were evaluated from sequencing data. NGS data were analyzed by Amplicon Suite (SmartSeq,Novara, Italy). Results: Concentration and quality of DNA extracted from buccal swab samples were adequate for librarypreparation and sequencing. Comparable quality parameters result from the evaluation of NGS data across samples types. BRCA genetic alterations (SNPs, PVs, CNV) detected in buccal DNA swabs were concordant with those from matched blood samples. Conclusions: Devyser BRCA NGS kit performs as well with buccal swabs collected using Copan FLOQ Swab as it does with samples collected from blood. Similar genotyping performances between the two DNA sources wereobserved, supporting the use of buccal swabs as alternative sample type in NGS.

Quaio Fleury Medicina e Saúde, S ão Paulo, Brazil Introduction: Commercial tests for carrier status determi  nation of common autosomal recessive conditions are cur  rently offered in Brazil. Nevertheless, frequency of rareautosomal recessive alleles has not been established for the Brazilian population. Therefore, clinical utility of these tests is not determined for this speci ﬁc population. Methods: We actively searched for pathogenic variants in autosomal recessive conditions, not the primary objective of analysis, in 100 whole exomes performed for diagnosticpurposes in a private laboratory in Brazil. Common variants (e.g., frequency >1%) in common recessive conditions (HFE, SERPINE1, BTD) were excluded from our analysis.We reviewed the methodology of three commercial tests for carrier status and assessed whether variants found in our cohort were covered by these commercial kits. Results: Rare pathogenic variants in genes associated with autosomal recessive conditions were found in 37% of patients. Among these patients, 40,5% presented more thanone variant. Average number of genes tested by commercial kits was 433. More than half (54%) of variants found were not universally covered by all commercial kits assessed. Asfor individual laboratories, coverage of recessive variants varied from 45% to 66,5%. Conclusion: Information about limited sensitivity for carrier status panels for pathogenic variants in Brazilian patients should be addressed in genetic counselling to avoid false reassurance and adjusting expectations from couples.The usage of larger target gene panels, or even whole exome sequencing, might overcome this limitation.

Auer Grumbach4 1Telemark Hospital Trust, Skien, Norway,2Medical Uni  versity of Vienna, Vienna, Austria,3Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway,4LMU Munich University Hospital, Munich, Germany Introduction: TheMME  gene encodes a widely expressed zinc dependent metalloendopeptidase (Neprilysin). Biallelic sequence variants in MME cause axonal Charcot Marie  Tooth disease and fetomaternal alloimmune membranous glomerulopathy, while heterozygous variants are suscept  ibility factors for axonal Charcot Marie Tooth disease. Theframeshift deletion NM_007289.3( MME ):c.467delC956 J. del Picchia(p.Pro156Leufs*14) has been reported as a dominant sus  ceptibility factor and as a cause of recessive neuropathy. Materials and methods: We present three axonal neuropathy families and three simplex individuals carrying theMME c.467delC variant. Probands underwent Next  Generation Sequencing (NGS); most relatives were Sangersequenced. Results: NGS identi ﬁed heterozygous c.467delC in the probands with familial disease and in two simplex cases.The last simplex case was homozygous. Subsequent Sanger analysis con ﬁrmed these results in all cases. Six additional relatives appeared to be homozygotes by Sanger sequen cing. However, NGS showed these six individuals to be heterozygotes. Further investigation revealed a highly polymorphic AT repeat in close proximity to the variant.All heterozygous individuals who appeared homozygous for c.467delC were heterozygous for the AT repeat (8AT/ 13AT). The heterozygous individuals were homozygous forthe AT repeat. Conclusions: A heterozygous AT repeat situated in close proximity to MME c.467delC causes allele dropout on Sanger sequencing; heterozygotes appear to be homozy  gotes. An incorrect diagnosis and cascade testing may have a large clinical impact. This highlights that even a smalldifference in nucleotides outside the primer binding sites may cause allele dropout. H.T.

We present a casestudy of a patient diagnosed with cancer where three indi  vidual molecular tests were utilized in the care continuum. Case Presentation: A 56 yo Caucasian female diagnosed with stage IIIc ovarian clear cell carcinoma was treated with total abdominal hysterectomy with bilateral salpingooophor  ectomy, omentectomy, appendectomy, lymph node sam pling, peritonectomy, and optimal tumor debulking in June, 2018. Comprehensive genomic pro ﬁling for tumormolecules and diagnostic testing for hereditary cancer predisposition syndrome was performed to identify inherited risk and consider use of PARP inhibitor therapy. Treatment withﬁrst line adjuvant chemotherapy concluded in October 2018. The patient relapsed (Jan 2019) and was enrolled in clinical trial GYO16, receiving pembrolizumab infusionswith oral epacadostat. In Feb 2019, ctDNA was monitored using a bespoke assay designed from matched normal whole exome sequencing. ctDNA was initially detected (4.61MTM/mL) and continued to increase across multiple timepoints (15.33 MTM/mL), consistent with the patient ’s reported progressive disease and exit from GYO16 study inNov. 2019. Positive ctDNA results allow opportunity to monitor treatment response and trending disease burden through longitudinal screening of ctDNA levels. Conclusion: This case study utilized three different molecular tests to inform and monitor cancer treatment.

 Comparison of DNA extraction methods for samplesfrom old blood collections,P16.07,"S. Samut Tagliaferro , A. Zejnelagic, R. Farrugia,",S. Bezzina Wettinger,"University of Malta, Msida, MaltaIntroduction: Limited information is available on which methods are suitable to extract DNA from 20 year oldblood samples and samples kept in non ideal storage con  ditions. The aims of this study were to assess if DNA can be extracted from whole blood collected and stored at  20 °Cfor 7 20 years, and to identify which commercial DNA extraction kit is most suitable for this purpose, yielding good quality DNA. Materials and methods: Nine whole blood samples collected in 1999, 2001 and 2012, all having low (between 100μL to 200 μL) blood volumes, were used in this study. DNA extraction was performed using three different DNA extraction kits, according to their respective instructions. Results: The Quick DNA Miniprep Plus kit produced the highest DNA yield ranging from 0.51 –20.2 µg, followed by the DNeasy Blood and Tissue kit which gave DNA yields ranging between 0.30 µg and 2.92 µg. In contrast, theMagAttract HMW DNA kit was less ef ﬁcient at extracting DNA from these samples, with DNA yields ranging between 0.16 and 0.80 µg. The average yield was notaffected by the age of the sample. Conclusion: From the results obtained, it can be concluded that good quality DNA can be extracted fromwhole blood samples biobanked for 18 to 20 years at  20 °C. This study was limited by the small number of samples. DNA concentrations were not affected by thenumber of years the blood sample was stored, but were affected by the type of kit used to extract the DNA. S. Samut Tagliaferro: None. A. Zejnelagic: None.

 Low density oligonucleotide microarray for the detec tion of ethnospeci ﬁc mutations causing ﬁve genetic disorders prevalent among the Yakut population,P16.08,"M. Savvina , N. Maksimova, A. Sukhomyasova","North Eastern federal university, Yakutsk, Russian Federa","tion In yakut population of republic of Sakha (Yakutia) serious genetic disorders occur with relatively high frequency. Thereis a pressing need for comprehensive carrier screening and molecular diagnostic, but methods of genetic diagnostics that commonly used today are not able to afford it due to the highcost and time consumption for a single test. For such pur  poses, we developed an ethnicity speci ﬁc assay based on DNA microarray. Microarray is designed to address mostprevalent mutations among yakut population: 4582_4583insT inCUL7 gene,с.5741G >Ai n NBAS gene,с.806С>ТinDIA1 gene, c.1090G>C in FAH gene, c. 23 +1G>A in GBJ2 gene causing 3 M syndrome, SOPH syndrome, Tyrosinemia type 1, Methaemoglobinaemia type 1, Nonsyndromic hearing loss and deafness (DFNB1) type 1A respectively. Oligonucleotideprobes printed onto aldehyde group coated glass slides using non contact microarrayer. The assay based on reverse hybri  dization, which include two step multiplex PCR reactionswith production of one stranded Cy5 labeled PCR products following its hybridization with oligonucleotide probes. Using this microarray, we estimated heterozygose carrier frequencyin 120 healthy people of yakut ethnicity and validated data by real time PCR and PCR RLFP methods. The evaluation of this microarray demonstrates that it is comprehensive, robust,sensitive, speci ﬁc, and easily modi ﬁable. The developed assay can be considered as an alternative cost effective tool for genetic screening purposes and it is suitable for both carrierscreening and disease diagnostics in yakut population in the republic of Sakha (Yakutia).

More than 70 laboratories in constitutionalcytogenetics, hematology and array CGH participate each year. The evolution of our practices requires continuously adaptation but these EQAs and their European equivalentshave made us aware of the state of knowledge and certain limitations reveal the loss of competence in classical cyto  genetic analysis as well as of molecular pangenomic tech niques. Indeed we have identi ﬁed technical gaps or pitfalls that we will illustrate with 2 examples. Postnatal Cytoge  netics: We proposed a pericentric chromosome 5 inversioninv(5)(p13q13) considered a variant in the literature. A large discrepancy was observed between laboratories reporting this chromosome a polymorphism and others reasoning as aclassic pericentric inversion. The ""youngest"" cytogeneticists have lost experience regarding a variant not recently reported in the literature. Postnatal Array CGH: The secondproposed case involved a caryotype validated pentasomy X. Surprisingy some laboratories missed the pentasomy. They concluded a trisomy or tetrasomy mosaicism. The expla nation may lie in the limitations of the assessment of the copy number by algorithms used in the presence of unusual ratios especially at the level of gonosomes, a too fast ana lysis or a technique that did not allow to evaluate a large number of chromosome X copies. This exercise allowed us to observe the limitations of certain computational algo rithms and remind us of the importance of maintaining a solid formation in classical cytogenetic analysis to best interpret the results from pangenomic molecular techniques(array CGH, WGS/WES).

Sample collectiondoes not require trained professionals or dedicated facilities. The preanalytical work ﬂow should minimize DNA degra  dation and fragmentation. This study demonstrates the compatibility of QIAGEN gDNA sample preparation kits with different saliva collection devices, as part of a work  ﬂow for extraction of high quality, intact salivary gDNA. Methods: Saliva was collected from 10 healthy indivi  duals using six different collection devices, according to manufacturer ’s collection instructions. gDNA was extracted using either QIAamp technology (manual) or the QIA  symphony instrument (automated) and quality and quantity were spectrophotometrically assessed. A qPCR assaytargeting human β Actin and the QIAGEN Investigator Quantiplex Pro RGQ Kit, a multiplex gene assay, were used to evaluate compatibility with qPCR. The Agilent TapeSta tion 4200 was used for fragmentation analysis. Results: High donor to donor variability was observed, but there was no signi ﬁcant difference in total yield between the saliva collection devices used. DNA purity was assessed byA 260/A280ratio, showing good sample quality with both extraction methods. Intact gDNA was recovered andshowed low fragmentation of high molecular weight gDNA. Samples analyzed demonstrated consistent and stable performance in qPCR applications, showing noinhibition. Conclusions: QIAGEN gDNA sample preparation kits are compatible with various saliva collection devices. Therecovered gDNA is intact high molecular weight DNA and can be used in ampli ﬁcation based qPCR assays. C. Lowe: A. Employment (full or part time); Modest; QIAGEN GmbH. L. Erkelenz: A.

The KANSL1 gene is located on the 17q21.31 locus, which has been subjected to structural divergence in humans. The common structural 17q21.31 haplotypes diverge mainly in the direction of the inversionand the copy number state of KANSL1 , affecting exons 1 to 3 of the gene. The architecture of this genomic region sig  niﬁes a challenge for the clinical interpretation of KANSL1 variants as reported by Koolen et al in 2016. We present several cases illustrating strategies to ascertain the putative clinical signi ﬁcance of single nucleotide variants located within exons 1 3 of KANSL1 (NM_001193466.1). These cases corroborate that partial polymorphic duplications of the 17q21.31 region confound the clinical relevance of theKANSL1 variants. Consequently, the same pathogenic var  iant can be causative in some individuals, while clinically irrelevant in others. Hence, parental testing demonstratingthede novo state of the variant in index patients is critical evidence supporting its pathogenicity. Importantly, in cases where parental testing is not performed, the variant allelefrequencies combined with copy number analysis can be used to disentangle the genomic architecture at the locus and consolidate (or exclude) the diagnosis of the syndrome.

TS case was a woman with personal (age 54) andfamily history of breast cancer. For both cases, breast cancer gene panel analysis did not detect any pathogenic variant but chromosome X control probes showed abnormal results:presence of two chromosomes X for the man and one chromosome X for the woman.

 Exceptionally late diagnosis of patient with Prader Willi Syndrome,P16.18,"K. A. Zapart , M. Malarska","Medical University of Lodz, Łódź, Poland","Prader Willi Syndrome is an uncommon imprinting dis  order, caused usually by the deletion of the paternal copy in15q11 q13 region. Average age of patients diagnosed is not older than 3 years of age when syndromes like hipotonia, feeding dif ﬁculties and delayed development, including hypogonadism arise. Distinctive facial features in particular almond shaped eyes, a narrowing of the head at the temples, a turned down mouth and a thin upper lip are noticed.Nevertheless, the main complications come from sequelae of hyperfagia, thus obesity and intellectual impairment. Still, early diagnosis can prevent most of them. This study presents a case of 27 year old man, who was admitted to general practitioner because of memory problems. He had never been to genetics clinic before.Obese patient (BMI:47), with distinctive facial traits, reports learning dif ﬁculties and poor short term memory. One to  one tuition during his schooling age was necessary. Duringhis childhood, a psychologist diagnosed him with person  ality disorders. Although he likes playing video games, he ﬁnds it dif ﬁcult to focus on things. He also reports photophobia and constant hunger. Since all those symptoms were unusual for PWS he was ﬁ nally referred to a specialist. Because of nonspeci ﬁc symptoms and low incidence, the diagnosis presents a challenge to pediatricians and requires skilled eye and experience.

Liska,","B. Chylikova, A. Horinek, A. Panczak, O. Seda First Faculty of Medicine Charles University, Prague 2, Czech Republic We would like to introduce the new concept of molecular diagnostics of genetic disorders intended for routine clinicallaboratories in the Czech Republic. The concept is based on three levels of genetic analysis using the method of next generation sequencing. The ﬁrst level is represented by a panel of genes called OIDIP (Open Interdisciplinary Diag  nostic Panel) designed for routine differential diagnosis of both selected common and rare diseases. However, theprovided genetic analysis is much more complex and, if relevant, the Polygenic Risk Score (PRS) calculation can be done on basis of co analysed SNPs. Moreover, the detectionof diverse clinically signi ﬁcant common variants (trombo  philic mutations, lactose intolerance, warfarin drug response, etc.) is performed at the background. From theepidemiologic point of view, two genes are included to detect carriers of pathogenic alleles for cystic ﬁbrosis and phenylketonuria to spread knowledge of associated riskswithin Czech population. The second level of genetic test  ing is represented by “clinical exome ”suited for diagnosis of rare and genetically heterogenous diseases. The last levelof genetic testing is featured by whole exome sequencing and is still intended for special cases. Appropriate clinical questionnaires are an integral part of the concept as well aswebsite ( www.oidip.cz ), which should serve to connect clinical specialists and share the information.

" Importance of Low and Moderate impact variants inwhole exome sequencing (WES) analysisR. Tripathy , Z. Yüksel, M. Drasdo Bioscientia, Ingelheim, GermanyIntroduction: Whole exome sequencing (WES) has become an indispensable tool in the ﬁeld of genetic diag nostics. While we have observed an enormous rise in technical and medical standards of WES data analysis, there remain many limitations in the interpretation of the identi ﬁed variants. Currently applied analytical strategies rely heavily on assumptions of variant ﬁltering such as the commonly used parameter of variant type (e.g. missense,frameshift, canonical splice site). The variants then undergo a subjective classi ﬁcation of the severity of consequence based on SNPEff: HIGH, MODERATE, LOW andMODIFIER. In this study, we concentrated on the patho genicity of variants that are often declared to have low deleterious effects and hence overlooked during patientWES data analysis: synonymous (LOW), splice region (LOW) and intron (MODIFIER) variants according to VEP annotation in order to understand the pathogenicity of suchvariants. Materials and methods: We determined only very rare synonymous, splice region and intron variants in patients inwhich WES was performed. We concentrated on those variants which showed signi ﬁcant overlap with the given patient phenotype. We studied the predicted effect of suchvariants on splicing using reverse transcriptase PCR (RT PCR). Results: We identi ﬁed several synonymous, splice region and intron variants that are usually underestimated by conventional ﬁltering and/or annotation methods. Conclusion: It is important to build WES variant ﬁltering strategies based on the phenotypic overlap before concen trating on the uncovered regions or other genetic mechan isms.

There is now tremendousinterest for implementing GWAS like approaches to gen  omes of pathogenic bacteria in order to advance our understanding of infectious disease risk and underlyingbacterial virulence factors. However, bacterial genomes harbour complex structure and long range linkage dis  equilibrium (LD), making such analyses extremely chal lenging. We aim at identifying genetic variation in Listeria monocytogenes associated with food versus clinical sources using whole genome sequencing of 3718 strains of food andclinical origins collected in the context of Listeria surveil  lance in France. Materials and methods: We used both real and simulated data to assess the performances of various GWAS approaches. First, we considered SNPs derived from the core genome, and unitigs obtained by compactingthe de Bruijn graph. Second, we compared alternative ad hoc algorithms for deriving pairwise genetic relatedness between strains. Third, we assessed a range of logistic andlinear mixed models (LMM) with various random effect. And fourth, we assessed solutions to account for the observed extensive LD. Results and conclusion: We identi ﬁed multiple critical issues in existing approaches, resulting in invalid GWAS results in our data. We developed solutions for each of thoseissues, implementing an adaptive inference of relatedness between strains, a stepwise LMM model selection, and a genome LD correction inspired from human GWAS.

Following the GA4GH recommendations and the PrecisionFDA challenges, we aimed to assess the performance of ourcurrent whole genome (WGS) and whole exome (WES) sequencing and bioinformatic work ﬂows for detecting sin  gle nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small insertion anddeletion (indels) in human samples. Materials and methods: We used the NIST GIAB pilot sample NA12878/HG001 WGS provided by the Preci sionFDA, and WES sequences with PE75 at >50X obtained on a HiSeq4000 (Illumina) in our laboratory, both used as internal references. Variants were called with the Haploty peCaller following the Genome Analysis Toolkit Best Practices work ﬂow recommendations (GATK v3.8 and",2020
".4). A high con ﬁdence set of variants accounting for read depth, and variant calling and mapping quality was compared against the GIAB gold standard. Results: A relatively high accuracy was observed according to recall, precision and F score metrics from the benchmark of WGS (>97.9%) and WES (>87.5%), with minor differences among SNVs and indels. The lowerobserved WES accuracy might be related to the non uniform coverage found in WES enrichment when comparing to synthetic WES reads from HG001. Conclusions: We have developed and tested a custom pipeline to conduct WGS and WES based benchmarking to ensure reproducibility. These results support that our currentprocedures and work ﬂows are reliable albeit a ﬁne grained study of inaccuracies is needed.

L. Smith, C. J. Bult, The Mouse Genome Informatics","Staff and Software Team The Jackson Laboratory, Bar Harbor, ME, United States Ciliopathies comprise a broad spectrum of genetically and phenotypically heterogeneous disorders arising from muta  tions that disrupt ciliary structure or function, and ranging from mild single organ pathologies to lethal multi systemicsyndromes. Phenotypic manifestations can include respira  tory dysfunction, infertility, brain malformations, hydro  cephalus, heterotaxia, polydactyly, renal anomalies,neurosensory de ﬁcits, and cognitive impairment. Moreover, the clinical features of syndromic ciliopathies are often variable and overlapping, depending on the causal gene,mutation type or site, and/or other genetic modi ﬁers of penetrance or expressivity, rendering diagnosis challenging. Mice present a premier model system to dissect the functional roles of motile and non motile cilia in diverse tissue/cell types and developmental stages, discover new ciliopathy clinical entities and/or contributing loci, andevaluate therapeutic strategies. Mouse Genome Informatics (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org ) integrates data from multiple sources to correlate mouse phenotypes and humandisease symptoms and inform disease pathogenesis and treatment.

" Using AI for an automated CNV Classi ﬁcation based on the new ACMG/ClinGen recommendationsY. Einhorn Genoox, Tel Aviv, IsraelIntroduction: The ACMG and ClinGen recently published new technical standards for CNV classi ﬁcation in order to replace the old guidelines. These new standards are highly detailed and structured compared with the previous guide lines. Thus, while the detailed evaluation criteria willincrease classi ﬁcation consistency between different labs, it can be time consuming and hold some computational challenges. Here, we present a novel AI based variantclassi ﬁcation engine (aiVCE) for CNV classi ﬁcation based on the new ACMG/ClinGen framework. Methods: An aiVCE was developed for implementing the new recommendations and removing their computa tional and technical challenges. As no gold standard dataset with category level evidence exists for classi ﬁed CNVs, to evaluate the aiVCE we benchmark against the dataset which was used for the recommendations creation where each CNV was evaluated by two different clinical labs. Results: Comparing the results. shows high concordance without any strong con ﬂict. Looking on the variants that both reviewer classi ﬁed the same, 100% of the P variants were classi ﬁed as P or VUS Leaning Pathogenic (VUS P), 100% of the VUS variants were classi ﬁed as VUS,VUS P or VUS Leaning Benign (VUS B)and 71% of the Bvariants were classi ﬁed as B/VUS B and the remaining (29%) as VUS. Conclusions: Herein we demonstrated how an AI based algorithm can aid in following the new CNV classi ﬁcation recommendations, a task which is challenging, time consuming and error prone. Table.

Pirogov Russian National Research Medical University, Ministry of Health of theRussian Federation, Moscow, Russian Federation, 3Rus  sian Medical Academy of Continuous Professional Educa  tion of the Ministry of Health of the Russian Federation,Moscow, Russian Federation Introduction: Brain disorders are constantly associated with copy number variations (CNVs). Increase in CNV burden is common in psychiatric disorders, leading to dis  ruptions of shared biological processes. However, there is alack of approaches used for uncovering pathogenic path  ways/CNVs in brain diseases using genomic data. Materials and methods: Here, we propose an algorithm —“CNV laundering ”— for CNV/pathway prioritization in brain disorders. Algorithm ’s stages are (1) CNV data is obtained and checked for recurrence (recurrent CNVsexcluded); (2) ontology and expression of CNV genes obtained (genes not expressed in the brain excluded); (3) gene gene interactions are retrieved; (4) candidate pathwaysobtained by analyzing the set of interacting genes; (5) pathway prioritization and clusterization using a novel prioritization criterion (number of CNV genes in a pathway/total number of pathway genes). Using the algorithm and Affymetrix CytoScan HD microarray, we analyzed 191 genomes of children with neurodevelopmental disordersand congenital abnormalities (patient inclusion criteria: absence of CNVs larger than 500 kbp). Results: The most signi ﬁcant pathway clusters were determined as “proteasome ”,“neurodegenerative diseases ”, “regulation of TP53 ”,“vesicles functioning ”,“signaling by NOTCH ”,“actin functioning ”. Conclusions: “CNV data laundering ”allows for pathway and CNV prioritization. The application of the algorithm provides for accumulation of knowledge about the mechan isms of brain disease both in individual cases and in certain disorders.

It is characterized by acomplete polysyndactyly in hands, feet in the form of a mirror image and malformations at the level of the nose such as hypoplasia of the nasal alae and the short columella.To inform a new intronic variant associated with LSS in a Colombian female patient of 2 years and 11 months of age with multiple malformations associated with agenesis ofbony parts, a molecular study was conducted using com  plete exome sequencing and afterward a bioinformatic prediction analysis of the splicing effect through the HumanSplicing Finder prediction software. As a result, a variant was found in the LMBR1 gene c.1282 14G>A, Intron 16 Splicing, heterozygosis (69%); associated with LSS. Thebioinformatic study demonstrated the pathogenicity of the variant, which allows a phenotype genotype association. Ourﬁndings inform the ﬁrst case reported in the literature of a patient with LSS in Colombia. Besides, they suggest that this intronic variant plays a pathogenic role associated with the phenotype of the patient and allows us to conclude thatthe use of bioinformatics software for the prediction intronic variants are a useful tool to evaluate the clinical sig  niﬁcance, promoting its use to provide directed clinical approaches.

New and exciting tools are released constantly, relying on a variety of966 J. del Picchiaunderlying technologies. While those different tools help to improve not only the quality of the data analysis but help to perform new types of analyses, they are often complicated to install and only run on Linux. Although bigger labora  tories often run their analyses on clusters using pre con  ﬁgured pipelines, this is often not the case in smaller laboratories which rely on windows machines with a limited informatics support. Methods: We propose to use docker for Windows with WSL 2 to integrate bio informatics tools into existing analysis tools like GensearchNGS with a minimal overhead. WSL 2 greatly reduces the I/O overhead previous versionsof Docker or approaches likes emulation. We show Results: We released a new version of GensearchNGS which allows users that have Docker installed to use avariety of bio informatics tools (such as BWA or Bismark), previously only available to linux users. Conclusions: We show that by using Docker combined with WSL 2, Linux only bio informatics tools can be run with a minimal overhead on windows and integrated into existing data analysis tools. We demonstrate this byintegrating NGS aligners into GensearchNGS, an existing cross platform NGS data analysis tool.

Yet, due to the “black box ”nature DCNNs remain dismissed in the clinic. Thus, extracting knowledge from arti ﬁcial intel  ligence (AI) becomes an important bioinformatic ’s research topic. We analyzed a DCNN that learned to infer the gender from fundus images with high accuracy. This puzzledophthalmologists since they haven ’t found any differential features. We trained an inceptionv3 DCNN to classify gender in fundus images from UKBiobank. With an AUC of 0.82, we asked ophthalmologists for possible features that couldexplain this accuracy. We then tested the effect of hypothesis driven data manipulation on the classi ﬁcation accuracy. 1) To highlight possible morphological features we created occlusion sensitivity maps. 2) To assess the relevance of cone distribution we split the color channels of the fundus images. 3) We compared the distance betweenthe fovea and the optic disc. Color channel separation didn ’t improve the basal performance, discarding the cone distribution hypothesis.Distances between the fovea and the optic disc were similar across gender, based on a t test (p value > 0.05). Finally, we compared the performance of different occlusion sensitivitymaps. This allowed us to identify a distinctive vein structure close to the ocular disc in the nasal side of the eye, providing a differential feature to label images. Image manipulation is a viable method to help interpret DCNN models and extract clinically relevant knowledge. Thus, our study shows that clinical expertise can narrow thefeature space and help guide model training. http://www. eye2sex.com/ http://www.fundus2gender.org/ M.A. Ibarra Arellano: None. S.

Reclassi ﬁcation of Variants of Uncertain Signi ﬁcance (VUS) represents a challenge in their diagnosis. We aimed to study VUS epidemiological, mole  cular and functional features that can provide rules to improve VUS clinical management. Methods: In a two years period, we collected 669 IRD cases studied by clinical exome sequencing and determined their diagnostic status. We identi ﬁed 152 VUS in 129 unsolved cases, and studied their features in the context of the same cohort causal variants (N ,379 cases). Results: While the type of commercial clinical exome used did not show any difference, the analyst in charge seems to be a source of discrepancy, as one of the most IRD experiencedAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 967clinician showed greater VUS reporting (p ,1.52e 04). We found signi ﬁcantly differential patterns for VUS frequency, according to inheritance classi ﬁcation and involved gene, being recessive cases signi ﬁcantly less frequent (p ,0.01), andABCA4 andIMPG2 showing the lowest and highest VUS frequency ratio, respectively (p ,1.05 e08;p<0.001).

 Validating DeepVariant: Assessment of a deep learning variant caller in Targeted Next GenerationSequencing data,P17.16,"T. Loupis , D. Vrachnos, K. Zoi, D. Thanos,",P. Makrythanasis,"Greek Genome Center, Biomedical Research Foundation Academy of Athens (BRFAA), Athens, Greece Introduction: In 2018, DeepVariant was introduced, a deep convolutional neural network tool which is reported to outperform other variant callers. The algorithm can be implemented in three different type of datasets: 1) Shortread Whole Genome Sequencing 2) Short read Whole Exome Sequencing (WES) and 3) PacBio reads, excluding the commonly used Targeted Next Generation Sequencing(TNGS) panels or at least without validating the perfor  mance of DeepVariant in such data. Materials and methods: We created arti ﬁcial TNGS data, by downscaling WES data from the reference sample NA12878 to simulate an in house TNGS custom designed gene panel (containing less than 100 genes), targeting clinical signi ﬁcant germline variants. Performed variant calling using DeepVar  iant’s WES model and GATK ’s Best Practices germline variant calling pipeline (HaplotypeCalle r, HC), comparing both results to the high con ﬁdence calls of the NA12878. Results: DeepVariant achieved 100% accuracy with the artiﬁcial TNGS data calling all 51 of the high con ﬁdence variants of the NA12878 same as HC. Furthermore, 2 extravariants where called by DeepVariant, one common with HC, both not in the high con ﬁdence set. Conclusions: DeepVariant seems to adapt to targeted gene panel data, suggesting the possible implementation of the algorithm to accurate detect germline variants in human samples. We currently investigate the ef ﬁciency of DeepVariant, on a range of gene panels and genomic regions of different features, to accurately detect germline variants in any set of genomic intervals smaller than a WES.

In addition, SMAD4 muta tions have been identi ﬁed not only in pancreatic cancer but also in other cancers such as colorectal and gastric cancers. The analysis method used the fragment molecular orbital(FMO) method, which can calculate the molecular structure and the interaction between molecules. In this study, we investigated whether the effects of genetic mutations onpathogenicity could be estimated using the FMO method. The structure (1dd1.pdb) of the wild type SMAD4 trimer was obtained from the protein structure data bank (PDB),and the structure was corrected by MOE Structure Pre  paration. Pathogenic mutations were obtained from Clin  Var, and the structure of mutants were constructed by MOEHomology modeling and wild type structure as a template. The computer used supercomputer K (AICS, RIKEN) and FX100 (Nagoya Univ). The calculation was performed atthe calculation level of MP2/6 31G* using ABINIT MP as the software. The sum of inter fragment interaction energies (IFIE sum) was compared between the wild type and themutant. Comparing the calculated results of the wild type and the mutant, the interaction energy was destabilized in the mutant such as R361C. R361C mutation destabilized theinteraction between D537 and D351. R361, D537 and D351 form a hydrogen bond network during SMAD4 trimer formation. After R361C mutation, this hydrogen bondnetwork could not be formed, and the results of computa  tional analysis showed that this trimer formation was destabilized. It is thought that a similar analysis couldpredict a pathogenic mutation. N. Kawashita: None. A. Itagaki: None. K. Tamura: None.968 J. del PicchiaE",2020

Sorbonne Université, PARIS, France,3Inserm UMRS 974, Institut de Myologie, PARIS, France In molecular genetics, variant interpretation is a critical step in order to make a diagnosis. Presumed splice variantspresent speci ﬁc analytical dif ﬁculties in clinical practice outside the natural splicing sites (GT and AG dinucleotides). Laboratory tests to study splicing on RNA are expensive and time consuming, thus it is unrealistic to perform them on the large amount of variants identi ﬁed by NGS. The use ofin silico prediction tools is therefore necessary to quickly select the most convincing splicing variants before sending them to experimental validation. Many tools are availablebut often based on a web interface and limited to only one request at a time. Consequently, we have selected 4 algorithms which allow automatic annotation of variants and simple integration into bioinformatics pipelines: MaxEntScan (2004), dbscSNV_ada (2014), SpliceAI (2019) and SPiP (2019).To assess the performance of these tools, we collected 47 variants suspected of altering splicing which were tested experimentally at the Pitié Salpêtrière Hospital, Paris. 33variants out of 47 have a demonstrated effect on RNA, 14 have not.

 Detection of non reference sequences in population scaleWGS data,P17.21,"T. Krannich , B. Kehr","Berlin Institute of Health, Berlin, Germany","Non reference sequence insertions are a less frequently investigated class of genomic structural variation. Here, DNA sequences are found within an individual that arenovel with respect to a given reference. These sequences occur primarily due to the fact that a reference genome lacks some ancestral sequence since it is mostly derived from afew or a single individual. Therefore, newly sequenced individuals can yield genomic sequences which are absent from a reference genome. To ﬁnd such insertions in short  read sequencing data, it is necessary to perform a de novo assembly of the non reference sequence, an algorithmically challenging and computationally expensive task. In recentyears, only a few methods and tools have been developed to detect these non reference sequence insertions and even fewer to perform the detection on large cohorts. One inser tion caller that exploits the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples is PopIns. PopIns extracts unmapped reads from all individuals, assembles a non redundant set of contigsequences across all individuals, anchors these sequences to the reference and ﬁnally genotypes each individual. We entirely redesigned the assembly module, a key step tocombine samples. The novel assembly module uses a highly specialized data structure called compacted colored de Bruijn Graph . By applying this new approach to simulated data, the detected sequences are more precise while their computation requires less memory. Subsequently, this will considerably improve the detection of non referencesequence insertions and, therefore, offer more comprehen  sive variant call sets for population and disease studies. T.

Janicijevic, T.","Skaric Juric Institute for Anthropological Reasearch, Zagreb, Croatia Introduction: The pharmacogenetic data have been studied extensively due to their clinical importance in the appro  priate drug prescription. Aim: to determine allele frequencies of 27 most important ADME polymorphisms (20 of them 1A, 1B or 2A clinical annotation levels of evidence) in the Croatian populationand to compare them with the European population. Materials and methods: The 27 loci from 20 ADME genes were genotyped in the Croatian study sampleconsisted of 429 participants. Allele frequencies were combined with published data on the Croatian population (weighted frequencies according to sample sizes). TheCroatian allele frequencies were compared with the European population average data taken from the gnomAD database (selection criteria: control cases only and non Finnish).Results: Results showed higher variant allele frequencies in the Croatian population at six loci (rs1045642, rs2279343, rs1799853, rs1057910, rs28371725, rs9923231) and lower at two loci (rs1695, rs1801272). The most signi ﬁcant differences were: 0.4608 vs 0.4880 in ABCB1 , 0.0932 vs 0.2430 in CYP2B6*4 , 0.1228 vs 0.1470 inCYP2C9*2 , 0.3325 vs 0.2980 in GSTP1 and 0.3488 vs 0.4030 in VKORC1 genes, in Europeans and Croatians respectively. Conclusions: Croatian population shows higher variant allele frequencies in several genes responsible for metabo  lism of anticoagulation drugs (warfarin, acenocumarol andphenprocoumon). This ﬁnding indicates higher bleeding and over anticoagulation risk in Croatians, demanding lower drugs` prescription doses. Also, lower doses ofphenytoin and celecoxib, while higher doses of digoxin, fentanyl, bupoprion and efavirenz are more frequently required in Croatians compared with European average.Acknowledgement: Croatian Science Foundation (HRZZ IP 01 2018 2497 and HRZZ IP 2014 09 4454).

Study design: Genome wide genotyping studies of cohorts of preterm and term individuals were evaluated. We determined the mitochondrial haplogroup and nuclearancestry for individuals and developed a scoring for the degree to which mitochondrial ancestry is divergent from nuclear ancestry. Results: Infants with higher degrees of divergent mitochondrial ancestry were at increased risk for preterm birth (0.124 for preterm vs 0.105 for term infants; P < .05).Thisﬁnding was validated in 1 of 2 replication cohorts. We also observed that greater degrees of divergent ancestry correlated with earlier delivery within the primary studypopulation, but this ﬁnding was not replicated in secondary cohorts born preterm.Conclusions: Individuals with divergent patterns of mitochondrial and nuclear ancestry are at increased risk for preterm birth. These ﬁndings may in part explain the higher rates of preterm birth in African Americans and in individuals with a matrilineal family history of preterm birth.

 The incidence of the commonest alpha 1 antitrypsindeﬁciency (AATD) alleles (PI Z and PI S) in the population of Polish newborns,P19.02,J. Chorostowska Wynimko,"1, R. Struniawski1,","M. Borszewska Kornacka2,A. Jezela Stanek1 1National Institute of Tuberculosis and Lung Diseases, Department of Genetics and Clinical Immunology, Warsaw, Poland,2Medical University of Warsaw, Neonatal and Intensive Care Department, Warsaw, Poland Introduction : Alpha 1 antitrypsin de ﬁciency (AATD, MIM613490) is listed among the most common genetic disorders in Caucasians. It considerably increases the risk of progressive obstructive lung diseases, as well as hepaticdysfunction, especially in early childhood. The protein is encoded by the SERPINA1 gene, harbouring numerous polymorphisms. Among them, Z (PI*Z) and S (PI*S),resulted from mutation at Glu342Lys and Glu264Val position, respectively, are most commonly occurring de ﬁ  ciency alleles. They lead to the synthesis of structurallyabnormal AAT protein, enable to succeed a physiological conformation, and thus accumulating in hepatocytes (Z protein) or degrading (S protein). Data on the prevalence ofAATD and frequency of mentioned de ﬁciency alleles in Poland are scarce, with only one published preliminary result and no studies with large enough group to be repre sentative for the entire population. Our presentation aims to show the results of a study which investigates the pre  valence of de ﬁciency alleles Z and S in Poland. Materials and methods: Real time PCR genotyping and AAT blood concentration measurement by nephelometry were performed from the dry blood spots (DBS) samples ofapprox. 5000 newborns. Results: Among 4948 newborns (preliminary data) both variants were identi ﬁed in 221 children, including PI*Z allele in 115 (2.3%) and PI*S allele in 106 neonates (2.1%).Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 971Blood A1AT concentration was signi ﬁcantly lower in both groups. Conclusions: The estimated prevalence of AAT de ﬁ  ciency alleles per 1.000 persons were 11,5 (9,4 13,6) for PI*Z and 10,6 (8,6 12,6) for PI*S. It indicates more frequent occurrence of the Z allele in Poland than in earlierreports. J. Chorostowska Wynimko: None. R. Struniawski: None. M. Borszewska Kornacka: None. A. Jezela Stanek: None.

The main goal of our study was to evaluate the incidence of anencephaly (and its possible trends) duringthe long term period. Methods: For this study, we have used data from the National Registry of Congenital Anomalies of the CzechRepublic. We analyzed the incidence of anencephaly in births and in prenatally diagnosed cases in the 1964 2016 period. We also evaluated maternal age in these cases. Thestatistical analysis was performed by Poisson regression and Fisher ’s exact test. Results: During the study period there were 6 891 062 children born in the Czech Republic. Among those, 1232 children were born with anencephaly. Another 966 cases of anencephaly were diagnosed during prenatal diagnosis andthese pregnancies were electively terminated, the total number of anencephaly cases was 2198. The total incidence of anencephaly signi ﬁcantly decreased during the study period (p ,0.0136). The incidence in births decreased signiﬁcantly as well (p <0.001). We found statisticallyhigher incidence of anencephaly in elder mothers (42 years and over). Discussion: Gradual implementation of ultrasound pre  natal diagnostics started in the 80s of the last century and lead to a very signi ﬁcant decrease in the incidence of anencephaly cases in births. Additionally, the total inci dence of anencephaly decreased signi ﬁcantly as well. We found signi ﬁcantly higher incidence of anencephaly in elder mothers (42 years and over).

Materials and methods: A cross sectional study was conducted among senior healthcare students at the main Libyan Universities. Students from faculties of Medical,Dental, Pharmacy and Medical Technology who were about to graduate at the end of the 2020/2021 academic year completed a structured and self administered online ques tionnaire distributed in social media University pages and via emails. The questionnaire included information about personal and general health, attitudes towards biomedicalresearch and donation and awareness of biobanks. Results: A total of 324 students successfully completed and submitted the questionnaire. The majority of studentsapproved medical research (96%, 311/324) and 75% (244/ 324) were willing to participate in genetic research. Less than 5% of students were unwilling to participate in geneticresearch. Approximately 48% (155/324) were aware of the term biobank and 74% (240/324) were willing to donate their specimens to a biobank. Conclusions: This study provides novel information on the likelihood of donating biospecimens and although students were largely willing to donate biological samples,they were not aware of biobanking. It is therefore highly recommended to reinforce medical and biomedical curricula to educate students about biobanking, medical and geneticresearch. A. Elhadi: None. I. Alhudiri: None. A.

 Genetic variants of BRCA1 exon 11 in Libyan breast cancer patients,P19.06,"H. Elshwekh, I. Alhudiri , H. Abdul Jalil, A. Mohamed,","A. Elkikli, N. Jornaz, N. Enattah","Biotechnology Research Centre, Tripoli, Libyan Arab Jamahiriya Introduction: The majority of hereditary breast and ovarian cancers are associated with mutations in two genes, breast cancer type 1 and 2 susceptibility genes (BRCA1 andBRCA2). Here we describe for the ﬁrst time analysis ofBRCA1 exon 11 in 48 Libyan breast cancer patients with family history of cancer. Materials and methods: All patients had family history of cancer and were included in the study only if they have family history of breast or ovarian cancer, male breast cancer or triple negative tumours. PCR was performedusing speci ﬁc primer pairs spanning BRCA1 exon 11 followed by Sanger sequencing. Genetic analysis was done using Sequencher ®5.1. Results : We identi ﬁed 12 genetic variants in BRCA1 exon 11. Three variants were novel (c.1019T>C c.2363T>G, c.3192T>C); c.2363T>G is predicted by SIFTas damaging. Six variants were of unknown signi ﬁcance (c.918T>C, c.1853G>C, c.1886G>A, c.2215A>G, c.2612C>T, c.3113A>C, c.3784T>C), and 3 were classi ﬁed as benign in ClinVar database (c.918T>C, c.2082C>T, c.2311T>C). Conclusions: Scanning of the entire BRCA1 is needed to identify any associated deleterious mutations. Although the clinical importance of unclassi ﬁed variants is unknown, the association of certain variants with deleter ious mutations and contralateral breast cancer warrants genetic testing and counseling in Libyan population.

 Penetrance of the CFTR 5T allele in congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens,P19.07,D. Seidl,"1,2, Á. Mikó1,2, A. Kaposi2, K. Tory1,2","1Semmelweis Univesity, 1st Department of Paediatrics, Budapest, Hungary,2MTA SE Lendület Nephrogenetic Laboratory, Budapest, Hungary Introduction: Congenital bilateral absence of the vas deferens (CBAVD) is responsible for 2% of male infertility. One third (25 40%) of patients with CBAVD are compoundheterozygous for the CFTR 5T (c.1210 7_1210 6delTT) variant and another variant in trans. The 5T allele, with a MAF of 3% in the general European population, causes theloss of exon 10 in 95% of mRNA. Using a formerly developed population genetic algorithm we aimed to assign the penetrance of the 5T variant. Materials and methods: We collected phenotype and genotype data from 3279 patients with biallelic CFTR mutations from PubMed. The penetrance (P) of the 5Tvariant was calculated by comparing its allele count (AC) to the AC of the loss of function (LOF) variants in theAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 973European non Finnish patient population and in the gnomAD as P ,(AC 5T/AC LOF)patient/(AC 5T/AC LOF)gnomAD , tested by Fisher ’s exact test. Results: We found the 5T allele in 339/3279 (10.34%) patients, trans associated to LOF mutations in 187/635 (29.3%) of the patients with CBAVD. None of thecompound heterozygous patients with the 5T allele (without other variant in cis) developed CF. We found the penetrance of the 5T variant to be 4.3% (p ,5x10  389). Conclusions: According to our penetrance estimation, for a couple with heterozygous CFTR 5T allele in one parent and a LOF variant in another, the risk of a son beingaffected by CBAVD is 1% (25% x 4.3%).

Mashkina southern Federal University, Rostov on don, Russian Federation Introduction: The presence of functional SNPs in the pro moter regions can be considered as one reason for the imbal ance in cytokines levels during HPV infection which leads to an imbalance of pro and anti in ﬂammatory cytokines. Materials and methods: In our work, we assessed the association of polymorphic variants of the IL1 β 31T>C, 511C>T, IL4 589C>T and IL6 174G>C genes with high risk HPV infection in women, ages 30 years and older (101 women infected with HPV with viral load more than 4lg and 93 women without HPV). Polymorphic variantsdetected by allele speci ﬁc PCR. Results: The individual SNP genes IL1 β 31T>C, IL4 589C>T and IL6 174G>C did not reveal signi ﬁcant differences in all frequencies of genotypes and alleles. At the same time, the difference in frequency of the 511T allele and TT genotype of the IL1 βgene between two groups was statistically signi ﬁcant (OR ,1.71, 2.02 respectively). Analysis of intergenic interactions for all contribution allelic variants revealed the signi ﬁcant inter action for polymorphic variants IL1 β, IL4 and IL6 genes (OR for the combination of loci was 4,70 CI 95 % (2,55 8,67) (P ,0,0001). Haplotypes analysis revealed that the 511C / 31T haplotype is statistically signi ﬁcantly lesscommon among women with a high concentration of HPV (5.9% and 15.2 % p ,0.002).

QU Health, Doha, Qatar Introduction: The COMT gene encodes for catechol O  methyl transferase enzyme that has the major role in theregulation of synaptic catecholamine neurotransmitters. Many variants of the COMT gene have been described and some of them are in strong linkage disequilibrium de ﬁning haplotypes associated with the enzyme activity level. Our aim is to investigate the haplotypic distribution of the COMT gene markers in North African population in orderto assess their usefulness in investigating North African population genetic structure. Materials and methods: Four markers (rs2020917, rs4818, rs4680, rs9332377) have been typed in 275 North African populations using TaqMan technology. Haplotypes have been phased. Linkage disequilibrium (LD), Fst distance matrix and Principal Component Analysis (PCA), were performed. For comparative analyses, data from the 59 Kidd Lab populations and the 1000 Genome Project,were used. Results: Our main ﬁndings show that COMT activity prediction, according to LD performance, could be limitedto rs4818 rs4680 micro haplotypes. North Africans and South Asians show intermediate frequency values (20% and 25% respectively) of the low activity (CG) haplotype whencompared to those of African populations and East Asians that show frequencies of 55% and 40% respectively, and to European populations frequency of 10%. Fst genetic distance and PCA analysis showed genetic differentiation between Africans, North African, Europeans, East and974 J. del PicchiaSouth Asians according to their signi ﬁcant haplotype frequency differences. Conclusion: The high level of genetic diversity of COMT haplotypes along with different LD levels can be useful tool for population genetic studies and included in ancestry informative panels.

Methods: Under the IV screening of the international program ""HAPIEE"" and the WHO program ""MONICA  psychosocial"" in 2003 2005 a representative sample of the population aged 45 64 years (n ,781 of men) was surveyed. All study participants ﬁlled out the depression scale proposed by WHO MONICA psychosocial program. The genotyping of the DRD2/ANKK1 Taq1A gene polymorph ism was done in frame of the budgetary issue # АААА   А17 117112850280 2. Results: The prevalence of depression in the open population of men 45 64 was 36.3% (13.5% with a high level and 22.8% with middle level). A comparative intergroup analysis showed that odds ratio (OR) of a highlevel of depression was 3.86 fold higher in persons with T/ C genotype than those with C/C genotype without depression. OR of a high level of depression was in 3.28times higher in persons with T/C genotype compared to persons with middle level of depression and with homo  zygous C/C genotype. Males with T allele of the DRD2gene more likely to be at high level of depression in 2.63 times than persons with C allele who had more often no depression.

 Pertinence of genetic testing ordered by different medical specialties. Experience from a reference labora tory in Colombia,P19.12,"I. T. Bernal , S. J. Maradei, A. J. Muñoz, Y. M. Gómez","Biotecgen S.A., Bogota, Colombia","Introduction: In the last decade, there has been a rapid increase in the technical capacity of multiple genetic tests to detect DNA variants that can be used to diagnose differentpathologies and to guide speci ﬁc diagnostic strategies. In Colombia, there has been a dramatic increase in the request for all types of genetic studies by the vast majority ofmedical specialties, without adequate guidance by clinical geneticists, regarding to the choice of molecular study and interpretation of results. Materials and methods: We reviewed all the molecular studies received in our laboratory during the year 2019, grouping them by requesting specialty, type of study andresult, determining the index of relevance and/or accuracy, and the diagnostic yield of each one. Results: We received 834 orders for genetic studies, requested by 25 different medical specialties, with a total of 248 positive results (29,7 %), 119 VOUS (14,2%) and 467 negative results (55,9%), ma inly corresponding to NGS panels. The two specialties with the highest number of requests for molecular studies were Clinical Genetics and Oncohematology, the former having the highest diagnosticyield, the 40% of medical special ties had only negative results. Conclusion: We strongly recommend that genetic tests prescribed by untrained medical staff should be reserved forcases with high clinical suspicion only, otherwise it leads to increased time for diagnosis and treatment, and economic detriment to the health system. Moreover, medical special ties should be instructed on the impact of VOUs and the importance of their reclassi ﬁcation. I.T. Bernal: None. S.J. Maradei: None. A.J. Muñoz: None. Y.M. Gómez: None.

Unregulated DNAdamage leads to aberrant gene expression and may initiate disease processes. This study aimed to investigate impact of dietary nutrients in modulating DNA damage due to HMs innon occupationally exposed Malaysian women. Methods: A cross sectional study was conducted invol  ving 134 Malay women aged between 20 to 50 years. Hairsamples were collected from occipital region of the scalp. Concentrations of four HMs were quanti ﬁed using Induc  tively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP MS).Degree of DNA damage was detected using Alkaline  Comet assay. Hundred cells were randomly selected and scored using online software for evaluating four cometassay parameters. Participant ’s daily energy, macro and micro nutrient intake were extracted from a food frequency questionnaire. Results: The basal level of DNA strand breaks was 11.49 ±5.67 (%DNA in comet tail mean ± SD). Mean concentrations of arsenic, mercury, chromium and cadmiumwere 0.1318 ± 0.329, 0.984 ± 4.107, 6.151 ± 4.3487, and 0.201 ± 0.868 mg/kg respectively. After adjustment for covariates, signi ﬁcantly lower cadmium levels were found for high vitamin D intake (p ,0.043) and signi ﬁcantly lower chromium levels were found for high calcium intake (p,0.043). High intake of manganese had positive impact (p,0.031) on comet tail DNA in individuals with high concentrations of hair arsenic. Conclusion: Speci ﬁc dietary nutrients may modulate heavy metal induced DNA damagein non occupationally exposed individuals.

Sousa1,3","1ICBAS, Porto, Portugal,2CHUP, Porto, Portugal,3i3s,","Porto, Portugal Introduction: Variability in age at onset (AO) of Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy (TTR FAP Val30Met) is well known. Three independent Val30Met mutational eventshave been hypothesized by different authors, suggesting an association with AO differences among the main clusters. Whether there is a common origin for Val30Met mutationin the Portuguese cluster remains an open question. Objectives: To distinguish between one or multiple mutational events among the Portuguese Val30Met TTR FAP kindreds, through characterization of the genetic background surrounding Val30Met locus and to estimate the age of ancestral mutational event(s). Methods: From the largest Val30Met TTR FAP database worldwide we carried out an extensive family based haplotype study, in 45 families from two disease clusters(Northern Coast and Inland). Results: Mean AO was signi ﬁcantly higher in patients from Inland than from Northern Coast (p <0.001). Acommon haplotype of different lengths was shared by almost all carriers, providing strong evidence of a major single founder effect for Val30Met in these two diseaseclusters. We estimated that the mutational event occurred in the mid VI century (AD) (1450 1475 years ago), spreading from Póvoa de Varzim/Vila do Conde to the Inland region.Although AO variability in Val30Met Portuguese kindreds does not seem associated to different mutational origins, striking differences in the extended haplotype downstreamSTR D18S1133 were found between Northern Coast vs. Inland. Conclusions: 1) We were able to clarify Val30Met ancestral origins and its migration path between these two Portuguese cluster, 2) Exploring this genomic region may provide new insights on AO variability, with the identi ﬁca  tion of genetic modi ﬁers.

However, it is still unclear in different populations that the APC and MUTYH genetic pro ﬁling might have effect. Thus, in study we determined the incidence of APC andMUTYH muta tions in patients with tubular adenoma and adenocarcinoma.Material and Methods Peripheral blood samples of 18 patients were sequenced for APC andMUTYH genes via MiSeq NGS System (Illumina). Data was analyzed by QCI Analyze and QCI Interpret bioinformatics tools. Results: 11 clinically signi ﬁcant variants in APC and MUTYH genes were detected in 55.5% (n ,10) of 18 patients whom 50% of tubular adenoma, 44% adenocarci noma and only one of hyperplastic polyp. In tubular adenoma group, 77.7% of them had at least one mutation, 6variants in APC gene and 2 variants in MUTYH gene retrospectively. Interestingly, while 1 of APC variants is a novel, two of them are variants classi ﬁed as uncertain signiﬁcant. On the other hand, only 25% of adenocarcinoma patients had mutations on APC andMUTYH genes (1 in APC and 1 in MUTYH ). Conclusions: Our data suggested that patients with both premalignant and malignant tumors of colorectum should undergo genetic screening for the bene ﬁt of patients and their families.",P19.18,M.K.

Recent studies suggest that anti  inﬂammatory cytokines such as interleukin 17 (IL 17) plays a prominent role in the pathogenesis of CP. This study aims to investigate the association between CP andinterleukin IL  17 (A and F) gene polymorphisms. We also aim to evaluate the association between eight subgingival pathogens ( Porphyromonas gingivalis, Treponema denti  cola, Tannerella forsythia, Prevotella intermedia, Pre  votella nigrescns, Campylobacter rectus, Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, Eikenella corrodens) and CP in Libyans. Materials and methods: The study consisted of 100 Libyan individuals between the ages of 25 and 65 yearsincluding 50 cases and 50 controls. DNA was extracted from buccal swabs and paper points for subgingival pathogen samples. IL 17 (A&F) genotyping was performedby PCR followed by Sanger sequencing. Speci ﬁc 16S rRNA primers for each pathogen were applied in a multiplex PCR reaction and visualized by agarose gelelectrophoresis for detection of subgingival pathogens. Results : IL17A AA, GG and AG (rs2275913) genotypes were detected in patients with CP. IL 17F CT (rs763780)genotype was seen in CP group only. A novel variant c. *34G>A in IL17F was found in 14% of patients. Signi ﬁcant association between the subgingival pathogens and CP (p value ,0.0001) and high prevalence of subgingival pathogens in CP group. Conclusion: IL 17 gene polymorphisms are associated with CP, and strong association between subgingival pathogens and CP exist. Further large scale studies are needed to elucidate the association. E.

Matrix metalloproteinases 2 (MMP 2)may have a signi ﬁcant role in the IS therapy outcome. Polymorphisms (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864, rs2285053) within the MMP 2 gene could potentially affect MMP 2 gene expression and consequently IS patients ’ recovery and the occurrence of HT. Aim: To analyze the correlation between genotypes and haplotypes of the selected MMP 2 gene polymorphisms on IS patients ’recovery, along with testing the occurrence of HT after thrombolytic therapy. Methods: The study included 170 patients with IS treated with thrombolytic therapy. Patients ’convalescence was determined using the Modi ﬁed Rankin Scale (mRS) after 3 months from IS onset, where the good outcome has been deﬁned with scores 0 1 and unfavorable with scores 2 6. Genotypisation was performed using Real Time PCR(rs243866, rs243865, rs243864) and PCR RFLP (rs2285053) methods. Haplotype analysis was performed by Haploview software. Results: Obtained frequencies of genotypes and alleles were in accordance with Caucasian population results. We have observed no association between any genotypes orhaplotypes with thrombolytic therapy outcome and HT occurrence. Haplotypes GCTC, ATGC, GCTT and GCGC (rs243866, rs243865, rs243864, rs2285053) were the mostfrequent among our patients (73.2%, 17.0%, 5.6%, 1.5%, respectively). Using Solid spine of LD method, haplotype block was de ﬁned among all investigated polymorphisms within the MMP 2 gene. Patients with GCTC haplotype had less frequently repeated IS (60% Vs. 75.5%, p ,0.021). Conclusion: MMP 2 promotor haplotype GCTC may be protective against recurrent IS. M.G. Dusanovic Pjevic: None.

MetS is a mul tifactorial disorder and includes genetic environmental interactions. ADRB3, APOA5, ADIPOQ and PPARG are among the most studied genes having roles in severalmetabolic pathways. A differential distribution of these polymorphic genes in different human populations has been reported by numerous studies worldwide. We aim todetermine the genetic composition of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) rs2075291 (G / C), rs2241766 (G / T), rs1800571 (G / T) and rs4998 (C / A / G) in a populationsample of Bucaramanga, Colombia. Materials and methods: A blood sample was collected from 1057 healthy subjects. DNA extraction was performedusing the PrepFilerTM kit. Polymorphisms were ampli ﬁed in a multiplex PCR, and a SNaPshot minisequencing reaction followed by analysis on an ABI PRISM 310.Allelic frequencies and Hardy Weinberg test (EHW) were obtained by Arlequin v 3.5. Results: The most frequent genotype and allele for each of the polymorphisms were: ADRB3 GG gene (0.738), G (0.859); APOA5 GG (0.766), G (0.875); ADIPOQ TT (0.561), T (0.749); and PPARG CC (0.861), C (0.928).These results agree with previous studies (Ziki 2016; Kim 2018). No deviations from EHW were found after performing Bonferroni correction. Conclusions: The frequencies obtained do not differ from those previously reported.

 Analysis of association of MMP 2 gene promoter haplotype with ef ﬁcacy and toxicity of methotrexate in patients with Rheumatoid arthritis,P19.30,M. B. Grk,"1, V. Milic2, M. G. Dusanovic Pjevic1,","N. Maksimovic1, T. Damnjanovic1, M. M. Pesic1, M. Gulic1, B. Jekic1 1Institute of Human Genetics, Belgrade, Serbia,2Institute of Rheumatology, Belgrade, Serbia Introduction: Rheumatoid arthritis (RA) is an autoimmune disease characterised by chronic synovitis. Invasivesynovial pannus overproduces matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) and leads to synovial joints impairment. Expression ofMMP is controlled by cytokines at the transcriptional level. Methotrexate (MTX), as anchor treatment in RA, could indirectly in ﬂuence MMP production through cyto  kine expression modulation. Hence, MMP 2 promoter haplotype could affect its expression, and as a result in ﬂu  ence disease activity and MTX response. We investigated the association of MMP 2 promoter haplotype with MTX monotherapy ef ﬁcacy/toxicity. Material and methods: We included 109 RA patients. MTX ef ﬁcacy was estimated using the changes in Disease activity score (DAS28) after 6 months of MTX mono  therapy, according to EULAR response criteria. Adverse effects (AE) were collected during the follow up period.Bone erosion appearance was estimated after 6 months of treatment. Genotyping for MMP 2 gene polymorphisms (rs243866, rs243865, rs2285053) was performed using theReal Time or PCR RFLP methods. Haplotype analysis was performed using the Haploview software. Results: Investigated MMP 2 haplotypes were not associated with MTX response or overall AE. Haplotypes GCC, ATC, GCT and GTC were most frequent among our patients (64.3%, 19.2%, 11.8%, 3.6%, respectively). UsingConﬁdence intervals LD method, haplotype block was deﬁned between rs243866 and rs243865 MMP 2 gene polymorphisms (r2 ,0.74, D ’,0.94). ATC haplotype was not observed among patients with nausea (n ,9) while it was present in 21% of patients without this AE (p ,0.03). Conclusion: According to our study MMP 2 promoter haplotype does not in ﬂuence MTX therapy outcome in RA patients. M.B. Grk: None. V. Milic: None. M.G. Dusanovic Pjevic: None. N. Maksimovic: None. T.

Unfor tunately, the tools developed so far do not perform well when predicting phenotypes in admixed populations. MITF (Melanocyte Inducing Transcription Factor) is an essentialtranscription factor in melanin biosynthesis, regulating the transcription of TYR,TYRP1 ,DCT andSLC24A5 genes, and could be a good target for ﬁnding new variants for Forensic DNA Phenotyping. Here we report associations found between variation sites at the MITF gene and pigmentation phenotypes in a Brazilian population sample. Materials and methods: Samples were collected from 498 volunteers in Ribeirão Preto, SP. Pigmentation phenotypes and melanin index measurements (spectro photometry) were also collected. Genotype data was obtained using a) In ﬁnium Multi Ethnic Global 8 (MEGA) Kit Array (Illumina) and b) target sequencing (HaloPlexTarget Enrichment System For Illumina Sequencing, Agilent Technologies), followed by alignment to hg19/ GRCh37 reference genome and genotyping by GenomeAnalysis Tool Kit (GATK) HaplotypeCaller. Association analysis were performed using logistic regression adjusting to ancestry composition and Fisher Exact test. Results: Two variants in linkage disequilibrium in the promoter region (rs6761994*A and rs62250968*T, r 2, 0.698954) were associated with dark blond hair, green eyesand fair skin. Melanin index is signi ﬁcantly lower for individuals carrying these variants. Previous studies reported rs62250968 effects on regulatory motifs and onMITF expression. Conclusions: Results showed that rs6761994 and rs62250968 are associated with intermediate phenotypesand could be good markers for DNA phenotyping in admixed populations. L. Marcorin: None. A.L.E.

Nevertheless, to date it remains completely unclear whether there is a genetic continuity between the Scythian Sarmatian archaeological culture of the Iron Ageand modern population of Northern Eurasia. The aim of our study was to analyze mitochondrial DNA in 9 samples of the Scythian Sarmatian historical and archaeological cul ture, followed by comparing the results with data from more than 1,000 individuals from modern Northern Eurasian populations. DNA samples from the Scythian and Sarma tian cultures were shown to belong to mtDNA haplogroups: W, W3a, T1a1, U5a2 +16294, U5b2a1a2, U5b2a1a1, U5b2c, T1a1d, C1e. Screening using 1042 samples frommodern populations of Northern Eurasia showed that hap  logroup W was found in almost all analyzed samples and reached maximum in Balkar population (15.7%) and wasabsent only in some ethno territorial groups of Bashkirs. In turn, haplogroup W3 was detected only in populations of the Volga Ural region, where it reaches its maximumamong Udmurts (6.8%) and Besermyans (5.1%).

Using an orthogonal approach to infer mtDNA levels in peripheral blood, we aimed to analyze theassociation with ICU mortality by acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Material and Methods: We analyzed Axiom Genome  Wide CEU1 and Axiom Genome Wide PanAFR array data from patients with sepsis associated ARDS: 269 Spanish from GEN SEP study and 137 African Americans.Estimates of the mtDNA levels were obtained from the intensities of selected probes, with 100% identity with mtDNA and with the largest number of mismatches with thenuclear sequences. Values were normalized across the individual probe intensities. Logistic regression was used for association with 28 day mortality and ICU mortality inSpanish and African Americans, respectively. Results and conclusions: A signi ﬁcant association was obtained in the Spanish study (OR ,1.47; 95%CI ,1.11  1.93; p,6.98e 3). The result was not signi ﬁcant in African Americans (OR ,0.98; 95%CI ,0.72 1.32; p ,0.88).

 Age structure of neurodegeneration onset is consistent with multistep aetiology,P19.36,R. L. McLaughlin,"Smur ﬁt Institute of Genetics, Dublin, Ireland","Introduction: Most neurodegenerative diseases are highly heritable, implying genetically determined disease risk andonset. Despite this, neurodegeneration does not typically begin until later in life, with peak incidence between the sixth and eighth decades. Using an epidemiological methodclassically applied to cancer, a linear relationship between log scaled incidence and log scaled age was recently demonstrated for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, supporting amultistep model of disease onset due to six discreet time  associated steps (or exposures) on average. In this study, we sought to determine whether other ICD 10 classi ﬁed dis  eases of the nervous system appear to be multistep in nature. Materials and methods: We used least squares regres  sion to ﬁt the model log(incidence) ~ (n 1)log(age) in published estimates of age speci ﬁc incidence of neurologi  cal diseases to estimate n, the average number of steps required for disease onset. Results: Onset of age related neurodegeneration is consistent with multistep aetiology. For Parkinson ’s disease, the average number of steps required across bothsexes in a catchment population of 2 million white Americans was 8.4 (r 2,1; p,6.1×10 5; 474 cases). For Alzheimer ’s disease, 13.0 steps were required on average (r2,0.98; p ,8.6×10 4; 114 cases). This contrasts with epilepsy, which showed no evidence of a multistep aetiology (r2,0.01; p ,0.76; 501 cases from 0.9 million Icelanders). Conclusions: This model supports the conclusion that neurodegenerative diseases begin later in life because of theaccumulation of multiple time dependent steps or expo  sures. These could be environmental risk factors or age  associated biological changes in (eg) gene expression orbrain cell type composition, potentially interacting with genetic risk. R.L.

We aimed to analyse the association between epigenetic variants in geneencoding for NmU and metabolic phenotypes, and the potential mediating role of low grade in ﬂammation. Methods : A subcohort of 1,160 subjects were randomly selected from the Italian Moli sani cohort (2005 2010, ≥35years). Methylation levels at 17 CpG sites of NMU regions 76 (promoter) and 32 (intronic) were analysed usingpyrosequencing. Principal factor analysis (PFA) was performed to identify the main methylation patterns. Multivariable regressions (age, sex, smoking, alcohol andvegetables consumption as covariates) were performed to estimate the associations between resulting factors and metabolic phenotypes (BMI, waist, blood pressure, glucose,lipids and apolipoproteins A and B). False discovery rate (FDR) was used to correct for multiple comparisons. Mediation analyses were performed using a compositeindex of circulating in ﬂammation based on hsCRP, granuocyte to lymphocyte ratio, platelet and white blood cell count (INFLA score). Results: PFA on CpG sites identi ﬁed two factors for each region. F1 of region 76 was signi ﬁcantly associated with lipid related parameters (total cholesterol, 4.5±1.4 mg/dL,10.8% of variance explained, p ,0.001; ApoB, 0.03±0.01 g/ L, 12.2% of variance explained, p ,0.0004). F1 was also signiﬁcantly associated with granulocyte to lymphcyte ratio, in turn associated with total cholesterol and ApoB (all p<0.0001) and mediated part of the total effect of F1 on the lipid related phenotypes (24.1%, p ,0.012, and 25.4%, p,0.003). Conclusion: Methylation patterns in the promoter region of the NMU gene could jointly modulate lipid relatedparameters and low grade in ﬂammation.

Lamnissou1","1Department of Biology, National & Kapodistrian Uni","versity of Athens, Athens, Greece,21st Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology, Alexandra Hospital, School ofMedicine, National & Kapodistrian University of Athens, Athens, Greece Background: Paraoxonase 1 (PON 1) is a calcium depen  ded antioxidant glycoprotein and one of the HDL structures. The PON 1 coding region has the two polymorphismsL55M (163T>C) and Q192R (575A>G). The purpose of the present study was to investigate the possible association between these PON 1 polymorphisms with the risk ofrecurrent spontaneous abortion (RSA) in a Caucasian Greek population. Materials and methods: A total of 280 women were enrolled in this case control study. The patient group consisted of 150 women identi ﬁed as RSA patients, and the controls were 130 women with at least two successfulpregnancies and without history of abortions. All indivi  duals were genotyped for the PON 1 polymorphisms by PCR RFLP method. Results: Statistical analysis of the results indicated that for PON 1 L55M variant the differences of genotype or allele frequencies between RSA patient and control groupswere statistically signi ﬁcant. In contrary, no signi ﬁcant differences have been observed in genotype or allele frequencies among the patient and the control groups forthe PON 1 Q192R variant. Conclusion: Our results indicated that the PON 1 polymorphism L55M (163T>C) may represent a usefulbiomarker of RSA susceptibility in the Greek Caucasian population and with combined effects of environmental factors might contribute to RSA prevalence.

Sepsis susceptibility and poor out  come have been observed, independently from patients age, gender and comorbidities. Nitric oxide (NO) synthesized byendothelial NO (eNOS) or inducible NO (iNOS) synthase, plays signi ﬁcant role in pathogenesis of sepsis. INOS has been associated with NO overload and hypotension insepsis. ENOS derived NO is linked to the upregulation of proin ﬂammatory cytokines and production of superoxides. This study aimed to assess the in ﬂuence of eNOS haplo  types ( T786C, 4b/4a, G894T polymorphisms) and iNOS rs2297518 gene variant on severe complications and mor  tality in surgical patients with secondary peritonitis. Material and methods: Study included 149 surgical patients with secondary peritonitis who underwent emer  gency laparotomy, surgical source control, antibiotictherapy and intensive care support. We evaluated the following outcomes: septic shock, multiple organ dysfunc  tion syndrome (MODS), mechanical ventilation andmortality. Genotyping was performed using Real time PCR ( rs2297518 ) or PCR RFLP method ( T786C, 4b/4a, G894T ).ENOS gene haplotypes were evaluated using the Haploview 4.2 software. Results: Patients with TbG eNOS haplotype were more frequently in ICU (p ,0.045) and required mechanical ventilation support (p ,0.003) more often than patients with other haplotypes. Analysis of rs2297518 using multiple logistic regression adjusted for confounding factors (age,APACHE II score and comorbidities) showed that MODS was more frequent in patients with GG genotype (p ,0.017). Conclusion: Ourﬁndings suggest that eNOS andiNOS polymorphisms may play a role in development of severe complications in surgical patients with secondary peritonitis. M. Gulic: None. N.

" The rs13107325 polymorphism of the SLC39A8 geneand body mass index in two teenage, European populations.M. Kafyra 1,2, M. Stathopoulou1, S. Siest1, G. Dedoussis1,2 1University of Lorraine, Nancy, France,2Harokopio University of Athens, Athens, Greece Introduction: Research on the effect of genetic background on Body Mass Index (BMI) in teenagers and its potential inﬂuence on adult BMI values, has unveiled the effect of various single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), includingthe rs13107325, in the SLC39A8 gene. The present analy sis, focuses on the role of the rs13107325 SNP on the BMI of two teenage, European populations. Materials and methods: We used data from two European cohorts; the Greek TEENAGE study (data used for n,654) and the French STANISLAS Family Study SFS (data used for n ,509). We examined the potential effect of the rs13107325 polymorphism on the z scores (zBMI) and logBMI of the teenagers. Analyses adjusted for age andgender, were conducted via linear regression modelling in SPSS, for the TEENAGE cohort. Given that some of the teenagers of the STANISLAS cohort could belong to thesame family, we tested for potential association using the R statistical software, the GWAF and kinship2 packages, to correct for familial resemblance. Results: The rs13107325 polymorphism was related both to zBMI ( β,0.23, p ,0.006) and logBMI ( β,0.01, p,0.005) of the Greek teenagers. The polymorphism did not display any signi ﬁcant associations, neither with zBMI (p,0,63), nor with logBMI (p ,0.48), when referring to the French teenagers. Conclusion: Genetic background plays a major part in obesity development, even from adolescence. Variations in the effect of loci display great interest and lay thefoundation for the creation of genetic scores, for the prediction of the genetically associated obesity develop ment risk.

So far, few studies identi ﬁed the susceptibility genes of smoking relapse around the world. The study was aimed to investi  gate the genetic variants associated with smoking relapse in Taiwan. Materials and methods: A total of 600 current smokers having at least one quitting attempt during the 2 year follow up were recruited. Fifteen SNPs in seven candidategenes (CHRNA3, CHRNA5, CYP2A6, CYP2B6, 5HT 2A, 5HT 3A, 5HT 3B) were genotyped. Logistic regression and Cox proportional hazard models were used to explore theassociation between the genetic variants and smoking relapse as well as their association over time. Results: After adjusted for gender, age, smoking durations and cigarettes per day, we found that the TC genotype of rs578776 in CHRNA3 gene compared with TT genotype (OR ,0.68, 95%C.I. ,0.47 0.97) and the CT genotype of rs518425 in CHRNA5 gene compared with CC genotype (OR ,0.68, 95%C.I. ,0.48 0.98) would decrease the risk of smoking relapse. Moreover, the TTgenotype of rs33940208 in 5HT 3Agene compared with CC genotype would increase the risk of smoking relapse (OR,2.80, 95%C.I. ,1.19 6.60). Smokers carrying an additional T allele of rs33940208 would relapse more easily (OR ,1.40, 95%C.I. ,1.05 1.86). However, we did notﬁnd any associations between other four genes and smoking relapse.

We examine four SNP volume associations for the putamen, pallidum, caudate and hippocampus in a neonatalcohort. Methods: Data was obtained as part of the Developing Human Connectome Project. Our full, mixed ancestralcohort comprised 411 term born infants with accompanying MRI and genetic data (European subsample 202). Infant DNA was genotyped for SNPs genome wide and standardquality control and imputation were performed. MRI images were acquired at term equivalent age. Volume estimates for the caudate, putamen, pallidum and hippo campus were extracted using a neonatal atlas. We used a linear regression model with an additive model of association for each genetic variant, including gestationalage at birth, postmenstrual age at scan, intracranial volume, gender and ancestry principal components as covariates. The main analysis was with a European cohort (fourimaging phenotypes, corrected p value, p < 0.0125). Signi ﬁcant results were replicated in the full mixed  ancestral cohort. Results: In the European cohort there was a signi ﬁcant association between SNP rs945270 and putamen volume (p,0.0027, β,0.14, SE ,0.04) and a borderline association between SNP rs61921502 and hippocampal volume (p,0.012, β, 0.12, SE ,0.046). The putamen result replicated in the full mixed ancestral cohort (p ,3.81x10   4,β,0.12, SE ,0.03) suggesting this relationship is robust across different ancestries at birth. Conclusions: SNP rs945270 was signi ﬁcantly associated with putamen volume in a European and mixed ancestral neonatal cohort showing the relationship previously described in adults, is present at birth.

Mishra2, G. Mishra1","1Indian Council of Medical Research   National Institute of Pathology, New Delhi, India,2Symbiosis School of Biological Sciences, Symbiosis International (Deemed University), Pune, India The human leukocyte antigen (HLA) region with its mul  tiple genes and extreme polymorphism is known to be the greatest contributor to the genetic susceptibility to type 1diabetes (T1D). To evaluate the risk of developing T1D, it is important to de ﬁne the individual ’s HLA type, particu  larly HLA DRB1 and  DQB1 allele. Individuals who arepositive for HLA DQA1*05:01 DQB1*02:01 (DQ2) on HLA DRB1*03 (DR3) and DQA1*03:01 DQB1*03:02 (DQ8) on HLA DRB1*04 (DR4) have the highest risk ofdeveloping T1D. For determining HLA DR/ DQ types relevant to T1D, there are various HLA typing methods but most of these are time consuming and expensive Hence, weused four SNPs, namely, rs3104413, rs285427, rs9273363 and rs2187668 to identify the HLA DR/DQ types relevant to T1D, viz., DR3/4, DR3/3, DR3/X, DR4/4, DR4/X, andDRX/X (where X ≠DR3 nor DR4). We genotyped 135 samples of (80 T1D and 55 healthy controls) for the SNPs using ARMS PCR. The PCR parameters were stan dardized and performed using in house standardised pro  tocol. Further, we validated our SNP based HLA DR/DQ screening using HLA DRB1/DQB1 combi genotyping SSPkits (BAG Healthcare, Germany). Out of the 80 T1D patients, 63 patients (78.6%) and 10 out of 55 healthy individuals (18.18%) were found to be positive for high riskHLA DRB1*03 DQB1*02 haplotype(p<0.01). For HLA  DRB1*04 DQB1*03 haplotype, 17 out of 80 T1D (23.75%) and 8 out of 55 healthy individuals (14.55%) werepositive(p<0.01). Our SNP based screening method showed 100% concordance with the kit based method. Using our SNP based HLA typing, we were able to predict HLA DR/DQ types relevant to T1D accurately in a rapid and cost  effective manner. N. Chuzho: None. N. Kumar: None. N. Mishra: None. G.

A number of genes related to vitamin D metabolism were also impli  cated to contribute to the susceptibility to persistent TBinfection among which vitamin D receptor (VDR) has been well studied. Aim of the study is to evaluate the possible role of the VDR polymorphisms and polymorphisms of theother genes involved in vitamin D pathway on TB sus  ceptibility in Kazakhstani population. Materials and methods: DNA samples from 84 participants were included to the current study. SNPs were genotyped on a SNP array using qualitative real time PCR on a Life Technologies Quantstudio 12K Real Time PCRsystem using the cycle relative threshold (Crt) method. 11 SNPs from 8 genes of the vitamin D metabolic pathway were subsequently analyzed. Results: We speci ﬁcally analyzed 11 SNPs belonging to the following genes: DHCR7, CYP2R1, GC 1, CYP24A1, CYP27A1, CYP27B1, VDR and TNF α. These genes play a number of different roles including synthesis, activation, delivery and binding of the activated vitamin D. Our preliminary results indicate signi ﬁcant association of VDR (Vitamin D receptor) SNPs (rs1544410, BsmI, with OR,0.425, CI ,0.221 0.816, p ,0.009 and rs731236, Taq I with OR ,0.443, CI ,0.228 0.859, p ,0.015) and CYP24A1 (rs6013897 with OR ,0.436, CI ,0.191 0.996, P,0.045) with TB.

This studyaimed to identify circulating prognostic biomarkers in order to select melanoma patients at high risk of tumor progres  sion at the time of diagnosis. We hypothesized that circu lating miRNAs could provide information about melanoma progression at the time of primary tumor excision. Materials and methods: We performed RNA Seq on 25 plasma samples from patients with primary cutaneous melanoma. We investigated the differential expression of miRNAs in stages I III at the time of diagnosis. Functionalanalysis of the involved molecular pathways was also performed. Results: miR 182 5p was downregulated, and miR 199a  5p, miR 877 3p, miR 1228 3p and miR 3613 5p upregu  lated in stage III in comparison with stage IA melanoma patients. Functional analysis of this set of circulatingmiRNAs revealed their involvement in molecular pathways related to cancer. Conclusions: Low circulating levels of miR 182 5p, and high miR 199a 5p, miR 877 3p, miR 1228 3p and miR  3613 5p levels, are associated with advanced melanoma stage at the time of primary tumor excision, and maytherefore serve to recommend sentinel lymph node biopsy and to guide surveillance follow up and imaging studies schedule for tumor staging. Our ﬁndings may serve to anticipate the stage at the moment of the initial diagnosis and, therefore, to avoid a delay in the initiation of the adjuvant therapy.

In recent years, miR 210 has been shown as one of the main biomarkers, associated with various diseases, including pre eclampsia (PE). Materials and methods: We obtained miRNAs linked with preeclampsia from the manually curated pregnancy pathology database PregMiR was developed us early(https://pregmir.ott.ru/ ). miRNA were included in the analysis only if their differential expression between samples with PE and normal samples was signi ﬁcant (adjusted p< 0.05). Results: We observed that miR 152, miR 1 and miR  193b were only detected in studies with a changed miR 210level, whereas miR 27a, miR 29a, miR 130a and miR 519b were detected in studies without miRNA 210 differential expression. It can be assumed that the most likelymechanisms of PE development in the early pregnancy stage are either upregulation of miR 210, miR 152, miR  518b and downregulation of miR 126; or upregulation ofmiR 126 and downregulation of miR 182 and miR 518b. Late stages of PE are determined by miR 210, miR 152, miR 518b, miR 21, miR 155, miR 181a, miR 182, miR 193b 3p, miR 517c, miR 518e (upregulation) and miR 126, miR 18a, miR 195, miR 223, let 7f (downregulation); or miR 27a, miR 29a, miR 130a and miR 519d, miR 517c,miR 518e miR 155, miR 126, miR 181a, miR 195 (upre  gulation) and miR 223, miR 18a, miR 182 (downregulation). Conclusions: The presented results allow speculation about the in ﬂuence of certain miRNAs on PE developmentin the context of the presence or absence of miR 210 differential expression, but additional experimental studies are required to evaluate the ﬁndings.

Herein, we have investigated association of single nucleotide polimorphisms (SNP) in IFNG and CLEC5A and vaccine ef ﬁcacy, looking for elucidate the genotypic and phenotypic mechanisms that may also be correlated to post vaccination adverse events. Material and Methods: Blood samples from thirty volunteers vaccinated with YF17DD were collected 0, 4, 7 and 10 after immunization (DAI). RT qPCR assay was carried out to quantify expression of CLEC5A, IFNG, IL6, RNASEL, IRF7, IRF9, STAT2 and OAS1 . SNP Allelic discriminations was carried using TaqMan assays. Blood cell were stimulated with the envelope viral protein andphenotyped by ﬂow cytometry. Results: We observed an association between CLEC5A rs13237944 (AC/CC, p ,0.04), and IFNG rs2069718 (AA/ TT, p,0.01) and rs2430561 (AG/AA, p ,0.04) and high antibody levels, also presenting high expression levels of CLEC5A and IFNG mRNA respectively.

Here, we were curious about whether or not there is possible forthcoming genomicbeneﬁts on the molecular basis. Materials and methods: The olive ( Olea europae , Genome ID:10724 ) genome sequence in the Pubmed genome database was aligned with the human genome using website NucleotidBlast. The variations of the matching sequences with nearest restriction sites wereinvestigated in online databases such as Pubmed, PolyPhen  2, Exac.browser. Results: Multiple matched oligo sequences (at least 28 to more than 500 bp in length) were found in 67 genes with a similarity rate of 73 100%. Among these genes, remarkable sequence matches were found in cancer related genes(BRAF, BRMS1L, SDHA ) and calmodulin ( CALM1, CALM3 ) genes. There are many pathological (Egs; rs267607276, rs1060602608, rs1064796271, rs155814427on CALM1 gene leading to Long QT syndrome) and non  pathological variations de ﬁned on the human genome at the matched sequences, but interestingly the wild types of themwere present in the olive genome. Another notable ﬁnding was the presence of diverse restriction enzyme sites within the matching sequences. Conclusions: Presence of wild type DNA sequences at the plant genome while the disease causing mutations reported in the similar human genome sequences give theclues of possible genomic based therapies could emerge as the phytotherapy protocols. Moreover, we wondered if oral consumption of genome carrying seeds might give rise totherapy regimens as the DNA pills. Those questions would need more detailed investigations to elucidate them.M.

" Role of Genetic Nurse in the Gastrointestinal CancersClinic at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in Oman988 J. del PicchiaI. Alhaddabi , A. AlSayegh, Z. Bruwer, K. Al Kharusi SQUH, Muscat, OmanIntroduction: The cancer genetics service was introduced at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital in 2011 run by acancer geneticist and genetic nurse. The principle goal of the clinic is to provide genetic counselling and testing to individuals affected with or at increased risk of an inheritedcancer. Aim: This study aimed to look into the number of families that were seen for gastrointestinal cancer GI duringthe last ﬁve years and to describe the role of the genetic nurse within the clinic. Method: The database was reviewed to identify all GI cancer cases that were tested from 2015 till 2019 seen. The role of the genetic nurse was explored over the ﬁve year period and the involvement in clinic related procedures wasdocumented. Results: Two hundred and twenty patients were identi ﬁed with a pathogenic variant. Predictive testing was offered to136 family members (greatest number seen in 2018 2019). Initially the role of the genetic nurse was limited to admin related tasks like arranging follow up appointments andreferrals to gastroenterologist. This developed to include educating affected individuals about the importance of family screening and surveillance, facilitating groupsessions for family support and promoting a multidisci plinary approach with greater involvement of the GI team. Conclusion: A large number of cases are being seen in Oman in our tertiary hospital. Predictive testing has increased exponentially over the last two years. This is likely related to the improvements that have been put inplace by the cancer genetics team and genetic nurse.",P22.01,I. Alhaddabi: None. A. AlSayegh: None. Z. Bruwer:,None. K.

Communicating complex diagnoses to patients, explaining the effects of rare mutations (or eventhe very concept of a DNA mutation) can be challenging in medical genetics. What is obvious to us medical profes  sionals in genetics, may not be obvious to anyone else. Having realised that words might not be the ultimate form of communication, we have started an experimental method of creating individualised, caricature esk diagrams some times assembled into comic strips to explain dif ﬁcult con  cepts to patients and their primary health care providers. Mental pictures rendered into actual images with the com plete avoidance of jargon and confusing expressions are not only an effective method of communicating complex issues, but it might be a successful way of reaching out to dif ﬁcult populations, such as parents with anti vaccine beliefs.

Clinicians are recommending testing, hoping for an early diagnosis. This may lead to early treatment; however, in some situations testing results are unexpected. We report anewborn with long QT syndrome. Methods: Targeted NGS, with a panel of 174 gene related to cardiologic phenotype (TruSightCardio Illumina)was used. The panel includes the KCNQ1, KCNH2, SCN5A, ANK2, KCNE1, KCNE2, KCNJ2, CACNA1C, CAV3, SCN4B, AKAP9, SNTA1, KCNJ5, CALM1 genes. Results. An eutrophic newborn male, with a 41 42 weeks gestational period, with normal evolution of neonatal jaundice, with a normal level of creatine kinase, without hypotonia wasexamined. During labor, a fracture of clavicula and lesion of the eye have been reported. While being monitored, a unique episode of bradycardia was observed and ECG wassuggestive for long QT syndrome. The NGS result did not indicate any genetic cause to explain patient ’s phenotype, but did report, as incidental ﬁnding in RYR1 , with a heterozygote, probably pathogenic, NM_000540.2: c.2390G>A, and VUS NM_000540.2:c.10648C>T.Pathogenic variants in RYR1 gene were associated with high clinical variability and multiple phenotypes: Suscept  ibility to Malignant Hyperthermia (OMIM 145600), AD; Central core disease, OMIM 117000, AD, AR; King  Denborough Syndrome (OMIM 145600), AD; Minicore myopathy with external ophthalmoplegia, (OMIM 255320),AR; Congenital neuromuscular disease with uniform ﬁber type 1 (OMIM 117000) AD, AR. Attributing clinical signiﬁcance for the variants was very dif ﬁcult due to lack of phenotype details and age of patient. Thus, susceptibility for Malign Hyperthermia, was reported as main possible association.

Puiu","Genetics Discipline, Center of Genomic Medicine, “Victor Babes, ”University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania Background: Noonan syndrome is an autosomal dominant genetic disorder, characterized by a wide spectrum of symptoms and clinical features, being characterized by short stature, skeletal malformations, hypertelorism, low set ears,pulmonary stenosis, congenital heart defect and thorax deformations. The most frequent involved genes are PTPN11 (50%), SOS1 (10 13%), RAF1 (5%), RIT1 (5%),KRAS (less than 5%). Aim: This study aims to correlate the genotype with the phenotype in NS patients in order to identify thecharacteristic features for each gene involved. Materials and method: 12 patients, aged 0 to 17 years old, with Noonan syndrome were diagnosed at the TimisoaraCentre for Genomic Medicine. The molecular testing was performed on MiSeq platform (Illumina) using TruSight Cardio Sequencing Panel. As expected, the most commonlyinvolved genes we found were: PTPN11 (c.1504T>G, c.923A>G, c.922A>G, c.236A>G, c.188A>G, c.767A>G) and SOS1 (c.512T>C, c.1322G>A, c.1277A>G, c.842G>T). Results: The main facial features characteristic for NS, mentioned above, were present in all cases, but we also found signi ﬁcant clinical differences between the patient ’s phenotype. The patients with PTPN11 pathogenic variants showed higher prevalence in developing aortic990 J. del Picchiaregurgitation, atrial septal defect, “café au lait ”spots, exophthalmia, umbilical hernia and thrombocytopenia while the patients with SOS1 were presenting hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, spastic tetra paresis, coarctation of the aorta, lymphedemas and joint laxity.

The aim of this study was to elicit the opinion ofRussian geneticists on genetic testing in relation to repro  ductive choice. Materials and methods: For the pilot study, a ques  tionnaire was developed containing questions for evaluating the main approach to patient counseling. The survey was attended by 30 geneticists. Results: All 30 geneticists answered that the prevention of the birth of children with a genetic disease is extremely important for them. 27/30 specialists agreed with thestatement “Before marriage, people should know if they or their partners are carriers of genetic diseases ”. The majority of respondents (23/30) agreed that ""The government shouldmake it mandatory to test for carriage of mutations in genes for common hereditary diseases.

Teaching them to leave behind all educated negative feelings about an exam, and showing them how toparticipate with open minds and hearts instead of fear and frustration in an examination, can make a difference in the way they perceive this examination and future ones. Thispaper shows a possible connection between feeling peaceful and fearless during an examination in medical genetics and respectively the better marks obtained by the participatingstudents. At the end of the ﬁrst term, in January 2019, 105 ﬁrst year medical students were asked to try to relax before an open book examination. The 2   4 minutes long relaxa tion technique began with deep breathing, followed by directing the mind to a place of peace, safety, support and love, and it ended with suggesting feelings of happiness andjoy, when seeing the high grade each one of them obtained.

Generally, this condition is characterized by the partial or complete absence of one X chromosome. Majority of girls with Turner syndrome can be diagnosed within childhood, but about 20% might be diagnosed at adolescence period. Short stature is the most commontrigger to have evaluation for those girls. Material and Method: We looked at the patient visited to outpatient with short statue as main complaint from 2013to 2019. Retrospective data on age at diagnosis, reason for karyotype analysis and presenting clinical features was collected from the medical records. Result : We have seen 53 girls with short statue. All the patients had been through karyotyping as primary screening of short statue. Of those, 5 were diagnosed as Turnersyndrome. 2 had other genetic condition and 10 was diagnosed as persistent short statue related small for gestational age. Most of them were diagnosed as idiopathic.All the girls with Turner syndrome have been on regular check up with pediatrician and/or gynecologist. Conclusion: Girls with Turner syndrome were diagnosed at early childhood.

Clinical manifestations involve central and per  ipheral nervous system. Patients can experience recurrentacute attacks that can be not only life threating, but also chronically debilitating.Material and Methods : Retrospective data from medical records and clinical questionnaires with patients followed in a reference center in Brazil Results 24 patients (20 females and four males) were enrolled. Media age of symptoms onset was 22 years (range: 12 47 years). All patients reported recurrent porphyria related symptoms, such aspain, neurological and/or psychiatric disorders, nevertheless other systemic complications as hypertension and chronic kidney disease were seen in 10 patients. The medianfrequency of attacks in the last year was 3 times, and the duration of every attack was 8 days. Analgesic dependency to opioid was seen in 12 patients.

In light of trends such as big data analysis and value based healthcare, which respectively emphasize ef ﬁcient data utilization and positive patient outcomes, extended use of genetic data to provide care is being discussed. This care may or may not be relevant to an initial indication. Exam ples include providing polygenic risk scores, certain inci  dental ﬁndings or pharmacogenetic passports. This study aims to explicate the values and principles of involvedexperts that underlie expanded use of genetic data to establish a starting point for ethical clinical conduct, and to clarify how experts think patients might bene ﬁt. Methods: Semi structured interviews, based on prevalent principles in medical ethics, have been conducted among 8 experts involved in expanding the scope of clinical geneticsat the Erasmus Medical Center, including clinical geneti  cists, lab technicians, and bio informaticians. Results: Common principles in medical ethics (most notably autonomy, bene ﬁcence, non male ﬁcence and jus  tice) prove useful in describing ethical conditions for clinical conduct, but were speci ﬁed and supplemented in ways that depart from current clinical practice, and differed among experts. Motivation for expanded use of genetic data, expected patient bene ﬁt, and expectations concerning departmental responsibility showed only moderate overlap between experts.Conclusions: Identi ﬁed values and principles can provide the fundaments for developing and evaluating ethical clinical conduct in expanded genetic diagnostics, but further explication is required for convergence between experts.

It is determined that such work should be carried out considering the need to protect data onthe genome. There are legal provisions related to both human rights and fundamental freedoms, and the regime of genetic information as a type of personal data. This meansthat the legal component of the genetic passportization goes far beyond addressing the issue of creating genetic pass  ports. According to the International Declarations onHuman Rights research in this area should not prevail over respect for fundamental freedoms and dignity of people. Scientists warn against possible abuses in this area talkingabout the creation of two types of passports: a forensic passport and a passport that re ﬂects risks to human health and other features of his body. We proceed from the need to develop specialized genetic passports. The main use of genetic information today is limited to medicine and for  ensics.

Inyushkin,"Samara National Research University, SAMARA, Russian FederationAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 993The principle of con ﬁdentiality is one of the key legal and ethical principles for building relationships between parties in many areas of public life. Its essence is that the information obtained in the course of work is not subject to deliberate or accidental disclosure, and in a situation where it is necessary to transfer it to third parties, it must be presented in a formthat excludes its use against the interests of its owner. The principle of con ﬁdentiality accompanies the entire set of actions carried out with genetic information. It is inextricablylinked to such legal institutions as “medical secrecy ”,“per  sonal data ”, principle of informed consent, “autonomy of the patient ’sw i l l ”etc. Within the genetic research, the content and forms of manifestation of this principle have a certain speciﬁcity, which requires special attention in the legal reg  ulation of the relevant provisions. Thus, the informationobtained during genetic research is not strictly individual, since it may relate to family members of the owner of genetic information. In this regard, in many cases there is a need inmaking a compromise decision. This aspect leads to cases of deviation from the strict rules of con ﬁdentiality. Russian legislation requires the development of a clear and consistentalgorithm for performing appropriate actions by a specialist.

Initially, Rebrikov ’s research team worked with the CCR5 gene related to HIV resistance. But their methodology was different from that used by He. They tested it on abnormal embryos that could not be transferredto the uterus due to genetic defects. Then he changed his goal and decided to edit the GJB2 gene, causing hereditary deafness. He said in the media that already has severalfamilies that could take part in an experiment on editing embryos. Materials and methods: the content analysis method was used to analyze publications in the Russian media. Results: this problem should be considered from three perspectives: clinical ethics (normative regulation ofresearch, ethical aspects of safety and reliability of technologies); ethical and philosophical issues ( “designedbaby”, the emergence of new forms of social inequality, interference with the evolution of humankind, etc.); and research ethics (reputation of a scientist in the scienti ﬁc world, biotechnological race, IRB).

On anational level, both the British Nuf ﬁeld Council and the German Ethics Council have published comprehensive reports on ethical aspects of HGGE. Analysis of the twodocuments may provide valuable insight into the current state of opinion formation in Europe and help to clarify the prospect for developing a common European policyon HGGE. Materials and methods: Analysis and comparison of the Nufﬁeld Council ’s report, Genome Editing and Human Reproduction “(2018) and the German Ethics Council ’s opinion, Intervening in the Human Germline “(2019). Results: Even though public attitudes towards genetic and reproductive technologies have traditionally been much more sceptical in Germany than in the UK, conclusions on HGGE reached by the Nuf ﬁeld Council and (the majority of) the German Ethics Council are rather similar. Both committees are open towards further exploration of the potential of HGGE. Differences appear when it comes to theway ethical questions on HGGE are framed, but also with regard to a number of substantial issues (e.g. embryo research or the relevance of the therapy/enhancementdistinction). Conclusion: Despite remaining differences, the two councils ’reports re ﬂect tendencies towards convergence of opinion between the UK and Germany (and maybe within Europe more generally) on genetic and reproductive technologies.

The SCD communities require high quality, accurate, and accessible information about novel curative genetic therapies. Methods: Searched the world wide web (WWW) for patient education materials (PEM) on gene therapy, gene editing and curative genetic therapies for SCD. News mediaarticles, magazines, personal stories and scienti ﬁc publica  tions were excluded. A secondary search was conducted by a medical librarian to identify additional educationalmaterials. PEM quality was evaluated using the United States Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool forPrint or Audiovisual materials (PEMAT P; PEMAT AV). The readability of PEM was assessed utilizing the Flesch  Kincaid Grade Level (FKGL) and the Simple Measure ofGobbledygook (SMOG). Scienti ﬁc Accuracy Score (SAS) was assessed by two reviewers and a gene therapy clinical expert. The assessment of the scienti ﬁc accuracy included an evaluation of the risks and bene ﬁts. Results: Authors identi ﬁed on the WWW twelve patient education materials: 8 webpages, 1 infographic and 3educational videos. Findings include FKGL, SMOG and SAS scores. PEMAT understandability scores ranged from 60   93% (± 9.78), average 77%, and the actionabilityscores ranged from 0   70% (±33.8), average 40%. Conclusion: Access to quality PEM about novel curative genetic therapies for SCD is a requirement for diseaseadvocacy community engagement and study participant recruitment for ongoing clinical trials.

However, the gene regulatory landscape of the hypothalamus remainsunclear. We characterized the physical relationships among gene promoters and their corresponding cis regulatory ele  ments in human embryonic stem cell (ESC) derived hypo thalamic cells by integrating RNA seq, ATAC seq and promoter focused Capture C pro ﬁles. We conducted thiseffort in an in vitro model of hypothalamic neurons using human ESCs at 3 stages of differentiation: ESCs, hypo  thalamic progenitors (HPs) and hypothalamic like neurons (HNs). We identi ﬁed 87,170 open chromatin regions (OCRs) contacting promoters in at least 1 stage of HN differentiation. Interestingly, we observed that regardless ofgene expression pattern during differentiation, overall accessibility of interacting OCRs ﬁrst increased during the transition to HP, then decreased following differentiation toHN. In order to relate these ﬁndings to GWAS data, we tested for enrichment of SNPs within promoter interacting OCRs. We found signi ﬁcant associations with BMI, sleep traits, age at menarche (AAM) and major depressive dis  order (MDD). We mapped these trait associated variants to their physically interacting genes. We identi ﬁed 2 putative effector genes for AAM ( RPS26 andSUOX ) and 1 for BMI (DHRS11 ), which were also supported by colocalized hypothalamus eQTLs in GTEx. Additionally, HyPrColocanalyses revealed several putative effector genes associated with >1 trait, including ZRANB2 for AAM, BMI and MDD, andFEZF1 for AAM and BMI. Taken together, our ana  lyses provide insight into cis regulatory architecture during hypothalamic development and how it may contribute to hypothalamus associated phenotypes.

Impaired autophagy has been associatedwith a range of complex human diseases, yet congenital core autophagy disorders are exceedingly rare. Patients: Whole exome sequencing identi ﬁed pathogenic bi allelic variants in the novel disease gene ATG7 , encoding a core autophagy protein, in seven individuals from four families who display complex neurodevelopmental dis orders distinguished by selective neurological, neuromus  cular and endocrine dysfunction. Contrasting Atg7 null mice that demonstrate perinatal lethality, all patientsinvestigated are now adults. Results: ATG7 variants lead to diminished levels or loss of ATG7 protein, causing severe attenuation or completeabsence of autophagic reactions including LC3 lipidation in patient derived ﬁbroblasts and a marked reduction in starvation induced long lived protein degradation. Expres sion of mutant atg7 failed to rescue the autophagic defect displayed by Δatg7 yeast. Skeletal muscle biopsy with no detectable ATG7 protein demonstrated myopathic changesincluding accumulation of p62 and focal mitochondrial dysfunction. Despite the loss of ATG7, we detected autophagosomes and autolysosomes in patient ﬁbroblasts and muscle, in support of an alternative autophagy pathway driving their biogenesis. Moreover, RNA sequencing of patient ﬁbroblasts highlighted dysfunctional spinocerebellar ataxia associated ITPR1  signalling.Conclusion: Our study provides the ﬁrst clinical, genetic and mechanistic demonstration that mutated ATG7 leads to profound neurological disease in humans who are able to survive for decades in the absence of canonical autophagy, deﬁning the importance of this pivotal pathway in human health.

 A transcriptome wide Mendelian randomization study to dissect the molecular aetiology of autoimmune diseaseand cancer outcomes,P24.04,"C. Prince , T. G. Richardson","MRC Integrative Epidemiology Unit, Population Health","Sciences, University of Bristol, Bristol, United Kingdom Developing functional understanding into the causal mole  cular drivers of immunological disease is a critical challengein genomic medicine. Here we use Mendelian randomiza  tion (MR) methods to investigate the effect of genetically predicted gene expression on 12 autoimmune and 4 canceroutcomes. Gene expression data from the eQTLGen con  sortium (n ,31,684) was leveraged to construct weakly correlated genetic instruments (r2<0.1) for 15,392genes. Applying the inverse variance weighted MR method transcriptome wide whilst accounting for linkage dis  equilibrium structure identi ﬁed 773 unique genes with evidence of a genetically predicted effect on at least one disease outcome. We next applied genetic colocalization to investigate whether these effects may be con ﬁned to speci ﬁc cell types using data derived from 18 types of immune cells. This highlighted various cell type speci ﬁc relationships, including PRKCQ and asthma which appeared to be T cell speciﬁc, as well as PTK2B and in ﬂammatory bowel disease, which was restricted to monocytes and neutrophils. Fur  thermore, as the use of human genetics can help improvethe ef ﬁcacy and safety rates of drug targets, we undertook a phenome wide MR analysis for each of these 773 genes on 335 health related outcomes. This atlas of results can beused to prioritise which of these potential therapeutic targets is least likely to cause unanticipated adverse effects.

The majority of T1D  associated polymorphisms lie in noncoding regions of thegenome and many are predicted to alter the secondary structure and expression of long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). We performed a complete functional char acterization of a lncRNA that harbors a T1D associated SNP, namely Lnc13 . Materials and methods: Overexpression and disruption ofLnc13 were performed in the human pancreatic β cell line EndoC  βH1 using allele speci ﬁc overexpression vec  tors and CRISPR Cas9 mediated deletion. Polyinosinic:polycytidylic acid (PIC) was used to mimic a virus related inﬂammatory response. RNA antisense puri ﬁcation (RAP) and RNA immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays were imple mented to characterize the binding partners of Lnc13. In vitro experiments were further corroborated with expression analysis of human pancreatic islets. Results: Human pancreatic islets harboring the T1D  associated Lnc13 risk allele (rs917997*CC) showed higher STAT1 expression than islets harboring the heterozygous genotype (rs917997*CT). Upregulation of Lnc13 in pan  creatic β cells allele speci ﬁcally increased activation of thepro in ﬂammatory STAT1 pathway, correlating with increased production of chemokines. In contrast, Lnc13 disruption partially counteracted PIC induced STAT1 and pro in ﬂammatory chemokine expression. In the presence of PIC, Lnc13 translocated from the nucleus to the cytoplasm acting as a linker between the 3 ’ UTR of STAT1 and the protein PCBP2, allowing the formation of a complex that stabilizes STAT1 mRNA and sustains β cell in ﬂammation. Conclusions: Our results demonstrate that Lnc1 3 reg  ulates virus induced in ﬂammation in pancreatic β cells through a molecular mechanism that involves allele speci ﬁc activation of the STAT1 signaling pathway.

Here we have applied aMendelian randomization (MR) framework using geneti  cally predicted variation in gene expression to prioritize candidate drug targets for the treatment of CVD. We systematically evaluated the association between 8,851 genes each had ≥2 cis eQTLs based on results from the eQTLGen Consortium) and 5 CVD risk factors from theUK Biobank (UKB) (body mass index, systolic and diastolic blood pressure, low density lipoprotein cholesterol and triglycerides). Associated genes were then analyzedusing factorial MR to evaluate evidence of an additive CVD lowering effect compared to an HMGCR score acting as a proxy for statin inhibition. Phenome wide analyses wereconducted to evaluate the associations with between 569 traits to elucidate potential adverse effects.

Material and methods: We combined mouse genetics with molecular high throughput genomic technologies onex vivo and in vitro human cells to discover the molecular nature of CRC causing Wnt signaling machinery. Results: Here we ﬁnd that, in CRC cells and in developing mouse forelimbs, BCL9 proteins sustain the action of β catenin in a largely PYGO independent manner. Our genetic analyses implied that BCL9 necessitates otherinteraction partners in mediating its transcriptional output. We identi ﬁed the transcription factor TBX3 as a candidate tissue speci ﬁc member of the β catenin transcriptional complex. In developing forelimbs, TBX3 and BCL9 co  occupy a large number of Wnt responsive regulatory elements, genome wide. Moreover, mutations in Bcl9 affect the expression of TBX3 targets in vivo, and modulation of TBX3 abundance impacts on Wnt target genes transcriptionin a β catenin  and TCF/LEF dependent manner. Finally, TBX3 overexpression exacerbates the metastatic potential of Wnt dependent human CRC cells. Conclusion: Our work implicates TBX3 as a new, context dependent component of the Wnt/ β catenin depen  dent enhanceosome. Our study suggests a new paradigm inwhich tissue speci ﬁc co factors might be the key to understand the spectrum of possible transcriptional outputs observed downstream of Wnt/ β catenin signaling.

 Complex genomic rearrangements in MECP2 duplica tion syndrome,P24.11,M. Gandhi,"1, D. Pehlivan1, C. M. Grochowski1, B. Suter2,J .","M. Fatih1, H. Y. Zoghbi1, J. R. Lupski1, C. M. B. Carvalho1 1Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX, United States, 2Texas Children ’s Hospital, Houston, TX, United States MECP2 Duplication Syndrome (MDS) is a neurodevelop  mental disorder caused by copy number gains of the MECP2 gene at the Xq28 locus. The clinical presentation is variable, but there are several predominant features, including infantile hypotonia, severe developmental delay/ intellectual disability, recurrent respiratory infections, andepilepsy. One possible explanation for this variability is the distinct structural variants (SVs) among MDS patients at this locus, 26% of which were previously reported ascomplex genomic rearrangements (CGRs). To pursue a robust genotype phenotype correlation, a combination of custom high resolution array comparative genomic hybri dization (aCGH), droplet digital PCR (ddPCR), whole  genome sequencing (WGS), and genomic optical mapping were used to resolve MECP2 SVs in 89 MDS probands. This analysis revealed CGRs constitute 46.1% (41/89) of our cohort, including 15.7% (14/89) triplications (5/14 involving triplicated MECP2 ), 5.6% (5/89) DUP NML  DUP (two duplications separated by a copy number neutral segment), and 10.1% (9/89) involving a translocation. De novo SVs were observed in 18.1% (12/66) of probands: 4 translocations, 4 terminal duplications, 3 single duplica  tions, and 1 DUP NML DUP rearrangement. Interestingly,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 999our data demonstrate that CGRs are observed in almost half of MDS patients, with triplications being amongst the most common copy number ﬁnding. In 9/14 cases with triplica  tions, MECP2 did not map within the triplicated interval. Probands who carry a de novo MECP2 duplication have a higher likelihood of carrying a translocation (4) or largeterminal duplication (4), which may contribute to a more severe phenotype.

Although the etiology of MA is likely to be of genetic origin, only 13 genes have been reported as recurrentpotential causes of MA. Material and Methods : Exome sequencing in 147 selected MA patients (discovery cohort and twovalidation cohorts). Results : We identi ﬁed 5 novel genes responsible for MA (ADAD2 ,TERB1 ,SHOC1 ,MSH4 , and RAD21L1 ), for which mouse knockout (KO) models are concordant with the human phenotype. Four of them were validated in the two independent MA cohorts. In addition, 9 patients carriedpathogenic variants in 7 previously reported genes   TEX14 , DMRT1 ,TEX11 ,SYCE1 ,MEIOB ,MEI1 and STAG3   allowing to upgrade the clinical signi ﬁcance of these genes for diagnostic purposes. Our meiotic studies provide novel insight into the functional consequences of the variants, supporting their pathogenic role. Conclusions: Diagnosing complete MA based on a genetic test is clinically relevant because affected patients should not undergo invasive testis surgery (TESE). Ourﬁndings contribute substantially to the development of a pre TESE prognostic gene panel. Wider implications include the understanding of potential genetic links betweenNOA and cancer predisposition, and between NOA and premature ovarian failure.

The recent completion of return of results from The 100,000 Genomes Project for Moor ﬁelds Eye hospital NHS Foundation Trust highlighted the vast potential of Whole Genome Sequen  cing (WGS) to maximise diagnosis in IED. Methods and Results: As part of the 100,000 Genomes project (pilot and main study), 1673 recruited cases were analysed. WGS analysis consisted of evaluation of potentially disease causing variation, based on the ACMGevidence framework and application of suitable curated virtual panel(s) from PanelApp ( https://panelapp. genomicsengland.co.uk/ ), resolving 54% (903/1673) of cases. In an additional 17% (291/1673) of cases, variants identi ﬁed outside of this ﬁltering strategy included non  coding, structural and those that were otherwise ﬁltered out or outside the gene panel. Examples included: 1) Strength of genetic evidence: e.g. curation and identi ﬁcation of known disease alleles in ABCA4 (high frequency in control populations and those escaping standard in silico assessment) encompassed an additional 5% of total diagnoses. 2) Strength of phenotypicevidence: e.g. NR2E3 biallelic variants and pathognomonic clinical presentation of Enhanced S cone syndrome enabled identi ﬁcation of poorly annotated pathogenic variants in this gene. Conclusion: Crucial to improving diagnostic services will be the widespread implementation of WGS andincorporating multidisciplinary team meetings. In order to maximise WGS effectiveness, expanding the analysis outside of the coding regions of the targeted gene paneland evaluating the pathogenicity of different classes of variants will be an important step forward in the post  genome age.S.

The mechanism by which post transductional modi ﬁcations in ﬂuence the mitotic apparatus and the mitotic ﬁdelity remains poorly under  stood. Recent studies in mouse oocytes showed that Hdac8 controls meiotic spindle assembly. Using time lapse ima ging, we have found that HDAC8 co localizes on spindle microtubules and the midbody, and therefore appears to be involved in chromosome alignment and accurate spindleassembly. We used HeLA cells and human derived lym  phoblastoid cell lines expressing a mutant HDAC8 allele as in vitro culture systems, both capable of recapitulating the in vivo events. These models proved to be valuable tools to understand how HDAC8 depletion affects genomic stability during mitosis. We observed that mutant HDAC8 led to theformation of anaphase bridges and lagging chromosomes, tripolar cells and inef ﬁcient chromosome congression. We found strong evidence that HDAC8 acts as genomeeuploidy guardian, and understanding the underlying mechanism in mitosis raised new questions. Overall, our ﬁndings indicate that HDAC8 de ﬁciency promotesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 1001aneuploidy in human cells, providing some insight into the mechanisms behind HDAC8  related disorders, such as Cornelia de Lange Syndrome 5 (OMIM #300882).

The most severe form is non obstructive azoospermia (NOA), which is, in part, caused by an arrest atmeiosis, but so far only few validated causal genes have been reported. To address this gap, we performed whole exome sequencing in 58 men with unexplained meiotic arrest andidenti ﬁed in three unrelated men the same homozygous fra  meshift variant c.676dup (p.Trp226LeufsTer4) in M1AP , encoding meiosis 1 arresting protein. This variant results in atruncated protein lacking 57% of its full length as shown in vitro by heterologous expression of mutated M1AP. Next, we screened four large cohorts of 1904 infertile men from theInternational Male Infertility Genomics Consortium (IMIGC) and identi ﬁed three additional cases carrying homozygous c.676dup and three carrying combinations of this and otherlikely causal variants in M1AP . Moreover, a homozygous missense variant p.(Pro389Leu) segregated with infertility in ﬁve men from a consanguineous Turkish family (LOD score ,3.28). The common phenotype between all affected men was NOA, but occasionally spermatids and rarely a few spermatozoa in the semen were observed. A similar pheno type was described for mice with disruption of M1ap .C o l   lectively, these ﬁndings demonstrate that mutations in M1AP cause autosomal recessive severe spermatogenic failure andmale infertility. In view of the evidences from several inde  pendent groups and populations, M1AP should be included in the growing list of validated male infertility genes.1002 J. del PicchiaThis work was supported by DFG Clinical Research Unit “Male Germ Cells: from Genes to Function ”(CRU326).

 A set of random forest models for each amino acid substitution to predict pathogenicity of missense var iants in the human genome,P24.18,"J. Takeda , K. Nanatsue, R. Yamagishi, M. Ito, K. Ohno","Division of Neurogenetics, Center for Neurological Dis","eases and Cancer, Nagoya University Graduate School ofMedicine, Nagoya, Japan Introduction: When we predict the pathogenicity of a nonsynonymous single nucleotide variant (nsSNV), a radi  cal change in amino acid (AA) properties is prone to be classi ﬁed as being pathogenic. However, not all such nsSNVs are associated with human diseases. Materials and methods: We generated random forest (RF) models individually for each AA substitution todifferentiate pathogenic nsSNVs in the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and common nsSNVs in dbSNP. We named a set of our models “Individual Meta RF (InMeRF) ”. Results: Ten fold cross validation of InMeRF showed that the area under the curves (AUCs) of receiver operatingcharacteristic (ROC) and precision recall (PR) curves were on average 0.941 and 0.957, respectively. Variants of InMeRF and seven recently reported tools were generatedby the same training dataset, and were compared using the same trifecta of benchmark datasets. Among the eight tools, ROC AUC and PR AUC of InMeRF were ranked ﬁrst on average. Application of InMeRF to nsSNVs in the MUSK gene causing congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) showed the sensitivity and speci ﬁcity of 1.000 (7/7) and 0.857 (12/14), respectively. With regard to the VANGL1 gene causing spina bi ﬁda, the sensitivity and speci ﬁcity showed 0.933 (14/15) and 1.000 (8/8), respectively. Conclusions: We showed that individual modeling each AA substitution made the performance of InMeRF superiorto the previously reported tools. We made the InMeRF web service program, and also made genome wide InMeRF scores available online at https://www.med.nagoya u.ac.jp/ neurogenetics/InMeRF/ .

Methods: We calculated proportions of families with IRD attributable to variants in each gene in the whole cohort, a cohort <18 years, and a “current ”cohort (patients seen in last two years). Additionally, we explored correla  tion between numbers of families and gene transcript length. Results: We identi ﬁed 3195 families with a molecular diagnosis (variants in 135 genes), including 4236 affected individuals. The paediatric cohort comprised 452 individualsfrom 411 families (66 genes). The current cohort comprised 2614 families (131 genes; 3130 affected individuals). The paediatric cohort showed a higher proportion of families withX linked disease. The 20 most frequently implicated genes accounted for 71.8% of all families (Table 1). Spearman coefﬁcients for correlation between numbers of families and transcript length were 0.20 (p ,0.025) overall, and 0.27 (p,0.017),  0.17 (p ,0.46) and 0.71 (p ,0.047) for genes in which variants exclusively cause recessive, dominant or X linked disease respectively. Conclusions: Our ﬁndings quantify the burden of inherited retinal disease attributable to each gene. Over70% of families had pathogenic variants in one of 20 genes. Transcript length (relevant to gene delivery strategies) correlated signi ﬁcantly with numbers of affected families (but not for dominant disease).

Methods: We performed rare variant association analysis of 840 LVNC cases and 125,748 gnomAD population controls, and compared results to similar analyses on dilatedcardiomyopathy (DCM) and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM). Results : We observed substantial overlap in genes and variant classes associated with LVNC and with DCM/ HCM, indicating that LVNC often represent a secondary phenotype occurring in certain patients with DCM or HCM.In contrast, truncating variants (TV) in MYH7 ,ACTN2 and PRDM16 were uniquely associated with LVNC and may reﬂect a distinct LVNC aetiology. MYH7 TV, generally considered non pathogenic for cardiomyopathies, were 20  fold enriched in LVNC cases over controls. Carriers of MYH7 TV in the UK Biobank and healthy volunteers also displayed signi ﬁcantly greater non compaction compared to matched controls, with 50% meeting the diagnostic criteria for LVNC. Large deletions in RYR2 and missense variants in the transmembrane region of HCN4 were also enriched in LVNC, supporting prior reports of association with arrhythmogenic LVNC phenotypes. Conclusions: While LVNC is characterised by substan  tial genetic overlap with DCM and HCM, it can also present with a distinct genetic pro ﬁle involving TV in MYH7 , ACTN2 and PRDM16 and with variants associated with joint LVNC/arrhythmia phenotypes. These results will enhance the application of LVNC genetic testing and helpto distinguish pathological from physiological non  compaction. F. Mazzarotto: None. M.H. Hawley: None. M. Beltrami: None.

Söding1","1Max Planck Institute for Biophysical Chemistry, Gottin  gen, Germany,2George August University, Gottingen, Germany,3Indian Institute of Technology, Kanpur, India Trans acting expression quantitative trait loci (trans eQTLs) are SNPs regulating the expression of distant target genes (>1Mb). Trans eQTLs account for ≥70% heritability of gene expression levels and have great potential to uncoverthe underlying biological mechanisms of complex diseases. However, trans eQTLs are more challenging to identify than locally acting cis eQTLs because of their small effectsizes and the severe multiple testing burden. Furthermore, strong gene expression correlations entails strong correla  tions among SNP gene association P values. Our methodTejaas can discover trans eQTLs by performing L2 reg  ularized ‘reverse ’multiple regression of each SNP on all gene expression levels, aggregating evidence from manysmall trans effects while being unaffected by the strong expression correlations. Tejaas, coupled with a novel k  nearest neighbors confounder correction, discovers 18851unique trans eQTLs across 49 tissues from the GTEx(v8) data. They are enriched to occur in various functional regions of the genome, including DHS sites (1.32xenrichment), open chromatin (1.19x), enhancer (1.31x) and promoter (1.10x) regions. They overlap with known cis  eQTLs (1.24x enrichment) from the GTEx analysis and are1.09x enriched to be located within 100kb of known tran  scription factors. They are also enriched in reporter assay QTL regions of K562 (1.79x) and HepG2 (3.29x) cellsindicating regulatory activity. Many trans eQTLs overlap with disease associated SNPs from GWAS, revealing tis  sue speci ﬁc transcriptional regulation mechanisms that drive disease etiology. For example, trans eQTLs dis  covered in whole blood show enrichment in GWAS for blood traits, while heart and aorta have enrichment in car diometabolic traits.

We have previously shown that CTCL are telomerase positivetumors expressing hTERT in which neither ampli ﬁcation nor promoter hotspot mutations could explain the hTERT re expression. Since the hTERT promoter region is rich in CpG islands, we investigated the contribution of DNA methylation in hTERT expression. We compared hTERT promoter methylation status in CTCL cell lines, Sézarysyndrome (SS) patient derived cells, fresh SS patient cells, and in normal CD4 +and CD34 +cells from healthy donors. Bisul ﬁte Sanger sequencing revealed in tumor cells a common methylation pattern encompassing a hyper  methylated distal region from  650bp to  150bp and a hypomethylated proximal region from  150bp to +150bp (relatively to the transcription start site). Interestingly, the identi ﬁed hypermethylated region in CTCL cells matchesAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 1005with the recently described TERT Hypermethylated Onco  genic Region (THOR) reported to be associated with telo  merase reactivation in many cancers, but so far not studied in lymphomas. Moreover, we assessed the effect on THOR methylation of two histone deacetylase inhibitors (HDACi), romidepsin and vorinostat, both approved for the treatmentof CTCL patients.

To provide novel insight regarding the inter popula  tion diversity of loci associated with complex traits, weintegrated genome wide data from UK Biobank (UKB) and 1,000 Genomes Project (1KG) data representative of the genetic diversity among worldwide populations. Materials and methods: We investigated genome wide data of 4,359 traits of 361,194 UKB participants. Using 1KG data, we explored the allele frequency differences andlinkage disequilibrium (LD) structure across worldwide populations. ENCODE data were used to identify regulatory elements and evaluate the tagging properties of signi ﬁcant variants. Results: No signi ﬁcant difference was observed in allele frequency between UKB and 1KG GBR. Considering otherancestries, we identi ﬁed genome wide signi ﬁcant alleles with frequencies different from what expected by chance: UKB vs. 1KG EUR without GBR (rs74945666; allele ,T [0.908 vs. 0.03], standing height p ,1.48×10  17), UKB vs. 1KG AFR (rs556562; allele ,A [0.942 vs. 0.083], platelet count p ,4.84×10 15), UKB vs. 1KG AMR (rs1812378; allele,T [0.931 vs. 0.089], standing height p ,4.23×10 12), UKB vs. 1KG EAS (rs55881864; allele ,T [0.911 vs. 0.001], monocyte count p ,7.29×10 13), and UKB vs. SAS (rs74945666; allele ,T [0.908 vs. 0.061], standing height p,1.48×10 17). LD structure analysis and computational prediction showed differences in how some of these allelestag functional elements across human populations. Conclusions: We provide novel evidence regarding how the human genetic diversity affects GWAS results wherecertain loci appear to be affected by local adaptation while others may be biased by population strati ﬁcation.

We aim to assess whether1006 J. del Picchiafetuses with 22q11 aberrations have common features enabling us to detect them from ﬁrst trimester combined screening (cFTS) parameters. Methods: From regional databases, all pregnancies in Central Denmark Region were identi ﬁed between January 1st, 2008, and December 31, 2018. Pregnancy data was linked to genetic outcome data and fetuses with 22q11.2 aberrations (hg19 chr22:18.8mio 23.7mio) were identi ﬁed and compared to a reference group. Results: We included 200,991 pregnancies and 12,616 prenatal genetic tests. 42 fetuses were diagnosed with 22q11 aberrations (23 with microdeletions and 19 with  duplica tions). One fetus was also diagnosed with Trisomy 21 and excluded from the analysis. Prenatal detection was based on: An elevated risk estimate (n ,20), malformations (n,14), familial predisposition (n ,5), and test after stillbirth (n ,2). Compared to the reference group, fetuses with 22q11 aberrations had a signi ﬁcantly larger nuchal translucency (NT), and lower PAPP A and β hCG MoM (p<0.05) but with substantial overlap in the distributions (Figure 1). Risk estimates for Trisomy 13, 18, and 21 weresigniﬁcantly higher for 22q11.

We present qualitative pre  and peri lockdown data indicating that now is also the timeto rede ﬁne the contribution of human genetics to a reformed society.Methods: We interviewed 77 traditional and unconven  tional actors in human genetics   of which 28 during lockdown   to unravel, characterise and structure the emerging transition. We applied iterative coding to the interview transcripts. Inductive reasoning (grounded theory) revealed transition points, elements of culture, and emer ging (adjacent) regime changes as major drivers for the (future) human genetics regime. Results: Actors unanimously consider clinical genetics as dominant for the structure, culture and practice in today ’s human genetics. They point out three historic transition points that have shaped this evolution; WWII and its post war anti eugenic sentiments, legitimisation of clinical genetics as a medical specialty, and the introduction of next generation sequencing. The interviews initiate areﬂection on how we do research, who we should care for, and where our money comes from. The latest data   generated during lockdown   particularly indicate a strongurge to anticipate an emerging transition in human genetics, moving beyond The Diseases Formerly Known As Mono  genic (TDFKAM). Conclusions: Based on the results we present scenario prototypes for the role of human genetics in the context of glocal societies, data driven governance, hybrid healthcare, and participatory research T.

 Duplex sequencing uncovers age related increase in the frequency of de novo indels in mouse mitochondrial DNA,P24.32,E. Torres Gonzalez,"1, B. Arbeithuber1, J. Hester1,","M. A. Cremona2, N.

Makova1 1Pennsylvania State University, University Park, PA, United States,2Laval University, Quebec City, QC, Canada,3Sant’Anna School of Advanced Studies, Pisa, Italy To study the evolution of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), an understanding of the frequency and pattern of mutations, and the potential effect of age on these mutations, are essential. This is especially true for de novo mutations which can be dif ﬁcult to detect with conventional sequen  cing techniques due to their high error rates. Duplex sequencing permits the detection of mutations at very lowfrequencies. Our study examined the frequency of mtDNA de novo insertions and deletions (indels) in mouse germ cells (single and pooled oocytes) and somatic tissues (brainand skeletal muscle). Two groups of mice were included: eight 10 month old mothers and 28 1 month old pups. TheAbstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 1007de novo indel frequency in mouse mtDNA was measured to be 1.16e 7 indels per site, 4 fold lower than for de novo substitutions. Most de novo indels were small (1  to 3 bp long), but we also detected events as long as 58 bp. Dele  tions were more common than insertions. We observed a higher indel frequency at homopolymeric tracts ( ≥5b pi n length) than in the rest of the mitochondrial genome. We also found a signi ﬁcantly higher frequency of de novo deletions in skeletal muscle of mothers vs. pups, who wereseparated by only nine months in age from each other. Our results demonstrate the power of duplex sequencing in studying de novo mtDNA mutations, which has allowed us to study their frequency and pattern, as dependent on age, despite such a small difference in age between the studied animals.

The genetics of the MDD T2D comorbidityis still understudied. Hypercortisolism occurs in MDD and a T2D patients ’subgroup. Given their hypercortisolism, MDD patients have inappropriately normal cerebrospinal ﬂuid CRH and plasma ACTH levels, indicating impaired negative feedback. The CRH receptor 1 (CRHR1) may explain the MDD  and T2D hypercortisolism. CRHR1   variants predisposing to impaired CRHR1 dosage/function may lead to hypercortisolism (substrate for serotonin dys  function and MDD), and hyperglycemia, insulin resistance,and increased visceral fat, all T2D traits. CRHR1  variants contribute to MDD. CRHR1 mediates glucose stimulated insulin secretion and, if impaired, may lead to T2D. Wehypothesize that CRHR1  variants may impair the stress and cortisol response, conferring MDD T2D comorbidity risk inMDD drug naïve subjects. Using 212 Italian families with T2D, enriched T2D familial history, and MDD, we ampli  ﬁed and tested 163 CRHR1 SNPs by two point parametric  linkage and linkage disequilibrium (LD) with the models: dominant (D) complete penetrance (1), D incomplete  penetrance (2), recessive (R) 1 and R2 (Pseudomarker). Wedetected linkage and/or LD to MDD for 98 SNPs/D1, 59 SNPs/D2, 95 SNPs/R1, and 14SNPs/R2, and to T2D for 15 SNPs/D1, 19 SNPs/D2, 12 SNPs/R1 and 10 SNPs/R2.Three independent SNPs are comorbid. We found LD  blocks ’implications in the comorbidity. I n silico analysis detected functional gene and tridimensional protein changesin a risk SNP. Ours is the ﬁrst report of CRHR1  linkage/LD in MDD and T2D in T2D families. CRHR1 contribution to MDD appears stronger than and antecedes T2D. Geneti cally impaired stress/cortisol response may lead to comor  bid MDD T2D, likely a molecular clinical entity in a families ’subset. Findings should be replicated in other ethnicities. L.

CHOUERY1 1Saint Joseph University, Beirut, Lebanon,2Lebanese University, Beirut, Lebanon Rett syndrome (RTT) is an X linked dominant neurodeve  lopmental disease characterized by a normal early postnatal development followed by an arrest of growth. There are twomain types of RTT: typical and atypical delineated on the bases of clinical and genetic criteria. In the atypical form, patients present with many of the clinical criteria of RTTbut do not essentially have all of the features of the disorder. Dysmorphic features were observed in few RTT cases. Rett  like syndrome is a recently introduced term, used when apatient presents with an overlap of features between typical and atypical RTT. While MECP2 mutations are linked to the majority of typical RTT cases and some atypical forms,the molecular etiology of many entities remains uneluci  dated. Two affected individuals from a consanguineous family presenting with atypical Rett phenotype were stu died. MECP2 sequencing followed by a strategy combining whole exome sequencing and chromosomal microarray analysis were performed. MECP2 gene sequencing ruled out the implication of this gene in the disease of this family. A strategy combining WES data and CMA allowed the identi ﬁcation of a homozygous splice site mutation (c.323 +1G>A) in PDE2A in both patients. The mutation segre  gates with the disease in the family and is predicted to disrupt the 5 ’ splice site of exon 4 of PDE2A , which was conﬁrmed by RNA studies.

Severalreproductive medicine options are available for adults with 22q11DS who wish to have an unaffected child, chie ﬂy prenatal testing with termination of affected pregnancies orpreimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD). The views of people with 22q11DS on these options have not previously been studied. An inductive qualitative design using semi structured interviews was used, to explore the views of adults with 22q11DS on reproductive medicine options. Three overarching themes emerged: 1. Personal and familyimpact of 22q11DS, 2. Attitudes towards reproductive medicine, and 3. Lack of accessible information. The interviews revealed that 22q11DS has an impact on familylife in ways which could in ﬂuence reproductive decision making. Despite the concerns about the implications of having a child with 22q11DS, there was reluctance to ter minate a 22q11DS pregnancy. PGD was viewed more positively, because it did not involve termination. Currently available information resources on reproductive medicineoptions are not designed for people with intellectual dis  ability, participants identi ﬁed that current information resources were not accessible to them.

A recent study revealed potential medical treatment of hearing loss with anakinra (anti interleukin 1 receptor antagonist) in selected cases. However, for severely aggravated hearingloss not responsive to anakinra, cochlear implantation (CI) would be the last resort for hearing rehabilitation. Outcome of CI is not clearly elucidated yet in this emerging type ofhearing loss related to NLRP3  related autoin ﬂammatory disorders, which has a systemic nature and ubiquitous dis  tribution of resident macrophages involving the spiralganglion neuron and the cochlear nerve. Here, we report the successful outcome of CI in NLRP3  related autoin  ﬂammatory disorder. Materials and methods: Three subjects representing each type of NLRP3  related autoin ﬂammatory disorder: CINCA (chronic infantile, neurological, cutaneous, andarticular) syndrome; MWS (Muckle Wells syndrome); and DFNA34, who underwent CI for auditory rehabilitation, were recruited. Phenotypes as well as genotypes werereviewed in the subjects and audiologic performances before/after CI over time were evaluated. Results: All three subjects showed excellent audiological outcomes with rapid improvement of speech perception test result reaching plateau at 3 months after CI, although distribution of the disease predicted poor outcome based ontheoretical analysis. Conclusions: This is the ﬁrst report to present outcome of CI among subjects with a con ﬁrmed NLRP3 genetic etiology and resultant systemic in ﬂammation, and suggests that CI is a viable treatment option in this disease entity.

However, their application has yet to generate clearly improved outcomes in clinical genomics, and the discovery potential within genomic datasets remains largelyuntapped. Objectives and methods: Our analysis sets out to determine the early stage practical policy actionsfor capitalising on the opportunities AI presents for genomic medicine, minimising harms and expediting its effective delivery into healthcare. Informed by a combina tion of literature review and expert interviews, we examine the state of AI applications for genomic medicine and determine the major challenges to realising its fullpotential. Results: We identify a number of interconnected issues and barriers to progress, including: the quality andaccessibility of AI training data; ethnic bias in genomic datasets; challenges in replicating AI methods and results; fragmentation of skills and infrastructure;data security and privacy concerns; and regulatory uncer tainty around requirements and the status of AI algorithms within clinical genomics. The imperative to address theseissues is heightened given the fast pace of AI activity in genomics. We set out seven urgent policy priorities to meeting these challenges. They include taking action to establish the right skills, digital infrastructure, and cross discipline collabora tions; mitigate against algorithmic bias; prioritise AIdevelopment for the most pressing and clinically relevant problems; support community driven efforts to benchmark and review new algorithms; and establish the clinicalgovernance arrangements for AI applications in clinical genomics.

For adolescents and young adults (15 39 years) with LFS, the inability to predict when cancermay develop or determine prognoses contribute to sub  stantial uncertainty regarding how or whether to pursue family formation. Materials and methods: An interdisciplinary team, including medicine, social work, health communication, psychology, occupational science, and nursing developedand conducted IRB approved, in depth interviews with 38 AYA individuals with LFS. Most participants were female (n,26) and white (n ,31). Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using modi ﬁed grounded theory analysis. Results : Reproductive concerns evolved based on age, cancer diagnostic and treatment history, relationship status, and caregiving responsibilities, and contributed prominently to LFS related distress. Participants balanced developmen tal readiness with pressured timelines to achieve family formation goals and survivorship concerns. Decisions regarding fertility preservation, pre implantation geneticdiagnosis, or adoption were intertwined with identity, divergent spiritual or family beliefs, ﬁnancial resources, and ongoing cancer worry. Limited provider guidance orreferrals for reproductive or mental health consultation caused frustration and dissatisfaction with care. Conclusions : Optimal LFS care for AYAs must include providers trained to support developmental transitions over time, speci ﬁcally regarding family formation contextualized in lifelong cancer risk and survivorship.

More than 300 breast cancer patients with subtype informa  tion are surveyed from the State Hospital in Nicosia between2006 2015 for their demographic, reproductive, genetic, epi  demiological factors. The breast cancer subtypes, Estrogen receptor (ER) +/ , Progesterone receptor (PR) +/ , and human epidermal growth factor 2 (HER2) +/  status, are determined. Single and multiple variable, regularized regres  sions, with predictive factors as independent variables, breastcancer subtypes as dependent variables are conducted. Our cohort differs signi ﬁcantly from larger cohorts (eg Breast Cancer Family Registry), in age, menopause status, age ofmenarche, parity, education, oral contraceptive use, breast feeding but the distribution of breast subtypes is not sig  niﬁcantly different. Subtype distribution in our cohort is also not different from another Turkish cohort. We show that the ER+subtype is positively related to post menopause and negatively associated with hormone therapy; ER +/PR+is positively associated with age and breast feeding, and nega  tively associated with cancer grade and having ﬁrst degree  relative with cancer. HER2 +, which is negatively correlated with ER +and ER+/PR+, is positively related to having ﬁrst  degree relative with cancer, and negatively associated with post menopause. Regressions identify older age to be posi tively correlated to ER +and ER +/PR+, negatively corre  lated to HER2 +. Assuming ER +and ER +/PR+to have better prognostic, post menopause and breast feeding arebeneﬁcial, hormone therapy treatment is detrimental.

It ischaracterized by microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, optic atrophy, cortical dysplasia, mental retarda  tion and hypogonadism. We are reporting three cases withtwo novel splicing mutations and one including micro  duplication of 3q29. Materials: Case 1 is a 8 year old female with neuromotor retardation and spasticity. Parents were consanguineous having 3 affected children. She had microphthalmia, nystagmus, bilateral optic atrophy, operated congenitalcataracts and corpus callosum hypoplasia. Case 2 is a six  month old male with microcephaly, microphthalmia, congenital cataracts, diffuse cerebral atrophy and cryptorch idism. Case 3 is a 21 month old female having neuromotor retardation, hypotonia and epilepsy. She had microphthal  mia, congenital cataracts, cerebral atrophy and corpuscallosum hypoplasia. Methods: RAB3GAP1 gene was analyzed by DNA sequencing. In Case2 mRNA was isolated to generate tocDNA by reverse transcription, and exon 7 9 were analyzed. Results: In case 1 homozygous c.974 2A>G novel splicing mutation was detected in two sisters tested.

 Haplotype landscapes of genes associated with gallstoneformation,P24.46,"O. K. Clay , S. A. Dingsdag, G. A. Quintero",Translational Microbiology and Emerging Diseases,"(MICROS), School of Medicine and Health Sciences,Universidad del Rosario, Bogotá, Colombia Introduction: Gallstone disease or cholelithiasis, resulting from gallstone formation/growth, is a costly and common health problem. Large prevalence differences exist among age groups, geographic locations or ethnic backgroundsincluding between men and women. Thus, in Native Americans from North America, 64.1% of women and 29.5% of men were reported to have gallstones. A geneticcomponent is established, although individual common variants (including a variant of the ABCG8 gene responsible for hepatic cholesterol secretion) appear to have attributablerisks less than 10%. Environment, including diet, and microbiota are also relevant factors. In parallel to pheno  typic studies, corresponding genes and possible effects oftheir common variation have been identi ﬁed (e.g., Weber et al., 2019, Curr. Opin. Gastroenterol . 35:82 87; Bustos et al., 2019, Sci. Rep . 9:772). Materials and methods: Using data from the 1000 Genomes Project spanning populations of all continents, we performed a global analysis of haplotypes and haplotypeblocks containing genes that are associated with increased cholelithiasis risk. Restriction of attention to biallelic SNPs with MAFs above 3 5% facilitates the recognition, analysisand interpretation of haplotype blocks and haplotype classes. Results: Full analysis, across world populations, of the haplotype landscapes in which gallstone loci are embedded allows association ﬁndings to be integrated with results for the genes/proteins, and facilitates interpretation at both SNPand haplotype block resolutions. Conclusions: The analyses presented represent a step toward assembling a concerted, haplotype based view ofhow common variation in human genes may promote or prevent gallstone formation and disease.

In addition to environmental factors, the genetic and epigenetic background of thisphenomenon still remains unknown. We aimed to perform whole exome sequencing along the colorectal adenoma  carcinoma sequence on tissue samples in order to identifycharacteristic germline and somatic variants. Genomic DNA was isolated from 27 adenomas (AD), 52 CRC, 18 healthy patients (N) and from 2 colorectal cancer cell lines. Exomeenrichment was done with the Nextera DNA Exome Kit and sequencing was performed using the NextSeq 500 Instru  ment (Illumina). Germline and somatic variants weredetermined by Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK) and MuTect2 algorithms and were con ﬁrmed by ddPCR and in situ hybridization. Certain CRC associated pathogenicvariants could be detected in a relatively lower [e.g. APC 63.46%)], or with relatively higher frequency compared to the European statistics [e.g. KRAS 40.38%]. Among thegermline variants of the one carbon metabolism, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G and MTRR A66G variants were detected with a relatively higher frequency in the Hungarianpopulation compared to the European average. Alterations in the frequencies of CRC associated somatic variants compared to the European averages might contribute to thehigh CRC incidence observed in the Hungarian population. The germline variants of one carbon metabolism were observed with a relatively higher frequency in our cohorthaving an effect on the DNA methylation regulation system that might be a link between the genetic and epigenetic alterations of the CRC development.

 Longitudinal follow up on individuals with SNORD118 related Leukoencephalopathy with Calci ﬁcation and Cysts illustrates a complex structure function interaction.,P24.48,"A. Ng1, D. Jurado1, Y. Crow2, F. Bolduc1","1University of Alberta, Edmonton, AB, Canada,2MRC","Institute of Genetics and Molecular Medicine, Edinburgh, United Kingdom Mutations in SNORD118 have recently been linked to leukoencephalopathy with calci ﬁcations and cysts. Our longitudinal follow up of 2 individuals with SNORD118pathogenic variants illustrates the complexity of the dis  order, suggesting seizures may be observed at different time point in relation to calci ﬁcation and that clinical presenta  tion may be not be directly correlated with lesion burden on MRI. Indeed, we observed that before MRI lesions became visible, the 2 sibliings had transient clinical seizure whichresolved until recently and now became co localized with MRI changes. In addition, we observed signi ﬁcant intra  familial variability in clinical and MRI changes. Despitehaving the same mutation, the younger sibling had a more severe phenotype. Nonetheless, both siblings had similar EEG ﬁndings of left focal epileptiform abnormalities, with focal clinical seizures. MRI brain showed coarse calci ﬁca  tion in basal ganglia, thalami, white matter and dentate nuclei. Our ﬁndings raise the importance of considering SNORD118 in patients with calci ﬁcation but also with early onset seizure. A. Ng: None. D. Jurado: None. Y. Crow: None. F. Bolduc: None. E",2020
 diagnosis of phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase de ﬁciency by untargeted metabolomic analysis in plasma,P24.49,L. A. Lizcano Gil,"1, M. A. Luna Luna2","1Genetica Humana, Bogotá, Colombia,2Virrey Solis, Bogotá, Colombia Introduction: Phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase de ﬁciency is a rare inborn error of serine metabolism that causes severe neurological abnormalities. Objective: We describe the usefulness of metabolomic analysis patients with the severe form of this condition, whom usually present symptoms during the ﬁrst weeks of life. Methods: We present the case of a ﬁve months Colombian patient, who presented focal symptomaticrefractory epilepsy, hypotonia and bilateral cataracts. Metabolic studies showed normal or non conclusive results. By the time when the metabolomic test was considered, the clinical condition was critical, with severe hypotonia, refractory seizures, and sepsis, and ﬁnally, the patient dies. Analysis by non targeted metabolomics in plasma wasperformed (Metabolon Inc.) This test identi ﬁes molecules between 50 1,500 Daltons (Da). The identi ﬁcation is performed using four different types of high performanceUltra Performance Liquid Chromatography (UPLC) instru  ments paired with Mass Spectrometry (UPLC/MS). The identi ﬁcation of each molecule is con ﬁrmed against a proprietary chemical library consisting of accurate mole  cular weight/mass plus information on any adductation, in source fragmentation, and/or polymerization, retention time/index on the chromatography columns, and mass spectral fragmentation patterns. Results: Metabolomic analysis demonstrated low levels of glycine, lactate, and serine. Phosphoglycerate dehydro  genase de ﬁciency was considered, because all the biomar  kers associated with the metabolomic biochemical signatureof this disorder were outside the expected range. Conclusion: Metabolomic analysis is useful for the diagnosis of Phosphoglycerate Dehydrogenase De ﬁciency, and it is also a valuable tool for the study of patients with suspected metabolic disease.

Hmida2 1Higher Institut of Biotechnology of Monastir, Sousse, Tunisia,2Laboratory of Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Biology of Human Reproduction, Sousse, Tunisia, Sousse, Tunisia,3Service of Dermatology, Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia, Sousse, Tunisia Introduction: H syndrome and Rosai Dorfman disease (RDD) are rare autosomal recessive genodermatoses withmultisystemic manifestations mainly caused by mutations in the SLC29A3 gene which encodes the equilibrative nucleoside transporter hENT3. Materials and methods: Mutations analysis of SLC29A3 gene, was performed, using direct Sanger sequencing, for three unrelated Tunisian family withphenotypic overlap, associating features of RDD and H syndrome. Results: In this study, molecular analysis revealed the presence of a known homozygous missense mutation c.1088G> A: p.Arg363Gln in 6 patients, 5 of whom were related. A heterozygous compound mutation c.300 +1G> A / 1088G> A was also noted in a patient with H syndrome. Five of our patients carrying the same mutation c.1088G>A and belonging to the same family have presented withdistinct clinical manifestations, indeed 4 were carriers of the H syndrome, whereas the 5th patient was diagnosed withRDD. The analysis of the haplotype of patients originated from the center and south of Tunisia is considered to determine if it is a founding haplotype. We carried out a haplotype based analysis by way of genotyping 5 micro  satellite markers ﬂanking the SLC29A3 gene spanning a region of 2 Mb. Microsatellite markers analysis in allaffected sibling indicates that all c.1088G>A mutation carriers harbored the same haplotype, indicating common ancestor. Conclusions: Thisﬁnding could be explained by the high rate of consanguinity in our country. Other factors, genetic, epigenetic and/or environmental may have a role indetermining intra and interfamilial variation in tissue involvement and severity of the disease. H. Chouk: None. M.

 Feasibility of Identifying Familial Hypercholesterolae mia in Malaysian Primary Care,P24.53,H. Abdul Hamid,"1,2, S. Weng1, J. Kai1, A. Ramli2, H. Mohd","Nawawi2, N. Qureshi1 1University of Nottingham, Nottingham, United Kingdom, 2Universiti Teknologi MARA, Selangor, Malaysia Introduction: Familial Hypercholesterolaemia (FH) iden  tiﬁcation has been low worldwide, including in Malaysia. Primary care as initial contact for patients can play a vital role in the identi ﬁcation of individuals with FH. Methods: Patients attending two Primary Care Clinics in Malaysia between July to December 2019 were recruited to the study. Consented patients were required to ﬁll in socio  demographic and family history questionnaires, and patients ’lipid pro ﬁle were obtained from their clinical notes. Patients ’risk of FH were calculated using Simon Broome(SB), Dutch Lipid Clinic Criteria(DLCC) and FAMCAT criteria. Patients with high risk of FH(SB possible and de ﬁnite, DLCC ≥6, and FAMCAT> 1 in 200) were then referred to the Specialist Lipid Clinic for conﬁrmation through genetic testing. Results: 1,191 patients were approached during the study period, out of which 637 (53.48%) patients agreed to participate. Only 619 (51.97%) patients met the eligibility criteria. 65 (5.46%) patients had high risk of FH andrequired referral to Lipid Clinic, however, only 52 (4.37%) patients agreed to be referred. Among the 619 patients recruited, the mean age was 58.09 (SD 12.44), male 310(50.08%), majority is of Malay ethnicity (542, 87.56%), married (548, 88.53%), and had tertiary education (297,Abstracts from the 53rd European Society of Human Genetics (ESHG) Conference: e Posters 101547.98%). The mean lipid parameters for these patients (in mmol/L) were: TC: 5.34 (SD 1.29); LDL C: 3.27 (SD 1.16); triglycerides: 1.66 (SD 1.10); and HDL C: 1.34 (0.34). Conclusions / Implications: Recruitment of patients for FH assessment in Malaysian primary care setting is feasible. Increased training and awareness among the physicians andpublic are vital to increase identi ﬁcation. H. Abdul Hamid: None. S. Weng: None. J. Kai: None. A. Ramli: None. H. Mohd Nawawi: None. N.

 Porokeratosis of Mebelli in the Tunisian population,P24.54,H. El Mabrouk,"1,2, H. Chouk1,2, M. Denguezli3,4, A. Saad3,2,","L. Boussofara3,4,D .H ’mida3,2 1Higher Institute of Biotechnology, Monastir, Tunisia, 2Laboratory of Human Cytogenetics, Molecular Genetics and Reproductive Biology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia,3Faculty of Medicine Ibn El Jazzar, Sousse, Tunisia,4Department of Dermatology and Venerology, Farhat Hached University Hospital, Sousse, Tunisia Introduction: Porokeratosis (PK) is a rare group of acquired or hereditary genodermatoses characterized by an epidermal differentiation disorder and sharing commonhistology. Their etiopathogenesis still not fully understood. To date, several genes such as PMVK, MVK, MVD and FDPS , members of the mevalonate pathway, involved in PK are identi ﬁed. To date, several phenotypic variants of PK are described and rare are the genetic studies carried out in Tunisia. Materials and methods: 5 PK patients belonging to a cohort of 3 families from central Tunisia were sequenced forPMVK andMVK genes by the Sanger technique. Results: Direct sequencing provides genetic evidence of PK. We identi ﬁed a known nonsense variant, c.412C> T at a heterozygous state in exon 4 of the PMVK gene in 4 patients. A second synonym variant, newly described, c.147A>G was identi ﬁed at a heterozygous state in exon 2 of the same gene in 3 patients with porokeratosis of Mibelli(PM) and 3 of their relatives. Discussion: The same mutation noticed among our patients, members of 2 unrelated families from 2 differentTunisian regions, very likely a founder mutation in our population. The newly described synonym variant found exclusively in our PM patients, could be a modi ﬁer gene. Conclusion: We report the ﬁrst genetic study of PK in the Tunisian population. Given the phenotypicheterogeneity of our patients, further molecular investiga  tions are required. H. El Mabrouk: None. H. Chouk: None. M. Denguezli: None. A. Saad: None. L. Boussofara: None. D.

 Smith Lemli Opitz: About 1 case,P24.56,M. Ben Jemaa,"Farhat Hached Hospital, Sousse, TunisiaIntroduction: Smith Lemli Opitz syndrome (SLO) is a rare","autosomal recessive disease caused by mutations in DHCR7gene, resulting in de ﬁciency of 7 dehydrocholesterol reductase (7 DHC) enzyme. Clinical phenotype is hetero  geneous ranging from dysmorphia with behavioral dis orders, to severe malformations. Patients and methods: Our patient is dysmorphic with hands polydactyly, syndactyly of the 2 3e toes bilaterally,feet deformation, bilateral cataract, pyloric stenosis, horse  shoe kidneys, micropenis, hypospadias, microcephaly, growth and psychomotor delay. Cholesterolemia is loweredand 7DHC is raised. Results: The karyotype was normal. Molecular analysis of DHCR7 gene revealed the presence of compoundheterozygous mutation c.278 C> T: p.Thr93Met and c.724 C> T: p.Arg242Cys respectively in exon 4 and 7. The diagnosis of SLO has been con ﬁrmed, the parents have been reconvened for genetic counseling and a proposal for a DPN, and cholesterol and simvastatin supplementation has been suggested to the pediatrician. Discussion: Over 130 different DHCR7 mutations have been identi ﬁed, such as c.964 1G> C responsible for 28% of SLOS, p.T93M (10%), p.W151X (6%), p.R404C (5%)and p.V326L (5%). Sequencing of exons 6 –9 identi ﬁes approximately 85% of DHCR7 mutations. Sterol analysis demonstrating elevated blood or tissue 7DHC levelsconﬁrms SLO diagnosis. Mutation analysis is used to resolve borderline biochemical results. In rare cases, sterol analysis of ﬁbroblasts or lymphoblasts are used. These techniques can be performed on amniotic ﬂ uid for prenatal diagnosis. Conclusion: SLO is a metabolic disease with various phenotypes and weak genotype phenotype correlation. Biochemical and molecular tests are important for the diagnosis, and eventually for the decision of cholesterolsupplementation. M. Ben Jemaa: None.1016 J. del Picchi",2020

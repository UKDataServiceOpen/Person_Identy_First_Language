Genetic epidemiology of lipid associated disorders,PL1.1,F. Kronenberg,"Division of Genetic Epidemiology; Department of Medical Genetics, Molecular  and Clinical Pharmacology; Innsbruck Medical University, Innsbruck, Austria","Lipids are essential for many biological processes such as the building  of membranes, energy substrates, hormones and biological signals.  A well controlled balance of lipid demand and supply under changing  nutritional conditions with storage in various cells in form of lipid drop   lets is therefore important. The Austrian Genome Project âGOLDâ (Ge   nomics of Lipid associated Disorders) aims to discover genes, gene  products and metabolites required for the generation, structural integ   rity and catabolism of lipid droplets. Genetic epidemiology is one of  thirteen research teams of this multidisciplinary consortium and  aims  to identify genetic variation of genes involved in these processes by  two approaches: an hypothesis free approach with genome wide as   sociation studies on quantitative lipids traits and a hypothesis driven  approach with association studies on genes which might be involved  in lipid related phenotypes. The genome wide association studies re   vealed not only yet unknown gene regions influencing lipid levels but  also demonstrated that regions far upstream or downstream of the  gene have a strong impact on lipid levels. In the hypothesis driven ap   proach genetic variation within the newly discovered adipose triglycer   ide lipase (ATGL) which hydrolyzes the first ester bond of triglycerides  was found to have a strong impact on free fatty acid and triglyceride  concentrations. Furthermore, ATGL was found to have a large number  of rare and very rare variants which are subject of investigation. Finally,  adiponutrin, a protein structurally related to ATGL was recently identi   fied to be associated with hepatic fat content and liver enzyme levels.  Using five different studies we clearly demonstrated a strong impact of  variants within adiponutrin with total and non HDL cholesterol levels.",2009
Clinical significance of embryoscopy for early intrauterine  deaths,PL1.2,"T. Philipp1, E.R.Separovic2, S. Sladek3, P. Hofmeister3, A. Reiner 3","1 Department Obstetrics and Gynecology ,Danube Hospital, Vienna, Austria,  2Cytogenetic Laboratory ,Department of Pathology, B.C. Childrenâs Hospital,  Vancouver B.C,  Canada, 3 Department of Pathology ,Cytogenetic Laboratory,  Danube Hospital, Vienna, Austria. ","Introduction: About 20 % of clinically recognized pregnancies are  aborted, the majority of these being early spontaneous pregnancy  losses before twelve gestational weeks. Pathological examination of  first trimester losses is difficult because the embryo/fetus is only rarely  retrieved unaffected by the damage caused by either instrumental  evacuation or spontaneous passage. Transcervical embryoscopy prior  to dilatation and curettage in cases of missed abortion enabled us to  study the external features of the embryo detected in first trimester  missed abortions. The importance of accurate descriptions of the dead  embryo /fetus to  answer specific questions of parents as to the prob   able cause of death and the future risk of recurrence of abortion or an  abnormal infant  is discussed.  Material and Method: Prior instrumental evacuation of the uterus a rig   id hysteroscope (12 degree angle of view with both biopsy and irriga   tion working channel, Circon Ch 25 8 mm) was inserted transcervically  into the uterine cavity. The amnion was opened with microscissors (CH  7 2mm) to obtain a detailed view of the embryo. After evacuation of  the uterus chorionic villi were analysed cytogenetically, using either  standard G banding cytogenetic techniques or comparative genomic  hybridization in combination with flow cytometry. Results: The embryo or early fetus was visualized in over 800 first  trimester missed abortions in this ongoing study and a high rate of  developmental defects could be found. Localized developmental defects , usually represented by the combi   nation of several external developmental defects included neural tube  defects (spina bifida, encephalocele, anencephalus), holoprosenceph   aly ,microcephaly, facial dysplasia, various forms of cleft lip , fused  mouth, limb abnormalities(syndactyly, polydactyly, cleft hand, limb re   duction defect ), gastroschisis and omphalocele, amniotic adhaesions  and duplication anomalies(thoracophagus, acardius anceps). Chromosomal abnormalities included mostly numerical aberrations  such as monosomy X; trisomy of chromosomes ; triploidy; tetraploidy.  Trisomies for all chromosomes with the exception of chromosomes 1 were observed. The highest rate of chromosome abnormality was observed in the cat   egory of embryos showing combined (>2)localized defects, and the  lowest in morphologically normal embryos. Conclusions: The detection of a specific defect in an embryo with  normal chromosomes can be essential. It will confront investigators  with factors usually not considered to be etiologically related to early  pregnancy loss. Our data indicate that malformations of first trimester  intrauterine deaths with normal chromosomes are etiologically hetero   geneous. An accurate description of these specimens is essential as it  can help to identify the specific mechanism leading to the observed de   velopmental defects and might assist investigators in answering spe   cific questions from parents concerning the probable cause of death  and the risk of recurrence in a subsequent pregnancy.",2009

It thereby provides a functional readout of the physiological state  of the human body. Genetic variants that associate with changes in  the homeostasis of key lipids, carbohydrates or amino acids are not  only expected to display much larger effect sizes due to their direct in   volvement in metabolite conversion modification, but should also pro   vide access to the biochemical context of such variations, in particular  when enzyme coding genes are concerned. To test this hypothesis we conducted the first GWAS with metabolo   mics, based on the quantitative measurement of 363 metabolites in  serum of 284 male participants of the KORA study. We found associa   tions of frequent single nucleotide polymorphisms with considerable  differences in the metabolic homeostasis of the human body, explain   ing up to 12% of the observed variance. Using ratios of certain me   tabolite concentrations as a proxy for enzymatic activity, up to 28%  of the variance can be explained (p values 10^ 16 to 10^ 21). We  identified four genetic variants in genes coding for enzymes (FADS1,  LIPC, SCAD, MCAD) where the corresponding metabolic phenotype  (metabotype) matches the biochemical pathways in which these en   zymes are active. Our results suggest that common genetic polymorphisms induce ma   jor differentiations in the metabolic make up of the human population.  These genetically determined metabotypes may subscribe the risk for  a certain medical phenotype, the response to a given drug treatment, or  the reaction to a nutritional intervention or environmental challenge.Plenary Lectures ",2009

Here we validated the array  based sequence capture method for medical sequencing approaches  in heterogeneous genetic disorders. As a model disease we chose  autosomal recessive ataxia and selected 4 patients with known muta   tions in ataxia genes. Genomic sequences of all known disease genes,  including all intronic sequences and 5kb up  and downstream of each  gene, as well as a novel ataxia candidate locus were represented on a  single oligonucleotide array, comprising 2.5 Mb of genomic sequence  in total. After enrichment each of the patients DNA was analyzed by  one quarter of a Roche GS FLX Titanium sequencing run, resulting  in approximately 100 Mb of genomic sequence per patient. This was  sufficient to reach an average per base coverage of 34 fold in all tar   geted regions. Enrichment showed high specificity, as up to 88% of all  reads mapped uniquely to the targeted regions. Very few single reads  mapped to non targeted regions, interestingly mainly to chr.9_random,  which might indicate that this region represents a minor allele in the  existing human genome assembly. Importantly, this approach enabled  an unbiased detection of all known mutations in our 4 patients, dele   tions and point mutations, as well as known SNP variants (hetero  and  homozygous).

In order to identify the genetic basis of PHID  and study its relationship with glucose metabolism we performed ho   mozygosity mapping in five unrelated families followed by candidate  gene sequencing. Five loss of function mutations were identified in the  SLC29A3  gene which encodes a member of a highly conserved pro   tein family that transports nucleosides, nucleobases and nucleoside  analogue drugs, hENT3. We show that PHID is allelic with a related  syndrome without diabetes mellitus, H syndrome. The interaction of  SLC29A3  gene with insulin signaling pathways was then studied using  an established model in Drosophila melanogaster . Ubiquitous knock   down of the Drosophila ortholog of hENT3, dENT1 is lethal under strin   gent conditions whereas milder knockdown induced scutellar bristle  phenotypes similar to those previously reported in knockdown of the  Drosophila  ortholog of the Islet gene. A cellular growth assay showed  a reduction of cell size/number which could be rescued or enhanced  by manipulation of the Drosophila  insulin receptor and its downstream  signaling effectors, dPI3K and dAkt.  In summary, inactivating muta   tions in SLC29A3  cause a syndromic form of insulin dependent dia   betes in humans and in Drosophila  profoundly affect cell size/number  through interactions with the insulin signaling pathway.

The precise function of such non coding sequence elements  (CNEs) is unknown but they have been proposed to regulate time and  tissue specific gene expression over distances as great as 1Mb. Using  high resolution array CGH we detected CNE containing duplications  in patients with congenital malformations. We identified duplications of  1) a regulatory sequence 1Mb upstream of SHH  (ZRS) in triphalangeal  thumb polysyndactyly syndrome and in 2) Laurin Sandrow syndrome,  3) a 5kb regulatory element 110kb downstream of BMP2  in brachydac   tyly type A2, 4) 2Mb containing several CNEs upstream of SOX9  in  Cooks syndrome, and 5) 1.7Mb 5â of MSX2  in a condition resembling  cleidocranial dysplasia. In all cases the duplications are arranged in  tandem. We show that the CNE contained in the duplication at the  BMP2  locus is an enhancer regulating BMP2  expression exclusively  in the limbs, thus, functioning as cis regulatory element. We postulate  that duplications of cis regulatory elements cause selective deregula   tion of the target gene resulting in disturbance of dosage dependent  signalling pathways only in those areas and/or time points that cor   respond to the CNEâs regulatory potential. Our data provide the mo   lecular cause for so far genetically unresolved conditions (Laurin San   drow, Cooks syndrome) and show genetic heterogeneity for others.  Furthermore, duplications of CNEs can be considered a novel genetic  mechanism for developmental defects. Given the importance of tem   poral spatial gene regulation during embryonic development it is to be  expected that a large number of developmental defects are caused by  mutations affecting such distant enhancers/repressors.",2009
mitosis updated   PicH and the anaphase threads,PL2.5,"T. Schwarzbraun1, L. Wang2, P. Ulz1, E. A. Nigg2, M. R. Speicher1","1Institute of Human Genetics, Graz, Austria, 2Max Planck Institute of Biochem   istry, Martinsried, Germany","The process of mitosis has been illustrated in more or less unchanged  ways in textbooks for decades and still resembles the original observa   tions made by Flemming back in 1882. However, PICH (Plk1 interact   ing checkpoint helicase) was recently identified as an essential com   ponent of the spindle assembly checkpoint and shown to localize to  kinetochores, inner centromeres, and most interestingly, it decorates  thin threads connecting separating sister chromatids even until late  anaphase. PICH positive threads evolve from inner centromeres as  they stretch in response to tension reaching up to 15 Âµm in length. With the discovery of DNA threads connecting sister chromatids until  late anaphase a new level of cell cycle regulation seems likely. The  properties of the PICH protein lead to the hypothesis that it associ   ates with catenated centromeric DNA, where it may act as a tension  sensor to monitor the bipolar attachment of sister kinetochores and  thus ensuring accurate chromosome segregation. Indeed, we could  recently demonstrate that these threads are in fact mainly constituted  of stretched alphoid centromeric DNA and that topoisomerase activ   ity is required during anaphase for the resolution of PICH positive  threads. Additionally, knock down as well as over expression of the  PICH protein result in severe chromosomal mis segregation. These  data indicate that the complete separation of sister chromatids occurs  later than previously assumed as well as that PICH and the alphoid  centromeric DNA repeats are part of an additional mechanism to safe   guard the genomic integrity.Plenary Lectures ",2009

Genetics and sociobiology of microbes,PL3.2,K. Foster,"Center for Systems Biology, Harvard University, Cambridge, MA, United States","âIf it could be proved that any part of the structure of any one species  had been formed for the exclusive good of another species, it would  annihilate my theory, for such could not have been produced through  natural selection.â Darwin (1859) Since Darwin, evolutionary biologists have been troubled by coopera   tive behavior. Why do organisms frequently evolve social behaviors  that promote others at an apparent cost to their own reproduction? For example, honeybee workers labor their whole life without repro   ducing, birds make alarm calls, and humans often help one another.  This fundamental question has received considerable attention over  the last 50 years with the development of the field of sociobiology.  This has resulted in a solid base of theory, centered on principles like  inclusive fitness, and a myriad of empirical tests. It is now widely ac   cepted that cooperative behaviors evolve because they directly help  the actor alongside any recipients, or they help individuals who share  more alleles with the actor than predicted by chance (genetic related   ness), or both. One major group that remains relatively unexplored,  however, is the microbes, whose full spectrum of sociality only recently  came to light. My group studies how social environment and related   ness affects microbial behavior in a number of model systems, includ   ing biofilm forming bacteria, slime molds and budding yeast. We find  that microbes are extremely sensitive to social context   both in real  time and over evolutionary time   and use them to better understand  the genetic and genomics of social traits; a pursuit that is difficult in the  more classical model organisms for social behavior.",2009
Language as Kluge,PL3.3,G. Marcus,"New York University, NY, United States","In fields ranging from reasoning to linguistics, the idea of humans as  perfect, rational, optimal creatures is making a comeback â but should  it be? Hamletâs musings that the mind was ânoble in reason ...infinite  in facultyâ have their counterparts in recent scholarly claims that the  mind consists of an âaccumulation of superlatively well  engineered  designsâ shaped by the process of natural selection (Tooby and Cos   mides, 1995), and the 2006 suggestions of Bayesian cognitive scien   tists Chater, Tenenbaum and Yuille that âit seems increasingly plau   sible that human cognition may be explicable in rational probabilistic  terms and that, in core domains, human cognition approaches an opti   mal level of performanceâ, as well as in Chomskyâs recent suggestions  that language is close âto what some super engineer would construct,  given the conditions that the language faculty must satisfyâ. In this talk, I will I argue that this resurgent enthusiasm for rational   ity (in cognition) and optimality (in language) is misplaced, and that  the assumption that evolution tends creatures towardsâsuperlative ad   aptationâ ought to be considerably tempered by recognition of what  Stephen Jay Gould called âremnants of historyâ, or what I call evolu   tionary inertia. The thrust of my argument is that the mind in general,  and language in particular, might be better seen as what engineers call  a kluge: clumsy and inelegant, yet remarkably effective.Concurrent Symposia ",2009

Non coding antisense RNAs epigenetically regulate  transcription in human cells,S02.1,K. V. Morris,"Department of Molecular and Experimental Medicine, The Scripps Research  Institute, La Jolla, CA, United States","Small RNA targeting of promoters in human cells has been shown to  modulate transcriptional gene silencing. While the mechanism involved  in transcriptional gene silencing has been shown to require Argonaute  1 (Ago 1), Histone Deactylase 1 (HDAC 1), and DNA methyltransfer   ase 3a (DNMT3a), the endogenous RNA trigger directing these pro   teins to targeted promoters in human cells had remained unknown. We  present evidence here suggesting that non coding antisense RNAs  function in human cells as effector molecules driving transcriptional  gene silencing. The antisense non coding RNAs guide epigenetic re   modeling complexes to target promoters in an Ago 1 mediated man   ner. When these regulatory antisense non coding RNAs are degraded  using RNA interference there is a concomitant activation of the sense/ mRNA promoter which is under the regulatory control of the particular  antisense RNA. The data presented here suggests that in human cells,  bidirectional transcription is an endogenous gene regulatory mecha   nism whereby antisense non coding RNAs direct epigenetic regulatory  complexes to the corresponding sense promoters, resulting in RNA  directed epigenetic gene regulation. These observations support the  notion that epigenetic silencing of tumor suppressor genes may be the  result of an imbalance in bidirectional transcription levels. This imbal   ance allows the unchecked antisense RNA to direct silent state epi   genetic marks to the sense promoter, resulting in stable transcriptional  gene silencing.",2009

After the detection of the causal  mutation in the proband predictive DNA testing of relatives is possible  (cascade screening). Prevention of sudden cardiac death in patients  with a high risk by means of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator  is effective. Methods and results: In 97 hypertrophic cardiomyopathy families with a  sarcomere gene mutation we retrospectively determined uptake of ge   netic counselling and predictive DNA testing in relatives within one year  after the detection of the causal mutation in the proband. Uptake of ge   netic counselling was 39% and did not differ significantly by probandâs  or relativeâs gender, nor by young age of the relative (<18 years) or a  family history positive for sudden cardiac death. In second degree rela   tives, eligible for predictive DNA testing when the first degree relative  had died, uptake was 27.5% (p,0.047). Uptake of predictive DNA test   ing was 39%; conditional uptake of predictive DNA testing was 99%. Conclusions: Uptake of genetic counselling in hypertrophic cardiomy   opathy is comparable to uptake in oncogenetics. Conditional uptake  of predictive DNA testing, however, is much higher. Because sudden  cardiac death can be prevented uptake of genetic counselling in hyper   trophic cardiomyopathy should be as high as possible.

Mutations in 11 different genes encoding for contractile proteins have  been identified and can be detected in 30 to 60% of the patients with  HCM. Fortunately 3 genes (MYBC 3, MYH 7 and TNNT 2) account for  more than 60% of the known mutations. In patients with familial DCM mutations are equally dispersed over 20  genes. This heterogeneity seriously hampers the feasibility of genetic  screening. The only exception are patients with familial DCM with con   duction system disease, in whom defects in the gene encoding for  lamin A/C are found in 30 to 50%. The clinical relevance of genetic testing in familial CMs is currently  confined to 3 areas. 1) Lifestyle advice (sports, profession, â¦) in as   ymptomatic children and adolescents, 2) guiding prophylactic implan   tation of an implantable cardioverter defibrillator in patients with a fami   ly history of premature sudden death and 3) pre implantation diagnosis  in families with highly symptomatic forms of CM. A promising area, almost unexplored today, is that of prophylactic  âheart failureâ therapy in asymptomatic carriers of DCM. So far we have no human studies exploring how to influence the natu   ral history of HCM, but it is clear that the relevance of early genetic  diagnosis will explode once we understand how to modify disease  progression. As genetic testing can transform a healthy person into a patient, the  role of dedicated clinical geneticists and psychologists in the treatment  of these people cannot be overestimated.s03.4 Peer support: A critical Resource A. Cox ;   CRY, Unit 7 Epsom Downs Metro Centre, Waterfield, Tadworth, Surrey, United  Kingdom. In the UK there has been a gap between what the National Health  Service has provided and what individuals affected by young sudden  cardiac death and inherited cardiovascular diseases require. Founded  in 1995, the charity Cardiac Risk in the Young (CRY) has developed  two unique services to address this disparity; the Bereavement Sup   port Network and the Surgery Supporters Network. Both aim to be fast,  expert and individual. CRYâs Bereavement Support Network is designed to facilitate âtalking  outâ personal grief. It is based around a network of bereavement sup   porters who have each been affected by a young sudden cardiac death  and subsequently completed a 2 year BAC accredited skills and theory  course. Bereaved families can also attend an Annual Family Medical  Conference in London and a series of Regional Bereavement Sup   port Days around the UK. Furthermore, to facilitate the understanding  of the potential genetic risks to other family members, CRY provides  specialist cardiac information and funds expert cardiac pathology   en   suring uncertainty and time delays are minimised. The CRY Surgery Supporters Network is designed for young people  (aged 35 and under) who have had, or are about to confront, poten   tially life saving surgery and want to talk to others who have been  through a similar experience. These experiences include the fitting of  pacemakers and implantable defibrillators, and ablation surgery. It was  developed as a support system that increases effective coping and  decreases social isolation for young implant recipients, whilst also of   fering support to others in a similar situation. Group meetings include;  âQuestion and Answerâ sessions with a specialist cardiologist; group  counselling; and opportunities to socialise. It is important that the implementation of counselling for the specific  psychological needs of those affected by inherited cardiovascular con   ditions are carefully considered. Counselling is only a luxury for those  that do not need it.",2009
targeted treatment of tuberous sclerosis using mt OR inhibitors,S04.1,J. R. Sampson,"Institute of Medical Genetics, School of Medicine, Cardiff University, Cardiff,  United Kingdom","Inactivating mutations of TSC1  or TSC2  cause the inherited disorder  tuberous sclerosis. They lead to loss of GAP activity of the TSC1/2  complex for the small GTPase Rheb and thereby to inappropriate ac   tivity of mTOR signalling that appears critical to the pathogenesis of  many disease manifestations. mTOR inhibitors represent clear can   didate therapies targeted to the molecular pathology of tuberous scle   rosis and they have been used in a number of pre clinical an early  phase clinical trials. These have demonstrated reduction in size of  TSC associated renal tumours (angiomyolipomas) and improvement  in lung function in patients with lung manifestations (lymphangioleio   myomatosis, LAM). A case series of TSC associated brain tumours  (sub ependymal giant cell astrocytomas) were also reported to shrink  during rapamycin therapy. An important though variable feature of the  tuberous sclerosis phenotype is learning difficulty. Recent studies in  mouse models carrying heterozygous TSC2  mutations demonstrated  improvement in learning deficits following treatment with the mTOR  inhibitor rapamycin. These promising pre clinical and early phase hu   man trials have led to development of larger scale randomised control  trials of mTOR inhibitors for the treatment of the renal, lung, and brain  manifestations of TSC associated disease.",2009
Genetic aetiology defines optimal treatment in monogenic  diabetes,S04.2,S. Ellard,"Institute of Biomedical and Clinical Science, Peninsula Medical School, Exeter,  United Kingdom","In the pre genetics era there were two types of diabetes; type 1 which  required insulin and type 2, usually treated with oral hypoglycaemic  agents. Mutations in 8 genes are now known to cause isolated dia   betes and there are at least 15 syndromes which include diabetes. Concurrent Symposia  Monogenic diabetes accounts for 1 2% of diabetes with an estimated  prevalence of up to 1/1000 in Europe. For some patients, defining the  genetic aetiology of their diabetes may lead to improved treatment. Mild fasting hyperglycaemia resulting from heterozygous inactivating  GCK  mutations does not usually require pharmacological treatment  and children misdiagnosed as having type 1 diabetes have been able  to stop insulin injections without a deterioration in glycaemic control.  Those patients with HNF1A or HNF4A mutations are sensitive to low  dose oral sulphonylureas but may later progress to insulin. Heterozygous activating mutations in the KCNJ11 and ABCC8  genes  encoding the Kir6.2 and SUR1 subunits of the beta cell ATP sensitive  potassium (KATP) channel account for around 50% of patients with per   manent neonatal diabetes (PNDM) diagnosed in the first 6 months of  life. This discovery of the underlying genetic aetiology has dramatically  improved treatment since most patients achieve improved glycaemic  control upon transfer from insulin to high dose oral sulphonylureas. The challenge now is to educate health care professionals to recog   nise monogenic subtypes of diabetes in order to maximise the benefits  of a pharmacogenetic approach to treating diabetes.",2009

Array cGH in clinical practice: Fascination and frustration.,S05.2,K. Devriendt,"Center for Human Genetics, University of Leuven, Leuven, Belgium","Array CGH gradually is being integrated into the routine clinical prac   tice to detect submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances. The first ex   perience is one of fascination. In about 15% of cases with a âchro   mosomalâ phenotype, an etiological diagnosis can now be reached.  Mosaicism can be detected more easily, and chromosomal aberrations  are characterized precisely. Improved genotype phenotype correla   tions not only facilitates counselling and guidance, but also has lead to  the elucidation of the genetic cause of several clinical disorder such as  CHARGE and Pitt Hopkins syndromes. More surprisingly, the field of  reverse phenotyping has emerged, where phenotyping of individuals  sharing a similar imbalance has resulted in the delineation of novel  recognisable entities. Now that the major technical issues of array CGH have been solved,  its application in clinical practice faces several challenges. In an at   tempt to decipher the large number of remaining unexplained cases,  higher resolution arrays were applied, but met with limited success.  It appears that many smaller imbalances cause a monogenic disor   der, which had not been recognized clinically. The high number of rare  variants poses major difficulties in the interpretation of found imbal   ances. Traditional cytogenetic criteria of pathogenicity such as size or  de novo  occurrence do not longer apply. Also, the distinction between  pathogenic and polymorphic becomes blurred even further since many  CNVâs act as susceptibility loci and in addition, the associated pheno   types vary in an unexplained way. Also, as a result of genome wide  screening, the clinician will be confronted with unexpected results that  may have important implications for the person and his family. These  issues will have to be considered before one can apply array CGH in  prenatal diagnosis.s05.3mitotic recombination in leukaemia B. D. Young , M. Raghavan, M. Gupta;   Cancer Research UK , Barts and Royal London School of Medicine, Medical  Oncology Unit, Cancer Genomics Group, London, United Kingdom. The introduction of array based analysis of single nucleotide polymor   phisms (SNPs) allows the rapid determination of many thousands of  allelotypes in a human DNA sample. This technology is particularly  suited to the study of changes that take place during the development  of cancer.  For example, regions of tumour associated loss of hetero   zygosity (LOH) can be detected as by comparison with germline DNA  from the same individual. Since this approach also yields copy number  information it is possible to determine the probable source of LOH. The application of SNP genotype arrays to acute myeloid leukaemia  (AML) unexpectedly uncovered large regions of acquired homozygos   ity which were not associated with copy number gain or loss and which  cannot be detected by conventional cytogenetics. This phenomenon,  which often continues to the telomere, has been termed acquired uni   parental disomy (aUPD) and is the consequence of a mitotic recom   bination event occurring during the evolution of the cancer. In a large  study we have demonstrated that there is a distinct pattern of aUPD  in approximately 17% of AML with certain regions being preferentially  affected. Furthermore we have shown that certain gene mutations are  being rendered homozygous by the mitotic recombination event, in   cluding FLT3, WT1and CEBPA. These data strongly suggest that the  mutation precedes mitotic recombination [1]. A relatively large proportion of AML patients will relapse with resist   ant disease. Recently we have applied SNP array analysis to serial  leukaemia samples including both presentation and relapse material  in order to determine whether mitotic recombination could have a role  in disease evolution. It was observed that up to 40% of AML at relapse  should evidence of aUPD frequently affecting chromosome 13q and  involving mutations to FLT3. This suggests that mitotic recombination  events could have an important role in the evolution of AML [2] References 1.

Hirschhorn1,2, for the GIANT Consortium","1Department of Genetics, Childrenâs Hospital/Harvard Medical School, Boston,  MA, United States, 2Broad Institute, Cambridge, MA, United States","Genome wide association (GWA) studies have been used to map loci  at which common genetic variants are associated with polygenic traits  and diseases. However, the modest effects of these common variants  has meant that mapping and validating associated loci requires large  numbers of samples and collaborations. We have taken a collabora   tive approach and are using GWA studies representing over 100,000  individuals to identify common variants associated with anthropometric  traits, including height and measures of obesity. Earlier iterations of  these efforts, involving studies of up to 30,000 samples, successfully  identified 10 loci for body mass index and over 40 loci for height. These  results have implicated both expected and novel biological pathways,  and have highlighted the role of central nervous system in regulating  body weight as well as several distinct pathways in the regulation of Concurrent Symposia  height. These studies have moved us closer to our primary goal, which  is to shed light on the underlying biology of the regulation of height and  weight in human populations. Thus far, the associated variants we have identified explain only a  small fraction of the expected contribution of genetic factors to popula   tion variation. Clearly, many of the causal loci and even causal vari   ants at known loci remain to be discovered. Thus, further efforts and  analyses will likely uncover additional genetic determinants, although  the relative contributions to trait variation of common and rare variants,  and discovered vs undiscovered loci, remains to be seen. These ef   forts will include expansion of GWA studies both in sample size and  in the number and types of variants that can be assayed, studies of  individuals samples from the extremes of trait distributions, compre   hensive and deep sequencing of known loci, more complex analyses,  and, eventually, comprehensive sequencing of the genome in large  numbers of individuals.",2009

Ages of onset  vary from birth to old age and the symptoms range from mild to se  verely debilitating and life threatening. Although primarily neuromuscu   lar, the precise array of symptoms observed in any one patient varies  dramatically. Myotonic dystrophy type 1 is caused by the expansion  of an unstable CTG repeat with patients typically inheriting from 50 to  several thousand copies of the repeat. In general, longer alleles are  associated with more severe symptoms and an earlier age of onset.  However, explanations for the additional symptomatic variability not  accounted for by repeat length have remained enigmatic. In order to  try and understand symptomatic variation in myotonic dystrophy we  have been analysing an unusual family in which the typical myotonic  dystrophy symptoms are accompanied by an intermediate Charcot  Marie Tooth peripheral neuropathy, acute encephalopathic attacks  and deafness. We have determined that in addition to the typical CTG  repeat expansion, this family has a complex repeat expansion at the  3â end of the array comprised of CGG, CCG and CTG repeats These  variant repeats presumably mediate the additional symptoms by an  RNA gain of function analogous to that observed in fragile X associ   ated tremor ataxia syndrome. We have also determined that similar  such variant repeats are observed in other myotonic dystrophy families  and appear to be associated with decreased genetic instability and  less severe symptoms. Notably, variant repeats are clustered at the 3â  end of the array and have not been detected at the 5â end of the array.  More bizarrely, variant repeats in some families appear to have arisen  de novo . The occurrence of such de novo  base substitutions reveals  a mutation frequency several orders of magnitude greater than previ   ously observed at any human loci and further extends our knowledge  of the unusual sequence properties of expanded repeats.",2009

Li Fraumeni syndrome: the role of DNA copy number variation  in cancer susceptibility,S08.2,D. Malkin,"Genetics & Genomic Biology Program, Research Institute; Division of Hematol   ogy/Oncology , The Hospital for Sick Children, University of Toronto, Toronto,  ON, Canada","DNA copy number variations (CNVs) are a significant form of inter  individual genetic variation. The size and plasticity of CNV regions  makes them particularly intriguing to the study of cancer. Li Fraumeni  syndrome (LFS) is an autosomal dominant disorder, frequently asso   ciated with germline mutations of the TP53 tumor suppressor gene.  LFS is clinically and genetically heterogeneous and TP53  mutational  status alone does not explain the cancer phenotype in these families.  The genetic events that determine specific cancers in each family are  unknown. Further, many LFS families do not have detectable TP53   missense mutations. We conducted a genome wide profile of CNVs in  DNA of peripheral blood lymphocytes of LFS families (Shlien A, et al  2008). Using the Affymetrix 500K array, we previously examined ge   nomic DNA from a large healthy population (n,770) and an LFS cohort  (n,53) and showed that the number of CNVs per genome is largely Concurrent Symposia  invariable in the healthy populations, but increased in these cancer  prone individuals (p,0.01). Expanding on the initial analysis and using  multiple algorithms and a replication cohort of LFS DNA (n,22) hybrid   ized on Affymetrix 6.0GW high resolution arrays we now demonstrate  that: 1) CNV deletions are more frequent than duplications in mutation  carriers (p,3.28 x 105); 2) the overall number of CNVs exceeds 300  in carriers (154 in controls); and 3) the difference in CNVs persists in  these individualsâ tumors. We have also recently uncovered rare CNV  deletions at 17p13.1 in LFS patients (n,4) and in patients with multiple  congenital abnormalities but no cancer phenotype (n,4). This led us  to posit that structural features of specific CNVs in the region may  play a role in distinguishing a cancer from a non cancer phenotype.  The CNVs at 17p13.1 all include TP53  but range in size from 4.236  to 2Mbp. The large deletions, causing happloinsufficiency of nearly 40  genes, are associated with a broad phenotype that includes multiple  congenital abnormalities, while smaller focal TP53  deletions (from ex   ons 2 to 11) are associated with cancer susceptibility. Using qPCR and  long range PCR, we continue to fine map these deletions with the goal  of finding the sequence features and mechanisms which cause these  large genomic events (e.g. LCR mediated NAHR). Our results suggest  an important role of DNA structural variation in cancer susceptibility,  and these models will be discussed during this presentation.",2009

I will demonstrate how âMende   lian copy number variantsâ   apparently benign CNVs that can cause a  disease phenotype dependent on copy number state, sex and genetic  or environmental background   require large scale collaborative efforts  to collect sufficient data and the development of expert systems to  provide accurate diagnosis.

I will illustrate how the technol   ogy helps prenatal diagnosis, but also demonstrate the potential risks  of using this technology. Finally, we developed a novel tool to genome  wide screen CNV and SNP genotype single cells.

Prenatal diagnosis and fetal treatment using fetal RNA in  maternal body fluids,S09.2,D. Bianchi,"Tufts Medical Center, Genetics, Boston, MA, United States","Cell free fetal (cff) DNA in maternal plasma provides a noninvasive  source of fetal genetic material. Cff DNA is elevated in preeclampsia,  placental abnormalities, and fetal aneuploidy. Qualitative analysis of  cff DNA in maternal plasma is already in clinical use worldwide for  noninvasive prenatal diagnosis of Rhesus D and fetal gender. Excit  ing work has recently been published that suggests that cff DNA and  RNA in maternal plasma can facilitate noninvasive prenatal diagnosis  of trisomies 18 and 21, using ratios of single nucleotide polymorphisms  (SNPs) or using a shotgun sequencing approach. In our laboratory  we are performing comparison gene expression microarray analyses  between the pregnant woman and her newborn to detect fetal gene  sequences that are indicative of normal and abnormal fetal develop   ment in the second and third trimesters (Maron et al.

Amniotic fluid supernatant is also a rich source  of cell free fetal DNA and RNA; it can provide novel information about  gene expression and functional development in the living human fetus.  We have generated preliminary data on fetal gene expression from  cell free mRNA in amniotic fluid.

Functional genomic analysis of second  trimester fetuses with trisomy 21 suggests that oxidative stress, ion  transport, and G protein signaling are important.

the challenge of prenatal and preimplantation genetic diagnosis  of mitochondrial disorders,S09.3,"C. de Die Smulders , H. Smeets","University Hospital Maastricht, Department of Clinical Genetics, Maastricht, The  Netherlands","Mitochondrial diseases are caused by defects in the oxidative phos   phorylation. They can be caused by mutations in nuclear or mito   chondrial DNA (mtDNA) encoded genes. Mutation analysis of nuclear  genes in prenatal (PND) or preimplantation genetic diagnosis (PGD) is  routine. Pitfalls do occur in biochemical analysis in PND. Mutations in  the mtDNA lead to a wide spectrum of diseases with very variable clini   cal expression. They are transmitted exclusively maternally and are  usually heteroplasmic. Severity of symptoms is partially determined by  mutation load. PND or PGD for mtDNA mutations is complex and ex   perience is limited. Prerequisites for reliable PND of mtDNA mutations  have been formulated by Poulton and Turnbull (2000) and include: 1.  a close correlation between mutation load and disease manifestation  2. no significant time dependent changes in mutation load 3. a uniform  distribution of mutation load in different tissues. These criteria also ap   ply for PGD. For genetic counseling one may subdivide the mitochondrial muta   tions in 5 categories: 1 de novo  mutations. Recurrence risk is low and  PND or PGD can be offered for reassurance. 2. Inherited stable muta   tions, such as the m.8993T>G/C mutations (leading to NARP/Leigh  syndrome). Outcome is favourable for this mutation when the mutation  load is < 60%, while mutation load >90% is associated with a bad  prognosis. Prediction of severity in the grey zone (60 90%) is difficult,  but a tendency for percentages at the extremes has been observed  in oocytes, which would favour conclusive results. PND was offered  more than 10 times. PGD for the m.8993T>G mutation has been re   ported once. 3. Inherited unstable mutations. The classical example  is the m.3243A>G (MELAS) mutation. There is a certain correlation  between mutation load and clinical severity but individual exceptions  exist. It is impossible to define a completely safe lower threshold. A  limited number of PNDs have been carried out. Mutant load was found  to be fairly stable in CVS and amniotic cells. Oocytes and foetuses of  carrier women can be without mutant load, the number dependent on  the mutation load of the carrier. PGD for the 3243A>G mutation was  carried out by our group (unpublished results). Mutation load showed  a broad range between embryos, but was equal in the blastocysts of  one embryo. Some embryos had a fairly low mutation load. 4. Rare  mutations with unknown outcome. Insufficient information is available  for reliable predictions. 5. Homoplastic mutations. PND or PGD is use   less as 100% of the mtDNA is mutated. In conclusion, assessment of mtDNA mutation load in chorionic villi,  amniotic cells or blastocysts is quite accurate nowadays and prelimi  Concurrent Symposia 0 nary data show that the mutation percentage is stable at different time  points in pregnancy or in different cells of one embryo.

Pathways to Parkinsonism,S10.2,M. R. Cookson,"Laboratory of Neurogenetics, NIA, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, MD,  United States","Parkinson disease (PD) was regarded as the archetypal non genetic  disease for many years but discoveries over the past decade have  shown that this is not true. There are two genes that cause autosomal  dominant PD, LRRK2 (leucine rich repeat kinase 2) and SNCA. The  latter gene is interesting because the protein product, Î± synuclein, is  deposited in Lewy bodies, the characteristic pathological inclusion of  PD and a related disease, dementia with Lewy bodies. LRRK2 cases  also usually have Lewy bodies, suggesting that these two genes might  be related to one another. The mechanistic basis of this relationship  is currently unclear, but both LRRK2 and Î± synuclein are reported to  have roles in neuronal function. LRRK2 has attracted a great deal of  interest as a possible drug target as it has been shown that the kinase  activity is required for pathogenic gain of function effects, at least in cell  culture models. LRRK2 is also a relatively common cause of inherited  disease in several populations, although the decreased penetrance of  many mutations has probably contributed to an underestimation of the  genetic contribution to PD in prior studies. Three genes have been reported to cause autosomal recessive par   kinsonism, a milder phenotype with earlier onset than typical PD where  Lewy bodies are not always present. Recent data suggests that the  oxidative stress sensor DJ 1, the mitochondrial kinase PINK1 and the  E3 protein ubiquitin ligase parkin all play roles in cellular responses  to oxidative stress and possibly by influencing mitochondrial function.  This indicates that recessive parkinsonism genes are probably found  in a common pathway, although whether this is related to the domi   nant PD pathway is uncertain. There are a number of additional genes  (PANK2, PLA2G6, ATP13A2, FBX07, TAF1, and PRKRA) that cause  parkinsonism/dystonia with or without Lewy bodies, whose relation   ship to âPDâ is also unclear. As well as mendelian genes, several robust associations between PD  and common genetic variants have been reported. These are currently  being supplemented by data from genome wide association studies.  Although the effect size of most common polymorphisms are quite  modest, with odds ratios in the range of 1.2 1.4, they suggest that  even sporadic PD has a partial genetic basis. In this talk, the identity  of the most robust associations will be discussed as they indicate that  the genetic determinants for PD are more likely related to dominant PD  genes, with some interesting additions that are more often thought of  as being associated with other neurodegenerative disorders. Overall,  this data is painting a complex picture of genetic contributions to an ap   parently simple non genetic disease that leads to a rethinking of views  about etiology and pathology in PD.",2009
Amyotrophic Lateral sclerosis,S10.3,L. H. van den Berg,"University Medical Center, Utrecht, The Netherlands","Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is a neurodegenerative disorder  characterized by progressive wasting and weakness of limb, bulbar,  and respiratory muscles. The disease is caused by loss of motor neu   rons in the spinal cord, brainstem, and motor cortex and can occur at  any time in adulthood, with a median age of onset in the mid fifties. The  incidence (around 1 2 per 100,000 person years) and prevalence (4 13 per 100,000) of ALS are remarkably similar across European and  North American populations. About half of patients die within 3 years of  symptom onset, usually because of respiratory failure. The only thera   peutic strategy to slow the disease is currently riluzole, which delays  progression by 3 6 months. In epidemiological studies 1 13% of ALS patients are claimed to have  a familial disposition for the syndrome (FALS), most commonly with a  Mendelian dominant mode of inheritance. Linkage analysis in 18 fa   milial ALS pedigrees associated the gene encoding Cu/Zn superoxide  dismutase ( SOD1 ) on chromosome 21 to the syndrome. Mutational  analysis revealed point mutations in the SOD1  gene to co segregate  with the disease in these pedigrees. Subsequent studies have identi   fied over 140 different SOD1 mutations in ALS patients. Mutations in  SOD1 can be identified in approximately 12   23 % of the patients  diagnosed with FALS and in 1   4 % of patients diagnosed with SALS  patients. Other genes linked to 1 3% of familial ALS are ANG, ALS2,  VAPB, TARDBP and FUS. In the remaining 90 % of ALS patients where there is no family his   tory and the disease is considered to be sporadic (denoted as SALS).  Although the genetic contribution to sporadic ALS appears to be con   siderable with an estimated heritability ranging 0.35 0.85, the genetics  of this disease remain largely unknown. Candidate gene studies have  identified potential risk factors, but replication of these associations  has proven to be difficult. Several genome wide association (GWA)  studies have now been performed in sporadic ALS and have high   lighted three novel candidate genes ( ITPR2 , FGGY  and DPP6 ).3 9 Two  independent studies found nominal p values < 0.05 for DPP6 ,6,10 but  recent genome wide efforts could not confirm this association.7,9 The  GWA studies in ALS have been relatively small and as a result of lim   ited power may have generated potentially spurious results. In order  to identify truly associated genetic risk factors for ALS, we recently  performed a two stage GWA study encompassing 19,838 subjects.  An initial genome wide screen with 2,323 cases and 9,013 controls  was followed by a replication experiment of all SNPs with a p value <  1.0x10 4 in an independent cohort of 2,532 cases and 5,940 controls.

Novel insights and challenges from the inborn errors of vitamin  B12 metabolism,S11.1,D. S. Rosenblatt,"McGill University, Department of Human Genetics, Montreal, QC, Canada","Over the last few years the discovery of the MMACHC , MMADHC ,  and LMBRD1 genes responsible for the cblC, cblD, and cblF inborn  errors of vitamin B12 metabolism has shed more light on the early steps  of intracellular handling of this vitamin. The LMBRD1 gene product is  responsible for the transport of cobalamin out of the lysososome. The  MMACHC  gene product binds cobalamin, and has been suggested  to play a role in reduction of cob(III)alamin to cob(II)alamin, removal  of the upper axial ligand and production of the base off conformation.  Epigenetic modification of the MMACHC  promoter is associated with a  malignant phenotype in a human melanoma cell line. Mmachc  knock  out mice do not survive to term and embryos show neurological ab   normalities consistent with the proposed requirement for vitamin B12 to  prevent neural tube defects. The MMADHC  gene product appears to  play a role in directing cobalamin to the mitochondria or the cytoplasm.  Mutations affecting different domains of the MMADHC  gene product  may result in decreased synthesis of AdoCbl alone, of MeCbl alone, or  of both cobalamin coenzyme derivatives. The recent expansion of newborn screening has resulted in a number  of surprising findings. These include mothers newly diagnosed with an  inborn error of cobalamin metabolism on the basis of a positive screen   ing test in their newborn, infants with cobalamin deficiency on the basis  of subclinical cobalamin deficiency in their breast feeding mothers, in   fants with a positive newborn screening test who carry mutations previ   ously shown to cause adult onset disease, and a newborn with the first  mutation in the gene for the transcobalamin receptor.Concurrent Symposia ",2009
"clinical, biochemical and genetic aspects of the methylmalonic  acidaemias",S11.2,M. R. Baumgartner,"Division of Metabolism, University Childrenâs Hospital, ZÃ¼rich, Switzerland","Methylmalonic acidurias (MMAurias) are a heterogeneous group of  inborn errors of metabolism biochemically characterized by the ac   cumulation of methylmalonic acid (MMA) in body fluids and tissues.  They result from deficiency of methylmalonyl CoA mutase apoenzyme  (MCM) or by a defect in the synthesis of its cofactor adenosylcobala   min (AdoCbl). MCM catalizes the conversion of L methylmalonyl CoA  to succinyl CoA thus linking the final catabolic pathways of L isoleu   cine, L valine, L methionine, L threonine, odd chain fatty acids, and  cholesterol side chains to the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Several mutant genetic classes that cause isolated  MMAuria are  known, based on biochemical, enzymatic and genetic complementa   tion analysis. The deficiencies of the apomutase locus are further sub   divided into defects without (mut0) and with residual activity (mut ). The  cblA, cblB and the variant 2 form of cblD complementation groups are  linked to processes unique to AdoCbl synthesis. The cblC, cblD and  cblF complementation groups are associated with defective methyl   cobalamin synthesis as well resulting in combined  MMAuria and ho   mocystinuria. Mutations in the genes associated with most of these  defects have been described. Finally, a few patients have been de   scribed with mild MMAuria associated with mutations of the methyl   malonyl CoA epimerase gene or with neurological symptoms due to  SUCL  mutations. The clinical presentation of affected patients is variable. The majority of  patients present during the newborn period or infancy with life threat   ening metabolic crises resulting in multi organ failure or even death.  These crises are often precipitated by catabolic stress, e.g. induced  by febrile illness. Severe keto  and lactic acidosis, hypo  or hypergly   cemia, neutropenia, hyperglycinemia, and hyperammonemia are the  most common laboratory findings. In a subgroup of patients chronic  progressive disease, psychomotor retardation, and failure to thrive  are the leading symptoms. Although the overall survival has improved  during the last two decades, long term outcome still remains disap   pointing. Neurological outcome is often impaired by extrapyramidal  movement disorder and developmental delay. Furthermore, chronic  renal failure is frequently found. Patients with mut0 and cblB have an  earlier onset of symptoms, a higher frequency of complications and  deaths, and a more pronounced urinary excretion of methylmalonic  acid than those with mut  and cblA  defects. Reliable classification of  these patients is essential for ongoing and future prospective studies  on treatment and outcome.",2009

"Using naturally occurring mutations to identify stem cell niches,  trace cell lineage and the origins of cancer in humans",S12.1,N. Wright,"Histopathology Lab, London Research Institute, Cancer Research UK, London,  United Kingdom","There have been considerable advances in our understanding of the  organisation of stem cells in epithelial tissues. The identification of reli   able stem cell markers has allowed lineage tracing in some tissues,  such as the intestine. But these observations are currently confined  to experimental animals, and the genetic manipulation required is not  available in humans. We have used a series of naturally occurring ge   netic alterations in humans to infer what we think are interesting obser   vations about human stem cells and the origins of human cancer. It is widely accepted that tumors are monoclonal in origin, arising from  a mutation or series of mutations in a single cell and its descend   ants. The clonal origin of colonic adenomas and uninvolved intestinal  mucosa from an XO/XY mosaic individual with familial adenomatous  polyposis (FAP) was examined directly by  in situ hybridization with Y chromosome probes. In this patient, the crypts of the small and large  intestine were clonal, showing that each was derived at some stage  from a single cells. However, at least 76 percent of the microadenomas  were polyclonal  in origin ( Science  272:1187 90). Previously studies  using X linked genes such as glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase  have been handicapped by the need to destroy the tissues to study the  haplotypes of glucose 6 phosphate dehydrogenase, but we were able  to directly visualize X inactivation patches in human females hetero   zygous for the G6PD Mediterranean mutation (563 C T). The results  showed again that crypts were clonal but crypts formed large families  (Proc Natl Acad Sci USA  100 3311 3314) We now describe a technique for detecting the expansion of a single  cellâs progeny that contain clonal mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) muta   tions affecting the expression of mtDNA encoded cytochrome c oxi   dase (COX). Since such mutations take up to 40 years to become  phenotypically apparent, we believe these clonal patches take origin  in stem cells. Dual color enzyme histochemistry was used to identify  COX deficient cells and mutations confirmed by microdissection of  single cells with polymerase chain reaction sequencing of the entire  mtDNA genome. These techniques have been applied to human in   testine, liver, pancreas and skin. Our results suggest that the stem cell  niche is located at the base of colonic crypts and above the Paneth cell  region in the small intestine, in accord with dynamic cell kinetic studies  in animals. In the pancreas, exocrine tissue progenitors appeared to  be located in or close to interlobular ducts, and in the liver, we propose  that stem cells are located in the periportal region. In the skin, the ori   gin of a basal cell carcinoma appeared to be from the outer root sheath  of the hair follicle. We propose that this is a general method for detect   ing clonal cell populations from which the location of the niche can be  inferred, also affording the generation of cell fate maps, all in human  tissues. The technique also allows analysis of the origin of human tu   mors from specific tissue sites ( Proc Natl Acad Sci USA ; 103:714 9;  Stem Cells  (in press).",2009
mapping mRNA expression QtLs in hematopoietic stem cells  and their progeny,S12.2,G. de Haan,"Department of Cell Biology, Section Stem Cell Biology, University Medical Cen   ter Groningen, University of Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands","A fundamental problem in biology is how a single genome can lead to  widely different cellular phenotypes. An illustrative and clinically rel   evant example is the generation of all mature blood cells types from  a small population of hematopoietic stem cells. Identification of gene  networks specifying stemness or lineage commitment is of major rel   evance for the emerging fields of tissue engineering and regenerative  medicine. We developed a genetical genomics approach as a tool to  dissect networks of interacting genes that specify cellular function in  four developmentally distinct hematopoietic cell stages. We evaluated  genome wide RNA transcript expression in highly purified Lin Sca 1+c  kit+ multilineage cells, committed Lin Sca 1 c kit+ progenitor cells, ery   throid Ter119+ and myeloid Gr1+ precursor cells isolated from a large  pedigree of genetically related and fully genotyped BXD recombinant  mouse strains. Variation in transcript abundance across all strains and  in all cell types was assessed by Illumina Sentrix Mouse 6 chip tech   nology, interrogating ~47,000 probesets mapping across of the ge   nome. For each variably expressed transcript genetic linkage analysis  identified a quantitative trait locus that affects variation in expression  levels of the corresponding gene (eQTL). These eQTLs map in the  vicinity of their target gene (cis regulation), or map elsewhere in the  genome (trans regulation). Complex transcript profiles for each cell type could be dissected into  more simple individual gene networks, each consisting of transcripts  whose variation in expression levels are regulated in trans by a single  genomic locus. We identified 1316 regulatory loci with cell stage spe   cific activity, including 140 loci that controlled gene expression pre   dominantly in the most primitive hematopoietic cells. We performed hi   erarchical clustering of all genes that were consistently downregulated  or upregulated during erythroid or myeloid development and detected  multiple modules of co varying transcripts for each set of consistently  downregulated or upregulated transcripts. To reveal whether such  modules of transcripts were under common genetic control, we per   formed eQTL clustering of 52 transcripts that were consistently down  Concurrent Symposia  regulated during both erythroid and myeloid differentiation. A genetic  analysis in revealed co localization of eQTLs for multiple transcripts,  which confirms shared regulatory relationships. Interestingly, a sub   stantial number of the 52 transcripts were regulated by loci on chromo   somes 1, 5, 9, 12, and 18, consistent with earlier QTL studies which  documented that these chromosomes contain loci that control the pool  size or the turnover of primitive hematopoietic cells. In addition to gene  expression data, we have recently embarked on studies aimed to de   termine whether micro RNA abundance and DNA methylation patterns  are regulated in a strain dependent way during myeloid and erythroid  development. Our data illustrate how hematopoietic cell differentiation may be the re   sult of cell type dependent rewiring of transcriptional connections. This  rewiring is observed as switches in correlation patterns, and indicates  reversal of regulatory polarity due to cell type specific transcriptional  co factors. Our dataset leads to an unprecedented number of concrete  predictions about the dynamic rewiring of the developmental regula   tory network, which can be followed up by hypothesis driven experi   mentation.",2009
stem cells as common ancestors in a colorectal cancer  ancestral tree,S12.3,D. K. Shibata,"USC / Norris Comprehensive Cancer Center, Keck School of Medicine, Los  Angeles, CA, United States","Stem cells can be defined in many ways. One retrospective way to de   fine and characterize stem cells is by ancestry. A somatic cell ancestral  tree has three types of cells. A start (zygote or first transformed cell),  present day cells, and no longer present cells. No longer present cells  can be divided into ancestors (with present day progeny) and dead  ends (no present day progeny). Functionally, ancestors are stem cells  and dead ends are non stem cells. Therefore, a somatic cell ancestral  tree is essentially a stem cell tree. In theory, molecular phylogeny can  reconstruct ancestral trees by comparing variations between present  day genomes. Genomes are almost perfect copies of prior copies, and  the numbers of random replication error can be used to infer the time  back to a common ancestor. Preliminary studies suggest that methyla   tion patterns in certain CpG rich regions effectively function as epigen   etic somatic cell molecular clocks. Methylation patterns sampled from  normal colon crypts are consistent with a niche with multiple mitotic  stem cells per crypt. Methylation patterns sampled from colorectal can   cer glands are diverse and inconsistent with very rare cancer stem  cells (CSCs). Simulations suggest that each cancer gland, similar to a  normal crypt, is also maintained by a stem cell hierarchy and contain  multiple CSCs. Potentially it may become practical to read the histories  of human cells from their replication errors, which primarily accumulate  in stem cells.",2009
Using microenvironmental microarrays to decipher the role of  the niche signaling in breast progenitor cell fate,S12.4,"M.A. LaBarge1, R. Villadsen2, O. Petersen2, M. J. Bissell1","1Life Sciences Division, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, University of  California, Berkeley, CA, United States, 2Department of Cellular and Molecular  Medicine, Faculty of Health Sciences, and Zoophysiological Laboratory, Depart   ment of Molecular Biology, University of Copenhagen, Copenhagen, Denmark","Previously we had shown that within the luminal population of the hu   man breast, a subpopulation of cells resembling stem cells could be  identified (1). These cells contained both luminal and myoepithelial  characteristics.  Since cellular pathways that contribute to adult human  mammary gland architecture and lineages had not been described pre   viously, we identified a candidate stem cell niche in ducts and zones  containing progenitor cells in lobules (2). Putative stem cells residing  in ducts were essentially quiescent, whereas the progenitor cells in the  lobules were more likely to be actively dividing. Cells from ducts and  lobules collected under the microscope were functionally characterized  by colony formation on tissue culture plastic, mammosphere formation  in suspension culture, and morphogenesis in laminin rich extracellular  matrix gels (LrECM). Staining for the lineage markers keratins K14  and K19 further revealed multipotent cells in the stem cell zone and  three lineage restricted cell types outside this zone. Multiparameter  cell sorting and functional characterization with reference to anatomi  cal sites in situ confirmed this pattern. The proposal that the four cell  types are indeed constituents of an as of yet undescribed stem cell  hierarchy was assessed in long term cultures in which senescence  was bypassed. These findings identified an adult human breast ductal  stem cell activity and its earliest descendants. Multi potent progenitor cells are some of the most primitive members  of the developmental hierarchies that maintain homeostasis. That  progenitors and their more mature progeny share identical genomes  suggests that fate decisions are directed by interactions with extrinsic  soluble factors, ECM, and other cells, as well as physical properties of  the ECM. To understand regulation of fate decisions, therefore, would  require a means of understanding carefully choreographed combina   torial interactions. We used microenvironment protein microarrays to  functionally identify combinations of cell extrinsic mammary gland pro   teins and ECM molecules that imposed specific cell fates on bipotent  human mammary progenitor cells. Micropatterned cell culture surfaces  were fabricated to distinguish between the instructive effects of cellâ cell versus cellâECM interactions, as well as constellations of signaling  molecules; and these were used in conjunction with physiologically  relevant 3 dimensional human breast cultures. Both immortalized and  primary human breast progenitors were analyzed (3). We report on the  functional ability of those proteins of the mammary gland that maintain  quiescence, maintain the progenitor state, and guide progenitor differ   entiation towards myoepithelial and luminal lineages.

Reverse Phenotyping: t owards an integrated (epi)genomic  approach to complex phenotypes and common disease,S13.1,S. Beck,"UCL Cancer Institute, University College London, London, United Kingdom","What determines a phenotype remains one of the most fundamental  questions in biology and medicine. In addition to genetic factors, non  genetic factors such as epigenetic and environmental factors have  been shown to play important roles. Of the epigenetic factors, meth   ylation at CpG dinucleotides is the only known biologically relevant  epigenetic modification at the DNA level in humans and vertebrates in  general. Knowledge of the methylation status of each of the ~28 mil   lion CpG sites (methylome) in the haploid human genome is therefore  of great importance for cellular identity, differentiation, development  and, if perturbed, for disease aetiology. To understand the rules gov   erning DNA methylation and the consequences if DNA methylation is  perturbed requires genome wide analysis of its temporal and spatial  plasticity. Almost 60 years after the discovery of 5 methyl cytosine and  about 25 years since the discovery that altered DNA methylation plays  a role in disease (particularly in cancer), technologies for methylome  analysis have finally become available.

","Lynch syndrome (HNPCC) patients are susceptible to colorectal, en   dometrial and a range of other cancers due to heterozygous inacti   vating mutations in one of the mismatch repair genes, MLH1 , PMS2 ,  MSH2  or MSH6 . In multiple patients with an MSH2 deficient tumor, in  whome no germline mutation in MSH2 could be detected, a hetero   zygous germline deletion of 4.9 kb encompassing the last exons of  EPCAM  (formerly known as TACSTD1)  was found. EPCAM  is located  directly upstream of MSH2 and encodes the epithelial cell adhesion  molecule Ep CAM. Due to the deletion of the transcription termination  signal transcription of EPCAM  was shown to extend into MSH2. As  antisense transcription of CpG islands may lead to methylation, we  tested whether the transcription of the MSH2  promoter would lead to  methylation of its CpG dinucleotides. Indeed, the MSH2  promoter in  cis with the deletion is methylated in Ep CAM positive, but not in Ep  CAM negative, normal tissues, thus revealing a correlation between  transcriptional read through of the mutated EPCAM  allele and epigen   etic inactivation of the corresponding MSH2  allele. A distinct deletion  that also includes the 3â end of EPCAM  was detected in two Chinese  families, one of which was previously described with mosaic MSH2   methylation. Also in these families transcriptional read through corre   lates with subsequent promoter methylation. Gene silencing by tran   scriptional read through of a neighboring gene as demonstrated here  in sense direction for MSH2, has been described earlier in antisense  direction for HBA2  in a patient with alpha thalassemia and thus could  represent a general mutational mechanism. Depending on the expres   sion pattern of the neighboring gene that lacks its normal polyadenyl   ation signal, this may cause either generalized or mosaic patterns of  epigenetic inactivation, that are inherited over generations. Moreover,  abrogation of polyadenylation signals due to chromosomal aberrations  in cancer cells may result in aberrant promoter methylation and inacti   vation of tumor suppressor genes.",2009

Terzic2","1Department of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, Mayo Clinic College of  Medicine, Rochester, MN, United States, 2Department of Medicine, Mayo Clinic  College of Medicine, Rochester, MN, United States","Cellular senescence of cultured cells relies heavily on activation of  the p19Arf p53 tumor suppressor pathway. This together with the ob   servation that p19Arf expression increases with age in many tissues  of humans and rodents, led to speculation that p53 activity drives in  vivo senescence and natural aging. However, it has been difficult to  experimentally test this hypothesis in vivo using a model system, be   cause inactivation of p19Arf or p53 in mice results in early death from  tumors with 100% penetrance. One approach to test the role of the p53  pathway in organismal aging would be to inactivate p19Arf or p53 in a  mouse model that develops age related pathologies at a young age.  BubR1 insufficient mice (BubR1 hypomorphic), which die five times  faster than wild type mice, develop a variety of early aging associ   ated phenotypes including cachetic dwarfism, skeletal muscle atrophy (sarcopenia), cataracts, arterial stiffening, loss of subcutaneous fat,  reduced stress tolerance and impaired wound healing. We show that  BubR1 hypomorphic mice exhibit high expression of p19Arf in skeletal  muscle and fat. Surprisingly, inactivation of p19Arf exacerbates in vivo   senescence and aging specifically in these tissues, suggesting that  p19Arf is an attenuator, rather than an effector of aging and senes   cence. Furthermore, in accordance with a generalized anti aging ef   fect of the p53 pathway, we find that abrogation of p53 also selectively  accelerates senescence and aging in skeletal muscle and fat of BubR1  hypomorphic mice. Importantly, BubR1 hypomorphic mice lacking the  cell cycle inhibitor p21, a key target of p53 activation, exhibit the same  accelerated aging characteristics and senescent cell accumulation as  BubR1 mutants lacking p19Arf or p53, suggesting that p53 exerts its  anti aging effect through p21, and not through targets that mediate  apoptosis. Based on these data, we propose that chronic stress as   sociated with BubR1 insufficiency or normal aging, induces a relatively  mild p53 transcriptional response that instead of promoting aging and  senescence acts to attenuate aging by providing stress resistance.",2009
Aging and cancer: Rival Demons?,S14.2,"J. Campisi1,2","1Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, Berkely, CA, United States, 2Buck  Institute for Age Research, Novato, CA, United States","Age is the largest single risk factor for developing cancer. In this re   gard, cancer is no different from a host of other age related diseases     cardiovascular disease, osteoporosis, neurodegeneration, etc. None   theless, cancer appears to differ from other age related pathologies in  conspicuous ways. First, cancer is dominated by hyperproliferation,  rather than degeneration. Second, somatic are an essential driving  force behind cancer development, but it is not clear whether is the  case for other aging phenotypes. Third, cancer arises from renewable  tissues, which promote longevity by allowing repair and regeneration,  but are perennially and inherently at risk for developing malignant tu   mors due to mutations that can arise during DNA replication. Nonethe   less, mutations are known to accumulate very early in life, and it is now  clear that mutations alone are rarely enough to fully drive malignant tu   morigenesis. How then do fundamental aging processes set the stage  for the development of cancer, and do these processes differ from  those that set the stage for other age related pathologies? We present  a model and supporting data to suggest that evolutionarily conserved  tumor suppressive pathways, which evolved to protect complex multi   cellular organisms from cancer, can have deleterious late life effects.  We propose that the evolutionary antagonistic pleiotropy of certain  tumor suppressor responses can drive aging phenotypes, including,  ironically, late life cancer. We suggest that these deleterious effects  arise, in part, from the transcriptional response of normal cells to dam   age and other potentially oncogenic insults, which leads to the secre   tion of factors that can alter normal tissue structure and function, and  ultimately create a tissue milieu that is conducive for the development  of cancer. This model offers a new paradigm for understanding both  aging and cancer phenotypes, and new possibilities for ameliorating  the deleterious effects of certain tumor suppressive strategies.",2009
"insulin signalling, ageing and age related disease",S14.3,D. Withers,"Centre for diabetes and endocrinology, University College London, London,  United Kingdom","Although aging appears to be stochastic in nature, involving accumu   lation of molecular damage caused by such processes as oxidation  or glycation, the rate of ageing is also influenced by genetic varia   tion. For example, there are striking differences in longevity between  animal species and mutations in single genes can extend lifespan in  laboratory animals.  There is growing evidence that the insulin/insulin  like growth factor (IGF) signalling (IIS) pathway, which has long been  known to play pleiotropic roles in the development, growth, reproduc   tion, stress resistance and metabolism of multicellular animals, is a key  evolutionarily conserved regulator of longevity. The pleiotropic effects  of IIS upon organismal physiology are largely mediated by intracellu   lar signalling adaptor proteins the best characterised of which are the  insulin receptor substrate (IRS) proteins. We recently undertook a sys   tematic analysis of the role of IRS proteins in mammalian lifespan. Fe   male Irs1 /  mice were long lived and, importantly, resistant to a range  of age related pathologies, including skin, bone, immune and motor  dysfunction. These improvements in health were seen despite mild,  life long insulin resistance. Thus, enhanced insulin sensitivity is not a  prerequisite for IIS mutant longevity. Irs1 /  female mice also displayed  normal anterior pituitary function distinguishing them from long lived  somatotrophic axis mutants. In contrast, Irs2 /  mice were short lived,  while Irs1+/  and Irs2+/  and Irs1+/ :Irs2+/  mice showed normal lifespan.  We are currently exploring potential downstream effector pathways  that mediate the longevity assurance mechanisms regulated by IRS  signalling and the role of this signalling pathway in neurodegenerative  disease. IRS signalling is a key intracellular determinant of age related  health, and hence a potential point of intervention for broad spectrum,  preventative therapy against age related diseases.",2009

Recently, we have documented independent association of  Vangl1  and Vangl2  gene mutations with NTDs. In the Looptail  mouse,  homozygosity (but not heterozygosity) for loss of function alleles at  Vangl2  causes the severe NTD craniorachischis, while heterozygosity  for mutant variants of VANGL1  is associated with NTDs in a human co   hort of sporadic and familial cases. Recent functional studies of Vangl2   Looptail alleles (S464N, D255E) show that loss of function in these  two variants is associated with reduced protein stability and absence  of mature protein at the membrane. To further understand the role of  Vangl1  in normal development, we created a mouse mutant with an  inactivating mutation at Vangl1  (Vangl1gt). Vangl1  shows a dynamic  pattern of expression in the developing neural tube and notochord at  the time of neural tube closure. Vangl1gt/+ heterozygotes and Vangl1gt/gt  homozygotes are viable and fertile, although Vangl1gt/gt display subtle  alterations in polarity of inner hair cells of the cochlea. Remarkably,  and as opposed to healthy Vangl1gt/+and Vangl2lp/+heterozygotes,  Vangl1gt/+;Vangl2lp/+ double heterozygotes show profound develop  mental defects that include severe craniorachischisis, inner ear de   fects (misorganization of the stereociliary bundles of hair cells of the  organ of Corti), and cardiac abnormality (aberrant right subclavian ar   tery). These results show that genetic interaction between Vangl1 and  Vangl2 genes causes neural tube defects. They raise the possibility  that interaction between individual Vangl  genes and other genetic loci  and/or environmental factors may additionally contribute to the etiol   ogy of NTDs.",2009

Graded sonic Hedgehog signaling and the control of Neuronal  subtype identity in Vertebrate Embryos,S15.3,J. Briscoe,"The National Institute for Medical Research, The Ridgeway, London, United  Kingdom","Neuronal subtype specification in the vertebrate neural tube is one  of the best studied examples of embryonic pattern formation. Distinct  neuronal subtypes are generated in a precise spatial order from pro   genitor cells according to their location along the anterior posterior  and dorsal ventral axes. Underpinning this organization is a complex  network of multiple extrinsic and intrinsic factors. In ventral regions,  the secreted protein Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) acts in graded fashion  to organize the pattern of neurogenesis. This is a dynamic process  in which increasing concentrations and durations of exposure to Shh  generate neurons with successively more ventral identities. Interac   tions between the receiving cells and the graded signal underpin the  mechanism of Shh action. In particular the transcriptional regulation of  genes induced or repressed by Shh signaling plays an essential role in  shaping the graded readout. Thus the accurate patterning of the neural  tube relies on the continuous processing and constant refinement of  the cellular response to graded Shh signaling. Concurrent Symposia ",2009

Using only a single mouse blastomere, our mRNA  Seq assay can detect the expression of 74% (5,270) more genes than  microarray techniques. Moreover, 8   19 % of the genes with multiple  known transcript isoforms express at least two isoforms in the same  blastomere or mature oocyte, which unambiguously demonstrated the  complexity of the transcript variants at whole genome scale. Finally,  for Dicer and Ago2 knockout oocytes, we also showed that in Dicer  knockout and Ago2 knockout mature oocytes, 1,924 and 1,687 genes  respectively were abnormally upregulated, and 1,343 and 987 tran   scripts respectively were downregulated compared to wildtype con   trols, which proves the global importance of small RNAs (including mi   croRNAs and endogenous siRNAs) for oogenesis. The main technical  novelty of this work is the combination of an improved unbiased ampli   fication of cDNAs from single cells with well over a 100 million reads,  or a few gigabases of cDNAs on SOLIDTM. This not only allowed us to  discover many novel transcripts that have been overlooked but also  to get a quantitative estimate of their abundance in the cell by the fre   quency with which the sequence occurs in the mRNA Seq reads.

","Around 90% of human genes have been estimated to undergo alter   native splicing. Apart from switching genes on and off, switching be   tween transcript isoforms can be used for fine tuning and orchestra   tion of cellular differentiation. Using the myoblast cell line C2C12 as  a well controlled model for cell differentiation, we applied a variety of  high resolution genomics technologies to study gene transcription in  undifferentiated and differentiated cells. We applied CAGE Seq (cap  analysis of gene expression followed by Illumina deep sequencing) to  quantitatively identify the 5â ends of transcripts, SAGE Seq to quan   tify the 3â ends of transcripts, and assayed mRNA degradation rates  on Affymetrix exon arrays. We found 1400 transcription start sites not  previously annotated. Around 50% of the expressed genes demon   strated use of multiple polyadenylation sites. We observed extensive  qualitative and quantitative differences in use of transcription start  sites, internal exons, 3â UTRs, and polyadenylation sites between dif   ferentiated myotubes and undifferentiated myoblasts. Splice variants  from some genes were produced at comparable levels, but degraded  with different efficiencies; a transcript from the Itga7  gene with an ad   ditional internal exon was much more abundant in differentiated than in  undifferentiated cells, mainly because of specific and extremely rapid  degradation of transcripts lacking this exon. Since it is thought that the  abundance of different splice isoforms is mainly controlled by tissue  specific splicing factors, this represents a new mechanism to regulate  the ratio between different splice isoforms. We conclude that promoter  usage, alternative splicing and RNA degradation must be tightly cou   pled through yet unknown mechanisms.c01.3 Genomic variation detection by DNA selection and high  throughput sequencing S.

The resequencing of a targeted region of the genome has become a  major goal in order to understand the correlation between genomic  and phenotypic variability. We have optimized a genomic selection  method for high throughput sequencing. The repeat masked contigu   ous region of 8.9Mb was targeted on human chromosomes 21 and  7. We used DNA from an individual from the International HapMap  Project for which the genotype data are available. After microarray  based enrichment and sequencing of genomic DNA from chromosome  21 we observed a 260 fold enrichment with 41% of reads from the  targeted region. The median coverage of the targeted region using  two lines of an Illumina GA2 sequencing instrument was 16 fold. We  also observed that regions with low sequence coverage are AT rich  and are close to low complexity DNA stretches. 83% of SNPs have at  least 4 fold coverage, and 80% of the SNPs identified were already  listed in dbSNP. For these dbSNP positions our sequence genotypes  are concordant in 92% of cases with previously obtained genotypes of  NA12782. 54% of all dbSNP positions had at least 15 fold sequence  coverage, the coverage previously estimated as minimal for rigorous  SNP search. At this threshold, 98.8% of dbSNP genotypes are concor   dant between sequencing and HapMap data for NA12872. Validation  experiments using Sanger sequencing after PCR amplification were  done for 46 SNPs covered 15 20 fold; the confirmation rate obtained  was 96%.

Small RNAs are  involved in the guidance of diverse types of gene regulation, tipically  resulting in reduced expression of target genes. In the central nervous  system miRNAs are key in developmental processess, contributing to  neuronal cell identity and synapse formation. miRNAs also play a role  in mature neurons, participating in synaptic plasticity and neuronal sur   vival. Alterations in miRNA related pathways have been associated to  several neurological and neurodegenerative diseases. Here we have  used Illumina/Solexa deep sequencing to extensivelly characterize  and profile small RNA libraries of three adult brain areas: frontal cor   tex, striatum and amygdala. In all the samples the majority of reads  corresponded to previously annotated miRNAs. The most abundant  sequences in all libraries included members of the let 7 family, mir  29a, mir 1, mir 101 and mir 103 miRNAs. Selective miRNAs were spe   cifically enriched in each brain area. We have found strong variability  in the mature miRNA reference sequence, mainly in the form of length  modifications, that match the precursor sequence of the miRNA. Vari   ability was also detected as nucleotide substitutions in the different  positions of the reference mature miRNA, which was clearly reduced  in the 5â seed region. These results suggest a miRNA signature in the  different brain areas that may be related with the maintance of the tran   scriptome in each brain structure.

Molecular testing for HCM has  a growing impact on the medical management of patients/families. To  overcome the extensive genetic heterogeneity we had developed a  microarray to resequence 30 Kbp including all exons (n,160), splice  sites and 5â UTR of 12 HCM genes (HCM custom DNA resequenc   ing array, HCM RA, Fokstuen et al, 2008). This approach, now used in  diagnostics, is very efficient and cheap but does not detect small indels  (~14% of known HCM mutations). Moreover, HCM RA lacks flexibility  since gene additions require a redesign. We now present new results obtained using short read next genera   tion sequencing (NGS) of 12 HCM genes (targeted by multi exonic  amplicons) and a new downstream data analysis pipeline. DNAs from  19 patients (11 without known mutations, 8 positive controls as a com   posite pool) were assessed in one channel (exp.A). In another chan   nel (exp.B), we sequenced a single patient with no known mutation.  Mutations were confirmed by classical sequencing. In Exp.A, all the 8  known pathogenic mutations and SNPs previously identified were also  found by NGS. Furthermore we identified novel variants: two indels  and a nonsense mutation in MYBPC3 gene that likely cause the dis   ease. In Exp.B, no pathogenic mutation but 140 non coding dbSNPs  were identified. Although improvements are needed in target enrichment and data  analysis, NGS holds considerable promises in high throughput analy   sis of mutations/variants underlying the highly heterogeneous or multi   genic genetic disorders in clinical practice.c02.1Phenotypic and genomic evaluation of 52 subjects with a smith  Magenis like phenotype: identification of new syndromic regions  associated with altered gene dosage S.

Haploinsufficiency of the retinoic acid induced 1 gene (RAI1) results  in Smith Magenis syndrome (SMS), which includes developmental  delays, sleep disturbance, self injurious behaviors, and dysmorphic  features. We evaluated 52 individuals referred for molecular analysis  due to a possible SMS diagnosis. Screening for 17p11.2 deletions and  RAI1 mutations was negative, suggesting that at least one other lo   cus is responsible for the SMS like phenotype. This cohort is clinically  indistinguishable from SMS, with >90% overlap with core features, in   cluding developmental delays, sleep disturbance, self injurious behav   iors, motor dysfunction, obesity, and behavioral anomalies of the same  type and prevalence as seen in SMS. We performed whole genome  array CGH to identify genomic lesions contributing to the SMS like  phenotypes and identified 15 CNVs/52 cases, including 10 deletions  and 5 duplications. These CNVs include novel genomic regions where  altered gene dosage has not been previously associated with any clini   cal syndrome. We also identified several well characterized regions  associated with known syndromes, suggesting a need for better clini   cal phenotyping and discrimination between syndromes, as well as  possible syndromic associations not previously appreciated. Genes in  these regions contribute to development, neurological function, and  behavior, all of which are affected in SMS. Further, some of these loci  have been associated with autism, schizophrenia, and mental retarda   tion, suggesting possible genetic heterogeneity. Given the phenotypic  overlap between the SMS and SMS like cases, these molecular data  may provide insights into the function of RAI1 and may improve di   agnosis, understanding, and potentially treatment of these complex  behavior and mental retardation syndromes.",2009

The purpose of the retrospective EQA is to assess the technical quality  of the laboratories and the biological and clinical interpretation of the  results. The participant laboratories submit, online, reports concluded  in the previous year, with three corresponding pictures of the karyo   types. All the reports are anonymised for the patientâs name and the  laboratory origin. The database enables a rapid, and secured handling  of the assessed reports and pictures. The assessors are licensed  cytogeneticist divided into 5 groups. They examine the reports and  transmit back their conclusions to the database. The final results are  saved and delivered anonymously by mail. A total of 50/70 laboratories  participate in prenatal or/and postnatal scheme. In 2007, 131 postna   tal reports and 181 prenatal (131 amniotic fluids + 50 chorionic villi)  reports were uploaded. This represents 934 evaluated mitosis. The  results showed that 74,3% of the reports had 3/3 correct classified  karyotypes in R and/or G banding. The participants evaluated correctly  the resolution level in 76,1% mitosis.

Very recently a same homozygous  splice mutation in the CC2D2A  gene was reported in Finnish fetuses  with MKS defining the 6th MKS locus. Short after, CC2D2A  mutations  in Joubert patients were reported (JBTS9). Here we report the mutation and expression analysis of the CC2D2A  gene during human development . We identified mutations in 11 MKS  cases, of various ethnic origin, all predicting truncating alleles. These  results confirm the involvement of CC2DA  in MKS and show it major  contribution to the disease.We also identified missense CC2D2A  mu  tations in two JS cases.

Genome wide linkage analysis identifed a 5.8 Mb in   terval on chromosome 8q with shared homozygosity among the affect   ed persons. Sequencing of genes contained in the interval revealed a  homozygous mutation, S100P, in carbonic anhydrase related protein 8 (CA8), which is highly expressed in cerebellar Purkinje cells and  influences inositol triphosphate (ITP) binding to its receptor ITPR1 on  the endoplasmatic reticulum and thereby modulates calcium signaling.  We demonstrate that the mutation S100P is associated with protea   some mediated degradation, and thus presumably represents a null  mutation comparable to the Ca8 mutation underlying the previously  described waddles mouse, which exhibits ataxia and appendicular  dystonia without pathological abnormalities of either the central or the peripheral nervous systems.  Subsequently, we identifed the mutation R237Q in a highly conserved  region of CA8 in an unrelated Iranian family with mild mental retar   dation and ataxia without quadrupedal gait. Magnetic resonance im   aging studies of an affected person revealed no structural cerebral  or cerebellar abnormalities.

Causative genes have  been identified for the most frequent forms of autosomal recessive  ataxia. Nonetheless, genes remain unidentified for about half of the  cases. A SNP based genome wide scan in a consanguineous family with 3  affected siblings allowed us to identify a novel locus for autosomal  recessive ataxia on chromosome 3qter. By direct sequencing of genes  in this family, we have identified a homozygous frameshift mutation  shared by the patients and heterozygous or absent from the 5 healthy  siblings. The patients have an early onset of ataxia before 7 years  associated with delayed motor development, dysarthria, epilepsy with  no relapse observed after treatment since 3 years of age. Two of the  patients present also mental retardation. Nerve conduction studies re   vealed no evidence of associated peripheral neuropathy. Bioinformat   ics predictions show that the homologs of the mutant gene belong to  a subfamily of genes coding for Plekstrin homology domain. A close  plekstrin homolog may be linked to small GTPase signaling and colo   calizes with late endosomal/lysosomal vesicles in osteoclast like cells,  suggesting a putative function in vesicular transport in the osteoclasts.  These data suggest that our recessive ataxia gene is involved in mem   brane signaling, a function that can now be tested by molecular studies  in order to understand the mechanism of this novel form of recessive  ataxia.",2009

Children suffer from severe mental and motor impairments due to at   rophy or hypoplasia of the cerebellum, hypoplasia of the ventral pons,  microcephaly and variable neocortical atrophy. The disease is progres   sive and usually patients die before they reach adulthood. We identified a common mutation in TSEN54 (A307S) in the major   ity of European PCH2 patients. TSEN54 is one of the four subunits  of the tRNA splicing endonuclease (TSEN34, TSEN2 and TSEN15).  The TSEN complex is responsible for the splicing of intron containing  tRNAs and also plays a role in pre mRNA 3âend formation. In PCH  patients without the A307S mutation, we identified other missense and  nonsense mutations in TSEN54 , TSEN34 and TSEN2 subunits. In situ hybridization for TSEN54 using LNA/2OME probes revealed  that TSEN54 is highly expressed in neurons of the pons, cerebellar  dentate and olivary nuclei. Northern blot analysis of tRNA Tyrosine from fibroblasts of 3 patients  did not show unspliced products. The molecular mechanism behind pontocerebellar hypoplasia remains  unclear. In order to study the mechanisms underlying PCH we per   formed knock down experiments in zebrafish. Injection of TSEN54 or  TSEN2 morpholino oligonucleotides in zebrafish embryos results in  similar neurodevelopmental phenotypes, most prominently affecting  brain development.",2009

PolyQ expansion confers to  mutant proteins a toxic gain of function, which compromises neuro   nal function and survival. However, the molecular and cellular mecha   nisms underlying polyQ expansion toxicity remain unclear. SCA7 is unique among polyQ diseases to cause retinal degeneration  and blindness. To get insight into the mechanisms of polyQ toxicity, we  are studying the SCA7 retinopathy in the R7E transgenic mice, which  express the polyQ expanded ataxin 7 under the rhodopsin promoter.  Initial studies showed that R7E retinopathy was characterized by a  progressive reduction of photoreceptor segments and of electroretino   graph (ERG) activities, however, without extensive loss of photorecep   tors. That differed R7E retinopathy from other retinal degenerations in  mammalian (inherited or light induced), in which degenerative outer  segment disappearance is typically followed by photoreceptor death. We now describe the morphological deconstruction of R7E photore   ceptor cells, which is reminiscent of the structural reorganization that  assures the survival of photoreceptors in some retinal detachment  paradigms. Moreover, a subset of R7E photoreceptors migrate out of  outer nuclear layer, die by non apoptotic cell death and thereby cause  a continuous loss of photoreceptor cells along the pathology. Remark   ably, some photoreceptors expressing mutant ataxin 7 undergo cell  division and likely contribute to maintain the photoreceptor cell popula   tion until late disease stage. In conclusion, in response to ataxin 7 toxicity photoreceptors undergo  a wide range of cell fate, including adaptative deconstruction, lethal  migration and proliferative cell renewal.",2009

The skeletal dysplasia com   prises platyspondyly with moderate short stature, osteopenia, and  widened metaphyses. Patients have an increased ratio of total urinary  pyridinolines, lysyl pyridinoline/hydroxylysyl pyridinoline (LP/HP), of ~  1 as opposed to ~ 6 in EDS VI or ~ 0.2 in controls. Lysyl and prolyl  residues of collagens were underhydroxylated despite normal lysyl hy   droxylase and prolyl 4 hydroxylase activities; underhydroxylation was  a generalized process as shown by mass spectrometry of the Î±1(I)   and Î±2(I) chain derived peptides of collagen type I and involved at  least collagen types I and II. A genome wide SNP scan and sequence  analyses identified in all patients a homozygous c.483_491del9 muta   tion in SLC39A13 that encodes for a membrane bound zinc transporter  SLC39A13. We hypothesize that an increased Zn++ content inside the  endoplasmic reticulum competes with Fe++, a cofactor which is nec   essary for hydroxylation of lysyl and prolyl residues, and thus explains  the biochemical findings.

Mutations in TRPS1 cause the  tricho rhino phalangeal syndrome (TRPS). Besides typical craniofacial  anomalies, skeletal malformations are characteristic hallmarks of pa   tients with TRPS. Here we show that TRPS1 interacts with Indian hedgehog (Ihh)/GLI3  signalling and regulates chondrocyte differentiation and proliferation.  By immunoprecipitation assays using transiently transfected cells as  well as native tissue samples from embryonic mouse limbs, we could  demonstrate that TRPS1/Trps1 specifically interacts with the activa   tor form of GLI3/Gli3, whereas a direct binding of the repressor form  of GLI3/Gli3 could be excluded. GST pull down experiments were  used to verify the interaction of the isolated GLI3 activator domain with  TRPS1. Through the use of different truncated TRPS1 constructs, a  domain of 185 aa, containing three predicted zinc fingers, was shown  to be sufficient for the interaction with GLI3. Using different mouse models we find that in distal chondrocytes Trps1  and the repressor activity of Gli3 are required to expand distal cells  and locate the expression domain of Parathyroid hormone related pep   tid. In columnar proliferating chondrocytes Trps1 and Ihh/Gli signal   ling have an activating function. The differentiation of columnar and  hypertrophic chondrocytes is supported by Trps1, independent of Gli3.

No pathogenic mechanism  has been described previously, but clinical similarity has been noted to  craniofrontonasal syndrome (CFNS), which is caused by mutations in  the X linked EFNB1 gene. Here we report a family in which females in three generations pre   sented with hypertelorism, but lacked either craniosynostosis or a  grooved nasal tip, excluding CFNS. DNA sequencing of EFNB1 was  normal, but MLPA indicated a duplication of all 5 exons of EFNB1,  which segregated with the hypertelorism. We characterised the dupli   cation breakpoint sequence, revealing a direct duplication of 937 kb  including EFNB1 and two flanking genes, PJA1 and STARD8. By use  of Pyrosequencing, we measured imbalance of EFNB1 expression in  the affected grandmother. After correction for skewed X inactivation,  we show that the X chromosome bearing the duplicated EFNB1 genes  produces approximately twice as much EFNB1 transcript as the nor   mal X chromosome. We propose that in the context of X inactivation, the difference in ex   pression level of EFNB1 between the normal and duplicated X chro   mosomes results in abnormal cell sorting during embryogenesis, lead   ing to hypertelorism. To support this hypothesis we provide evidence  from a mouse model carrying a hypomorphic Efnb1 allele, that ab   normal cell sorting occurs in the cranial region. Hence we propose  that X linked cases resembling Teebi hypertelorism may have a similar  pathogenesis to CFNS, and that cellular mosaicism for different levels  of ephrin b1 (as well as simple presence/absence) leads to craniofa   cial abnormalities.",2009

The identified variants  are common and have low penetrance in the general population. The  aim of this study was to examine for gene gene interactions and inves   tigate the combined effect of the 19 variants by applying receiver op   erating characteristics (ROC) to demonstrate the discriminatory value  between glucose tolerant individuals and type 2 diabetes patients in a  cross sectional population of Danes. Methods : The 19 variants were genotyped in three study populations:  The population based Inter99 study, the ADDITION study, and in ad   ditional type 2 diabetic patients and glucose tolerant individuals. The  case control studies involved 4,093 type 2 diabetic patients and 5,302  glucose tolerant individuals. Results:  Single variant analyses demonstrated allelic odds ratios (OR)  ranging from 1.04 (95%CI: 0.98,1.11) to 1.33 (95%CI: 1.22,1.45).  When combining the 19 variants subgroups with extreme risk profiles  showed 3 fold difference in risk of type 2 diabetes (lower 10% carriers  with <15 risk alleles vs. upper 10% carriers with >22 risk alleles, OR  2.93 (95%CI: 2.38,3.62, p,1.6Ã10 25). We calculated the area under a  ROC curve to estimate the discrimination rate between glucose toler  ant individuals and type 2 diabetes patients based on the 19 variants.  We found an area under the ROC curve of 0.60. Two way gene gene  interaction showed few nominal interactions. Conclusion:  The 19 validated variants enables detection of subgroups  in substantial increased risk of type 2 diabetes, however the discrimi   nation between glucose tolerance and type 2 diabetes is still too inac   curate to achieve clinical value.",2009

We  propose a simple method for the joint (re )analysis of multiple SNPs,  based on published summary data. Our approach is based on two  observations. Firstly, finemapping studies are focused, by design, on  a limited number of moderately to strongly correlated SNPs. All test   ed SNPs are expected to reflect the true association of the unknown  causal variant proportional to their LD with it, in concordance with the  âFundamental Theorem of the HapMapâ. Secondly, given such corre   lated SNP data it has been suggested before that a joint analysis of all  markers together is most powerful for detecting a true association. A  closer examination of the results reported in the GWAS study reveals  that the data indeed concur with the âTheorem of the HapMapâ. Based  on the above we re analyzed the replication data using a novel joint  test of association and conclude and the results strongly favors Piccolo  to be a causal risk factor for major depression.

Alternatively, the non parametric Multifactor Dimensionality Reduction  method, MDR (Ritchie et al. 2001), can be applied. The common fea   ture of MDR and its extensions is that they are extremely computer  intensive, that best models are evaluated on the basis of cross valida   tion (prediction accuracy measures) and permutations and that only  one such best model is proposed when looking at interactions of a  particular order. We propose a novel unified multifactor dimensionality reduction strat   egy for genetic interaction association analysis that can handle both  unrelated individuals and families of any structure, different outcome  types (e.g., categorical, continuous or survival type), easy covariate  handling or adjustment for lower order interactions or confounding  factors, all within the same framework. When applied to family data,  we obtain a less computationally intensive method than current MDR  adaptations to family data and allow several clusters of markers to be  proposed as showing significant association with the outcome under  investigation. This better reflects locus heterogeneity and genetic het   erogeneity, usually present in complex diseases. Our epistasis detection method is further evaluated and validated via a  simulation study, by computing type I error and power under a variety  of scenarios, and via application to a real life data set.Concurrent Sessions",2009

W. Morris , A. P. Corvin","Institute of Molecular Medicine, Trinity College Dublin, Dublin, Ireland","Genome wide association studies (GWAS) provide substantially  greater potential to detect common risk variants of modest effect in  complex disorders than previous positional cloning methodologies. A  major criticism has been that these studies have, to date, explained  only a small fraction of predicted heritability despite large sample sizes  and genome wide SNP coverage. The joint action of common variants  within pathways may play a major role in predisposing to complex ge   netic disorders, where multiple genes may contribute to susceptibility.  Thus, there is a pressing need to develop more sophisticated mining  techniques to identify biologically meaningful signals in data gener   ated by GWAS. Molecular pathways  or systems based approaches  to mining complex GWAS are currently gaining prominence. Here we  describe a novel SNP ratio test (SRT) that compares the observed  to expected ratios of significant to non significant SNPs within versus  outside of pathways using GWAS data. In a recent GWAS we reported  evidence that possibly thousands of common genetic variants of small  effect contribute substantially to variance in both schizophrenia and  bipolar disorder susceptibility. We now report a two stage molecular  pathways analysis testing 212 experimentally validated molecular  pathways using discovery (International Schizophrenia Consortium  (ISC); n,6,909) and validation (Genetic Association Information Net   work (GAIN); n,2,729)) schizophrenia case control samples.

For many  markers, genotypes cannot be imputed with complete certainty, and  the uncertainty needs to be taken into account when testing for asso   ciation with a given phenotype. In this paper we compare the statisti   cal properties of currently available methods for testing association  between uncertain genotypes and quantitative traits. We propose a  new method that has superior performance, compared to previously  available methods. Our new method is based on exact maximization  of the likelihood function, and use a mixture model to accommodate  non normal trait distributions. Unlike some previously described meth   ods, the proposed new method controls the false positive rate, without  requiring ad hoc filtering rules, and harsh transformations of the trait  under study. Furthermore, our in silico analysis showed that the new  method can increase power to detect associations when the trait is  non normally distributed. Its computation time is around one CPU day  for a genome wide scan, with 2.5M SNPs and 5,000 individuals, which  is comparable to previously proposed methods. Finally, in a case study  of three lipid phenotypes, we demonstrate that the superior statistical  properties of the new method lead to an improved selection of SNPs  that successfully replicate in independent samples.",2009

XPV results from mutations of the  POLH gene that encodes a DNA translesion polymerase. In this work,  we tested the hypothesis that POLH variants could be associated with  melanoma risk. Patients and methods: A common non synonymous POLH variant,  c.1783A>G p.M595V, was genotyped in 1075 melanoma patients and  1091 ethnic matched controls from France. In addition, we searched  for rare POLH variants by sequencing the entire coding sequence in  201 patients having a familial history of melanoma (n, 123), sporadic  multiple melanomas (n, 65) and a melanoma associated with a skin  carcinoma (n, 13). Results: Overall, the c.1783G, p.595V allele was statistically associ   ated with melanoma (respective allelic frequencies, 0.040 versus  0.022, P value,1.17x10 3, OR,1.86 [1.27 2.71]), which was further  confirmed by a meta analysis including 274 patients and 174 matched  controls from Italy (P value ,7.7x10 4, OR ,1.84 [1.29  2.63]). Inter   estingly, three non synonymous POLH variants were identified in 3 pa   tients (c.295G>A p.V99M, c.815T>C p.I272T and c.1745C>T p.S582L)  that were absent in 352 chromosome controls from healthy subjects. Conclusion: Our data strongly suggest that POLH variants could act  as low penetrance melanoma predisposing alleles. Hence, in addition  to pigmentation genes, polymorphism of other genes implicated in UV  response is associated with predisposition to melanoma. Replication  studies in other populations are awaited to precise these data.",2009

All genomic lesions were validated with multiplex ligation dependent  probe amplification (MLPA). In four cases we were able to establish  that the aberrations were inherited from one of the parents. Two of the  genomic lesions were deletions affecting a microRNA gene, illustrating  that constitutional defects in these gene expression regulators might  be common. Interestingly, at least two of the identified genes could be  linked to pathways involved in CRC development.

","p53 helps to maintain genomic integrity, regulates the cell stress re   sponse, and controls human cancer development and progression.  Approximately half of all human malignancies carry mutant p53, and  many tumours containing wild type p53 have abnormalities in p53  regulators. By using a microarray based approach we found that p53 significantly  induces the expression of TRIM8, a gene belonging to the Tripartite  Motif (TRIM) protein family involved in various cellular functions such  as cell proliferation and differentiation. Bionformatic analysis, ChIP and  luciferase assays revealed that TRIM8 regulation is modulated by four  p53 responsive elements located in the first intron of TRIM8 gene. Importantly, we showed that TRIM8 interacts with and increases the  p53 protein stability and it affects p53 transcriptional activation of p21  in mammalian cell lines. TRIM8 is located within the 10q24.3, a region mostly involved in de   letions and rearrangements in brain cancer. By QPCR we showed  that the relative expression of TRIM8 is strongly underexpressed in a  number of human glioblastomas. MTT cell proliferation and colony for   mation assays showed that the overexpression of TRIM8 inhibits cell  proliferation. Consistently, siRNA mediated TRIM8 silencing in mouse  neural progenitor cell cultures increases the normal cell cycle progres   sion suggesting that TRIM8 might be involved in a tumour suppression  mechanism. Together these observations suggest the existence of a new p53  TRIM8 feedback loop mechanism and support the hypotheses that  TRIM8 might participate to the development of glioblastomas through  yet unknown molecular mechanisms that involve p53.",2009

SNPs were  called with the MAQ software. Additional filters were applied to exclude  known and possible sequencing artefacts. We generated 20.4 and 15.6 million 32 bp paired end reads of the  CN AML and remission sample, respectively, which mapped to exons  of UCSC genes. 8.9% of reads for the AML and 5.0% reads of the re   mission sample mapped to intergenic regions.

Accumulating evidence suggests  that the correct segregation of chromosomes is achieved by events oc   curring in prophase during meiosis I. These include a synapsis between  homologous chromosomes, cohesion between sister chromosomes,  and meiotic recombination. In our current study, we demonstrate that  mutations in SYCP3, a gene encoding an essential component of the  synaptonemal complex that is central to the interaction of homologous  chromosomes, contributes to recurrent pregnancy loss. Two out of 26  women with recurrent pregnancy loss of unknown cause were found  to carry independent heterozygous nucleotide alterations in this gene,  neither of which was present among a group of 150 control fertile wom   en. Analysis of transcripts from mini genes harboring each of these two  mutations revealed that both affected normal splicing possibly result   ing in the production of a C terminally mutated proteins. The mutant  proteins were found to interact with their wild type counterpart in vitro  and inhibit the normal fiber formation of the SYCP3 protein when co  expressed in a heterologous system. These data suggest that these  mutations are likely to generate an aberrant synaptonemal complex in  a dominant negative manner and contribute to abnormal chromosomal  behavior that may lead to recurrent miscarriage. Combined with the  fact that similar mutations have been previously identified in two males  with azoospermia, our current data suggest that sexual dimorphism in  response to meiotic disruption occurs even in humans.",2009

The cause of these dis   orders is most often a disruption of the genetic programs that regulate  development of testes or ovaries. Although a number of genes have  been identified in these developmental pathways, in many cases of  DSD the causative mutations cannot be identified. We have used the Affymetrix 6.0 whole genome SNP array to perform  whole genome copy number analysis on genomic DNA from 33 individ   uals with gonadal dysgenesis. Rearrangements affecting known sex  determination genes were a duplication of the X chromosome includ   ing DAX1 in a 46,XY female, as well as a 1.2 Mb deletion upstream of  the SOX9 locus that caused sex reversal without campomelic dyspla   sia in a 46,XY female. Several other potentially causative rearrange   ments were identified, including a duplication of the SOX3 gene in a  46,XX male and a 50 kb deletion immediately downstream of GATA4  in a 46,XY female. Both of these genes have been suggested to play  a role in gonadal development in animal models without previous sup   porting evidence in humans. These findings will stimulate molecular analysis of a number of genes  in gonadal determination and differentiation, and support the hypoth   esis that mutations affecting the regulation of known genes are re   sponsible for a significant number of DSD cases.c07.3 Afamin deficiency in mice leads to reversible infertility G.

Previous work from our group has established the vitamin E binding  property of afamin, a member of the albumin gene family. Afamin is  expressed primarily in liver and kidney and secreted into the plasma.  Significant amounts were detected also in follicle and seminal fluid  suggesting possible roles for afamin in vitamin E transport in these  body fluids with potential significance for fertility. In order to investigate the physiological role of afamin in detail, afamin  overexpressing transgenic and gene knock out mice were created and  characterised. Transgenic animals were phenotypically without patho   logical findings. A detailed histological analysis of their testes revealed,  however, a significantly higher density of testis tubules. Chimeric (par   tial afamin knockout) mice had undetectable afamin blood levels and  were completely infertile so that homozygous afamin knockout mice  could not be bred. Histological characterisation of male chimeric ani   mals indicated impaired/dysfunctional spermiogenesis resembling the  human Sertoli Cell Only phenotype, female animals were histologi   cally free of pathological findings. Supplementation with recombinantly  produced murine afamin by a constant diffusion pump device led to  restoration of normal testes size, histology, spermiogenesis and fertil   ity. Taken together, afamin is described here as a novel gene which plays  a key role in fertility. The findings from successfully treating infertile  mice with exogenous afamin suggest a therapeutic potential for treat   ing human fertility with afamin.",2009

The m.3243A>G, a cause of MELAS  syndrome (Mitochondrial myopathy, Encephalopathy, Lactic Acidosis  and Stroke like episodes), and the m.8993T>G responsible for NARP  (Neurogenic weakness, Ataxia, Retinitis Pigmentosa) or Leigh syn   drome, were quantified in 21 preimplantation embryos (3 NARP and  18 MELAS) and 19 fetuses (9 MELAS et 10 NARP) from heteroplas   mic females. While the mutant load pattern depended on the type of  mtDNA mutation, it was however stable in various blastomeres from a  given embryo and in various tissues from a given fetus. No temporal  variation of heteroplasmy was found in 8 heteroplasmic fetuses who  had at least two samples at different stages of development. Eight children, carrying less than 30% mutant load in the prenatal peri   od, were born and are healthy at 18 months to 9 years of age. Prenatal  heteroplasmy less than 30% is therefore predictive of a good postnatal  prognosis, even though longer clinical follow up is required. PGD, by  giving the opportunity to select embryos with low mutant loads, consti   tutes a valuable alternative to PND.Concurrent Sessions",2009
Prenatal oligo based arraycGH with custom made focused  design: first experiences,C07.5,"A. Lott, M. Kuhn, H. Gabriel , M. Gencik","ZMG Osnabrueck, Osnabrueck, Germany","ArrayCGH is a well implemented diagnostic tool for the detection of  submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances. Postnatal array CGH is  routinely performed in our lab using whole genome oligonucleotide ar   rays (Agilent). Sometimes, if imbalances with uncertain clinical signifi   cance are detected, the interpretation of the results is challenging. This  is particularly crucial in a prenatal setting. To minimize such difficulties,  we decided to design our own focused oligonucleotide microarray us   ing Agilents eArray tool. Our array design is based on the 44k format  (more than 40.000 oligonucleotides) and restricted on the dense cov   erage of about 130 microdeletion/duplication syndromes and subtelo   meric regions combined with a 1Mb whole genome spacing. In our ongoing process of validation we found very good concor   dance of the arrayCGH results with our focused design compared to  the whole genome design. First we used DNA samples derived from  blood of patients with known aberrations and normal male and female  controls. But the interest in prenatal testing of fetuses with abnormal  ultrasound findings is increasing and therefore we successfully tested  the DNA from fetal samples like chorion villi and cultured amniocytes.  If there is no time for culturing, uncultured amniocytes is a challenging  material for use in arrayCGH, since the number of cells in amniotic  fluid in early pregnancies is low. Different methods for DNA isolation,  whole genome amplification and fluorescence labelling were tested to  optimize arrayCGH quality. Summarized, our results are encouraging to go on with implementing  this focused array design in our lab for pre  and postnatal arrayCGH  diagnostics.",2009

Before 2007 only women of 36 years and  older were offered prenatal screening. According to new legislation,  this was extended to all women, regardless of maternal age. Screen   ing includes maternal blood markers and fetal nuchal translucency  measurement. We sought to study the effect of the new policy on the  outcome of invasive prenatal diagnosis by chorionic villus sampling  and amniocentesis. Therefore we collected the outcome of conven   tional karyotyping of all invasive procedures (n,9931) performed be   tween January 2000 and December 2008 in the Universitary Medical  Center Utrecht (UMCU). Data were extracted from the cytogenetic  database. A trend analysis was made of the number  and type of in   vasive procedures, indications and percentage and type of abnormal  karyotypes. Results show that the contribution of women younger than  36 years rose significantly, from 19,3 % in the years before the new  policy, to 25,3% after 2007. For women younger than 36 years, the  percentage of abnormal karyotypes also increased significantly from  13% to 19%. The percentage of abnormal karyotypes for all maternal  ages increased from 6,5% to 8,8%, mainly due to the increased use of  high performing indications, such as âabnormal first trimester screen   ingâ and âsonography findingsâ, as opposed to âadvanced maternal ageâ  alone as indication for the invasive diagnostics. This rise was mainly  due to the increased detection of autosomal trisomies.

It is a complex genetic  disorder although 95% of the patients carry the risk heterodimer HLA  DQ2. Genome wide association studies on CD have identified nine  non HLA loci that also contribute to CD risk, most of which are shared  with other immune related diseases. Our aim is to predict the genetic  risk for CD using HLA and non HLA risk alleles. Methods: We selected ten independent polymorphisms in 2308 cases  and 4585 controls from Dutch, UK, and Irish populations and catego   rized the individuals into three risk groups, based on their HLA DQ2  genotype. We used the summed number of non HLA risk alleles per  individual to analyze their cumulative effect on CD risk, adjusting for  sex and population group in logistic regression analysis. We validated  our findings in 436 Italian cases and 532 controls. Findings: CD cases carried more non HLA risk alleles than controls:  individuals carrying 13 or more risk alleles had a higher CD risk (OR  , 6Â·2; 95% CI 4Â·1 9Â·3) compared to those carrying zero to five risk  alleles. Combining HLA and non HLA risk genotypes in one model in   creases sensitivity by 6.2% compared to using only HLA for identifica   tion of high risk individuals with slight decrease in specificity .

Meiotic recombination increases haplotype diversity and thus pro   foundly affects evolution. High resolution analysis of de novo  recom   bination events in human sperm DNA has revealed clustering into  very narrow hotspots that generally coincide with abrupt breakdown of  linkage disequilibrium. Using population genetics approaches applied  to whole genome diversity surveys such as the International HapMap  project, sites of historical recombination activity have been inferred.  Around 40% of ~30000 hotspots so identified contain a 13 bp motif  CCNCCNTNNCCNC which appears to be involved in hotspot specifi   cation and which may also drive some modes of genome instability. To  test the effect of the motif on crossover frequencies and distributions,  candidate hotspots with the motif at their centre and which carry a mo   tif disrupting SNP are being studied. The first hotspot to be analysed  in sperm showed extreme biased gene conversion accompanying  crossover in men heterozygous at the disrupting SNP. The bias was  in favour of the motif disrupting allele, consistent with suppression of  crossover initiation on chromosomes carrying this allele. This provides  direct evidence for the importance of this motif in crossover initiation,  and helps shed light on hotspot polymorphism and turnover in human  populations.",2009

","Genetic isolates are valuable for identifying genetic variations underly   ing complex traits. However, prior knowledge of the genetic structure  of the isolate is fundamental for carrying out genome wide associa   tion studies (GWAS) in these populations. The Sardinian population is  currently the target of GWAS because of its ancient origin and long  standing isolation. To perform GWAS in Sardinia, we aim to character   ize a subpopulation from the archaic area of Central Eastern Sardinia  at the genomic level. We used sex specific markers (Y chromosome  and mtDNA) to assess the heterogeneity of the founder lineages and  the divergence from other populations. In addition, we used a dense  set of autosomal markers (SNP 5.0 array, Affymetrix) to investigate  genome wide Linkage Disequilibrium, to construct a Copy Number  Variation map and to estimate pair wise kinship and inbreeding.We  first determined Y chromosome lineages in 256 unrelated Sardinians  using biallelic and microsatellite markers. Our analysis showed that  the frequency of the major Y haplogroups clearly sets this population  apart from other European haplogroups. The analysis of microsatellite  markers revealed a high degree of gene diversity. Pairwise kinship  and inbreeding were estimated in 113 subjects using 77709 autosomal  SNP markers. We found that 16% of the subject pairs shared identi   cal by descent alleles more often than expected by chance. Further   more, 60% of the subjects had low inbreeding coefficient values.

To identify genetic variants for T2DM  in Han Chinese that accounts for 98% of the Taiwan population, we  conducted a two stage genome wide association study with a total of 1715 cases and 2000 random controls. Genotyping was started with  517,401 SNPs that pass quality control filters using the Illumina Hap   550duov3 chip and then validated and replicated in a cross plateform  sequenom. All patients were diagnosed using the American Diabetic  Association Criteri and recruited from the China Medical University  Hospital, Taiwan. Random controls were selected from the Taiwan  Han Chinese Blood and Cell Bank, Academia Sinica, Taiwan. We ex   cluded SNPs from further analyses by three major criterions: (1) miss   ing data rate>5%, (2) missing data rate>1% for SNPs with a minor al   lele frequency < 5%, and (3) p value of Hardy Weinberg Disequilibrium  test <10 7. We identified one previously unknown signal with significant  evidence (p < 10 7) for association with T2DM. Four SNPs/loci showed  positive association (10 7 < p < 10 5), including the KCNQ1 previously  reported in Japanese population. In addition to confirming the known  association with KCNQ1, we have identified four novel loci associated  with T2DM in Han Chinese population.

Out of these, subcuta   neous fat biopsies were obtained from 54 individuals, and their global  expression profiles were analyzed using Affymetrix microarrays. Two best HDL associating SNPs were located at CETP, as in previous  studies. However, the 3rd and 10th best hits (rs7766109, p,10 5 and  rs4959377, p,3.45x10 5) were located within F13A1, a coagulation  factor with no previously reported associations with lipids. After testing  54 additional SNPs within F13A1 region, we detected associations for  10 of them, all of them located within introns 3 5. The associations  of F13A1 introns 3 5 for HDL were replicated in a normally distrib   uted Health2000 population sample (n,890).

The heritabil   ity of age at natural menopause is estimated to be ~60%, suggesting a  strong genetic component. While few candidate gene polymorphisms  are associated with age at menopause, the genetic risk factors are  largely unknown. We conducted a meta analysis of genome wide association studies  with >2,500,000 SNPs for age at natural menopause in 10,399 post  menopausal Caucasian women from 9 population based cohorts.  We identified 20 SNPs on chromosome 19q13.4 and chromosome  20p12.3 that reached genome wide significance (p value < 5*10 8).  The chromosome 19 SNPs are located on the same locus in BRSK1  and LOC284417, the most significant SNP is associated with 0.47  year earlier menopause per allele copy (SE: 0.05, p value 1.9*10 18).  BRSK1 is a brain specific serine threonine kinase, for which no link  with menopause could be established. The top hit on chromosome  20 is located in MCM8, and is associated with an 0.89 year earlier  menopause per copy of the minor allele (SE: 0.11, p value: 2.2*10 15).  MCM8 is expressed in mouse ovaries and is involved in DNA replica   tion. No other loci reached genome wide significance.

We show  that cell stress upregulates FOXL2 expression in an ovarian granu   losa cell model. Increased FOXL2 transcription might be mediated at  least partly by self activation. Using 2D western blot, we show that the  response of FOXL2 to stress correlates with a dramatic remodeling of  its post translational modification profile. Upon oxidative stress, we ob   serve an increased recruitment of FOXL2 to several stress response  promoters, notably that of the mitochondrial Superoxide Dismutase   (MnSOD ). Using several luciferase reporter systems, we show that  FOXL2 transactivation is markedly enhanced in this context. Models  predict that gene upregulation in response to a signal should even   tually be counterbalanced to restore the initial steady state. In line Concurrent Sessions with this, we found that FOXL2 activity was repressed by the SIRT1  deacetylase. Interestingly, we demonstrate that SIRT1 transcription  is, in turn, directly upregulated by FOXL2, which closes a negative  feedback loop. The regulatory relationship between FOXL2 and SIRT1  prompted us the test action of nicotinamide, an inhibitor of sirtuins,  on FoxL2 expression/activity. According to our expectations, nicotin   amide treatment increases FoxL2 transcription. Finally, we show that  11 disease causing mutations in the ORF of FOXL2  induce aberrant  regulation of FOXL2 and/or regulation of the FOXL2 stress response  target gene MnSOD . Taken together, our results establish that FOXL2  is an actor of the stress response, and provide new insights into the  pathogenic consequences of FOXL2  mutations.",2009

Members of this family directly re   verse alkylated DNA and RNA damages by oxidative demethylation  and the R316 residue play a crucial role by mediating 2OG coordina   tion. While the mutation does not alter the nuclear localisation of the  protein, western blotting experiments showed a significantly reduced  amount of FTO protein in patient fibroblasts as compared to controls.  More importantly, in vitro  assays demonstrated that the R316Q FTO  mutant protein had a markedly reduced activity, likely due to the in   ability of the mutant protein to interact with the 2OG co substrate.

In a genome wide gene expression study of congenital mal   formed human hearts we identified DPF3 as significantly up regulated  in hypertrophic right ventricular myocardium of patients with Tetralogy  of Fallot.

DPF3 is associated with the BAF chromatin remod   eling complex and binds methylated and acetylated lysine residues of  histone 3 and 4. During development Dpf3 is expressed in the heart  and somites of mouse, chicken and zebrafish. Morpholino knockdown  of dpf3 in zebrafish leads to incomplete cardiac looping and severely  reduced ventricular contractility with disassembled muscular fibers.

DPF3 potentially represents the missing link to explain the high impact  of the histone modification status on the recruitment of the BAF com   plex to chromatin target sites and its consequence for cardiac function.  The knowledge of the molecular function of Dpf3 contributes to our  understanding of cardiac hypertrophy in patients and might provide the  basis of future therapeutic options in heart failure.",2009

","Alpha synuclein has been implicated in the pathogenesis of many  neurodegenerative disorders, including Parkinsonâs disease (PD). PD  is based on progressive neuropathological alterations leading to mo   tor abnormalities that are frequently predated by olfactory dysfunction Concurrent Sessions and then cognitive decline in later disease stages. Whether the neu   rodegenerative process might be halted or even reversed is presently  unknown. We therefore generated conditional mouse models by us   ing the tet regulatable system. Mice expressing high levels of human  wildtype alpha synuclein in several brain regions developed nigral and  hippocampal neuropathology, including reduced neurogenesis and  neurodegeneration, leading to progressive motor decline and impaired  long term memory. Turning off transgene expression in aged mice halt   ed progression of motor symptoms but did not reverse the symptoms.  Mice expressing the mutated (A30P) alpha synuclein limited to the  olfactory bulb showed a reduction of monoamines in this region. In a  conducted TMT smell test these mice also revealed an impaired anxi   ety reaction and an increased exploratory behavior; the latter might  be a depressive core symptom. These data suggest that approaches  targeting Ã¡ syn induced pathological pathways might be of benefit only  in early disease stages. We further generated mice with permanent  expression of the synphilin 1 transgene. We found ubiquitin positive  inclusions in cerebellar Bergman Glia and dark cell degeneration of  Purkinje cells. At the behavioral level mice showed impairment of mo   tor performance and motor skill learning. This data suggest a negative  impact of overexpressed synphilin 1 in transgenic mouse brain.",2009
Rescue of a Lethal murine model of methylmalonic Acidemia using rAAV8 mediated Gene therapy  One Year Post t reatment,C12.3,"R. J. Chandler , C. P. Venditti","National Human Genome Research Institute, National Institutes of Health,  Bethesda, MD, United States","Methylmalonic acidemia (MMA) is a genetic disorder caused by de   ficient activity of methylmalonyl CoA mutase (MUT). MMA patients  exhibit increased methylmalonic acid levels in the plasma and urine  and exhibit a clinical phenotype of lethal metabolic decompensation,  growth retardation, renal failure and metabolic strokes. A recombinant  adeno associated virus (AAV) serotype 8 carrying the murine Mut  cDNA (rAAV8 m Mut) was injected directly into the liver of newborn  Mut /  mice. Greater than 95% of the 27 Mut /  mice injected with 1 or  2x1011GC of rAAV8 m Mut have survived for 1 year or longer and are  indistinguishable from their control littermates. All the untreated mu   tants (n,58) perished before day of life 72. Subsequently, a smaller  group of Mut /  mice (n,4) received an intraperitoneal (IP) injection of  3x1011GC of rAAV8 m Mut, with 75% of the mice rescued for longer  than 120 days. Hepatic Mut RNA levels decreased from 37 72% at  90 days post injection to 10 15% at one year post treatment. Plasma  methylmalonic acid levels in the treated mutant mice were significantly  reduced at 24 and 60 days after treatment and remained stable one  year post treatment, indicating that substantial MUT enzymatic activ   ity was restored and maintained. Whole body MUT enzymatic activity,  indirectly measured by in vivo  conversion of 1 13C sodium propionate  into 13CO2, was readily detected in Mut /  mice one year post treatment.  These experiments provide the first evidence that gene therapy has  clinical utility in the long term and acute treatment for methylmalonic  acidemia and provide proof of principle evidence to support the devel   opment of gene therapy for other organic acidemias.",2009

Trans  splicing gene therapy in autosomal dominant skin disease,C12.5,"V. Wally , U. Koller, H. Hintner, J. W. Bauer","Division of Molecular Dermatology and eb house Austria, Salzburg, Austria","Mutations in the KRT14 gene underly different types of the blistering  skin disease Epidermolysis bullosa simplex (EBS). This form of EB is  usually inherited in an autosomal dominant way, rendering it challenge  for gene therapy, since the expression of wild type cDNA does not  remove the dominant negative keratin aggregates. We chose âSpliceosome Mediated RNA Trans  Splicingâ (SMaRT) to  repair the heterozygous KRT14 missense mutation R125P. By replac   ing a specific gene portion by trans  splicing of a pre  trans  splicing mol   ecule (PTM) to a target pre mRNA, functionality of the target protein  is restored and the amount of negatively interfering dominant gene  product is reduced. Besides the wildtype gene portion to be replaced and essential splicing  features, the PTM incorporates a binding domain (BD), which is crucial  for the trans  splicing specificity and efficiency. We developed a screen   ing method to identify best BDs for a PTM which specifically replaces  KRT14 exons 1 to 7. It is based on fluorescent molecules which render  successful trans  splicing events discriminable. A PTM library including random binding domains specific for KRT14  exon/intron7 was produced. Transfection of the library with a target  molecule results in fluorescence of trans  spliced molecules, visible  in the fluorescence microscope and detectable by FACS analysis.  Functional PTMs were isolated and tested for trans  splicing efficiency  and specificity. Best PTMs were adapted for endogenous trans  splic   ing and transfected to a EBS keratinocytes cell line, showing specific  trans  splicing into exon 8 of the endogenous KRT14.

Despite lifelong physiological therapy and antibiotics, lungs  of affected patients are progressively destroyed leading to respiratory  insufficiency. Recessive mutations in Dynein Axonemal Intermediate  chain type 1  (DNAI1 ) gene have been described in 10% of cases of  Primary Ciliary Dyskinesia. Objective: Our goal was to restore normal ciliary beating in DNAI1 de   ficient human airway epithelial cells. Methods: A lentiviral vector based on Simian Immunodeficiency Virus  pseudotyped with Vesicular Stomatitis Virus Glycoprotein was used  to transduce cultured human airway epithelial cells with a cDNA of  DNAI1  driven by the Elongation Factor 1 promoter. Transcription and  translation of the transduced gene were tested by RT PCR and west   ern blot, respectively.

With ge   nome wide haplotype sharing analysis we identified an IVF locus on  chromosome 7q36. This locus harbors the DPP6 gene and was found  in 10 distantly related families with IVF and unexplained sudden car   diac death (SCD). Methods: We studied echocardiograms, MRIs, ECG characteristics at  baseline, exercise and at ajmaline/flecainide provocation, and event  free survival. Results: We identified 254 relatives, 117 carriers (mean age 43Â±20  years, 56% males) and 137 noncarriers (mean age 40Â±21 years,  44% males). Echocardiography (n,33) and MRI (n,43) did not re   veal significant or consistent abnormalities. Baseline and exercise  ECG characteristics were not different between groups and provoca   tion with ajmaline/flecainide was negative in six resuscitated carriers.  SCD/IVF had occurred in 37 carriers (32%, median age 34 years).  Kaplan Meier curves showed severely decreased survival for carriers  with only 50% event free at 60 years of age. Male carriers seemed to  be more severely affected with 50% event free survival at 48 years of  age (p,0.004). At present, an implantable defibrillator seems the only  treatment option in carriers. Conclusions: We identified a novel IVF locus on chromosome 7q36  which harbors the DPP6 gene. The associated phenotype is extremely  malignant and presents as premature IVF/SCD. Genetic testing for  the responsible haplotype is currently the only risk marker in these  patients. This raises the unique possibility to assess the risk status  of, and treat accordingly, presymptomatic individuals with a potentially  fatal disease that does not express otherwise.",2009

In  these cases, molecular autopsy and cardiological and genetic exami   nation in surviving first degree relatives might unmask its cause, espe   cially primary arrhythmia syndromes. We sought to determine the yield  of family screening in a large series of young SUD victims. Methods: At the cardiogenetics department of our university hospital,  we studied all consecutive families who presented with â¥1 first de   gree related SUD victim aged 1 50 years. Autopsy was not performed  (53.8%) or did not reveal a cause of death. The initial examination of  the relatives consisted of personal and family medical history and a  resting ECG. Cardiac autopsy was revised if possible. Additional car   diological examinations were performed on indication. Genetic anal   ysis of the associated candidate gene(s) was performed in material  obtained from the deceased person or in those relatives with clinical  abnormalities.  Results: The families of 115 SUD victims (mean age at death 29.1 years, 67.8% male) were examined. Per family, a mean of 2.5 (1 8)  first degree relatives were examined (N,242). A (probable) diagnosis  was made in 36 of the families (31.3%). Catecholaminergic polymor   phic ventricular tachycardia (N,8) and long QT syndrome (N,7) were  the most common diagnoses. Conclusions: By screening family members of a young SUD victim an  inherited heart disease is identified in approximately 31% of families.  Family screening at a specialized cardiogenetics department should  be recommended to relatives of SUD victims.",2009

","Hereditary hearing impairment is a genetically heterogeneous disorder.  Identification of the causative deafness genes is a considerable strat   egy to uncover the molecular basis of hearing. Reassessment of three  DFNB63  families which were used in the identification of the DFNB63   locus and two additional Tunisian families helped to narrow the critical  DFNB63  region to a 1.03 Mb interval. This interval has 26 annotated  and predicted genes and sequencing of these genes revealed four  pathogenic mutations in an uncharacterized gene LRRC51, renamed  LRTOMT. LRTOMT has two alternative reading frames and encodes  two different proteins LRTOMT1 and LRTOMT2. LRTOMT2 is a pu   tative methyltransferase. Further characterization showed that in the  primate lineage, LRTOMT  evolved from the fusion of two neighbor   ing ancestral genes. In rodents, there are two separate genes, desig   nated Lrrc51  and Tomt  which together are orthologous to the primate  LRTOMT . RT PCR analysis of human tissues showed that LRTOMT   is widely expressed. RNA in situ  hybridization in mouse revealed the  expression of  Tomt in the cochlear and vestibular sensory cells of the  developing inner ear. Immunolocalization studies of Lrrc51 and Tomt  in the P30 mouse inner ear showed the expression of both genes in vestibular and cochlear hair cells and their supporting cells. Our data  indicates that LRTOMT  is essential for hearing and the identification of  LRTOMT , which encodes a leucine rich protein and a methyltransfer   ase, opens an exciting new field for genetic and physiological studies  of the inner ear and hearing.",2009

We identified 34 different SPRED1 mutations in 43 probands: twenty  seven were pathogenic (including 2 missense mutations) and 7 mis   sense mutations were classified as probably benign. Forty eight per   cent of SPRED1 positive patients fulfilled NIH NF1 diagnostic criteria  based on the presence of >5 CALM +/  freckling or a NF1 compatible  family history. We estimate that 1.2 2.9% of individuals with the clinical  diagnosis of NF1 have NFLS. A high SPRED1 mutation detection rate was found in NF1 mutation  negative families with an autosomal dominant phenotype with CALM  +/  freckling and no other NF1 features. The NF1 diagnostic criteria  are not specific, since 48% of patients with NFLS fulfilled these criteria.

Mutations in two different genes can be responsible  for NBIA: PANK2  gene and PLA2G6  gene. A third gene was discov   ered recently by our laboratory. From the clinical point of view all NBIA  patients share common symptoms. Nevertheless we suppose these  patients can be distinguished in three clinical subgroups. Because of  small patient numbers analysis of clinical symptoms is difficult. Methods: We present a structured clinical evaluation of a large collec   tion of NBIA patients characterized by one clinician (n,49). A mutation  analysis of the PANK2 gene  has been done in all patients. Patients Concurrent Sessions being negative for PANK2  mutations have been analysed on PLA2G6   gene and furthermore on the recently detected gene. Results: In 27 out of 49 patients homozygous or compound hetero   zygous mutations were identified in PANK2  (55%). No PLA2G6  mu  tations were found. Mutations in the new gene were detected in 16  patients (33%). The âeye of the tigerâ sign in MRI was found in the  majority of patients with PANK2  mutations (24 out of 27) but rarely  in the remaining patients. Furthermore patients with PANK2 mutation,  with mutations in the new gene and idiopathic NBIA patients can be  distinguished by several clinical features: age of onset, generalized  dystonia as presenting symptom, course of disease, oromandibular  dystonia, optic atrophy and psychiatric symptoms. Conclusion: Clinical symptoms and MRI together allow us to distin   guish NBIA patients in a first step.",2009

Through EUROGLYCANET, we have access  to a collection of 50 unsolved CDG I patients (CDG Ix). An investiga   tion of lipid linked oligosaccharides (LLO) has been performed on all  cases. We report a patient with severe developmental delay, epilepsy  and dysmorphic features, and a type I pattern on transferrin isoelectric  focusing. LLO showed an accumulation of the dol PP GlcNAc2 Man5  structure, and a limited and very unusual accumulation of the dol PP  GlcNAc2 Man3, dol PP GlcNAc2 Man6, dol PP GlcNAc2 Man7 and  dol PP GlcNAc2 Man8 species. This patient was compound heterozygous for 2 mutations in the DPM2  gene: a splice mutation (IVS2 1G>C) and a point mutation (c.68A>G,  p.Y23C). DPM2 is the smallest component of the dolichol phosphate  mannose synthase and is a hydrophobic protein of 84 amino acids. It  seems that DPM2 is involved in the regulation of the DPM synthase  complex by stabilizing DPM3 but also in the regulation of the GPI  GnT (glycosylphosphatidylinositols N acetylglucosaminyltransferase)  . We also identified, among other new cases, 2 new patients with an  RFT1 deficiency, respectively homozygous for the missense mutations  c.454A>G (p.E152K) and c.892G>A (p.K298E). The clinical phenotype  includes severe mental retardation, failure to thrive, hypotonia, epi   lepsy, sensorineural deafness, coagulopathy and feeding problems.  The transmembrane protein RFT1 is suggested to play a crucial role  in the flip flop of the intermediate Man5GlcNAc2 PP dolichol from the  cytosolic to the luminal face of the ER membrane. Flipping of lipids  across biomembranes is not spontaneous and requires specific pro   teins (flippases) that facilitate ATP independent, bi directional flip flop.",2009

We have generated an extensive map of CNV in  wild mice and classical inbred strains. Copy number variable regions  cover a total of ~340 megabases (~11%) of their autosomal genome.  Genome wide expression data from 6 major organs and 4 develop   mental times in six different strains reveal that expression levels of  genes within CNVs positively or negatively correlate with copy number  changes in approximatively 35 and 15% of the cases, respectively. Our experiments also show that CNVs influence the expression of genes  in their vicinity   an effect that extends up to half a megabase. These  controls over expression are effective throughout mouse development,  however some genes appear to be under compensatory loops at spe   cific time point. Interestingly, genes within CNVs show lower expression levels and  more specific spatial expression patterns than genes mapping else   where in the genome. Furthermore, genes expressed in the brain are  significantly underrepresented in CNVs compared to genes with ex   pression in other tissues, suggesting differential selective constraint  on copy number changes of genes expressed in different tissues. Our  study provides initial evidence that CNVs shape tissue transcriptomes  on a global scale and thus represent a significant source for within  species phenotypic variation.",2009

Thus, the maternal and paternal genomes possess distinct epigen   etic marks which distinguish them at imprinted loci. In order to iden   tify novel imprinted genes on chromosome 15, we have profiled DNA  methylation in cases with uniparental disomy of chromosome 15  (UPD15). Methylated DNA was immunoprecipitated using antibodies  for 5 methyl cytidine, and hybridized to high density oligonucleotide  arrays with complete coverage of chromosome 15, generating profiles  of the paternal and maternal methylomes. Comparison of six individu   als with maternal versus paternal UPD15 reveals more than twenty  DMRs on chromosome 15. Putative DMRs were validated by bisulfite  sequencing, confirming the presence of parent of origin specific meth   ylation marks in multiple samples. Many are associated with known  imprinted genes within the Prader Willi/Angelman syndrome region,  such as SNRPN  and MAGEL2 , validating this as a method of detecting  imprinted loci. However, more than half of the novel DMRs identified  are located outside of 15q11 q13, and are associated with genes not  previously thought to be imprinted. These include IGF1R  at 15q26.3,  which plays a fundamental role in growth regulation, and GABRG3 , a  gene which has previously been shown to be abnormally expressed in  autism. Many DMRs occur at CpG islands or overlap conserved non  coding regions, suggesting a role in regulating gene expression. These data provide an imprinting map of chromosome 15, demon   strate that the number of imprinted loci in humans is much higher than  previously thought, and identify novel candidates for human disease.",2009

How   ever, to date, its potential impact on the evolution of higher eukaryotes  has not been widely appreciated. Here we attempted to extend the  concept of transient hypermutability from somatic cells to the germline,  using human disease causing multiple mutations as a model system.  Employing fairly stringent criteria for data inclusion, we have retro   spectively identified numerous potential examples of CSMMs caus   ing human inherited disease that exhibit marked similarities to the  CSMMs reported in other systems. These examples include (i) eight  multiple mutations, each comprising three or more components within  a sequence tract of <100 bp, (ii) three possible instances of âmutation Concurrent Sessions showersâ and (iii) numerous highly informative âhomocoordinateâ muta   tions. Using the proportion of CpG substitution as a crude indicator  of the relative likelihood of transient hypermutability, we also present  evidence to suggest that CSMMs comprising at least one pair of mu   tations separated by <100 bp may constitute signatures of transient  hypermutability in human genes. This analysis not only extends the  generality of the concept of transient hypermutability but also provides  new insights into what may be considered a novel mechanism of muta   genesis underlying human inherited disease. Finally, our findings raise  serious concerns regarding current practices in mutation screening,  which are likely to miss many potentially important secondary muta   tions linked in cis to the putative primary pathological lesion.",2009

We have de   veloped a Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) with over 9500 terms  representing individual phenotypic anomalies and have annotated all  clinical entries in Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man with the terms  of the HPO. Each term in the HPO describes a phenotypic abnormality such as  Atrial septum defect. The HPO itself does not describe individual dis   ease entities but rather the phenotypic abnormalities associated with  them. Clinical entities are annotated to the most specific terms pos   sible. The true path rule applies to the terms of the HPO. That is, if  a disease is annotated to the term Atrial septal defect, then all of the  ancestors of this term, such as Abnormality of the cardiac septa, also  apply. The structure of the HPO therefore allows flexible searches for  disease entities according to phenotypic abnormalities with a broad or  narrow focus. We have used the HPO to identify a phenotypic network that is made  up of dense clusters of shared phenotypic features that show char   acteristic patterns of interconnections between selected areas of the  phenotypic continuum.

To study the effect of balanced chromosomal rearrange   ments on gene expression, we compared the transcriptomes of cell  lines from control and t(11;22)(q23;q11) individuals. This translocation  between chromosomes 11 and 22 is the only recurrent constitutional  non Robertsonian translocation in humans. The number of differen   tially expressed transcripts between the translocated and control co   horts is significantly higher than that observed between control sam   ples alone, suggesting that balanced rearrangements have a greater  effect on gene expression than normal variation. Altered expression  on translocation chromosomes is limited to chromosome 11 mapping  genes. Consistently, we show that the nuclear position of the deriva   tive chromosome 11, but not that of the derivative chromosome 22, is  significantly altered compared to its normal counterpart, suggesting  that expression changes of chromosome 11 genes are potentially due  to their transposition into an anomalous chromatin environment. Our Concurrent Sessions results are consistent with recent studies, which indicate that nuclear  position plays a functional role in regulating the expression of some  genes in mammalian cells. Rearrangements may also have implica   tions on reproductive separation, as we show that reciprocal transloca   tions not only provide partial isolation for speciation, but also result in  significant changes in transcriptional regulation through alteration of  the relative nuclear position of chromosome territories.",2009

Interestingly, the five patients with the 5q14.3  microdeletion showed striking phenotypic similarities, namely severe  mental retardation, poor visual contact, absent speech, stereotyped  behaviour, facial dysmorphic features, epilepsy and/or cerebral malfor   mations. The boundaries and sizes of the deletions were different but  the minimal common deleted region encompassed only the MEF2C   gene. This gene, known to act in brain as a neurogenesis effector  which regulates excitatory synapse number, constitutes an excellent  candidate. We suggest therefore that 5q14.3 microdeletion may rep   resent a novel clinically recognizable condition caused by haploinsuf   ficiency of the MEF2C  gene.",2009

The paucity  of observations might result from the difficulty to detect small rear   rangements on this chromosome that lacks a clear banding pattern.  Using array based comparative genomic hybridization (array CGH)  we identified three distinct but overlapping interstitial 19q13.11 dele   tions, defining a minimal critical region of 2.87 Mb, associated with  a clinically recognizable syndrome. The three patients share several  major features including: pre and postnatal growth retardation with  slender habitus, severe postnatal feeding difficulties, microcephaly,  hypospadias, signs of ectodermal dysplasia and cutis aplasia over  the posterior occiput. Among the deleted genes, the human prolidase (PEPD) gene is of particular interest. It is involved in a rare autoso   mal recessive disorder of the connective tissue. Biochemical assays  showed reduced prolidase activity in our patients. Their dermatologi   cal anomalies, including cutis aplasia of the scalp and thin skin, might  thus be accounted for by PEPD haploinsufficiency. We suggest that  del 19q13.11 represents a novel clinically recognizable microdeletion  syndrome caused by haploinsufficiency of dosage sensitive genes in  the 19q13.11 region. Moreover, as a complement to the specific clini   cal features, prolidase activity in erythrocytes may provide a simple  diagnostic marker for this new genomic disorder.",2009

We explored commu   nity views of population carrier screening for FXS, using a qualitative  approach. Interviews and focus groups were conducted with 188 participants:  healthcare providers (81), relatives of people with FXS (29), and the  community, including pregnant and non pregnant women (78). Overall, participants supported population carrier screening for FXS,  provided it was optional. Some participants did have concerns which  were more focused on issues around screening in general and im   plications that screening has for society rather than about screening  for FXS. Participants felt the ideal time to offer screening was before  pregnancy and that screening should be offered through general prac   titioners clinics; however, some believed prenatal screening is more  practical. Most felt that genetic counsellors should deliver the results  and provide follow up support. There was a sense of general lack of  awareness about FXS, suggesting it is imperative that detailed infor   mation about the condition that people can relate to is provided at both  pre test counselling and when giving a positive result. The results from this first large qualitative study exploring community  views provide support for screening and are a valuable insight into the  wide range of issues involved. These findings will help inform future  development of carrier screening programs.",2009

Predic   tive genetic counselling and testing are performed using adapted Hun   tington guidelines, i.e. psychosocial care and time for reflection are not obligatory and the test result can be disclosed by telephone or mail.  Carriers identified by predictive DNA testing are advised to undergo  regular cardiological follow up to prevent sudden cardiac death. Methods: We evaluated the opinion of 143 predictively tested HCM  mutation carriers on received cardiogenetic care using questionnaires  (response rate 86%). Predictive genetic counselling and DNA testing  were evaluated on four domains: information provision, satisfaction  with counselling, social pressure in DNA testing and regret of DNA  testing. Opinions on cardiological follow up were assessed pertaining  to communication, nervous anticipation, reassurance and general dis   advantages. Results: Genetic counselling was valued positively. Only four carriers  would rather not have known that they were a mutation carrier. A ma   jority received their DNA test result by mail or telephone, and almost  all were satisfied. Only 76% of carriers received regular cardiological  follow up. Those who did, had a positive attitude regarding the cardio   logical visits. General disadvantages of the visits were valued as low,  especially by older carriers, men and carriers with manifest HCM. Conclusions: We conclude that our adapted Huntington guidelines are  well accepted and that cardiogenetic care is generally appreciated by  predictively tested HCM mutation carriers. To better understand the  cause of the substantial portion of carriers not receiving regular cardio   logical follow up, although recommended in international guidelines,  further research is needed.Concurrent Sessions P01.

This validated and internationally accepted  methodology assumes a rich evidence base and has previously been  used to develop guidelines for a range of conditions including cancers  with strong genetic components. However, for rarer diseases, the evi   dence base is very small or non existent, and we have adapted the  process so more emphasis is placed on expert opinion and consen   sus, whilst maintaining systematic rigor and transparency.

Jamaldini,"Genetics Research Center, University of Social Welfare & Rehabilitation Sci   ences, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran","Unexpected advances in medical genetics have provided the genetic  testing tools for a number of genetic disorders which raises complex  ethical, social, legal and religious issues. Iran is an Islamic country with many different ethnic groups, high rate  of consanguinity marriage resulting in high prevalence of recessive  genetic disorders. Bioethical decision making in Islam is done within a framework of val   ues derived from revelations and tradition. A Fatwa (consensus edict),  an authoritative ruling on a point of Islamic law, usually emerges in  Islamic countries, consensus groups will typically include a broad and  diverse representation of Ulema (Islamic jurists) and specialists, make  a final decision about relevant subject. According to a Fatwa in Iran the abortion is allowed after 120 days  if there is a danger to maternal life, regardless of whether the fetus  is normal or abnormal. In this case, termination of pregnancy goes  against religious well being, but it is done for the motherâs physical  health because protection of human life is one of the main principles  of Islam. Several strategic plans for medical ethics activities were performed by  ministry of health and medical education. Many ethical issues still need to be explored, although Islamic prin   ciples provide a moral and ethical basis for prevention and care in  Muslim countries, there is much to learn from how other countries are  challenging to do so within the context of their own moral and religious  because a common rule in religions that is protection of humanity is  the same.",2009
Change or not? Reflection on Eugenic ideas in the History of Human Genetics in Germany and Anglo American countries.,P01.15,H. I. Petermann,"Institute of Ethics, History and Theory of Medicine, Muenster, Germany",Eugenics as a movement of large ambition had the idea of improving  the genetic make up of the human race in history. Since the era of ra   cial hygiene in Third Reich the term has bad odour. In 1951 UNESCO  said that there is one human race. Comparing the discussion about  eugenics in Germany and Anglo American countries there can be  stated: 1. âOld Eugenicsâ before 1945 had social desire that was contrasting  to âNew Eugenicsâ with individual one. Before 1945 the decline of birth  rate in upper class should be stopped. After then it became the wish  for individual enhancement. 2. Eugenic ideas were topic in Germany and Anglo American countries  like in discussion at Londoner CIBA Symposium âMan and his Futureâ  (1962) and following Marburger Workshop âGenetics and Societyâ  (1969) and about those. Despite the past there was no difference in  ideas and utopias. 3. Public policy on human genetics and reproductive medicine is more  restrictive in Germany than in Anglo American Countries. Although  new ideas for perfection of man are discussed there is a big fear to  get on a slippery slope. This influences the discussion about ethical  aspects. 4. Historical experiences are always a strong argument in ethical and  philosophical discussions. Lack of knowledge of the history of eugen   ics leads to arguments that are neither false nor true. 5. More and better information about eugenic history could help to de   velop public policy by preventing mistakes of the past. This may relax research and therapy in human genetics and reproductive medicine.,2009

Patients present with hundreds of colorectal adenomas which inevi   tably develop into carcinomas in the absence of early diagnosis and  treatment using prophylactic colectomy. Childrenâs patients are at 50%  risk of receiving the mutation. Polyps can develop at very early ages.  Usual recommendations are to start endoscopic surveillance from the  early teens. In France, genetic testing of minors in FAP is usually of   fered after 10 years old. It is now well admitted that genetic testing  of minors requires additional counselling considerations and effort to  ensure understanding of the disease and of the gene test in order to  reduce uncertainty and misperceptions. Our experience of genetic testing for these children showed that dis   cussions about the disease were often difficult between parents and  their children. Informations about genetic transmission and risks of the  disease are complex notions to explain to young children. To improve communication within families and to help professionals  dealing with genetic counselling, we created a book dedicated to these  children. A professional drawer illustrated the story of Jeanne, a young  girl, whose father has FAP and who will undergo genetic testing.

Impact of involving the family in the  dynamics of the predictive process remains quite unclear. The present  longitudinal study aims at exploring the relationship between family  and disease in the context of genetic counselling during pre symp   tomatic testing (PST) for two neurodegenerative diseases: Spinocer   ebellar Ataxia Type 2 (SCA2) and Familial Amyloid Polyneuropathy  ATTRV30M (FAP). For one year, we followed 35 subjects that carried  out PST for SCA2 in Cuba and 28 subjects for FAP, in Portugal. It was  shown that the family influences psychological behaviour of subjects  requesting PST, starting from the decision making process down to  the changed indicators of psychological wellbeing of those performing  PST. After diagnosis, family functioning decreases regardless of the  outcome, and the presence of the disease in the mother is associ   ated with a greater disrupting effect of the disease in the family. In the  future, additional short and long term longitudinal studies are essen   tial, not just regarding the way in which the family influences genetic  counselling process in predictive testing, but also on how the latter is  influenced by the process of diagnosis.",2009

As a consequence, morbidity  and mortality due to genetic diseases is invisible in health information  systems. To overcome this difficulty, Orphanet (www.orpha.net) has  established a partnership with WHO to ensure a fair representation of  rare diseases in general. In order to prepare the proposal, Orphanet  has collected all published expert classifications and established a da   tabase of phenotypes indexed with ICD10 codes, MIM codes, genes,  mode of inheritance, age of onset, class of prevalence. Phenotypes  are assigned to as many classification systems as necessary to rep   resent them. The visualisation of the classification systems and of the  place of each disease within the classifications is available on the Or   phanet website. A Topic Advisory Group on rare diseases has been  established to manage the revision process at WHO. The whole com   munity of experts is going to be involved in the validation of the pro   posals prepared by Orphanet during the year to come. Information will  circulate via OrphaNews Europe.

Health behaviour models have  been used to predict responses and explain attitudes about taking up  healthcare. Method: We carried out a systematic review that aimed to evaluate  all current evidence for motivation to participate in genetic testing  and summarize the findings using thematic analysis, grouping results  based on health behaviours. We completed a search of qualitative and  quantitative literature from 1996 to December 2008. Relevant studies  were identified from searches of AMED, EMBASE, MEDLINE, Psy   cINFO and CINAHL databases. 342 relevant articles were retrieved in  abstract form, of which 18 were found to match our inclusion criteria for  review and data extraction. Results: Analysis of the results encompassed multiple motivational fac   tors for willingness to participate in genetic testing. Specific examples  of grouped themes included: â Personal, social and family history as predictive factors to partici   pate. â Perceived self benefit from the development of knowledge and treat   ment of disease. â Perceived social benefit, aiding the understanding of the wider com   munity. â Ability to understand terminology and education in genetic research  as cues to action/participation.

The WHO [2000]  recommended that developing countries implementing medical ge   netic services should produce a âcountry reportâ, in essence a stra   tegic health care plan. The first component of such a plan is a health  care needs assessment (HCNA). In the 1970s industrialised nations  standardised the process of HCNA. The approach was never applied  to medical genetic services. Experience from advising middle income  nations on developing their nascent medical genetic services indicates  they are not undertaking HCNA. A major impediment is the lack of a  documented approach. Objectives:  To develop an evidence based tool for HCNA for medical  genetic services in middle  and low  income nations. Outcome:  CAPABILITY, an EU funded Specific Support Action inves   tigating the transfer of medical genetic knowledge and technology to  developing nations, has formalised a HCNA for medical genetic ser   vices that middle  and low income nations can utilise for their âcountry  reportsâ. Key elements of the HNCA are the development of strategic  aims; an evaluation of existing services and the environment in which  they function; a review of epidemiology, effective interventions, opin   ions of consumers and professionals, available resources and pos   sible constraints. Analysis of these enables the production of a HCNA.  This approach will assist nations with emerging economies to marshal  and allocate their limited resources when developing medical genetic  services. Funded by:  EC Contract no.: FP6 037275",2009

Psychophysical retardation of children  with genetic pathologies, in general, is not so evident in first stages of  their life comparing with healthy children, due to human biological in   born potential. Developmental gap between healthy children and those  affected, progressively and naturally increases later. Correctional strategy of psycho medical genetic counseling of fami   lies for medical psycho behavioral stimulation of children up to three  years old with Down and X fragile Syndromes is based on following.  First, amelioration of childrenâs development by applying in complex of  medical, psychological and pedagogical resources.

towards implementation of non invasive prenatal diagnosis in  the UK National Health service,P01.41,"H. Burton , C. Wright","PHG Foundation, Cambridge, United Kingdom","Emerging technologies that capitalize on the presence of cell free fetal  nucleic acids in the maternal bloodstream have the potential to trans   form prenatal diagnosis and care by allowing non invasive testing from  as early as 7 weeks. This represents a major advance, since diagnosis  currently requires a later, invasive procedure (amniocentesis or chori   onic villus sampling) with an associated miscarriage risk of around 1%.  Many women opt against prenatal testing for this reason, and hun   dreds of healthy fetuses are lost following testing each year in the UK  alone. Technological applications already in active development are  the determination of fetal sex or the diagnosis of specific diseases in  the fetus of women at high risk of inherited disease; the determination  of fetal Rhesus blood group status in Rhesus negative women at high  risk of complications of pregnancy with a Rhesus positive fetus; and  the diagnosis of aneuploidies such as Down Syndrome in the fetus.  The approach may permit diagnosis of a wider range of genetic dis   eases in the future, subject to certain limitations, and ultimately could  also allow improved monitoring for complications of pregnancy such as  pre eclampsia.

Also 38 foreign students, some of  which were also in the groups which received questionnaires about the  practicals, were asked about the quality of 6 from 16 lectures. After analyzing the results one can conclude the necessity of a better  connection between lectures and practicals, the latter having to loose  the mostly theoretical topics, genetics being a proper field for applying  different teaching methods even if students have various biology back   ground knowledge from high school.",2009

These courses have  been developed following a thorough consultation with senior clinical Genetic counseling Genetics education, Genetic services, and Public policy and research scientists to assess training needs. Furthermore, we  have also developed courses in biobanking which are emerging as  important resources for translating knowledge of the human genome  into real benefits for health. Courses launched in 2007 for clinical cytogeneticists and genetic coun   sellors have become well established, receiving excellent appraisal  from both delegate and professional bodies alike. The reputation of  our courses in bioinformatics for cytogeneticists and molecular geneti   cists has led to them being repeatedly over subscribed. More recent  courses in Real Time PCR and biobanking have attracted delegates  from around the world and in 2009 we are launching courses in micro  RNA analysis and array CGH. To date, over 400 genetics professionals have attended our courses.  These are part of a broader training programme at Nowgen that has  attracted over 1,500 delegates in the past 5 years.

It is  ultimately unresponsive to inhaled nitric oxide and ECMO. Definitive  diagnosis requires lung biopsy, and is characterized by a reduction in  number of capillaries, with a decreased blood air interface. The deficit  likely involves the pseudoglandular and canalicular stages of lung de   velopment. Over 100 cases have been reported. The etiology of most cases is unknown, but many familial cases have  been reported. Associated malformations are seen in 50% of patients,  recurrent anomalies involve the cardiovascular, genitourinary and  gastrointestinal systems.

SCA10 is caused by repeat ex   pansion of pentanucleotide ATTCT in the ataxin 10 gene (ATXN10,  603516.0001), candidate region on chromosome 22q13.3, these re   peats form unpaired DNA structure that works as aberrant DNA repli   cation origin and contributes to the repeat instability and cell death, but  how produces a neurodegenerative effect is unknown. The aim of this research is to present the results of the molecular stud   ies in a female patient affected with SCA10. Material and Methods: A female aged 20 years old was studied clini   cally due to SCA10, laboratorial studies were performed with 5mL of  peripheral blood were used to isolate patientâs DNA by GeneCatcher  Kit (invitrogen). The molecular analysis was made by PCR with previ   ous described primers to detect normal alleles, the PCR product was submitted to electrophoresis in 8% polyacrilamide gel.

Results: We obtained a single band that corresponds to 19 ATTCT  repeted normal allele, thus our patient corresponds to an heterozy   gous genotype 19/unknown. Discussion: SCA10 mutation accounts for almost 15% of autosomal  dominant ataxia in Mexicans population and in Brazilians in 1.8%. This  low incidence can be explained probably by the limited molecular stud   ies in our country.",2009

ARS is inherited as an autosomal  dominant trait with high penetrance and has been linked to different  chromosomal loci. Two genes   PITX2 and FOXC1, which both encode  developmental transcription factors and map to chromosomes 4q25  and 6p25, respectively   are the most frequently associated. PITX2  mutations show great variety, from point mutations to microscopic or  submicroscopic deletions, and apparently balanced translocations  in few cases. Microscopic or submicroscopic deletions of PITX2 are  known to result in ARS through haploinsufficiency but only in few cas   es the extent of the deletion was characterized by molecular means.  Quantitative genomic polymerase chain reaction is the method of  choice to analyze patients in which sequencing did not reveal putative  mutations as the resolution limit of FISH or array CGH is too low to  detect mid size deletions. We identified a cytogenetically invisible sub   microscopic deletion at 4q25 in a patient diagnosed with ARS applying  quantitative genomic PCR analysis. Further genotyping of the patient  and her parents with polymorphic microsatellite markers showed that  the maternal allele was not transmitted indicating a de novo deletion  event in the patient. The deletion comprised the entire sequence of the  PITX2 gene but did not include adjacent genes.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology Recent mutation reports indicate that mid size gene deletions might  be a rather frequent cause of ARS.

The etiology of BEEC is unknown but there is  clear indication of genetic factors contributing to this birth defect. p63,  a p53 homolog located at chromosome 3q27 q29, was found to result  in a range of developmental defects of the skin and limbs as well as  bladder exstrophy in knockout p63 /   mice. Furthermore, p63 gain of  function mutations in humans cause genetic syndromes that frequently  present with urogenital anomalies. Although obvious mutations were  not detected, global dysregulation of variable p63 isoforms is apparent  in our results. Our data conclusively implicates p63 in the etiology of  BEEC.

BPES locus  was assigned to 3q23. BPES syndrome Ohdo type is extremely rare.  It is characterized by BPES anomalies and in addition neurological  anomalies, growth retardation, congenital heart disease, abnormal  ears and clynodactily of fifth fingers are noticed. Material and methods: We present a five year and four months old  male infant admitted for abnormal phenotype. The patient underwent a  complete pediatric, ophthalmologic and neurologic evaluation. Results: No similar case was known in the family. Pregnancy was  uncomplicated and the child was born at 38 weeks of gestation with  normal weight and length. In the first year of life seizures are men   tioned. The following facial characteristic features were noticed at clini   cal examination: short eyelids, blepharophimosis, ptosis of the upper  eyelids, epicantus inversus, telecantus, arched eyebrows, flat, broad  nasal bridge, protruding ears. Limbs defects: clynodactily of fifth fin   gers, flatfeet and genu valgum were present. Systolic cardiac murmur,  mild mental retardation and growth delay (15 kg weight, 100 cm height  and 50 cm occipito frontal circumference) were determined. Cardiac  sonography found atrial septal defect. Ocular ultrasound was normal.  MLPA analysis with P036C&P070 kit didnât find major mutations. Conclusions: Childâs phenotype probably represents variable expres   sion of the Ohdo syndrome. Typical clinical features lead to establish   ing the diagnosis and permit the surgical treatment of eyelids altera  tions. The prevention of visual impairment is a very important goal in  this case.",2009

Diagnosis criteria have been re   cently refined and several other features have been described such as  semi circular canals and cranial nerve anomalies. A CHD7  gene muta   tion is found in 60 % of patients with a clinical diagnosis of CHARGE  syndrome. Although frequently found, cardiovascular malformations  (CVM) are not specific. Methods: In our series, 85% of CHARGE patients with CHD7  mutation  have a CVM. We report on  the spectrum of CVM in 65 CHD7  mutated  patients (including 15 fetuses). All patients were precisely assessed for  their cardiac phenotype by echocardiography, CT scan or pathology. Results: Conotruncal malformations (n,16), aortic arch anomalies  (n,10) and atrioventricular septal defects (n,15), were the most fre   quent CVM. A rare association of atrioventricular septal defect and  transposition of the great arteries was described in one patient. De   spite the small number of mutated cases, our data suggest that hypo   morphic mutations (missense, splice sites) are less frequently associ   ated to a heart defect than nonsense and frameshift mutations. Conclusions: Although being  a minor criteria because of lack of speci   ficity, CVM proved to be very frequent in CHD7  mutated CHARGE pa   tients. The neural crest cells origin hypothesis of the CVM cannot ac   count for all observed defects. Cardiac progenitor cells of the second  heart field might be implicated in embryological mechanisms leading  to CVM in CHARGE syndrome.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology",2009

Patients present bilateral, painless, generally symmetrical  swelling of the jaws, caused by the replacement of normal bone with  pseudocystic osteolytic lesions. The disease affects pediatric popula   tion, frequently below five years of age, with slow progression of the  lesions until puberty, followed by their gradual remission in early adult   hood, with rare cases of residual jaw deformity. The diagnosis impli   cates clinical findings, associated with radiographic and histological  manifestations, and is confirmed by the molecular genetic testing of  SH3BP2 gene, located on 4p16.3 and affected by mutations in 80% of  the patients with cherubism. Case presentation: A 9 years old girl presented with mild, bilateral,  progressive, painless and a little asymmetrical enlargement of the  mandible. There were no other clinical findings in physical examination  excepting abnormal teeth implantation on the lower jaw. Radiological  examination revealed bilateral multicystic lesions of the lower jaw and  abnormal teeth implantation. Histological examination demonstrated  the presence of numerous multinucleated acidophilic giant cells ran   domly distributed in a fibrovascular stroma of mononuclear spindle  shaped cells. Family history identified no other members with similar  lesions. Conclusion: Clinical findings and radiographic and histological aspects  of this case plead for the diagnosis of cherubism.

Mutations and  association studies indicate that the homeobox gene MSX1  plays a  role in human clefting. In a Dutch case control triad study (mother,  father, and child), we investigated interactions between MSX1  and the  parentsâ periconceptional lifestyle in relation to the risk of OFC in their  offspring. We studied 181 case  and 132 control mothers, 155 case   and 121 control fathers, and 176 case  and 146 control children, in  which there were 107 case triads and 66 control triads. Univariable  and multivariable logistic regression analyses were applied, and odds  ratios (OR), 95% confidence intervals (CI) were calculated. Allele 4  of the CA marker in the MSX1  gene, consisting of nine CA repeats,  was the most common allele in both the case and control triads. Sig   nificant interactions were observed between allele 4 homozygosity of  the child with maternal smoking (OR 2.7, 95% CI 1.1 6.6) and with  smoking by both parents (OR 4.9, 95% CI 1.4 18.0). Allele 4 homo   zygosity in the mother and smoking showed a risk estimate of OR 3.2  (95% CI 1.1 9.0). If allele 4 homozygous mothers did not take daily  folic acid supplements in the recommended periconceptional period,  this also increased the risk of OFC for their offspring (OR 2.8, 95% CI  1.1 6.7). Our findings show that, in the Dutch population, periconcep   tional smoking by both parents interacts with a specific allelic variant of  MSX1  to significantly increase OFC risk for their offspring.

Cerebro oculo facio skeletal syn   drome (COFS) has been proved to be allelic to CS but a very limited  number of COFS cases have been clarified at the molecular level so  far. We report on a 20 month old female, second child of a healthy and  non consanguineous family. IUGR was evident at 30 wks of gestation.  The patient was born at term. She had severe congenital microceph   aly and developed failure to thrive soon after birth. She had bilateral  microphtalmia and congenital cataract. Clenched fingers and lower  limbs rigidity were observed. Bone X Ray showed mild platyspondyly.  Her neurological development is severely retarded. She has bilateral  neurosensorial deafness. Brain CT scan and MRI were normal at 4  months of age. No retinopathy is present. Extensive metabolic survey  and congenital infections were ruled out. In this context, minor senile  like dysmorphic features and the presence of photosensitivity suggest   ed the diagnosis of CS at the age of 13 months. In accordance with the  clinical picture the studies on skin fibroblasts of the recovery of RNA  synthesis after UV exposure showed a high deficiency and two differ   ent mutations in CSB gene (p.Leu871Pro and p.Lys1172X) were found  in this patient. Very few patients have been described worldwide with  these particular mutations.

","Cohen syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive disorder with variability  in the clinical manifestations. It is characterized by mental retardation,  postnatal microcephaly, facial dysmorphisms, ocular abnormalities,  and intermittent neutropenia. Mutations in the COH1 gene have been  found in patients with Cohen syndrome from different ethnic origins.  In a cohort of 19 patients, we previously identified 11 mutations by the  combined use of DHPLC, sequencing analysis and Real Time PCR  probes covering the entire length of COH1 gene (Katzaki E, 2007  J.Hum.Genet. and unpublished data). The use of an MLPA probemix  for COH1 was crucial in identifying missing mutated alleles and in  defining the extension of the rearrangements. Thus, we were able to  identify the second mutated allele in 2 unrelated patients and in 2 af   fected sisters. We also found 2 intragenic duplications spanning from  exons 4 to 13 and from exons 21 to 29, respectively. This is the first  time that duplications are reported in Cohen syndrome patients. MLPA  was also implemental in defining the extent of 4 deletions already de   tected by Real Time PCR.

Analysis for a range of disorders  including general screening for microdeletions and duplications across  all chromosomes through to specific deletions associated with pheno   types such as Smith Magenis, Cri du Chat and DiGeorge Syndrome  was performed using one or more multiplex probe ligation dependent Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology amplification (MPLA) probe mixes. Thereafter, positive or inclusive re   sults are referred to cytogenetics for confirmation through FISH. To  date, 350 patients have been reported across 17 separate phenotypes  using 9 separate MLPA probe mixes (supplied by MRC Holland). Of  these patients 15 (4%) have been reported with a pathogenic deletion  or duplication associated with DiGeorge Syndrome 22q11 (4), telo   mere / subtelomere (7), Williams Syndrome 7q11.23 (1), Rubinstein  Taybi Syndrome 16p13.3 (1) and Prader Willi (2).

The manifestations in affected individuals may fluctuate  from the neonatal period to adulthood. Disorders of sexual develop   ment arise from chromosomal, genic, gonadal, or anatomic abnormali   ties in the pathway of sexual differentiation, occasionally being associ   ated with other malformations. We report clinical, hormonal and other  parameters, together with the karyotype, FISH and molecular analysis  in three cases born with disorders of sexual development. One case  had facial dysmorphism suggesting an autosomal chromosomal ab   normality. Surprisingly, cytogenetic investigation revealed a 47, XXY  karyotype in all metaphases. Another case had ambivalent external  genitalia and chromosomal investigation showed male genetic sex.  Exploratory laparascopy and histopathological examination revealed  that gonads were exclusively testes. As all the investigations led to  the diagnosis of 46,XY disorder of sexual development, adequate  hormonal and surgical treatment was initiated. The third case was  also born with ambiguous external genitalia, chromosomal analysis  together with FISH and molecular analysis for SRY region revealing  female genetic sex. Clinical and hormonal data led to the diagnosis  of 21 hydroxylase deficiency. Ambiguous genitalia do not occur in all  disorders of sex development, but whenever ambiguity is present, it  needs immediate action, to try to establish the diagnosis and to decide  the best choice for the sex of rearing. A multidisciplinary approach,  with a patient centered model of care, is necessary in order to reach a  prompt and correct diagnosis and treatment.",2009

","Epidermolysis bullosa (EB) is a rare genetic disease characterized by  extremely fragile skin and recurrent skin blistering after mild or none  mechanical trauma. Traditionally, EB is classified in three major cat   egories according to the level of dermoepidermal separation at the  basement membrane (BM) zone: i) epidermolysis bullosa simplex  (EBS); ii) dystrophic epidermolysis bullosa (DEB); and iii) junctional  epidermolysis bullosa (JEB). EB is diagnosed by evaluation of clinical findings, transmission elec   tron microscopy of skin samples, and immunohistochemical mapping  of protein components of dermal epidermal junction zone. Molecular  genetic diagnostics of DEB and EBS was initiated in our laboratory in  2004. Dystrophic EB (EBD) is caused by mutations in the collagen type VII  (COL7A1) gene, which consists of 118 exons. EB simplex (EBS) is  caused by mutations in the keratin 5 (KRT5) gene (9 exons) and the  keratin 14 (KRT14) gene (8 exons). DNA from EB patients and their relatives were screened for mutations  in the COL7A1, KRT5 and KRT14 genes. Analysis was performed us   ing PCR and direct sequencing. We could identify KRT5 or KRT14  dominant mutations in 13 out of 19 EBS families. As regards 27 EBD  probands, we revealed disease causative mutations in 22 patients and  screening of COL7A1 is in progress. Determination of EB at the level of DNA has important implication for  final confirmation of diagnosis, possibility of genetic counselling and  early prenatal diagnosis.

Because previous reports have inconsistently noted the  type and frequency of malformations associated with esophageal atre   sia, we conducted this study in a geographically defined population,  evaluating the birth prevalence of esophageal atresia and associated  malformations ascertained between 1979 and 2003 in 334,262 con   secutive births. Of the 99 patients with esophageal atresia, 46 (46.5%)  had associated malformations. These included patients with chromo   somal abnormalities (8 cases,8.1%); non chromosomal recognized  syndromes including CHARGE syndrome, Fanconi anemia, Fryns syn   drome, and Opitz G/BBB syndrome; associations including VACTERL  (10 patients), and schisis; oculo auriculo vertebral spectrum; malfor   mation complex including sirenomelia, and non syndromic multiple  congenital anomalies (MCA) (21 cases, 21.2%). Malformations of the  cardiovascular system(24.2%), urogenital system (21.2%), digestive  system (21.2%), musculoskeletal system (14.1%), and central nervous  system(7.1%) were the most common other congenital malformations  occurring in patients with esophageal atresia and nonsyndromic MCA.  We observed a striking prevalence of total malformations and specific  patterns of malformations associated with esophageal atresia which  emphasizes the need to evaluate all patients with esophageal atresia  for possible associated malformations.

We report on here the clinical presentation and the molecular studies  in two unrelated girls with sporadic FDH: an 8 month old Algerian girl  (patient 1) and a 6 year old Belgian girl (patient 2). Both had: normal  head circumference at birth and developed progressive microcephaly  with no developmental delay, patchy, hyper pigmented or red atrophic  skin lesion, abnormal extremities with syndactyly, +/  ectrodactyly,  dysplastic nails, sparse and brittle hair with patchy alopecia, iris and  chorioretinal coloboma. Sequencing of the 14 coding exons and the exon intron boundaries of  the longest human splice variant of the PORCN  gene (isoform D; NM_ 203475.1) revealed novel heterozygous mutations in both children.

We present a female to female transmission of a Frasier  intronic mutation affecting splicing of the primary transcript of Wilms  tumour suppressor gene ( WT1 ). The index patient developped an iso   lated proteinuria from the age of 3 years with normal renal function at  age 5. No urogenital involvement and wilmâs tumour were observed  throughout the 2 years follow up. Her karyotype performed at age 5  with informed consent was normal 46,XX. The mother originated from  Belgium had proteinuria at age of 8 years and progressed into end  stage renal disease at age 17. Renal histology showed FSGS.

FS is usually lethal in the neonatal pe   riod and only 11 survivors have been reported. The diagnosis of FS is  based exclusively on clinical findings since no gene or locus has been  identified so far. In contrast, different submicroscopic chromosome  rearrangements were found in subjects mimicking FS, making array  CGH highly recommended. Even though a comprehensive description  of the broad spectrum of FS clinical features has been outlined, no  major mandatory feature has been found.

This is  a disorder characterized by the failure of the prosencephalon to de   velop. Material and Method: We are going to present a new born, male, hospitalized in the Prema   ture and Neonatology Department. Results: The newborn is the sixth birth; 36 weeks gestational age with  birth weight of 2470 g, Apgar score 6 and cranial circumference 39 cm.  Personal history of mother reveals urinary tract infection and dental  abscess in the first trimester of pregnancy, therefore she had antibiotic  treatment. Transfontanelar ultrasound shows complex cerebral malformation with  holoprosencephaly in lobar form, agenesis of corpus calossum and  lateral ventricle dilatation, confirmed also by MRI. The newborn was operated at neurosurgery, initial for hydrocephaly  and it was set a ventriculoperitoneal drain followed by the treatment of  occipital meningoencephalocelle. Conclusions: Lobar holoprosencephaly, a rare disorder, has no specif   ic clinic expressiveness; the diagnosis can be missed in the neonatal  period.

Here we report the clinical and molecular data of 25 fetuses and 15  children with ZIC2 mutations. HPE is mainly isolated and syndromic  in only 5 cases. All three classical types of HPE are described: alobar,  semi lobar and lobar, but syntelencephaly (middle interhemispheric  variant) is also reported twice, anencephaly/cleft face and a minor form  once each. Interestingly, neural tube defects are associated with HPE  in three cases like rachischisis and myelomeningocele. Even in se   vere forms of HPE, normal faces are described in 4 cases, mild facial  anomalies in most of the cases and proboscis in only one case. Molecular studies identified 36 mutations, including 31 different types  of mutations, and 4 deletions of the whole ZIC2 gene.

M. van Lan   gen1","1Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, 2Free University  Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Introduction: Marfan syndrome (MFS) is caused by mutations in the  fibrillin 1( FBN1 ) gene. Recently, mutations in the TGFBR2  gene were  found to cause Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS), MFS and familiar aortic  dissections. Mutations in TGFBR2  are often associated with aggres   sive vascular pathology including arterial tortuosity and early dissec   tions. Case report: We describe a 39 year old male who was diagnosed with  MFS at age 13. At that time, he had a dilated aortic root and character   istic skeletal and facial features. The parents and sister were healthy.  At age 20, he underwent aortic root replacement, followed by surgery  of the complete aorta in the years thereafter. In addition, aneurysms  and dissections of multiple other arteries were found. DNA analysis  of the FBN1  gene  identified a  pathogenic mutation (c.5952T>A). Be   cause of the severe vascular pathology, mutation analysis of TGFBR2   was performed as well revealing a known and probably pathogenic  missense mutation (c.1159G>A). Discussion: This is the first reported patient that carries pathogenic Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology mutations in FBN1  and TGFBR2 . The patient fulfils the clinical crite   ria for MFS, but has extremely severe cardiovascular complications,  worse than observed in patients with TGFBR2  mutations only. Thus,  the molecular findings match the clinical features. In vitro  studies in   vestigating these two mutations and their interactions are pending,  possibly providing a rationale for the choice of future medical treat   ment in this patient. Conclusion: In selected patients with features of MFS as well as fea   tures suggestive of  TGFBR2 mutations, DNA analysis should include  FBN1  and TGFBR2 .",2009

Pathogenic mtDNA  mutations are frequently found in tRNA coding regions of the mitochon   drial genome. The tRNALeu gene is one of the hot spots of the mtDNA.  Many pathogenic mutations have been reported in tRNALys too. Design/Methods: The most common mtDNA mutations were investi   gated in 470 patients, presumably with mitochondrial disease and in  100 controls with PCR RFLP methods in the region of tRNALys and the  intergenic region of COII and tRNALys genes. In patients, whose restric   tion patterns differed from the normal, bidirectional sequencing of this  region was performed. Results: The A8344G mutation was found in 8 cases. In one fam   ily (5 people) heteroplasmic substitutions T8312A and T8313G were Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology0 present. A heteroplasmic A8332G substitution was present in anoth   er family, and a homoplasmic A8347C substitution in 19 cases.

Using rela   tive Real Time PCR, D2L and D2S expression were examined in the  brain regions including striatum, PFC and hippocampus. We found  that morphine treatment leads to a significant increase in D2S level in  the striatum and PFC but has no effect on D2L level in the examined  regions. While administration of LiCl 5mg/kg along with morphine does  not alter D2L and D2S isoforms, LiCl 10 mg/kg treatment results in a  markedly increase in D2S but not D2L expression level in the striatum  and PFC of sensitized mice. The result indicates that morphine sensi   tization leads to an increase in presynaptic D2S receptor expression  level and is affected by lithium in a dose dependent manner with low  dose to inhibit and higher dose to enhance the effect.",2009

","The oral facial digital syndrome type I (OFDI) involves multiple con   genital malformations of the face, oral cavity and digits. It is the most  frequent type of oral facial digital syndrome, characterised by X linked  dominant mode of inheritance with lethality in males. The OFD1  gene  encodes for a centrosomal protein located both in the primary cilium  and in the nucleus, leading to consider the OFDI syndrome as a ciliop   athy. A polycystic kidney disease (PKD) is reported in almost one third  of OFDI patients, but long term outcome of the renal disease has been  essentially described through isolated cases. We report on the renal  manifestations of a cohort of 34 patients with an identified mutation  in the OFD1  gene. Patients are aged of 1 to 68 years. Their median  follow up is of 16.5 years. Among them, 12 (35%) patients presented  with PKD (11/16 (69%) if only adults were considered) with a median  age at discovery of 29 years. Ten of them also presented with renal  impairment and six were grafted. One grafted patient under immuno   suppressive treatment died from a malignant tumor originated from a  native kidney. In patients aged 36 or more, the probability to develop  renal failure was estimated to be more than 50%. Besides, neither  genotype phenotype correlation nor clinical predictive association with  renal failure could be evidenced. These data reveal an unsuspected  high frequency with age of renal impairment in OFDI syndrome.

OFD type I is  characterized by malformations of the face, oral cavity and digits. CNS  abnormalities and cystic kidney disease can also be part of this condi   tion. This rare genetic disorder is due to mutations in the OFD1 gene  that encodes a centrosome/basal body protein necessary for primary  cilium assembly and for left right axis determination, thus ascribing  OFDI to the growing number of disorders associated to ciliary dysfunc   tion.

Oligodontia is a rare anomaly of tooth number while hypodontia is a  common one. Both anomalies have a genetic background and are in   herited in successive generations of a family.  Objectives: to evaluate and compare the pattern of missing teeth in  families, to observe similarities and differences of dental phenotype  among affected relatives, to characterize the mode of inheritance and  to identify distinct groups of patients for further molecular investiga   tions.  Patients and Methods: Clinical examinations were carried out on 6  Caucasian patients and their affected first degree relatives from 3  families with a family history of missing permanent teeth. Combined  examination of clinical phenotypes and orthopantomograms improved  the precision of diagnosis. Family study was used to determine wheth   er there is a hereditary basis for oligodontia or hypodontia.  Results: We describe tooth agenesis in three main groups: mother  daughter, sister sister and brother sister. None of the patients and  their first degree relatives shared similar patterns of missing teeth. No  correlation exists between the patterns of missing permanent teeth in  related individuals. Predominant dental phenotype involved anterior  teeth agenesis and symmetrical (left   right) hypodontia. Anomalies of  tooth size and tooth shape were also observed in association with hy   podontia but not with oligodontia. Gender difference did not influence  the severity of phenotype.

Other organ systems can be involved, defining a complex  nosology including 13 specific subtypes. Some of them have been de   scribed in only one or two reports. Some overlap between subtypes  is suspected. The clarification of this complex nosology could only  come from a better understanding of their molecular bases. However,  only the OFD1  gene responsible for OFD type I is currently known.  Because of the presence of multiple congenital abnormalities (MCA)  and/or mental retardation in some OFDS, we questioned about the  possibility of submicroscopic rearrangements as a cause of OFDS. We  therefore performed high resolution array CGH (244 or 105K Agilent)  in a series of 20 OFDS negative for mutations and large rearrange   ments in the OFD1  gene, gathered through an international collabo   ration. Only seven patients could be assigned to a specific subtype  of OFDS. Three patients had malformations that are not commonly  found in the different OFDS subtypes, including gyration abnormali   ties, abnormal lung lobulation, deafness, imperforate anus, and trigo   nocephaly. Nine patients had mental retardation. We failed to evidence  submicroscopic chromosomal imbalances in this series. These results  suggest that chromosome imbalances appear rarely involved in OFDS  and that mutations within single genes may be responsible for these  phenotypes. Further work at a molecular level is needed to identify  the causes and allow appropriate counselling for families regarding  specific recurrence risk and prognosis.",2009

The issue of this paper is to present a case of  PKD associating 21 hydroxylase defficiency, diagnosed and followed  up in our clinic since newborn. Method: female girl, aged 3 years and  4 month, presented as newborn with clytoris hypertrophia, SGA. En   docrine evaluation (17 hydroxiprogesterone, cortisole, testosterone,  DHEA) established the diagnosis of adrenogenitally syndrome   21  hydroxylase defficiency. Elevated serum BUN and creatinine led to a  nephrologic imagistic evaluation, which showed a polycystic right kid   ney and a hypoplasia of the left kidney, CrCl , 12,12 ml/min, no hyper   tension. Substitutive treatment with hydrocortisone orally was initiated.  Close follow up included: growth parameters, clinical examination,  renal function, Ca   P metabolism, hematologic evaluation, hormone  determinations, imagistic assessment. Results: The patient devel   oped progressive renal failure (CrCl , 16,3 ml/min), anemia (Epoetine  started december 2007), renal osteodystrophy (1,25 dihydroxy vitamin  D3 administration), presented few episodes of urinary tract infections  and failure to thrive. Clinical evaluation of the genitalia and hormone  determinations showed a good response to substitutive treatment. The  evaluation of growth hormone therapy, started december 2007, is in  course. Conclusion: metabolic balance was difficult to obtain because  of the associated pathology, and the 21 hydroxylase defficiency could  be an unfavorable factor for the evolution of the renal disease.",2009

","Polymicrogyria is a relatively common but poorly understood defect  of cortical development characterized by numerous small gyri and a  thick disorganized cortical plate lacking normal lamination. We show  an association between bilateral asymmetrical polymicrogyria and de  novo mutations in a beta tubulin gene, TUBB2B, in four patients and  a 27 GW(gestational week) fetus. Neuropathological examination of  the fetus revealed an absence of cortical lamination associated with  the presence of heterotopic neuronal cells in the white matter, and  neuronal overmigration through breaches in the pial basement mem   brane, reminiscent of âcobblestone likeâ phenotypes observed in a  Gpr56 /  mice model. In utero RNAi based inactivation demonstrates  that TUBB2B is a new gene that is critically involved in neuronal migra   tion. We also show that two disease associated mutations lead to an  impaired formation of tubulin heterodimers as a result of deficiencies  in the complex chaperone dependent tubulin heterodimerization path   way. These observations, together with previous data, demonstrate  that disruption of microtubule based processes underlies a large spec   trum of neuronal migration disorders that includes not only lissenceph   aly/pachygyria, but also polymicrogyria malformations.",2009
is the pattern of root resorption in human teeth dependent on  the gene amelogenin?,P02.099,"M. Bille , D. Nolting, I. Kjaer","Department of Orthodontics, Copenhagen, Denmark","Introduction. It has been demonstrated that abnormal resorption of  primary roots is associated with unexpected resorption of permanent  roots (Bille et al., Eur J Orthod 2008; 30(4): 346 51). This leads to  the hypothesis that root resorption is not always acquired, but can be  inherited. This preliminary study is an immunohistochemical study on  human teeth focusing on the gene amelogenin. Amelogenin has for   mally been associated with root resorption in mice (Hatekeyama et al.,  J Biol Chem 2003; 278(37): 35743 8).  Material. 18 primary teeth extracted from 10 children due to dental  treatment.  Method. Paraffin sections for immunhistochemistry reaction were pre   treated with Tris EDTA pH 9 at 60Â°C for 90 minutes. Sections were  washed in TBS, encircled with a Dako pen (Dako, S2002), washed  in TBS. Sections were incubated with Peroxidase Blocking Solution  (Dako, S2023), washed in TBS, incubated in primary antibody for 60  minutes using: Anti Amelogenin (ABIN 187765, antibodies online. com) diluted 1:3000 (Antibody Diluent, Dako, S2022).

Results. Strong amelogenin expression was seen in the periodontal  membrane as small and well distinct islands in regions without root  resorption, while amelogenin expression was weak and mostly absent  in resorption lacunas. Conclusion. The present study showed that amelogenin might play a  decisive role in human root resorption and therefore might influence an  inherited pattern of root resorption.",2009

Karyotype investigations  in affected patients characteristically reveal premature centromere  separation, or heterochromatin repulsion. The syndrome is caused by  mutations in the ESCO2  gene, which is located at locus 8p21.1, and encodes a protein essential in establishing sister chromatid cohesion  during S phase. Allelic to this condition is SC phocomelia (SC) (OMIM  #269000), which has a milder phenotype compared to RBS with less  severe symmetric limb reduction, flexion contractures of various joints,  minor facial anomalies, growth retardation and occasionally, mental  retardation. Individuals with SC typically survive to adulthood whereas  severely affected RBS infants may be stillborn or die in the post na   tal period. As a result, there is little literature about the follow up of  adults with the spectrum of SC phocomelia/Roberts syndrome or the  recommended management.

At the age of 18 months he was still short with hypotonia, pyramidal  signs, epilepsy with multifocal EEG anomalies, no eye contact, high  myopia, nasolacrimal duct stenosis, a large fontanel, high forehead,  hypertelorism, midface hypoplasia, arched eyebrows with synophrys,  chubby cheeks, broad nose, large mouth and protruding tongue, low  set dysplastic ears, cochlear deafness, short neck, brachydactyly and  abnormal creases, short broad 1st toe and generalized hirsutism. Brain  MRI showed an empty sella. X rays showed wormian bones, no scle   rosis of the skull, short hand phalanges. His karyotype was 46,XY.  At that time Schinzel Giedion syndrome was diagnosed. In 2008 Affy  250K NspI arrays showed a submicroscopic der(9)t(9q34;17q25). This  represents one of the largest 9q34 microdeletions described, probably  explaining the severe phenotype. Hirsutism, hydronephrosis and se   vere neurological phenotype are typical of SGS and unusual for 9q34  deletions. Our observation, however, arises the question whether at  least some SGS patients might have a cryptic chromosomal imbal   ance or, less likely, whether some of the genes on 9q34 in our patient  contain a second recessive mutation.",2009

It is characterised by a postnatal progressive chondropathy  affecting primarily articular cartilage. Clinically, the condition mimics  Juvenile Rheumatoid Arthritis, and the diagnosis is often significantly  delayed. We want to raise awareness of this debilitating condition and  present 2 siblings from a non consanguineous family with SEDT PA  diagnosed radiologically. They presented with severe progressive  pain and stiffness of the hip joints, waddling gait and rheumatoid  like  hands from 3 years of age. Their X rays showed generalised osteo   penia, platyspondyly, narrow joint spaces, metaphyseal widening and  flattening of epiphyses. SEDT PA was confirmed by identifying com   pound heterozygote mutations in the Wnt1 inducible secreted protein  3 (WISP3 ) gene. The WISP3 protein is a member of the CCN family  (cysteine rich 61, connective tissue growth factor, Nephroblastoma  overexpressed) of secreted proteins that specifically associate with ex   tracellular matrix. CCNs are primarily maintenance proteins that mod   ify cellular responses to environmental factors and stimuli.

OBJECTIVES: (1) to determine a proportion of misdiagnosed cases  among children tested for suspicion of trisomy 21, and (2) to study SR  among those not having trisomy 21 according to their age at the ge   netic investigation. STUDY POPULATION: children referred to cytoge   netic testing because of having clinical features resembling DS, born in  1970 2008. RESULTS: Among 1197 children born in 1986 2008, when  completeness of cytogenetic confirmation of trisomy 21 had been im   proving from 86% to about 100%, there were 96 (8%) with normal  karyotype (annual rate varied from 0% in 1990 to 19% in 2008). Overall,  normal karyotype was diagnosed in 99 newborns (16M/83F, SR,0.19,  p<0.0001), in 68 babies of the age up to 1 year old (25M/43F, SR,0.58,  p,0.01), and in 59 children aged 1 year and older (27M/32F, SR,0.84,  p>0.05). Thus there was a strong female prevalence in misdiagnosed  newborns decreasing to about population value of 1.06 when children  growing up. CONCLUSION: the data obtained suggest that gender  affects clinical suspicion of DS. Since characteristic features allowing  suspicion of DS include facial dysmorphism, one may hypothesize sex  differences in the normal process of facial cranium ontogenesis during  perinatal period. An abnormal condition(s) specific to females might  also be implicated in a proportion of the misdiagnosed cases. Data of  the follow up study will be presented.",2009
A girl with short stature due to SHOX  deletion inherited from  paternal Y,P02.107,"J. Dupont , R. Silveira Santos, A. Medeira, A. Sousa, M. Ãvila, S. Serafim, I.  Cordeiro","Hospital Santa Maria, Lisbon, Portugal","Short stature is a frequent disorder for which clinical attention is re   quired during childhood. Short stature homeobox containing gene (SHOX ) is located on the pseudoautosomal region ( PAR1 ) of the short  arm of the X and Y chromosomes. SHOX  gene haploinsuficiency, due  to microdeletions or intragenic mutations, causes a highly variable  phenotype, ranging from isolated short stature to Leri Weill dyscon   drosteosis (LWD), while nullizygosity results in Langer mesomelic dys   plasia (LMD). We described the clinical and cytogenetic findings of a familial case  of SHOX haploinsuficiency due to a microdeletion inherited by an un   usual mechanism. The proband, a six year old girl, was referred to  our clinic for growth failure. On physical examination she presented  disproportionate short stature with mesomelic shortening of the limbs  and appearance of muscular hypertrophy. There were no dysmorphic  features, except relative macrocephaly and high arched palate. X rays  of the forearms showed no evidence of Madelung deformity. Endocrine  studies and karyotype were normal.

These results suggest  a prior meiotic recombination event on the father to account for the  transfer of the deleted SHOX gene to the alternate sex chromosome. Only three cases of inherited SHOX  deletions by the same mechanism  have been reported. The recognition of the etiology of short stature in  this family allowed an adequate genetic counseling.",2009

Additional investigations were all normal.  At 12 years, ultrasonography and skeletal x rays showed asymmetric  kidneys and delayed bone age. He grew up without feeding difficulties  (BMI,  2 SDS at 2 years old) and did not receive growth hormone  therapy; he demonstrated excessive sweating during childhood. Now,  at 33 years old, his final height is152cm ( 3.5 SDS) and he presents a  slight lower limbs asymmetry, relative macrocephaly (+1.5 SDS), bilat   eral fifth finger clinodactyly, and triangular face.

We observe the  preponderance of following traits: macroglossia (10 cases   62.5%),  Microglossia (2), Lobulated tongue (1), bifid tongue (1), asymmetric  tongue (1), tongue fasciculation (1). The syndromes diagnosed were:  congenital hypothyroidism (7 cases), Down syndrome (1), hypoglos   sia hypodactylia spectrum (3), MEN IIB (1), Opitz G/BBB (1), Werdnig  Hoffmann (1) and multiple anomalies (2). The tongue anomalies were  diagnosed after 2 months age old because of the tongue role in mas   tication, deglutition, speech etc. The small number of cases could be  explained by the low frequency of the anomalies or by messing the  diagnosis owing to a facile clinical evaluation. For accurate assessment, correct diagnosis, and management, the  patients should be dealt with in a team approach.

Fourteen common CFTR mutations  (CFTRdele2,3(21kb), 394delTT, L138ins, R334W, F508del, I507del,  1677delTA, G542X, 2143delT, 2184insA, 3821delT, W1282X, N1303K  and 3849+10kbC>T) and Tn polymorphism in the intron 8 (IVS8T)  have been analyzed. Results: CFTR gene mutations were found in 40 (4.7%) patients. Fol   lowing heterozygous mutations have been revealed: F508del (n,17),  CFTRdele2,3 (n,7), W1282X (n,6), 2143delT (n,4), 2184insA (n,1),  G542X (n,1), R334W (n,1), 1677delTA (n,1), 3849+10kbC>T (n,1)  and 3821delT (n,1). The presence of 5T allele was found in 96 (11.3%)  infertile men. This CFTR allele has been revealed in the heterozygous  (87,5%), in the homozygous (4,2%) and in the compound heterozygote  state (8,3%) with following common CFTR mutation: F508del (n,4),  CFTRdele2,3 (n,1), W1282X (n,2) and G542X (n,1). Mild (atypical)  forms of cystic fibrosis (CF) with extragenital features of CF (with a  presence of chronic bronchitis or chronic pancreatitis) were diagnosed  in 4 (0.5%) infertile men. CBAVD and/or obstructive azoospermia were  revealed in about 2% of examined individuals. One severe oligozoo   spermic patient presented with unilateral renal agenesis (URA) associ   ated with CUAVD syndrome. Conclusion: Obtained results demonstrated high prevalence of com   mon CFTR mutations and 5T allele between Russian infertile men. Fol   lowing four mutations: F508del, CFTRdele2,3, W1282X and 2143delT,  are the commonest CFTR mutations in Russia.",2009

Method and materials: 11 couples were selected for prenatal diagnosis,  based on family history or typical echographic findings. The couples  had previous children with cystic fibrosis who had been genetically  tested and had both mutations identified or had deceased children  diagnosed with cystic fibrosis but without molecular diagnostic. Ge   nomic DNA was isolated from amniotic fluid collected by transabdomi   nal amniocentesis in the 16th week of pregnancy and from venous  blood collected on EDTA from both parents. The genetic analysis for  CFTR mutations was performed with Elucigene CF29 kit which uses  the ARMS PCR method. STR genotyping was performed for several loci in order to verify the absence of contamination with maternal blood  or cells. When maternal contamination of amniotic fluid was unavoid   able, the culture of amniocytes in specific media was used for selection  of fetal cells. Results: 4 heterozygous genotypes were identified (ÎF508/N, G542X/ N), six normal genotypes and one compound heterozygous genotype  (621+1G>T/ÎF508). Conclusions: It is possible to perform prenatal diagnosis using Eluci   gene CF29 kit in all cases with the exception of cases which can be  homozygous for non ÎF508 mutations.

Screening for large gene rearrangements has improved  identification of CF alleles but a number of cases remain unsolved,  making genetic counselling difficult, particularly when the diagnosis  is uncertain. Unidentified CF mutations may lie in introns, such as  3849+10kbC>T and 1811+1.6kbA>G. We report the case of a French 25y woman diagnosed with dissemi   nated bronchiectasis, pancreatic sufficiency and borderline sweat  tests. Screening of the 27 exons including search for gene rearrange   ments only identified F508del in heterozygosity. Investigation at the  mRNA level was then performed from nasal epithelial cells. An abnormal, longer CFTR  mRNA was detected, corresponding to a  97bp insert between exons 6b and 7. This fragment matches a 101bp  sequence of intron 6b, and is flanked by the consensus donor and  acceptor splice sites. A new stop codon is created within the inserted  sequence. The amount of abnormal CFTR  mRNA of the patient was  estimated to be 20% of the wild type, which suggests the abnormal  splicing is due to partial activation of a cryptic splice site. This hypoth   esis is supported by the fact that the patient does not suffer from se   vere CF. Studies at the genomic level are still ongoing to identify the  mutation which leads to partial activation of a cryptic splice site and  explains the creation of a new exon.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology",2009

In fact the pathologic effect of an apparently benign  polymorphism, such as codon third position variations, or nucleotide  change/ deletion in the intronic non canonical splicing regulatory ele   ments, are difficult to assess. In this work we define the pathogenic role of a synonymous mutation  found in an Italian patient affected by cystic fibrosis (CF). It consists  of a G>T substitution at nucleotide 2811 on exon 15 of CFTR gene.  CFTR mRNA analysis showed that this synonymous mutation created  a new 5â splice site inside exon 15 causing  the skipping of 76 amino  acids. Furthermore, CFTR mRNA analysis showed that, although this aber   rant splicing caused a shorter exon 15, the downstream exonic se   quence from exon 16 to the end of the ORF was in frame. Therefore, the skipping of amino acid residues included in exon 15,  located in CFTR transmembrane domain MSD7, probably modify the  structure and the regulation of the Cl  channel. The growing interest on the potential effects of single nucleotide  changes in coding and non coding regions on the extent and accuracy  of pre mRNA splicing is expected to have a significant impact on the  diagnosis and treatment of genetic diseases. The correct classification  of mutations is essential to understand structure function relationship  in the corresponding protein, to assess the phenotypic risk in CF pa   tients and to devise new therapies.",2009

The patientâs  history was uneventful until her school years when mild upper respira   tory infections appeared with repeated coughing periods and sweat  chloride levels of 102mmol/l, however she did not have any intestinal  symptoms. As direct sequencing of all 27 exons of CFTR revealed, the  patient had two mutations in compound heterozygous form: a 2183  AA>G frameshift mutation in exon 13, described previously in three  unrelated CF patients of Sardinian descent; and a mutation not yet  reported elsewhere, a 3872 G>A transition in exon 20 resulting in a  glycine glutamate amino acid change at position 1247. We found that  the 2183 AA>G frameshift mutation was inherited from her Hungarian  mother, while the 3872 G>A transition from her Nigerian father. The  latter is also carried by her brother. This novel mutation affects an ATP  binding site of the CFTR protein, and was predicted to be probably  damaging by the Poly Phen prediction software, thus we presume that  it is a CF mutation causing a milder, late onset form of CF.",2009

Craniosynostosis is frequently observed as  an associated feature in a number of clinically and genetically hetero   geneous syndromic conditions, including a group of disorders caused  by activating mutations of the fibroblast growth factor receptor family  members FGFR1 , FGFR2  and FGFR3 . In these disorders, dysregula   tion of intracellular signaling promoted by the aberrant FGFR function  is mediated, at least in part, by the RAS MAPK transduction pathway.  Mutations in RAS and other genes coding for proteins participating in this signaling cascade have recently been identified as underlying  Noonan syndrome and related disorders. We have identified an identical germline KRAS  mutation in two unrelat   ed Noonan syndrome patients with a similar type of craniosynostosis.  Although craniosynostosis does not seem to be an invariant feature  of patients with this mutation, this finding highlights the significance  of aberrant signaling mediated by the RAS pathway in the origin of  craniosynostosis.",2009

Herein we describe four patients  presenting atypical findings in molecular diagnosis. Patient #351 had suggestive facial dysmorphology, severe short stat   ure and bilateral cryptorchidism. DNA testing identified an in frame  3pb insertion in exon 7 of PTPN11 gene (p.Q255_Q256insQ). Two  other affected members of the family segregate the variant. Patient #178 presented with facial dysmorphology and mild short stat   ure. PTPN11 assays were performed, revealing a 3pb deletion in in   tron 12 (c. 16_ 18delATG). In silico splicing simulation produced new  acceptor splice sites, thus probably affecting the correct splicing. Patient #301 displayed craniofacial anomalies with severe short stat   ure, pulmonic stenosis and hypertrophic myocardiopathy, moderate  developmental delay, and severe linfatic dysplasia. PTPN11 gene  analysis revealed the presence of a de novo single codon double  nucleotyde substitution (p.T73L) that produces an aminoacidic change  not previously reported.

Steiner","Institute of Medical Genetics, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland","Microduplications encompassing the Rubinstein Taybi region at  16p13.3 lead to a rare multiple congenital anomalies/ mental retarda   tion syndrome. We report on a 19 years old male patient with an over   growth syndrome with multiple congenital anomalies and mild mental  retardation due to a 0.95 Mb duplication at 16p13.3. He presented  with a left dysplastic ear with atresia of the external auditory canal, a  preauricular tag, fused middle ear ossicles and bilateral deafness. The  dysmorphic facial features were characteristic for a long and narrow  face, deep set eyes with low position of eyebrows, prominent nasal  root and tip, lateral flaring of eyebrows, short philtrum, prominent lips,  everted upper lip and large hand and feet with broad interdigital joints.  He showed tall stature with a mild scoliosis and a marked thoracic  kyphosis. Beside the typical facial and skeletal features, overgrowth  seems to be a key feature for submicroscopic duplications of the Ru   binstein Taybi region. Many of the clinical features of our patient fit well  with the three cases published so far; however, some are unique (in  addition, he presented ear anomalies, very distinctly advanced growth  and relatively mild developmental delay), delineating the common clin   ical phenotype on one side and broadening the clinical spectrum on  the other side. From this observation, we conclude that the evaluation  of patients with overgrowth syndromes with variable degree of mental  retardation should also include the investigation for submicroscopic  chromosomal imbalances.Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology",2009

","Introduction: Pycnodysostosis is a rare autosomal recessive trait,  characterized by osteosclerosis, short stature, acro osteolysis of the  distal phalanges, bone fragility, clavicular dysplasia, and skull deformi   ties with delayed suture closure. The responsible gene, cathepsin K  (CTSK ), is a lysosomal cysteine proteinase critical for bone remodel   ing and reabsorption. CTSK  spans approximately 12 kb in 1q21 and  contains 8 exons. Its 987bp open reading frame encodes a polypep   tide of 329 amino acids. CGC Genetics is a reference laboratory for  diagnosing this disease. We report here our experience for the identi   fication of new Pycnodysostosis cases. Method: During 2004 2008, we received 9 samples for  CTSK  gene  analysis. Our approach is the sequence analysis of the complete cod   ing region of this gene including adjacent intron/exon boundaries. At  this moment we designed a microarray based assay (patent pending),  to be used as a first evaluation that detects 15 mutations and includes  those referred in the present work. Results: In 5 patients we found 1 homozygous disease causing muta   tion plus 2 new mutations (1 nonsense and 1 frameshift). One patient  with 1 causative mutation and 1 new amino acid change, and 1 pa   tient with 1 new homozygous amino acid change. In the remaining 2 patients, no mutation was identified. The newly detected amino acid  change, in two cases, is predicted to be damaging. Conclusion: These results, with four new mutations identified in unre   lated families, emphasize the molecular heterogeneity of the defects in  CTSK  gene in Picnodysiostosis and the importance of genotyping for  diagnosis and genetic counseling.",2009

Clinical outcome is variable, depending on the severity of the  phenotype, however neonatal lethality is common. We report on a term boy, first born to a healthy, non consanguine  couple. Prenatal ultrasound at 30 weeks of gestation demonstrated  shortening of both femora. At birth, he presented with reduced muscle  tone and dysmorphic features such as frontal bossing, broad and de   pressed nasal bridge, short nose with anteverted nostrils, long phil   trum, hypertelorism, low set ears, and large fontanelles. Limbs were  short, in particular hands and feet with narrowed chest. Weight and  length were both <3 percentile.

There is evidence that cholesterol  supplementation improves the clinical course of SLOS. Since atypi   cal and severe cases are frequently misdiagnosed, a proper diagnosis  followed by appropriate therapy and reliable genetic counseling may  be delayed. Underdiagnosing is the reason why data on the true inci   dence of the disease is limited. The results of our previous newborn  screening, based on the carrier frequency of the two most common  SLOS causing mutations in Poland (p.W151X and p.V326L), would  make SLOS one of the most frequent recessive disorders in our coun  try (with an incidence of 1 : 2 300   1 : 3 937). This prompted us to  carry out the study presented herein. The incidence and prevalence  of Smith Lemli Opitz based on 3 year population surveillance were  estimated as 1 in 83 168 and 1 in 866 273, respectively. The notable  discrepancy between our previous carrier newborn screening and pro   spective results suggests that the syndrome is probably either misdi   agnosed (underascertainment of mild and atypical cases) or results  mainly in intrauterine and neonatal death. The effects of the causative  SLOS mutations identified in Polish patients, especially of the null  mutation p.W151X, and the data collected in our surveillance strongly  suggest that SLOS embryos are lost very early and that the disease  is responsible for a high number of first trimester miscarriages.

The develop   ment of a NIPD assay for Î² thalassaemia is based on the analysis  of maternal plasma DNA for the detection of the paternally inherited  fetal alleles using Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and the  Arrayed Primer Extension (APEX) assay. A SNP genotyping analysis was performed on 75 random samples  from the Greek Cypriot population using 130 SNPs located across the  Î² globin cluster for the determination of heterozygosity. 48 SNPs with  more than 10% heterozygosity were selected for the development of  NIPD. Moreover, 55 families at risk for carrying a Î² thalassaemic fetus  were analyzed using 11 SNPs in order to determine which were infor   mative for NIPD. For the development of the APEX assay we designed a DNA microar   ray chip called âthalassochipâ containing 60 Î² thalassaemia mutations  and 18 SNPs located across the Î² globin locus. The sensitivity and  specificity of the approach was determined. 24 maternal plasma sam   ples were analyzed using the APEX assay for 2 SNPs. NIPD was suc   cessfully performed on 17 samples, 2 were misdiagnosed, whereas 5  analyses failed. The APEX assay is a promising technique for NIPD and more tests  with additional SNPs need to be performed in order to render the as   say 100% reliable for NIPD.",2009

The male partner had low hematological data comparable with  thalassemia (i.e. MCV: 63.5 Fl, MCH:19.8 Pg ,Hb:15 g/dl and HbA2:2.5  g/dl). He was diagnosed to be carrier of alpha thalassemia with Med  mutation (  Med/ Î±Î±). The female partnerâs hematological data was:  MCV:80 Fl , MCH:25.6 Pg , Hb:14.2 g/dl , HbA2:5.4 g/dl , HbF:6.6 g/dl.  At first glance she would be diagnosed as being a carrier of beta thal.  Molecular analysis showed she was both carrier of alpha and beta  thalassemia. The high level of HbA2 was indicative of beta carrier and  near normal MCV and MCH was indicative of being carrier of both beta  and alpha thal. We could detect 3.7 kb deletion in alpha globin gene. The risk of H disease for the fetus is 25% though it would be mild.  The parents should become aware of this fact. Another point is that  since point mutation in alpha genes can give similar hematological re   sult and then in such case a transfusion dependent H disease may Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology result. It can be suggested that when one couple carry a severe form  of alpha thal as cis the other partner should be checked for alpha gene  mutation even if he is carrier of beta thal.",2009

Beta globin mutations were studied using a reverse  hybridization assay and sequencing of the total beta globin gene. The  XmnI Ggamma polymorphism, the Sicilian delta beta deletion, and  four alpha globin mutations (_a3.7, _a4.2, _MED, aaa anti 3.7) were  studied using PCR based techniques. The inheritance of the XmnI  Ggamma polymorphism with severe beta thalassemia alleles in the  homozygous or compound heterozygous state was the predominant  mechanism observed in 27 individuals (55.3%). In five cases, this sta   tus overlapped with the _a3.7,aa genotype.

RS is a serious neurodevelopmental disorder  caused by mutations in the MECP2  gene in Xq28. In its classic form  RS mainly affects females who after a relatively normal development  during the first six months of life develop a wide spectrum of symptoms.  Several atypical forms of RS also exist, such as the Hanefeld variant  with early onset convulsions, suggesting the implication of other genes  in the RS phenotype. Material Methods: We herein report a 14 year old female with a RS  like clinical picture, severe mental retardation, and well controlled sei   zures. Results:  MECP2  gene testing was negative, but subsequent  sequencing of the CDKL5  gene revealed a novel p.Arg970X (c. 2908  C>T) mutation in the last exon. The truncated protein only misses a  small portion of the terminus, which might explain the less severe phe   notype.

Loss of MeCP2  function causes Rett syndrome (RTT), whereas increased copy num   ber of the gene causes MECP2  duplication or triplication syndromes. Clinical genetics and Dysmorphology MeCP2 acts as a transcriptional repressor, however the gene ex   pression changes observed in the hypothalamus of MeCP2 disorder  mouse models suggest that MeCP2 can also upregulate gene expres   sion, given that the majority of genes are downregulated upon loss of  MeCP2 and upregulated in its presence. To determine if this role of  MeCP2 extends beyond the hypothalamus, we studied gene expres   sion patterns in the cerebellum of Mecp2  null and MECP2  Tg mice,  modeling RTT and MECP2  duplication syndrome, respectively. We  found that abnormal MeCP2 dosage causes alterations in the expres   sion of hundreds of genes in the cerebellum. The majority of genes  were upregulated in MECP2  Tg mice and downregulated in Mecp2   null mice, consistent with a role for MeCP2 as a modulator that can  both increase and decrease gene expression. Many of the genes al   tered in the cerebellum were similarly altered in the hypothalamus.  Our data suggest that either gain or loss of MeCP2 results in gene  expression changes in multiple brain regions and that some of these  changes are global. Further delineation of the expression pattern of  MeCP2 target genes throughout the brain might identify subsets of  genes that are more amenable to manipulation, and can thus be used  to modulate some of the disease phenotypes.",2009

We screened the FOXG1 gene in a cohort of 206 MECP2/CDKL5  mutation negative  patients with severe encephalopathy and microcephaly (136 females  and 70 males). The screening was negative in all males. Two de novo   mutations (c.1248C>G, p.Y416X and c.460dupG) were identified in two  girls.

Others  signs were not systematically observed: protruding tongue, scoliosis,  and epilepsy. Although the overall frequency of mutations in FOXG1   in females with severe mental retardation and microcephaly appears  to be low (1.5%), our findings suggest the requirement to investigate  both point mutations and probably gene dosage in the FOXG1 gene  in patients with severe encephalopathy with microcephaly, and some  Rett like features.",2009

To date, there have been ~90 X linked genes  implicated in causing XLMR with the majority of these genes being  associated with syndromal MR (MRXS). A smaller set of genes on the  X chromosome have been associated with nonsyndromal MR (MRX)  where the only discernible feature is mental retardation. Significant  overlap between these two sets of genes indicates that syndromal  and nonsyndromal can both be caused by alterations in many of the  XLMR genes. From a clinical perspective, proper diagnosis of males  with nonsyndromal XLMR is more straightforward when a positive fam   ily history exists. Unfortunately, many undiagnosed males with MRX  exist, and the absence of an X linked pedigree makes the identifica   tion of their underlying etiology much more difficult. Indicative of this  difficulty is that MRX accounts for roughly 2/3 of the total number of  XLMR cases. To test for MRX, the Molecular Diagnostic Laboratory at  the Greenwood Genetic Center has designed a resequencing panel  consisting of 95 amplicons encoding the exons and intron junctions  of 9 X linked genes.

The purpose of this study was to investigate miRNAs 105 role in the  development of nonsyndromic mental retardation (MR). We analyzed  rs10238918 SNP located in a miRNA 105 binding site of 3âUTR of  NeuroD6 gene in nonsyndromic MR patients and control group.

The majority of  mutations were so far detected in the protein coding regions of X chro   mosomal genes. However, sequence changes in regulatory regions  may result in similarly detrimental effects by influencing the transcrip   tion efficiency of the respective genes. Therefore one can assume that part of the unsolved cases of XLMR  may be due to promoter mutations. Thus, it is necessary to identify  functional promoter elements in known XLMR genes in order to de   termine where sequence changes can have functional consequences.  Furthermore, the identification of factors involved in the transcription  of these genes is also a way to find additional genes with a putative  role in MR. Therefore we investigated the promoter region of one of  the more frequently mutated XLMR genes, JARID1C, for functionally  relevant sequences. As JARID1C encodes a transcription factor, mutations in target pro   moters might also cause MR. Thus, having evidence of regulatory  interplay between JARID1C and its homolog JARID1B, we included  JARID1B as well as the other JARID1 family members (JARID1A and  JARID1D) in our study.

Identical and similar  mutations result in high clinical variability, ranging from moderate men   tal retardation to much more severe forms, including microcephaly,  short stature and spasticity. More recently we have begun to unravel  the pathomechanism of this disease and have found that PQBP1 mu   tant transcripts with a premature stop codon are partially degraded  by nonsense mediated mRNA decay (NMD) and that PQBP1 muta   tions cause nonsense associated altered splicing (NAS). Interestingly,  some of the mutations resulted in an upregulation of naturally exist   ing PQBP1 protein isoforms. Additional studies demonstrated that the  PQBP1 protein is part of a large multiprotein complex containing RNA  binding proteins that are established components of RNA granules and  play distinct roles in post transcriptional RNA regulation and metabo   lism.

However, recent studies have shown that  phenomena related to CIN (cell cycle errors, aneuploidy) are observed  in the diseased (nonmalignant) brain tissues. The latter phenomenon  was recently observed in neurodegenerative disorders. To test a pos   sible link between CIN and neurodegeneration, we have analyzed in   terphase chromosomes in the Alzheimerâs disease (AD) and ataxia tel   angiectasia (AT) brain. By means of interphase chromosome specific  multicolor banding (ICS MCB) and interphase FISH, we monitored  chromosome complement in about 500,000 neural cells derived from  the cerebral cortex of AD, AT and normal human brain (control sam   ples). We have established the mean rate of stochastic aneuploidy  per âmeanâ human chromosome as 0.5% in controls (the normal hu   man brain, 95%CI 0.2 0.7%; SD 0.2%). The AT brain demonstrated a  dramatic 2 to 5 fold increase of stochastic aneuploidy randomly affect   ing different chromosomes (mean 2.1%; 95%CI   1.5 2.6%; SD 0.8%).  The overall proportion of aneuploid cells in the brain of AT individuals  was estimated at 20 50%. The level of stochastic aneuploidy in the AD  brain was slightly increased compared with controls. However, a dra   matic 10 fold increase of cells with unstable chromosome complement  affected by chromosome 21 hypoploidy and hyperploidy was detected  in the AD brain (6 15% versus 0.8 1.8% in control). Thus, CIN mani   fested as aneuploidy does present in the AD and AT brain. Our data  indicate that CIN mediated by neural aneuploidization does not lead to  tumorigenesis but potentially mediate neurodegeration in these devas   tative brain diseases.

However, related studies rarely address genomic variations at  subchromosomal and chromosomal levels in the diseased brain. We  have addressed variation in chromosome numbers and somatic chro   mosome pairing in neural cells of the schizophrenia brain by interphase  FISH. We demonstrate that the schizophrenia brain exhibits increased  rates of stochastic aneuploidy affecting different chromosomes with  the presence of low level mosaicism involving chromosomes 1, 18,  21 and X. Variation in chromosome number may destabilize grnome  in affected neuronal cells and play a definite role in schizophrenia  pathogenesis. The study of interphase chromosome organization has  showed the schizophrenic brain to differ in the rate of chromosomal  associations by both heterochromatic and euchromatic regions. The  frequency of somatically paired heterochromatic regions was 1.5 3  times higher for chromosomes 1, 9, 16 and 18 and for euchromatic  regions of chromosomes 1 and 18, while pairing of chromosomes 15  and 17 has occurred more frequently in the non diseased brain. Since  nuclear organization defines proper functioning of a cell, the present  findings propose for the first time alterations of chromosome organiza   tion in the brain as a possible epigenetic mechanism involved in the  pathogenesis of schizophrenia.

For 393 of them (61.3%) karyotype analysis in lympho   cyte culture was made. The chromosomal investigation has confirmed  the diagnosis of DS in 372 (94.6%) patients. In 19 (4.8%) patients was  found normal karyotype. In two patients chromosome anomalies other  than trisomy 21 were found. The karyotype in one 3 years old boy was  49,XXXXY. The boy was deeply mentally retarded and had mongolian  eyeslit, epicanthus, hypertelorism, palmar simian crease, clinodactily,  arches in papilar patterns on all ten fingers, and other microanoma   lies typical for DS patients. The other chromosome patient without  trisomy 21 was 29 yrs old mild mentally retarded woman in whose  karyotype ring chromosome 9 was found. For both patients the physi   cians suspected DS. Therefore, in Lithuanian population false positive  diagnosis of DS was found in 5.3% of patients, i.e. two   three times  rarely as compared with analogically investigations in other countries.  We suppose that one of the reasons of such situation is the racial  homogeneity of Lithuanian population presented almost exclusively  by Caucasians. But in newborn Lithuanian babies the frequency of  false  positive diagnoses arises up to 32.1 percent: in 43 among 134  patients with clinical diagnosis of DS the normal karyotype was found.  The main clinical feature   mental retardation   cannot be recognized in  infants, and neonatologists do send the patients for karyotype analysis  due to isolated microanomalies.",2009
Folate related gene polymorphisms and risk for Down syndrome  among Russian women,P03.020,"A. Y. Belyaeva , M. S. Nazarenko, M. M. Koval, L. P. Nazarenko","State Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation","Downâs syndrome represents the most common chromosomal aneu   ploidy with high clinical significance. At least 90% of cases of 21 chro   mosome nondisjunction are due to maternal meiotic errors. Except for  increased age at conception and altered recombination, maternal risk  factors for meiotic nondisjunction are not well established. Itâs known  that deficiency in cellular folate and methyl donors have been associ   ated with pericentromeric DNA hypomethylation, chromosomal insta   bility and abnormal chromosome segregation. Attempts to find poly   morphisms of maternal folate related genes associated with risk for  Down syndrome have, however, often been inconclusive in different  populations. We have studied six SNPs of the methylenetetrahydro   folate reductase gene (MTHFR 677C>T (rs1801133) and 1298A>C  (rs1801131)), methionine synthase gene (MTR 2756A>G (rs1805087)),  methionine synthase reductase gene (MTRR 66A>G (rs1801394)),  methylenetetrahydrofolate dehydrogenase gene (MTHFD1 1958G>A  (rs2236225)) and DNA methyltransferase 3B gene (DNMT3B  149C>T  (rs2424913)) among 55 mothers of children with full form of trisomy  21 and 100 matched control mothers from Tomsk (West Siberia, Rus   sia). Prevalence of alleles and genotypes of 1958G>A MTHFD1 and   149C>T DNMT3B polymorphisms were estimated in the Russian pop   ulation for the first time. The frequency of mutant allele 66G of MTRR  gene was higher among case mothers than among control mothers  (71% vs. 53%; P,0.005).

Using chemically synthesized complex  libraries of oligonucleotides as templates for target regions identified  as being variant by array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH),  we directed our probes only at the most informative elements within  these regions to achieve high specificity with maximum flexibility.

Contrary to  the other published observations, our proband do not exhibit mental  retardation. Haploinsufficiency of FBN1  is likely to contribute to the  presence of features within the MFS spectrum. However, attenuated  features could be explained because disturbances of TGF beta signal   ling associated with FBN1  mutations do not exert full phenotypic ef   fect through simple haploinsufficiency.

Micronuclei appear during cell division as a result of  acentric chromosome fragments or whole chromosomes, outside the  nucleus. Peripheral whole blood cells collected from healthy donors,  18 to 30 years old, were incubated at 37oC for 48 hours in the presence  of 99mTc (3.7 MBq/100Î¼l).

This  is rather close to the estimates obtained by MLH1 mapping for male  mice (0.44) and mink (0.48). Twice higher recombination rate is de   tected in men (0.83), dogs (0.76) and cats (0.72).

A comparison of the interference estimates coming  from the distribution of MLH1 interfocus distances and RAD51/MLH1  focus ratio indicates a substantial difference between the species in  the strength of interference. This factor contributes into interspecies  difference in recombination rate. For example, cats have smaller FNa,  smaller total length of synaptonemal complex, but weaker interference  than dogs, and they exceed dogs in the average number of MLH1 foci.

Probably, aberrant DNA methylation may reinforce mitotic instability  through inactivation of cell cycle checkpoints. However, relationships  between mosaicism and epigenetic abnormalities are not investigated.  The aim of the present research was delineation of impact of abnormal  DNA methylation of G1/S checkpoints genes into etiology of chromo   somal mosaicism. Promoter methylation of P14ARF , CDKN2B  and  RB1 genes was studied by methylation specific PCR in the cytotro   phoblast and extraembryonic mesoderm of 45 spontaneous abortions  (SA) with chromosomal mosaicism, 20 SA with normal karyotype and  23 induced abortions. Level and tissue specific distribution of aneu   ploid cells were estimated by interphase FISH. Abnormal methylation  of P14ARF  and RB1 was observed in 9 and 20% of mosaics, respec   tively. At all 10 SA with epimutations were found. Low level mosaicism  confined by cytotrophoblast was denoted for 3 embryos indicating a  post zygotic origin of aneuploidy. At the same time epimutations were  found in both tissues indicating an error of genome demethylation prior  to implantation and germ layers differentiation. All other mosaics with  abnormal methylation were developed from aneuploid zygotes. So,  the epimutations were the secondary abnormalities for such embryos.  However, in this group association between tissue specific methylation  and level of euploid cells was observed providing evidence for reinforc   ing of trisomy rescue under abnormal epigenotype. Moreover, the in   cidence of RB1 methylation in the extraembryonic mesoderm (27.8%)  was significantly higher than in the cytotrophoblast (5.7%, P,0.04) in   dicating a possible epigenetic mechanism of karyotype self correction  in the trisomic conceptions.",2009

He was born at term with  uneventful prenatal and neonatal periods. His parents, who have 4  other normal children, noticed that he had developmental delay since  early infancy. His examination showed that he had macrocephaly, mal   formed right ear, retrognathia, hypotnia, and undescended testes. Brain  MR imaging showed hypoplasia of the corpus callosum and thickening  in the cortex of the frontal lobes predominantly in the singulate gyrus  suggestive of cortical dysplasia. MR Spectroscopy was unremarkable.  Karyotyping with 725 band resolution was normal. FISH for subtelo   meric cryptic rearrangements / deletions / duplications was negative.  Array CGH using a custom oligonucleotide microarray revealed an in   terstitial microdeletion of 7q22.1 to 7q22.3, spanning approximately  3.5 megabases. The deletion was confirmed by FISH study. To our  knowledge, this particular microdeletion has not been reported in lit   erature using aCGH. The phenotype we describe here in our patient  may represent a unique genomic syndrome of 7q22.1 q22.3 micro   deletion that could be clinically recognizable. Furthermore, our report  supports the value of incorporating aCGH in the evaluation of patients  with undiagnosed developmental delay and dysmorphism.",2009

They were born from healthy and unrelated young parents. The  first pregnancy was interrupted at 13 weeks of gestation because of  the severity of the lymphoedema. Karyotype on chorionic villus sample  was normal. Pathology revealed in a male foetus the association of a  common mesentery, a unique ectopic testis and small renal cysts. The second pregnancy was terminated at 15 weeks of gestation. The  female foetus presented a generalized lymphoedema, a single umbili   cal artery and bilateral hydronephrosis. Both foetus and parents had normal conventional chromosomal analy   sis. Array CGH revealed a 6.7 Mb 2q22.1q22.3 deletion encompass   ing five genes in the two foetuses. Deleted genes in this region were  LRP1B, KYNU, ARHGAP15, GTDC1 and ZEB2 . The latter is known to  be involved in Mowat Wilson syndrome. No parental anomaly was detected by array CGH. In addition, FISH  analysis on both parents confirmed the de novo deletion. Recurrence was explained by a presumed germline mosaÃ¯cism. Reported cases with identical structural chromosomal aberrations  born to karyotypically normal parents are rare. Gonadal mosaÃ¯cism is  well documented for autosomal dominant and X linked disorders, but  seems to be very rare for this type of chromosomal anomaly. Array  CGH analysis can therefore be very helpful to identify small structural  chromosomal aberration in foetuses with unusual multiple congenital  anomalies syndromes, and for adequate genetic counselling.",2009

It is a heterogeneous group of diseases divided into 4 subtypes.  WS3 associates hearing impairment, abnormal pigmentation, dystopia  canthorum and limb anomalies. This condition is due to mutations or  deletions of PAX3  gene. Mutations in PAX3  have also been reported in  the craniofacial deafness hand syndrome (CDHS), a rare form of WS,  which comprises a flat midface, hypertelorism, a hypoplastic nose and  limb anomalies. Here we report on a four year old boy referred to the genetic clinic for  bilateral hand arthrogryposis. He also presented dysmorphic features  such as a flat and asymmetrical face, severe dystopia canthorum and  a small mouth. Neither depigmentation nor gastro intestinal involve   ments were noted. He was born at 38 WG with the following growth parameters: 1.650  kg (<3rd centile) for the weight, 45cm (10th centile) for the length and  30cm (3rd centile) for the HC. A brain ultrasound scan performed soon  after birth was normal. On heart examination, patent ductus arterio   sus, pulmonary hypertension and Wolf Parkinson White anomaly were  identified.

One of the two patients has a twin sister with  highly similar dysmorphic features, which we are going to analyze for  the presence of the above mentioned imbalance. Comparing the genomic positions of all previously described deletions  with those we detected, a common minimal region cannot be found  because they are not all overlapping. However a better characteriza   tion of cytogenetically defined breakpoints and the finding of further Cytogenetics cryptic imbalances in the same chromosomal region, through the ap   plication of high resolution techniques, will lead to the identification of  causative genes and underlying molecular mechanisms. The finding of  identical deletions in unrelated patients suggests the occurrence of the  same event mediated by peculiar sequences or structures. Indeed at  the breakpoints, we found repetitive elements, such as Alu sequences,  which are known to generate genomic instability and to promote chro   mosomal aberrations.",2009

We describe a 6 year old male with a 1.2 Mb de novo  deletion of  2p16.3 detected by aCGH (Agilent 244K). Most of NRXN1  is missing  and no other known genes are within the deletion.

SGBS  is caused by mutations or deletions of the glypican 3 (GPC3) gene. Here, we report on a 2 year old boy presented with pychomotoric re   tardation, growth retardation, microcephaly, mild congenital malforma   tions (micropenis, hypospadia) and dysmorphic features (e.g. broad  forehead, facial asymmetry, round face, hypertelorism, micrognathia,  deep set and posteriorly rotated ears, slight bilateral clinodactyly). Initially, Silver Russell syndrome was suspected. While karyotyping  and testing for Silver Russell syndrome were negative, a 1 4 Mb dupli   cation at Xq26.2 including the GPC3/GPC4 gene cluster was identified  by BAC array CGH. This finding was validated by MLPA and Q PCR  analysis. For the characterization of the duplication in a much higher resolu   tion we have designed and customized a 60mer oligo array printed  in a 105K format (105.000 oligonucleotides probes) using the eArray  technology (Agilent). Testing of more family members revealed that the mother, the grand   mother and a maternal uncle were carrier of the Xq26.2 duplication.  All carriers displayed the characteristic features of the syndrome to  some extent. Interestingly, comparison of the Xq26.2 duplication phenotype to the  phenotype of SGBS patients revealed partially a âreverseâ phenotype  to the SGBS. Recently, it was proposed that the SGBS phenotype is caused by a  misregulation of the hedgehog signal transduction pathway. Here we  will present a potential explanation of the phenotypical differences be   tween the two syndromes based on the function of glypican 3 in the  hedgehog signal transduction pathway.",2009

Breakpoint analysis in patient 4 revealed the dis   ruption of C10orf11, a brain expressed gene that is located in the com   mon deleted interval of patients 1 3. The presence of an LCR at the  centromeric breakpoints of patients 2 and 3 suggests a common, LCR  mediated mechanism for the formation of both deletions. Since there  were no corresponding LCRs at the telomeric breakpoints, this mecha   nism is probably different from non allelic homologous recombination.

For individuals with chromosome abnormalities, the  promise of microarray technology is that it can quickly identify which  genes are and are not present in two copies. In order for this informa   tion to be useful to clinicians, there must be some tool to link genotypic  data with annotated phenotypic information. As an initial step towards  this goal, we have created a first generation gene dosage map for  chromosome 18. Methods.  Data from OMIM, the Database of Ge   nomic Variants, and medical and scientific manuscripts were reviewed  for each of the genes shown on the UCSC Genome Browser using  the March 2006 assembly. 253 genes were classified as haplosuffi   cient, haploinsufficient, conditional haplosufficient, or haplolethal. This  information, along with our data on critical regions for 18q  phenotypic  features, was used to create a custom track on the UCSC genome  browser. Results and Discussion . Eighty one genes were deter   mined to be haplosufficient; 4 were haploinsufficient, and 1 was con   ditional haploinsufficient. The effects of the non haploid state in the  remaining genes were unknown. Critical regions for aural atresia, renal  abnormalities, growth hormone deficiency, and dysmyelination were  also included on the custom track. This map allows clinicians to align  the molecular karyotype information from an individual patient with the  annotated genomic content so as to provide a clinical prognosis. Thus,  we have taken the first step towards creating a genomic map that may  be used in counseling and directing care of individuals with chromo   some 18 abnormalities.",2009

The ears were simple  with prominent superior and inferior crus of antihelix and the stem of  antihelix. The mouth was held open with tented upper lip. The palate  was extremely narrow but without clefting. Microretrognathia was evi   dent. He also had an extremely anteriorly placed anus. The genitalia  were otherwise normal. The rest of the clinical examination, including  the extremities, was normal. Head CT and MRI revealed craniosyn   ostosis of the coronal, lamdoid and metopic sutures and partial fu   sion of the sagittal suture, a fenestrated lacuna skull with ventriculo   megaly and a hypoplastic corpus callosum. Skeletal survey showed  no spine and limb anomalies. He had an abnormal male karyotype  46,XY,del(7)(p15.1p21) but parental karyotype was normal.

In a female child with general retardation and facial dys   morphisms a microduplication 19p13.3 was identified. Chromosome  analysis in the parents showed that the mother is carrier of a small  balanced translocation t(14;19)(p11;1;p13.3). Case report: AF, the second child of healthy parents, was born in May  2005 in the 38th week of gestation (38+0). She was small for gestation   al age (birth weight 1.825g, length 43cm, head circumference 28cm    all < 3rd percentile) and showed facial dysmorphisms. At the age of  one year chromosome analysis revealed a normal female karyotype  (400 band stage). AF was presented again at the age of 3 years and  2 months at our genetic counselling unit. Weight was 10,8 kg, height  93cm and head circumference 38cm. She showed a developmental  delay and was able to speak only few words. Methods and results: Oligonucleotid based array CGH on Agilent 44K  arrays revealed a 4,68Mb microduplication in 19p13.3 deriving from  a cytogenetically balanced translocation t(14;19)(p11.1;p13.3) in the mother.

mandibular dysmorphology in prenatal trisomy 18,P03.113,"L. Caspersen1, U. Engel2, I. Kjaer1","1Department of Orthodontics, Copenhagen, Denmark, 2Department of Pathol   ogy, Hvidovre University Hospital, Copenhagen, Denmark","Introduction: Among 2nd trimester aborted foetuses, trisomy 18 is  one of the most common autosomal trisomies. By ultrasonography it  may be difficult to distinguish between trisomy 18 and trisomy 13. Ac   cording to Keeling (1994), the prenatal trisomy 18 head is globular in  shape, with hypertelorism, a broad up turned nose, micrognathia and  backwards sloping abnormal ears. Short nasal bones have also been  reported. The purpose of this preliminary study is to add phenotypic character  Cytogenetics istics to prenatal trisomy 18 by evaluating the mandibular morphology,  easily recognisable by ultrasound. Material and methods: Lateral faxitron radiographs of 13 postmortem  trisomy 18 foetuses (mean GA,17 weeks) were compared with simi   lar radiographic exposures of 8 postmortem normal foetuses (mean  GA,16 weeks). The mandibular morphology in the lateral view was  expressed by measuring the mandibular angle (also named the gonial  angle), which is the angle between the tangent to the mandibular basis  and the tangent to the posterior contour of the mandible. Results: Gonial angle in trisomy 18: Mean 154.4Âº (SD,5.8). Gonial  angle in normal foetuses: Mean 135.0Âº (SD,6.1). Tested by unpaired  t test P<0.001. Conclusion: The size of the gonial angle, measured in this preliminary  study, is significantly larger in trisomy 18 when compared to normal.  The gonial angle is easy to recognize and measure during ultrasonog   raphy and accordingly, this enlarged angle seems to be a new valuable  dysmorphic feature in trisomy 18.

We report on a 3 year old boy with mental retardation, cerebral dys   myelination and dysmorphic features, bearing a distal deletion of 18q:  18q21 qter. Karyotype analysis was performed on peripheral blood lymphocytes,  by GTG banding. Painting probe for chromosome 18 and bacterial arti   ficial chromosome probe (BAC FISH probe) for 18q23 (RP11 248M19)  were applied for molecular characterization. Clinical features at presentation were severe mental retardation, se   vere speech delay, hypotonia, facial dysmorphism (broad forehead,  broad nasal bridge, thin lips, micrognathia) and clynodactily of 5th  finger. Brain MRI showed cerebral myelination defects. Severe hypo   gammaglobulinemia, responsible for repeated febrile episodes, was  also detected. Chromosomal studies revealed a deletion of the distal fragment of  chromosome 18q ranging from band q21 to qter. Painting FISH for  chromosome 18 ruled out cryptic rearrangements involving other chro   mosomes. The terminal 18q deletion was confirmed by FISH with sub   telomeric probe RP11 248M19. In conclusion, a large terminal deletion of 18q was detected in a pa   tient displaying major phenotypic features of 18q  syndrome. Further  delineating the deleted region in our case might contribute to a better  phenotype genotype correlation.

Cytogenetic slides were obtained from peripheral blood cultures, by  standard protocols. For FISH investigations painting probes WC4  (Kreatech) and BAC probes (RP11 338K13, RP11 472B18) were  used. BAC array CGH using CytoChip was applied on DNA extracted  from peripheral blood with Wizard Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Pro   mega). Classical cytogenetic analysis revealed an interstitial 4p deletion.  Painting probes for chromosome 4 excluded rearragements involving  others chromosomes. BAC array CGH was applied for a precise de   lineation of the deleted region. Proximal and distal breakpoints were  established at 4p15.2 and 4p16.2 respectively. Array CGH result were  further confirmed by FISH with BAC RP11 338K13 and RP11 472B18  probes. Parental karyotypes were normal. To our knowledge, an association of the described phenotype and  del(4)(p15.2p16.2) has not been described so far. Our results also  strongly support the need for use of various cytogenetic and advanced  molecular techniques, for a correct phenotype/genotype correlation.",2009

Hajianpour","Genzyme Genetics, Monrovia, CA, United States","Individuals with balanced reciprocal translocations are at risk for ad   verse pregnancy outcomes due to aberrant meiotic segregation. Per   forming PGD by interphase FISH can decrease the risk by selectively  transferring only normal or balanced embryos. We show that as long  as one subtelomere probe for FISH analysis is targeted at one of the  two translocation segments, the second subtelomere probe can be di   rected to any of the remaining three subtelomeres. In combination with  an appropriately selected centromeric probe, the tri color probe set  can detect all unbalanced segregants. The feasibility of using subtelo   meric probes other than those for the two translocated segments has  practical value; if one probe is unavailable or if the signal is subopti   mal, an alternate probe can be substituted. When centromeric probe  in a third color is not available, a two hybridization protocol performed  sequentially will be necessary to detect all unbalanced segregants.  This is achieved by using dual color short and long arm subtelomere  probes of one chromosome followed by a second hybridization with  the subtelomere probes of the other chromosome. This general guideline cannot be applied to two types of reciprocal  translocations: cases with centromere break and cases in which the  breakpoint is distal to the available subtelomere probe. The interphase  FISH signal pattern in such cases cannot be predicted by examining  the karyotype alone. It is therefore imperative that pre PGD interphase  and metaphase FISH analyses be performed on all translocation carri   ers to confirm that probes selected for PGD are appropriate.

","Background Tetrasomy 9p is a rare dysmorphic syndrome with approximately 40  cases described to date, both mosaic and non mosaic cases. We re   port a 3 years old child who has a mosaic isochromosome 9p detected  postnatally. Clinical findings and cytogenetic results are presented and  compared to reports of mosaic patients previously published. Case Report Second son of non consanguineous healthy parents, with an irrelevant  family history. The mother was 39 years old at the date of the birth.  No foetal anomalies were detected by repeated ultrasounds. Physi   cal examination at birth revealed normal somatometry and cleft lip.  Growth retardation, global mild psychomotor delay, hydronefrosis and  hydrocele were noted later. At a Medical Genetics consultation facial  dysmorphic features were observed. Height and weight under the 5th  centile, microcephaly, and small hands were confirmed. Cytogenetics Analysis GTG banded chromosome study from lymphocyte cultures of the pa   tient revealed mos 47,XY, +i(9)(pter >p10::p10 >pter)[25]/46,XY[5].  This supernumerary structurally anomalous chromosome contains a  mirror duplication of the short arm of chromosome 9, with one centro   mere. Parental karyotypes were normal. Discussion Most secondary isochromosome formation originates from primary tri   somy 9 due to maternal meiosis II nondisjunction. Isochromosome for  the short arm is often found in mosaicism, since it results of a telocen   tric chromosome with centromere instability. Mosaicism of tetrasomy  9p presents genetic counselling problems, especially if it is de novo  and diagnosed prenatally. The extent of mosaicism does not allow pre   dicting severity of phenotype, but mosaic cases tend to have increased  probability of survival compared to non mosaic cases.",2009

Variegated silencing of a large Xq region in a case of balanced  X;2 translocation,P03.143,"A. Conti, R. Genesio, F. Fabbrini, A. Izzo, V. Ronga, A. Mormile, D. Melis, L.

CGH by Affymetrix SNP array 6.0 excluded microdeletions, microdu   plications and loss of heterozygosity at the breakpoints. Methylation  analysis at the androgen receptor locus showed completely skewed X  inactivation in the proband lymphocytes. BrdU immunostaining assay,  combined with in situ hybridization using whole chromosome 2 paint   ing, demonstrated that the normal X chromosome was late replicating  in 100% of the metaphases from lymphocytes, thus excluding auto   some inactivation. The same analysis, performed in skin fibroblasts,  showed a late replication also in part of the Xq region translocated to  chromosome 2q, in 60% of the metaphases, suggesting gene silencing  in this region. Analysis of histone H3 lysine methylation confirmed the  partial inactivation of the translocated Xq region in fibroblasts. Quanti   tative RT PCR demonstrated downregulation of some genes mapping  to Xq24qter in the proband fibroblasts. As the altered phenotype can be ascribed neither to chromosome mi   crodeletions/microduplications nor to inactivation of the translocated  chromosome 2 region, we hypothesize that a mosaic functional nul   lisomy of genes mapping to Xq24qter, through a position effect varie   gation mechanism, might be responsible for the phenotypic anomalies  of the proband.",2009

De novo unbalanced translocations: how many of them have a  post zygotic origin?,P03.145,"M. C. Bonaglia1, R. Giorda1, M. Vitaloni2, R. Ciccone2, O. Zuffardi3","1IRCCS E.Medea, Bosisio Parini (LC), Italy, 2UniversitÃ  di Pavia, Pavia, Italy,  3UniversitÃ  di Pavia, P, Italy. ","Post zygotic formation of translocations is considered a rare event in  the absence of mosaicism. We have analyzed with array CGH and  microsatellites analysis of the trios eighteen de novo unbalanced  translocations. In four cases, we demonstrated that the derivative  chromosome was not deleted as expected but contained a distal dele   tion associated to a contiguous inverted duplication (inv dup del) on  which the second chromosome segment involved in the translocation  had been transposed. In the remaining thirteen cases the derivative  chromosome was deleted as expected but in three cases the deleted  and duplicated portions have different origin. Altogether, these findings  suggest that at least some de novo unbalanced translocations derive  from a dicentric chromosome. Asymmetric breakage of such a chro   mosome would result in the formation of an inv dup del chromosome  and a simply deleted one and both can be healed by telomere capture  from another chromosome either with different (50% probability) or the  same (50% probability) parental origin. The dicentric chromosome can  be formed, by NAHR and NHEJ, during gametogenesis or early em   bryogenesis. Mosaic situation with two or more cells line with different  derivatives, each one originating from the same chromosome dem   onstrated the existence of a dicentric chromosome in the zygote. Its  instability should lead during early embryogenesis to different break   ages leading to different cell lines. The most viable one(s) will survive  to term. This same mechanism of origin has been suggested also in  cases of inv dup del ring chromosomes.

Most of the patUPD14 cases have been ascertained because  of an abnormal phenotype. UPD14 can result from trisomy or mono   somy rescue during fetal development. Some cases are associated  with a familial Robertsonian translocation (ROB), where the affected  children were shown to carry the balanced translocation. We report an 8 month old girl diagnosed with patUPD14 and normal  karyotype 46,XX. Polyhydramnios, short limbs and small thorax were  detected prenatally. Post natal clinical features included a narrow  bell shaped chest, short limbs, contractures of the thumbs, blepha   rophimosis, congenital heart defect and dysmorphic features (deep  set eyes, full checks, vertical chin crease and short neck). Molecular  analysis confirmed complete paternal isodisomy of chromosome 14.  Parental chromosome analyses showed that the mother is a carrier of  der(13;14)(q10;q10). The proposed mechanism leading to patUPD14  in this patient is the duplication of paternal chromosome 14 in a mono   somic conceptus resulting from maternal meiosis I nondisjunction and  fertilization of a nullisomic gamete. The majority of published UPD14 cases with normal karyotypes were  not followed with parental karyotype analysis. As der(13;14) is the  most common translocation in humans, we propose that chromosome  analysis in parents of UPD14 patients with normal karyotype should  be considered to better determine the frequency of ROB in these fami   lies.",2009

","Beckwith Wiedemann syndrome (BWS) is a rare overgrowth syn   drome associated with an increased risk in childhood tumours. The  phenotypic variability in BWS reflects its genetic heterogeneity. This  syndrome is a multigenic disorder caused by dysregulation of imprint   ed growth regulatory genes in the 11p15.5 region. Accordingly, epi   genetic alterations, CDKN1C  (p57KIP2) gene  mutations, 11p15 paternal  uniparental disomy and 11p15 structural chromosomal abnormalities  have been described in BWS. The most commonly tumours reported  in this syndrome are tumours of embryologic origin such as Wilms tu   mours, hepatoblastomas, neuroblastomas, rhabdomyosarcomas and  adrenocortical carcinomas. Here, we report the case of a 10 years old patient diagnosed with  BWS, who developed an acute lymphoblastic T leukaemia. Lympho   blastic T leukaemia is rarer in children compared to the B  type.

Molecular diagnosis of BWS involved hypomethylation in  KvDMR or hypermethylation in H19 gene on chromosome 11p15.5;  while the RSS were resulted from hypomethylation in H19 gene or  hypermethylation in MEST gene on chromosome 7q32. Methods The methylation sensitive high resolution melting(MS HRM)  was used to analyze methylation within the KvDMR, H19 and MEST  gene. A total of 60 samples comprising normal control(40), BWS(13)  and RSS(7) DNA were bisulfite treated, analyzed and scored as hypo   methylated, hypermethylated or normal. Results were compare with  those derived by methylation specific PCR(MS PCR), methylation   sensitive multiple ligation dependent probe amplification(MS MLPA)  or sequencing. Results In MS HRM, the normal control would have two melting peaks,  representing the unmethylated and the methylated alleles, while the  patients would have only one prominent melting peak indicating the  methylation change. The results of MS HRM were 100% consistent  with that of the MS PCR and MS MLPA. Conclusion The MS HRM is a rapid, cost effective and sensitive meth   od for detection of the methylation changes in BWS and RSS. It may  also serve a platform for other epigenetic studies.Cytogenetics",2009

The term non specific or non syndromic  X linked mental retardation (MRX) was introduced to indicate a condi   tion segregating in an X linked manner in which male patients have no  consistent phenotypic manifestations other than MR. Nineteen genes  responsible for MRX have been identified so far. P106 MRX MLPA  probemix (MRC Holland MLPAÂ®) can be used to detect copy number  changes of several genes on the X chromosome that have been impli   cated in (non specific) X linked mental retardation. Mother, a daughter (11 year old) and a son (3 year old) were ana   lyzed using P106 MRX MLPA and a deletion was detected in AFF2  (FMR2) probe. Further analysis using conventional PCR techniques  and sequencing confirmed that members of family were carriers of an  expanded CGG region in FMR2 gene. Mother was carrier of an ex   panded allele with 70 CGG repeats, allele of daughter was expanded  till 120 CGGs and allele of son was 135 CGGs.

","Fragile X syndrome is the most common inherited form of intellectual  disability. The frequencies of full mutation (>200 CGG repeats) have  varied widely from 1/ 2,000 to 1/ 8,000 depending on the nature of  ascertainment. There remains uncertainty regarding the premutation  allele frequencies due in part to lingering issues of ascertainment bias,  but also to real frequency differences across ethnic and regional popu   lations. Setting and Methods : We report results of a newborn screening study  of 5,267 male blood spots collected from Castilla y Leon, the Northwest  region of Spain. The blood spots were screened by a rapid PCR based  method that is capable of identifying the presence of all expanded al   leles categorized as intermediate alleles (45 54 CGG repeats), premu   tation (55 200 CGG repeats), and full mutation (>200 CGG repeats). Results : The most common alleles, 29 and 30 CGG repeats, within  this population accounted for approximately 38% of all. We found 199  gray zone alleles (1 in 26; 95%CI, 1/23   1/30), 21 premutation alleles  (1 in 251; 95%CI, 1/164   1/385), and 2 full mutation alleles (1 in 2,633;  95%CI, 1/714   1/10,000). Conclusions : The frequency of premutation alleles is three times high   er than the oft quoted value of 1 in 813 from an Eastern Canadian  population, and is fully consistent with the results of large scale Israeli  screening studies. Our results demonstrate that newborn screening  for the presence of expanded FMR1 alleles is an effective means for  defining the distribution of expanded FMR1 alleles in newborn popula   tions and is suitable for large scale newborn screening.",2009

Thus, in Iran, the relative frequency of FXS seems to be higher than  in Central Europe and other Asian countries, and much higher in pa   tients with unrelated parents. We also show that even in families with  consanguineous parents, FXS has to be ruled out before assuming  that familial MR is due to autosomal recessive gene defects.

We found nine unrelated cases with the fragile X syndrome and three  index cases (four patients) with ARX elongations. Given the relative  frequencies between both genes and the prevalence of the fragile X  expansions (about 1:5,000 males), the prevalence of ARX elongations  can be estimated in 1:15,000 males. The duplex analysis we propose offers several advantages: 1) An in   creased sensitivity of the fragile X screening in about 30%, with no  substantial cost increment. 2) As large fragile X expansions cannot be  detected by PCR, the amplification of another fragment with similar  size, GC content and presence of repeats, serves as internal reference  to differentiate mutations (expansions or deletions) from technical pit   falls. 3) Similarly, weak co amplification of a normal FMR1  allele can  be suggestive of mosaicism with full mutation. Although rare, mosaic  cases represent a limitation of any PCR based method for the screen   ing of the fragile X expansion.",2009
"FmR2 protein, whose absence causes the FRAXE associated  mental retardation, is a splicing factor",P03.158,"B. Bardoni1, M. Melko1, J. Gecz2, E. Lalli1, M. Bensaid1","1Institut de Pharmacologie MolÃ©culaire et Cellulaire, Valbonne, France, 2De  partment of Genetic Medicine, Womenâs and Childrenâs Hospital,, Adelaide, Australia","FRAXE is a form of mild to moderate mental retardation due to the  silencing of the FMR2 gene. The cellular function of FMR2 protein  is presently unknown. By analogy with its homologue AF4, FMR2  was supposed to have a role in transcriptional regulation, but robust  evidences supporting this hypothesis are lacking. We observed that  FMR2 co localizes with the splicing factor SC35 in nuclear speckles,  the nuclear regions where splicing factors are concentrated, assem   bled and modified. Similarly to what was reported for splicing factors,  blocking splicing or transcription leads to the accumulation of FMR2 in  enlarged, rounded speckles. FMR2 is also localized in the nucleolus  when splicing is blocked. We have recently shown that FMR2 is able  to specifically bind the G quartet forming RNA structure with high af   finity. Remarkably, in vivo, in the presence of FMR2 the ESE (Exonic  Splicing Ehnancer) action of the G quartet situated in mRNA of an al   ternatively spliced exon of a minigene or of the putative target FMR1  (fragile X Mental retardation & gene) appears reduced. Indeed, the  absence of FMR2 does not affect the total expression of FMR1 mRNA  but increases the expression of the isoforms containing exon 14 and  encoding a protein localized in the cytoplasm. The role of FMR2 in  splicing is not exclusive to its role in transcriptional regulation, since we  cannot exclude that the function of FMR2 is modulated by the interac   tion with transcription factors, as, shown, for example, for SWI/SNF,  a complex involved both in chromatin remodelling and regulation of  alternative splicing.",2009

The recent introduction of array comparative genome  hybridization in the diagnostic clinic not only enables to identify these  aberrations, but also to delineate the size and locate the position of  the different breakpoints. Comparison of the different sizes and break   points of the affected chromosomal regions permits a first correlation  of the genotype with the phenotype. However, human subtelomere  regions are gene rich and it still remains difficult to assign the contribu   tion of each individual gene within the deleted region. Recently, the  Eu HMTase1 gene was identified as the major gene causing the 9q  subtelomeric phenotype, by studying a balanced translocation involv   ing chromosomes 9 and X. Subtelomeric rearrangements involving chromosome 6q have been  reported in a limited number of studies. Although the sizes are very  variable, ranging from cytogenetically visible deletions to small sub   microscopic deletions, a common recognizable phenotype associated  with a 6q deletion could be distilled. The main characteristics besides  mental retardation are hypotonia, seizures, brain anomalies, and  specific dysmorphic features including short neck, broad nose with  bulbous tip, large and low set ears and a fish like mouth. We report  a female patient, carrying a reciprocal balanced translocation t(5;6),  presenting with a clinical phenotype highly similar to the common 6q   phenotype.

Remaining one patient with 2.7 Mb gain of low log2 ratio  revealed 1q12 1q23.2 gain of high log2 ratio which was compatible  with his marker chromosome. These findings suggest that a recurrent  breakpoint of CNV could be located 1.56 Mb from the 1p telomere, and  the log2 ratio should be considered when interpreting the array CGH  data in constitutional disorders.",2009

In the first three months  from the start off of this project we investigated the first four patients (1  boy and 3 girls) that were included in the study. The phenotype of the  patients allowed as according to clinical criteria to set the PWS diag   nose. For all patients FISH analysis was performed using Vysis Prad   er Willi/Angelman Region Probe   LSI SNRPN SpectrumOrange/CEP  15 (D15Z1) SpectrumGreen/LSI PML SpectrumOrange probe. For one  of the patients the deletion was positive and for the rest the result was  negative.

Two recurrent deletions are commonly reported: one between the  breakpoint 1 (BP1) to BP3 and the other between BP2 to BP3. We  have recently shown that approximately 10 percent of the 15q11 q13  deletions are atypical and involve other breakpoints. PWS and epilepsy is a rare occurrence reported in less of 10 percent  of PWS. Recent studies have shown that CHRNA7 gene (cholinergic  receptor neuronal nicotinic alpha polypeptide 7) which maps on chro   mosome 15q13.3 is involved in isolated epilepsy. We report a case of a young girl affected with PWS and epilepsy. PWS  was suspected because of neonatal hypotonia and craniofacial fea   ture. The diagnostic was confirmed by methylation analysis and an un   balanced karyotype 45,XX, 15,der(10)t(10;15)(q26.3;q13) was found  by cytogenetics analysis. We performed a Quantitative Multiplex PCR  Short Fluorescent fragment methodology to analyse ten markers of  the 15q11 q13 region including the CHRNA7 gene. We found a large  atypical deletion leading to the loss of the CHRNA7 gene. Our results  suggest that epilepsy in this case of PWS could be due to the hap   loinsufficiency of CHRNA7.

About 70% of individuals have  a paternally derived interstitial deletion of 15q11 q13. Two common  classes of deletion has been reported: a type I between the break   point 1 (BP1) to BP3 and a type II deletion between BP2 to BP3. The  deletion type status is commonly characterized by FISH on cultured  cells and/or by microsatellites analysis on both patient and parental  DNA. Because these two approaches donât allow the screening of the  entire critical 15q11q13 region we believed that other types of deletion  might be missed. We have recruited 66 PWS patients with routinely  diagnosed 15q deletion and we have analyzed the critical region using  a new molecular assay based on the QMPSF (Quantitative Multiplex  PCR of Short fluorescent Fragments) method. This assay includes  three multiplex PCR allowing amplification of 18 different gene mark   ers located from BP1 to telomeric to BP3 region. We found 16 PWS  patients (24 %) with TI deletion, 44 (67 %) with TII deletion and 6 pa   tients (9 %) carrying an uncommon 15q deletion. The ratio of TI/TII  deletion was consistent with previous studies. In conclusion, our QMPSF assay represents a powerfull tool for rapid  detection and characterization for small rearrangements in 15q11 q13  region.

Recent evidence indicates that recurrent breakpoints may be more  common than previously thought and mediated by non B DNA struc   tures, such as cruciforms, caused by palindromic AT rich repeats. The  clinical significance of these rearrangements may be underestimated  because certain rearrangements, most notably subtelomeric translo   cations, can be difficult to detect by conventional G banding. We report on two siblings of same sex and apparently normal karyo   types both presented prenatally with severe intrauterine growth restric   tion (IUGR). The mother had an apparently balanced translocation,  t(4;11)(p16.3;p15.5), and both sibs had an adjacent  1 segregation  variant with loss of terminal 4p and gain of terminal 11p regions which  was detected by aCGH and FISH using subtelomeric probes. Each  of these rearrangements is associated with well known clinical phe   notypes.

Longer repeats induce decrease of transactivation function  in the AR receptor and weaken an anti proliferative effect on various  steroid related tissues. Shorter GGC and CAG repeats result in higher  receptor activity of AR that inhibits the growth of these steroid related  tissues. In fertile men the number of CAG repeats varies between 10  and 35 while GGC repeats varies between 4 and 24.  Methods: A group of 108 infertile men and other composed of 99 sub   jects with proven fertility were selected to be used in this study. Dif   ferences in CAG and GGC frequencies were calculated with Fisherâs  exact test. P<0.05 was considered statistically significant.  Results: No significant difference was found between patients and  controls in distribution of CAG and GGC, when analysed separately.  However, the analysis of the joint distribution of CAG and GGC (table  1) showed that the distribution of particular haplotypes is significantly  different between patients and controls.  Conclusion: Small sizes of both CAG and GGC repeats seems to be  able to predispose to the male infertility while the bigger sizes, mainly  for CAG repeats, will be able to have a protector effect in male infertil   ity.",2009

We found on the rearranged Y chromosome 2 SRY signals, 2 Yptel  Signals and noYqtel signal. We concluded that the rearranged chromosme contains a duplication  spanning at least the region from the Yptel to the SRY locus which  contains approximately 2,7Mb. Our clinical data with these findings led us to study the AZF region. Us   ing 9 STS markers, we found a partial deletion. In fact, no deletion was  found in AZFa. However, in AZFb one STS marker (sY135) is pres   ent and two others (sY127 and sY142) are deleted. Markers (sY277,  sY158) tested in AZFc region are deleted. Thus our patient harbour a duplication of the Yp region (YptelâYp11.31)  and a deletion in the Yq region (Yq11.222âYqtel) associated to azoospermia. Few cases of i(Yp) have been reported but to our knowledge, this is the  first case with duplication of Yp and Yq deletion.",2009

Men with bilateral congenital absence of the  vas deferens are probable CF carriers and patients should be tested  for CFTR gene mutations. Additionally, sperm DNA fragmentation and  elevated aneuploidy rates are being increasingly recognized as impor   tant causes of male infertility. Our cohort comprised of 10 patients with severe and 10 patients with  moderate oligozoospermia. No patient had deletions for the 5 screened  regions of Y chromosome ( AZFa , AZFb, AZFc, SRY , Yq12). None of  the commonest mutations of CFTR gene was detected. All were karyo   typicaly normal. DNA fragmentation measured with TUNEL assay was  not significantly elevated compared to 20 samples with normal sperm  parameters and ranged from 2% 18.8% (cut off limit: 20%), with the  exception of one patient with 40.4%.

Maternal age has the potential  to be more evident in cases of multiple aneuploidy (MA) or polyploidy  (MP). To test the hypothesis, we have investigated the karyotype in  600 samples of SA by interphase FISH taking into account maternal  exposure to common environmental mutagens and maternal age. An   euploidy and polyploidy were detected in 50.1% of cases. Both MA and  MP were found in 9.4% of cases of SA.

PCR based restriction fragment length poly   morphism analysis was used to detect SNPs in promoter regions of  MMP 2  (rs243866, rs243864, rs2285053) and MMP 9  (rs3918242). All  statistical tests were carried out using SPSS 17.0 program (SPSS Inc.,  Chicago, IL, USA). Results: Women with MMP 2   735 (rs2285053) TC and TT genotype  had a lower risk (p,0.016) of developing endometriosis compared to  the CC genotype carriers. The distribution of MMP 9   1562 (rs3918242) Reproductive genetics genotypes and allele frequencies was similar in both groups. However,  after dividing patients into subgroups according to the severity of dis   ease (minimal mild and moderate severe) the multinomial logistic re   gression analysis showed women with TT genotype or TT/TC genotype  had higher risk to develop moderate severe endometriosis than CC  genotype carriers (p,0.013 and p,0.027, respectively). There were no  significant differences in genotype and allele frequency distributions  of the MMP 2   790 (rs243864) and  1575 (rs243866) polymorphisms  between studied groups. Conclusions: Current study showed that the presence of T allele in  MMP 2   735 polymorphism was associated with decreased probability  to endometriosis, while the T allele in MMP 9   1562 polymorphism was  related to elevated risk of severe form of endometriosis.",2009

In the present study, the possible deleterious effects  on imprinting of superovulation were evaluated in the mouse. Super   ovulation was followed by natural mating and in vivo development.  Then, possible methylation defects in the differentially methylated do   mains (DMDs) of 2 paternally (H19 and Gtl2) and 3 maternally (Peg1,  Peg3 and Snrpn) imprinted genes were tested in the male offsprings.  The CpGs methylation status within the 5 gene DMDs was analyzed  in the liver, skeletal muscle, tail and sperm DNAs by pyro  or bisulfite  sequencing. In the liver, skeletal muscle and tail of controls, the per   centages of methylated CpGs were close to the theoretical expected  value of 50% and no effect of superovulation could be observed. In  the sperm of controls the percentages of methylated CpGs were close  to the theoretical values of 100% and 0% in paternally or maternal   ly imprinted genes, respectively. Superovulation did not induce any  change in the numbers of methylated CpGs of Gtl2 and Peg3 genes  but, interestingly, induced a significant 6 % decrease in the number of  methylated CpGs of H19 and significant 2.5  and 5.3 fold increases  in those of Peg1 and Snrpn, respectively.

Certain trombophilia gene mutations have been associated with an  increased risk for recurrent miscarriages. Chromosome aneuploidy is  the most common cause of miscarriage. Mutations in folate related  genes can lead to DNA hypomethylation and abnormal chromosomal  segregation during meiosis (non disjunction). Thus, mutations in folate  genes might represent a risk factor for having a fetus with chromosom   al aneuploidy. We have developed a multiplex single base extension  reaction assay that allows analysis of 10 different mutations in throm   bophilia and folate related genes (Factor V Leiden G1691A, Factor  V A1299G, Factor II G20210A, Factor XIII G34C, PAI I  675 4G/5G,  MTHFR C677T, MTHFR A1298C, MTR A2756G, MTRR A66G and  FG Ã  455G/A) in one single reaction. The PCR primers have been  designed to give different fragment sizes (129 to 420 bp), allowing their  separation by polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Different length of  poly (dC) tails was attached to the single base extension primers to  allow analysis of all 10 mutations by one multiplex SNaPshot analysis.  The SNaPshot fragments were separated by capillary electrophore   sis. Using this method we have successfully studied 200 patients with  spontaneous abortions (138 Slovenian, 34 Albanian 28 Macedonian  women) and 208 controls (130 Slovenian, 38 Albanian and 40 Mace   donian women).

The simultaneous analy   sis of genetic variants of the MTHFR and TYMS  loci was carried out to  investigate a putative gene gene interaction that was initially observed  in an elderly male population from Norfolk.

","Uterine leiomyoma (UL), a common hormonal dependent benign neo   plasm, is thought to affect up to 40% of women during their lifetime. It  often leads to fetal wastage as the lesion undergoes a rapid expansion  during pregnancy. Identification of genetic factors that predispose to  UL formation could provide further insight into the trigger mechanism  and risk factors leading to itâs development. We examined the distribution of common polymorphisms in ERÎ±  (Thr397Cys and Cys351Gly), IGF II (C/T 820), p53 (Arg72Pro),  CYP2A13 (Arg257Cys), XRCC1 (Arg399Gln) and AR (CAG repeat)  genes among 146 Bulgarian women: 72 healthy pregnant controls and  74 women affected by UL during pregnancy.

The case control analysis showed no significant difference in the dis   tribution of IGF II, p53, CYP2A13, XRCC1 and AR variant polymor   phisms among patient and control groups. ERÎ± polymorphisms Thr397Cys and Cys351Gly showed a statistically  significant association to leiomyoma development during pregnancy.  The distribution of Thr397Cys genotypes in control subjects was as  follows: 23,9% p/p (+/+), 44,8% p/P (+/ ) and 31,3% P/P ( / ), while in  UL patients it was: 37,3% p/p (+/+), 44,8% p/P (+/ ) and 17,9% P/P (  / ), (P < 0.03).

Glutathione S transferase (GST) catalyze the binding of a  large variety of electrophils to the sulphydryl group of glutathione. Dur   ing pregnancy, changes in blood coagulation may play a role in the  occurrence of abortion. Factor V Leiden (FVL) gene, is associated with  a hypercoagulable state and increased susceptibility for venous throm   bosis. Factor II (prothrombin) gene is associated with higher plasma  protrombin concentrations.

There seems to be tentative autosomal trans factor(s) as   sociated with chromosome 16 and can control XCI. CCCTC binding  factor (CTCF) potentially can be the one. It is localized on chromo   some 16, has binding sites in choice and imprinting center (IC) of X  chromosome and in IGF2/H19 IC. So, we suggest that overdosage of  CTCF may induce hypomethylation of some IC. Firstly, we studied the  level of trisomic cells in extraembryonic mesoderm (EM) and cytotro   phoblast (CT) of 28 spontaneous abortions (SA) with cytogenetically  verified trisomy 16 using FISH. XCI and methylation of IGF2/H19 IC  were analyzed in the same samples. Sex ratio among SA with mosaic  karyotype (<90% of aneuploid cells) appears to be skewed with preva   lence of male abortions (1.25) while females prevail among non mo   saic embryos (0.43).

Telomere length is set to a maximum during early oogenesis.  One theory supports that telomere shortening may be mediated in late  exit from the fetal production line and long interval ovulation in the  adult thus causing reproductive ageing in women. Excessive telomere  shortening causes chromosome misalignment during meiosis. In this study, telomere length was measured in embryos on day 5 of  preimplantation development and correlated to chromosomal ploidy  and morphology. Embryos were donated from patients undergoing treatment in the as   sisted conception unit. Seven couples, generating 40 embryos consist   ing of 1111 cells took part. Quantitative fluorescent in situ hybridisation  (FISH) measured the average telomere length of every cell using a  pan telomeric probe.

Application of genome wide 250k sNP array analysis in prenatal  diagnosis,P05.03,"B. Faas , I. van de B, A. J. A. Kooper, R. Pfundt, A. P. T. Smits, N. de Leeuw","Radboud University Medical Centre Nijmegen, Nijmegen, The Netherlands","Objectives: We explore the possibilities for the application of the Af   fymetrix 250k SNP array platform in prenatal diagnosis. Patients/methods: 250k NspI SNP array analyses were carried out on  DNA from 16 fetuses (after TOP; n,11 or IUFD; n,5) and 3 newborns,  all prenatally karyotyped because of ultrasound anomalies and issued  as normal (n,18) or as carrier of a de novo  translocation (n,1). CNVs  (gains>200kb and losses>150kb) were categorized as either benign or  (possibly) clinically significant. Results: Aberrations were detected in 6 cases. Three were highly likely  clinically relevant and cytogenetically not visible: a de novo  2.9 Mb  loss in 17p13 (IUFD), a 5 Mb loss in 3q26.33q27.2 (TOP; de novo   t(3;18)(q26.2;q21.3)) and a maternal UPD 16 (live born child with  MCA). In a fourth fetus a CNV with (yet) unknown clinical significance  was detected: a 340 kb gain in 17q12 (TOP; no parental analysis so  far). Furthermore, in a case of IUFD with no fetal karyotyping pos   sible and mother being carrier of a t(4;22)(q12;q11.1), a 56.5 Mb gain  of 4p16.3q12 was found. In a newborn with MCA, a 22qter deletion  detected postnatally was further characterized and shown to be 6.1  Mb in size. Conclusion: In 6/19 cases, genome wide SNP array analysis enabled  the detection of imbalances that otherwise would have remained unde   tected. Its high resolution increases the reliability for detecting imbal   ances, but more knowledge is essential to improve the interpretation of  CNVs. Moreover, criteria need to be established for the conscientious  application of prenatal genome wide array analysis.",2009

It was found that 10 fetuses had the Dandy Walker malformation. 3  women were diagnosed before 22 weeks of pregnancy and 7   after  22. 4 fetuses were male, 6 were female. For 7 of the positive fetuses it was their motherâs first pregnancies, 2    second and 1   fourth pregnancy. The main characteristic used to determine a positive test was an en   largement of the cisterna magna greater than 10 millimeters, complete  aplasia/hypoplasia of the cerebellar vermis. 5 (50%) of the positive cases had fetuses that had hydrocephalus. 4 (40%) had chromosomal abnormalities: trisomy 18 (2) and mosaic  monosomy X (2). All of the present chromosomal abnormalities were  accompanied by defects within the corresponding patientâs central ner   vous system (CNS) (dysgensis of the corpus callosum, hyposplastic  brain hemispheres, polymicrogyria) and other organs (congenital heart  defects, clubfoot and omphalocele). 3 of the cases were accompanied  by porencephaly (2) and microcephaly (1), 1 of the cases had cleft lip  and palate. One of the positive cases had associated CNS and non CNS associ   ated malformation, other have short rib polydactyly syndrome type 2.  All of these results were verified through autopsy.

We  attempted to confirm this and simultaneously examined whether in   creased circulating cell free DNA levels are related to the clinical char   acteristics and laboratory parameters of preeclamptic patients. Study design: Circulating DNA was measured by real time PCR in  plasma samples obtained from 67 women with preeclampsia and 70  normotensive pregnant women. Standard laboratory parameters and  C reactive protein levels were determined by an autoanalyzer. Plasma  von Willebrand factor antigen levels were quantified by ELISA, while  plasma fibronectin concentration by nephelometry. Plasma malondial   dehyde levels were measured by the thiobarbituric acid based colori   metric assay. Results: We confirmed that circulating total free and fetal DNA levels  are significantly elevated in pregnancies complicated by preeclampsia  (median: 11.395 vs. 32.460 and 0.001 vs. 0.086 pg/ul; P < .001).

Patients And Methods: 58 patients (20f, 38m) with three positive 17OH  progesterone (17OHP) determinations, but no neonatal CAH signs af   ter evaluation by paediatric endocrinologists, who indicated the DNA  analysis. Serial determinations of 17OHP and clinical follow up (>1y).  Study of the common mutations (PCR ASO) and R426H (7% virilizing  forms in Spain) together with genomic DNA analysis for hybrid dele   tions/large gene conversions to detect hemizygosity, semiquantitative  primer extension for gene duplications carrying Q318X, microsatellite  typing to detect unknown homozygosity for rare alleles (complemen   tary sequencing). Results: CYP21A2 segregated mutant alleles were detected in 13 pa   tients: 3 compound heterozygous with I172N and null alleles (3 boys),  8 compound heterozygous with severe mutations and V281L, and 2  with two mild alleles.

","Preeclampsia is a potentially dangerous disorder specific to the sec   ond half of pregnancy, affecting about 2.5 3% of women. It is the most  frequent pregnancy associated disorder and still a leading cause of  maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity and preterm birth. Pre   eclampsia starts with placental dysfunction in the first trimester. De   spite extensive research on preeclampsia during the last decades, the  underlying pathogenetic mechanisms remain unclear. Identification of placental products rather than cells in the maternal  circulation has taken a drastic turn for the better by the observation  that cell free DNA and RNA originating from the placenta circulates  in a protected form in the maternal blood and can be obtained easily  from the maternal plasma. Recent studies on microRNAs (miRNAs)  offer possibilities for developing another class of molecular markers.  miRNAs are short (19 25 nucleotides), single stranded, and nonpro   tein coding RNAs  that regulate gene expression by binding to the 3â  untranslated region of the target mRNAs. In this study, it is aimed that detection of miRNAs which have the dif   ferent expression profile in maternal plasma in preeclamtic pregnants  compare to healthy pregnants. In the content of study, miRNA extrac   tion from maternal plasma of 20 pregnants with preeclampsia and 20  non preeclampsia healthy pregnants, detection of expression differ   ences by the use of microarray and expression analysis of detected  miRNAs by quantitative real time pcr.The comparison of the collection,  isolation and concentration approaches as well as detection can be  observed in detail on our poster presentation.",2009

Nagy","Semmelweis University, Budapest, Hungary","Background:  Lately a novel variable tandem repeat polymorphism  (TTTC) in the 5â flanking region of the natriuretic peptid precursor B  gene (NPPB) was discovered, which was associated with essential  hypertension. It has not been studied in preeclamsia (PE). PE is a  serious complication of pregnancy with hypertension and proteinuria,  developing in the second half of the pregnancy. We decided to deter   mine the tandem repeats of the NPPB gene in preeclampsia. Method : DNA was isolated using High Pure PCR Template Preparation  kit (Roche, Germany) from blood samples of 28 healthy pregnants, 17  pregnants with essential hypertension and 26 preeclamptic patients.  We used fluorescent PCR and DNA fragment analysis for the detection  of the NPPB geneâs tandem repeat units on ABI 3130. Results : We found that the distribution of the TTTC repeat number is  giving mainly two groups, one at 11 and the other at 16. We found low  frequency of the high number of repeats (n,16) in the control healthy  group (21.4%), while it was higher in essential hypertension (32.3%)  and preeclamptic patients (32.6%).

Increased number of TA repeats in the  promoter region of the bilirubin UDP glucuronosyltransferase gene  (UGT1A1 ) results in decreased bilirubin conjugation and is the princi   pal cause of Gilbertâs syndrome in Caucasians. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether UGT1A1 (TA)n  polymorphism was related to pathological hyperbilirubinemia of unex   plained aetiology in Slovenian newborns. Single strand conformation polymorphism analysis was used to geno   type 147 consecutive newborns with unexplained jaundice (total serum  bilirubin over 220 Î¼mol/L) admitted to the Neonatal unit of University  Medical Centre Ljubljana. The frequencies of genotypes were as follows: (TA)6/6 (42.9%), (TA)6/7  (37.4%), (TA)7/7 (16.3 %), (TA)5/6 (2.0%), (TA)5/7 (0.7%) and (TA)6/8  (0.7%). The frequency of (TA)7/7 genotype, which is characteristic for  Gilbertâs syndrome did not differ from that of the healthy Slovenian  population (p>0.05). However, in neonatal hyperbilirubinemia group  males had higher frequency of (TA)7 allele than females (p,0.045). It  is interesting that there were 69.4 % males and 30.6% females in our  hyperbilirubinemia group. In conclusion, frequency of UGT1A1 (TA)n polymorphism genotypes  was determined for the first time in Slovenian newborns with patho   logical hyperbilirubinemia. The extremly rare (TA)5 and (TA)8 alleles in  Caucasians were found also in Slovenians. Our results suggest that  male newborns with (TA)7 allele have an increased risk to develop  pathological neonatal hyperbilirubinemia.",2009

Many diag   nostic units are currently offering non invasive fetal sex assesment for  X linked disorders and Rh determination in Rh( ) pregnant women. As for the monogenic disorders, since the fetal DNA circulates within a  high background of maternal DNA, NIPD is mainly based on the study  of paternal alleles, absent in the maternal genome . This limits this ap   proach to pregnancies in which the father is carrier of an autosomal  dominant mutation or those in which both parents are carriers for dif   ferent autosomal recessive mutations. The clinical incorporation of NIPD for monogenic disorders must fulfil  the same needs of the conventional molecular prenatal diagnosis. We have studied 14 paternal mutations associated to different diseas   es: X linked retinitis pigmentosa, congenital Leber amaurosis, cystic  fibrosis, propionic acidemia and Huntington disease. The diagnosis was performed by the use of different analytical meth   ods currently used in the clinical practice.

SHFM is clinically hetero   geneous and can be either isolated, associated with other malforma   tions or part of syndromic entities. This condition is usually inherited  in an autosomal dominant manner and several loci have been identi   fied. Among them, SHFM3 has been located on 10q24 and the natu   rally occurring Dactylaplasia  mouse is the animal model for SHFM3 in  humans. Recently, 0.5 Mb tandem genomic duplications at chromo   some 10q24 involving at least the DACTYLIN  gene have been found  in SHFM3 patients. No point mutations in any of the genes residing  within the duplicated region have been reported so far, and it is still not  clear how this rearrangement leads to the SHFM3 phenotype. Indeed,  complex alterations of gene regulation mechanisms that would impair  limb morphogenesis are likely.

Due to the incidence  and severity of SMA and the availability of a carrier screening test, we  embarked on a stepwise prenatal SMA carrier screening program in  Taiwan. Methods A total of 70,048 pregnant women participated in this carrier screening  program from 2005 to 2008. In the first phase, we used DHPLC as the  single tool for genetic testing. In the second phase, we combined the  DHPLC and MLPA for the test. If a woman was found to be a SMA car   rier, her husband was asked to take the genetic test. If they both were  SMA carriers, prenatal genetic diagnosis was suggested. Results A total of 40,756 pregnant women received the single tool screening;  1,726 (4.2%) were discovered to be at high risk of being SMA carriers.  Of these 1,726 couples, 62 husbands were also at high risk of be   ing SMA carriers. Five fetuses from these couples were affected SMA  cases. A total of 29,292 pregnant women received the combined tests;  the results showed 603 (2.1%) were SMA carriers; twenty husbands  were SMA carriers. Six fetuses from this group were affected SMA  cases. This screening program cost $401,202 US dollars to avoid a  SMA affected child being born.

Methods: We reviewed all the consecutive cases of FEB diagnosed in  pregnant women living in Brittany and who were referred for an analy   sis of the gene responsible for CF ( CFTR ) over the period 1992 2007.  Results: Over that period, 289 diagnoses of FEB were recorded. A  pathology was evidenced in 32.2% of the fetuses. Beyond CF (8.0%),  it mainly included digestive tract malformations (7.0%), chromosomal  abnormalities (3.7%), viral infections (3.7%) and cardiac disorders  (2.9%). Regarding CF, we identified 23 CF fetuses and 19 heterozy   gous ones, leading respectively to a CF prevalence of 8.0% (1/13) and  a carrier rate of 6.6% (1/15) in fetuses with FEB (rates significantly  higher than in the general population).

MSI is a common feature of many human tumours,  whereas microsatellite mutations have also been reported in human  spontaneously aborted fetuses. Couples undergoing Preimplantation  Genetic Screening (PGS) are at high risk of meiotic and mitotic chro   mosome abnormalities. This study aims to investigate the level of MSI  in this group of patients. Materials/Methods: Fifty four blastomeres from 23 untransferred em   bryos from 5 PGS couples were subjected to whole genome amplifi   cation by Multiple Displacement Amplification (MDA). Genomic DNA  and single lymphocytes from both parents were subjected to MDA and  analysed using microsatellite markers in order to ensure that MDA did  not introduce any artefacts. Embryonic and parental samples were an   alysed using the BAT26 and D5S346 markers and the embryonic hap   lotypes were compared to the corresponding parental patterns. The  generation of any novel microsatellite alleles in the embryonic samples  was interpreted as MSI. Results: Out of the 54 cells isolated, 44 generated an MDA product.  The BAT26 and D5S346 PCR results of these MDA products identified  2/23 embryos in which a novel allele was detected. Discussion/Conclusion: This preliminary data suggests that MSI may  be present in embryos from PGS cycles and further analysis is war   ranted. Comparison with MSI levels in embryos from PGD cases with   out fertility problems would elucidate whether embryos at high risk of  aneuploidy are at increased risk of MSI.",2009
is nuclear transfer morally acceptable as a means to prevent  mtDNA disorders if it cannot avoid residual health risks?,P05.46,"A. L. Bredenoord1,2, W. J. Dondorp1, G. de Wert1","1Maastricht University, Maastricht, The Netherlands, 2University Medical Center  Utrecht, Utrecht, The Netherlands","Since the 1990s, different variants of nuclear transfer (NT) techniques  have been proposed as possible strategies for preventing the trans   mission of a mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutation from mother to  child. The aim is to provide prospective parents with genetically related  offspring without the mtDNA mutation. In a clinical application of NT,  it seems difficult if not impossible to avoid small amounts of affected  mtDNA to come along with the oocyte, pronuclei or nucleus from the  recipient woman. This potential carryover may result in the co exis   tence of two populations of mtDNA, also called mtDNA heteroplasmy. As long as it is not possible to carry out the procedure without the  accompaniment of small amounts of affected mtDNA, the resulting  embryo will always have a certain amount of mtDNA heteroplasmy.  Although in many cases this will be far below the threshold to disease  expression, the occurrence of mitochondrial disease symptoms cannot  be ruled out completely, especially not in the resulting childâs offspring:  due to the existence of a genetic bottleneck, the mutant load may rise  again in the third generation   the coupleâs grandchildren. We will firstly discuss whether NT is morally acceptable as a means  to prevent mtDNA disease if it cannot avoid residual health risks. Sec   ondly, we discuss the proportionality of the procedure and compare  NT with alternative reproductive options. Thirdly, as mitochondria are  transferred maternally, male offspring will not pass on the mtDNA mu   tation. We examine whether this provides a reason to only create or  transfer male embryos.",2009

According to the restrictive legal situation in Austria, preimplantation  genetic diagnosis is limited by law to polar body diagnosis (PBD).  Polar body diagnosis was therefore offered and used to identify bal   anced/normal and unbalanced oocytes. Materials/Methods: Polar body diagnosis using FISH (fluorescence  in situ hybridisation) was performed for 9 couples with the female car   rying a translocation during conventional IVF cycles. We used trans   location specific combinations of distal and proximal probes to the  breakpoint, which allowed differentiation of unbalanced and balanced  oocytes. Results: Polar body diagnosis was performed for 14 cycles of trans   location diagnosis (7 cycles for reciprocal; 7 cycles for Robertsonian  translocations). After PBD only 19 % of oocytes were diagnosed as normal/balanced  and 81 % showed an unbalanced chromosomal content. From 14 cy   cles performed, only 4 cycles (28,6 %) had euploid oocytes available,  71,4 % showed solely aneuploid oocytes. Conclusion: In this study, we found a higher than average aneuploidy  rate in oocytes of female translocation carriers. Interestingly, patients  with Robertsonian translocations showed more euploid oocytes than  carriers of reciprocal translocations. The high rate of chromosomally  unbalanced oocytes lead to the conclusion, that for carriers of mater   nal translocations who already need IVF treatment for infertility, polar  body diagnosis is a valuable additional selection tool. Screening for  imbalance in cases with increased risk of viable chromosome abnor   mality might help to decrease miscarriages and pregnancy termina   tion after prenatal diagnosis.",2009

This information  has important implications for reproductive decision making yet, re   productive choices must be weighed against broader ethical, legal or  social issues particular to each diagnostic procedure. Contradictory  views and opinions abound in different countries creating an incon   sistency in the manner in which PND and PGD are regulated. This  is due to the presence or absence of universal health care systems  and to demographic, cultural or socio economic factors that underlie  different regulatory approaches. The aim of this article is to provide  an analysis of current laws and policies regarding PND and PGD and  the regulatory trends in sixteen different countries: Australia, Belgium,  Canada, China, France, India, Israel, Japan, Netherlands, New Zea   land, Singapore, Switzerland, South Africa, Spain, United Kingdom  and the United States. Our analysis shows that, despite the similari   ties between PND and PGD in terms of their uses and outcomes,  PND is progressively considered part of routine prenatal care while  the various uses of PGD, although expanding, are being heavily scru   tinized resulting in the tendency for greater regulatory oversight by the  majority of countries surveyed.

Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) is offered to patients having  a risk to transmit a genetic disease to their offspring. PGD is frequently used for single chromosomal rearrangement, using  fluorescence in situ hybridisation techniques (FISH) on embryoâs cell  nuclei. In case of complex chromosomal rearrangement (CCR) PGD faces  two major difficulties, I) the chances of having an unaffected embryo  are low, II): technical difficulties are increased to diagnose all possible  unbalanced karyotypes in embryos.

In the prenatal setting, however, where starting  DNA amounts may be too low for array CGH, the feasibility of the tech   nology remains to be defined. Although whole genome amplification  (WGA) has potential for expanding the use of array CGH in analyses  of few nanograms of DNA or even single cells, further information is  needed about the putative bias WGA introduces to the genomic pro   files. Methods: We performed WGA on DNA samples and analyzed the  resulting genomic profiles by means of array CGH. The amplification  was performed with GenomePlexÂ® (SigmaAldrich) products using few  nanograms of DNA or few cells as a starting material. To assess pos   sible bias introduced by WGA, the amplified test samples were hy   bridized using both the respective native and an amplified reference  DNA as the reference. PerkinElmerâs Constitutional ChipÂ® platform and  SpectralWareÂ® analysis software were used in the array CGH analy   sis. Results and conclusions: Our results indicate that the Constitutional  ChipÂ® platform works effectively for generating array CGH data from  amplified test and reference samples. However, when native DNA is  compared against the respective amplified DNA, specific chromosome  regions continuously fail to amplify, especially as the amount of the  starting material is decreased. The results show that detection of an   euploidies is not hampered by the sequence drop out, yet micro level  changes may be missed owing to the biased amplification.",2009

Increased amount of cell free foetal DNA (cffDNA) in maternal plas   ma has been found in adverse pregnancies such as preeclampsia,  gestational hypertension, foetal chromosomal aneuploidies, placental  abnormalities, preterm labour and hyperemesis gravidarum. It was  suggested that elevation of cffDNA in maternal plasma could be used  for early identification of adverse pregnancies. The aim of our study  was to determine the elevation of cffDNA levels in GDM pregnancies  compared to normal pregnancies. In this study, twenty three second  trimester plasma samples from GDM pregnancies were compared with  fourteen control samples of normal pregnancies, all carrying a single   ton male foetus. The cffDNA concentrations were measured by quan   titative real time PCR amplification of SRY gene which is located on  Y chromosome, using TaqMan dual labelled probe system. The mean  of cffDNA levels for cases and controls were 3.47 and 5.64 genome  equivalents/ml, respectively. No significant differences ( P , 0.17) in  the mean of cffDNA concentration were observed between GDM and  normal pregnancies. In conclusion, GDM does not affect levels of ma   ternal plasma cffDNA. Hence, if cffDNA is used as an additional serum  marker in prenatal screening test in the future, our data suggests that  cffDNA quantity will not require adjustment for GDM pregnancies.",2009

Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) is a common way to create  polyploid cells and possibly occurs in response to cellular DNA damage  responses. Although WGD has been observed during telomere crisis  in hyper proliferating cells and telomerase deficient mouse embryo fi   broblasts (MEFs), telomere dysfunction in cancerous growth has been  mainly related to structural chromosomal instability. Our data obtained  from a panel of telomerase positive and negative human immortalized  cell lines show that the telomere defective Alternative Lengthening of  Telomeres (ALT) is characterized by significantly higher rates of in vi   tro WGD as compared to telomerase positive growth. Furthermore,  telomere dysfunction after depletion/inhibition of hTERT in telomerase  positive cell lines was accompanied by significant increase in the fre   quencies of WGD. In this context, reconstitution of telomerase activity  resulted in suppression of WGD. To test the generality of these find   ings we examined WGD in the ALT VA 13 cells containing a constitu   tive hTERC and a tet inducible hTERT. When telomerase activity was  induced in these cells there was an immediate increase in the rates of  dysfunctional telomeres and WGD. These results are consistent with the  view that the generation of WGD occurs gradually during telomere dys   function and can be triggered to be massive in a crisis interphase state  between different types of telomere maintenance. Our data suggest a  telomere related universal mechanism of WGD in neoplasia. In this pro   cess telomerase activity has both enhancing and suppressive roles.",2009

However, by the use of the 32K platform, the follow   ing recurrent genomic imbalances were observed: del(2)(p11.2p11.2),  gain of 8q and deletions of 7p and 9p. The minimally deleted region in 7p occurred at 7p12, which was lost  in two of our cases as well as in three DS ALLs from the literature.  Regarding the 9p deletions, the focal deletions of CDKN2A and PAX5   previously reported might well correspond to the deletions encompass   ing 9p11.2 22.3 in two of our cases and the common deleted segment  9p13 p22 in two further cases of DS ALL recently published.

BCCs occur  predominantly on sun exposed skin of elderly fair skinned people.  Several tumor suppressor genes and oncogenes have been implicat   ed in the pathogenesis of BCCs, most of them beeing members of the  Hedgehog Gli (Hh Gli) signaling pathway. Hh Gli signaling pathway is one of the fundamental signaling pathways  in embryonic development and is required in vertebrates for normal  development of many structures, including the neural tube, axial skel   eton, skin and hair. Normally, a secreted protein Hedgehog (Hh) binds to a transmembrane  protein Patched (Ptch), which causes release of another transmem   brane protein Smoothened (Smo) from its repression by Ptch. This  triggers a signaling cascade in the cytoplasm which leads to transloca   tion of the activated transcription factor Gli to the nucleus and expres   sion of target genes (Gli, Ptch, WNT and TGF beta family members,  various cyclins), involved in cell proliferation, while Ptch acts as a limit   ing factor by blocking pathway activity. Aberrant activation of the pathway in adult tissue is associated with the  development of various tumors (BCC, medulloblastoma, pancreatic,  gastrointestinal etc ). In our research we investigated mutation status of several Hh Gli path   way genes in sporadic BCCs. The mutation screening was performed  by high resolution melting approach, which is based on differences in  melting curves caused by variations in nucleotide sequence; detected  variants were confirmed by direct sequencing.

Well known etiological risk factors are oc   cupational exposure to certain carcinogens and cigarette smoking. It  is thought that the interaction between genetic factors and the environ   ment accounts for the different levels of susceptibilities to the develop   ment of bladder cancer. The cytochrome P 450 (CYP) superfamily of enzymes catalyses one of  the first steps in the metabolism of carcinogens such as polycyclic aro   matic hydrocarbons, nitroaromatic compounds and arylamines. This enzyme system is highly polymorphic and these polymorphisms within  CYP genes have been found to be associated with many cancer types.  In addition, frequency of CYP polymorphisms shows ethnic variations  among populations, so it necessitates population based studies.

For the improvement  of recurrence prognosis we analysed gene expression and identified  differences between superficial bladder tumours in a non recurrence  cohort during period of two years (19 patients) and early recurrence  cohort (18 patients), which might explain differences in the biology and  clinical outcomes. Data from microarrays containing 29,019 targets  (Applied Biosystems) were subjected to a panel of statistical analyses  to identify bladder cancer recurrence associated gene signatures.

Loss  of heterozygosity (LOH) on 1p and 19q seem to be a predictor of good  prognosis and chemosensitivity. Conversely, 10q LOH predicts rather  poor outcome.

Two cases (1 astrocitoma and 1 glioblastoma) were not analyz   able due to low quality of tumor DNA. All astrocitomas did not show LOH on chromosomes 1p, 19q and 10q.  Among the 17 glioblastomas, two did not show LOH, three showed  1p LOH, two 1p+19q LOH, one 1p+10q LOH, one 19q+10q LOH and  eight 10q LOH. All oligodendrogliomas exhibited 1p+19q LOH. MGMT  promoter resulted methylated in all oligodendrogliomas and astrocito   mas, while among glioblastomas only 6 were methylated.

The lifetime risk of any woman getting breast cancer is about 1 in 8.  Gene amplification is a common mechanism of oncogene activation in  cancers. Previous studies identified the chromosomal band 17q23 as  a frequent site of gene amplification in breast cancer. Amplification and  overexpression of oncogene candidates in this region are to be likely  important for breast cancer. USP32, a predicted ubiquitin specific pro   tease on 17q23, is one of the oncogene candidates. We hypothesized  that overexpression of USP32 may contribute to breast tumorigenesis  as a protein taking part in protein degradation pathways. We detected  amplification and overexpression of USP32 in MCF7 and BT474 breast  cancer cell lines. Presence of Cys His domain suggests that USP32  functions as a deubiquitinating enzyme. To experimentally confirm this,  we sub cloned three different fragments containing functional domains  of USP32 into a GST fusion vector. These constructs were tested in  vivo for deubiquitination activity and we demonstrated that this protein  is indeed a ubiquitin specific protease. To understand the physiological  role of this protein inside mammalian cells, we performed localization  and co localization experiments for full length and partial fragments  of USP32 by generating USP32 GFP fusions. For further localization  studies, we used Fluorescent Protease Protection assay which sug   gested that USP32 could be a membrane bound protein. Further char   acterization of USP32 will help us understand the role of this protein in  the cell and in mammary tumorigenesis.",2009

However, molecular links between  NS and stem cell self renewal, embryogenesis and/or tumorigenesis  are not well understood. We have previously shown that NS is highly  expressed in rat bone marrow stromal stem cells (BMSCs) and the  expression is shut off upon induction of differentiation. Knocking down  the expression of NS in rBMSCs suggests an apparently P53 inde   pendent role for it in these cells. Moreover, NS knock down in different  bladder cancer cell lines demonstrated a cell type dependent function  of NS in arresting cell proliferation in either G1 or G2/M phases of  cell cycle. Here, we have evaluated the potential expression of NS  in 40 tumor/non tumor biopsies of the patients with gastric cancer.

Mowla","Department of Genetics, Faculty of Basic Sciences, Tehran, Islamic Republic  of Iran","Despite significant improvements in cancer therapy, tumor recurrence  is frequent and can be due to a variety of mechanisms, including the  evolution of resistance and tumor metastasis. Cancer stem cells are a  subclass of cancer cells possessing parts of properties of normal stem  cells. The existence of these malignant stem cells has been proven  for hematological as well as some solid tumors. These kinds of cells  have a high capacity of proliferation and are not targeted by standard  therapy thus play a critical role in tumor recurrence, resistance to ra   dio  and chemotherapy. The Octamer binding transcription factor 4  gene (OCT4), encodes a POU domain transcription factor which plays  a critical role in maintaining pluripotency and self renewal of ES cells.  OCT4 expression has also been detected in adult stem cells as well as  a variety of cancer cells and cell lines e.g. the bladder 5637 cell line.  In this study, the OCT 4 promoter was cloned into the pGL3 control  reporter vector encoding the Luciferase gene, followed by transfec   tion of the resultant construct into the 5637 bladder cell line. OCT 4  promoter driven Luciferase gene expression was further detected in  the 5637 bladder cell line which suggests the activity of the OCT 4  promoter in these cells.

It has a functional counterpart on the X chromosome, DDX3X, and  both are involved in translational control of downstream genes and  control of G1/S progression during cell cycle. While DDX3Y protein is  exclusively expressed in the male germ line, predominantly in sper   matogonia, the DDX3X protein is found also in somatic cells, but in  the male germ line only translated in spermatids. Since the deletion of  DDX3Y  results in pre meiotic spermatogenic disruption, an essential  role of DDX3Y in spermatogenesis is assumed. Our purpose was to  examine if the mechanisms for translational regulation of DDX3Y  tran  scripts might be associated with male germ cell differentiation. Tes   ticular germ cell tumours (TGCTs) are derived from different stages of  germ cell maturation and therefore provide a model system for such  germ cell differentiation studies. Consequently, we used a TGCT sam   ple panel including the pre invasive carcinoma in situ  (CIS) to investi   gate the expression of DDX3Y protein in these specimens. Our results  revealed strong DDX3Y expression in CIS cells but a heterogeneous  pattern in other TGCT cell types. The strong CIS expression is mark   ing their high proliferative activity and clearly designates DDX3Y as a  novel marker for these tumour precursor cells. Overt tumours showed  only a small and variable number of DDX3Y expressing cells. An abun   dant expression in seminomas compared to non seminomas points to  reduction of DDX3Y expression during tumour progression. Our re   sults indicate a successive vanishing of the spermatogonia cell type  character of these tumour cells and suggest that the spermatogonia  specific DDX3Y translation is indeed controlled by germ cell specific  trans factors.",2009

With respect to the oncogenic potential, HPV are divided into âhigh  riskâ(HR) and âlow riskâ(LR) types. HR HPV invade ano genital and  oropharyngeal regions of the human body and cause one of the most  serious and the second most frequent cancer in women: cervical car   cinoma. HPV DNA carries information for proteins of an early (E pro   teins) and a late (L proteins) infection phase. Most serious is the inter   action of E6  and E7 proteins with the human p53 and pRb proteins,  respectively, leading to malignant transformation of infected cells. Within this presentation we would like to draw your attention to rela   tions between cervical carcinoma, HPV infection and detection. HPV  detection can be performed by different techniques: indirect detection,  showing us presence of altered tissues or cells. The most widely used  technique, but not the most sensitive one, is gynaecological cytology.  Direct detection, manifesting presence of HPV, uses (among others)  most sensitive molecular biology techniques, and makes HPV DNA  testing possible. We have tested 380 patients. 88 patients (23.1 %)  were found to be HPV DNA positive. Use of the HPV DNA test allows detection of HPV infection with high  sensitivity and specificity. Such result can more efficiently specify un   clear outcomes of other screening methods, such as cytology. HPV  DNA test has been already incorporated into routine screening within  several countries. This test can be used for pre vaccination (e.g. be   fore vaccination against HPV) examination too.",2009

Using a new total RNA based protocol, we SOLiD sequenced the  whole transcriptome of the tumor and normal samples, and exam   ined the correlation between copy number variation and changes in  gene expression. We found a significantly positive correlation (0.56)  between CNV and gene expression in a patient. Some genomic seg   ments with big increases in copy numbers in genomic tumor samples  also show significantly elevated expression levels in the tumor tran   scriptome compared to the normal transcriptome.

Somatic loss of PTEN  has been described  in sporadic human cancers: brain, bladder, colon, lung, breast, endo   metrium and prostate. Germline mutations of PTEN cause a spectrum  of autosomal dominant hamartomatous overgrowth disorders includ   ing Cowden syndrome (CS, #158350). CS is mainly characterized by  macrocephaly, facial trichilemmomas, acral keratoses, papillomatous  papules and increased risk for breast, thyroid and endometrial cancer.  Surveillance for susceptible malignancies is the mainstay of manage   ment these patients. Clinical Report: We report on a 58 years old male patient affected with  CS. He presented macrocephaly, sclerotic fibroma, menyngioma, gas   trointestinal polyps and renal tumour. At the age of 56 he was diag   nosed a high grade prostate cancer, already metastized (vertebral col   umn). Mutation analysis of PTEN  in DNA extracted from lymphocytes  allowed the detection of a heterozygous mutation in exon 5 of PTEN  gene c.388C>T (p.R130X). Discussion: Although CS is a hereditary syndrome of cancer suscepti   bility, guidelines of surveillance of this disease donât comprise screen   ing for prostate cancer. However, thereâs compelling evidence indicat   ing a role for PTEN  in the initiation and progression of prostate cancer  (due to loss of heterozigosity and/or cooperation with other genes).  This report highlights the importance of performing large scale studies  in patients with CS to evaluate the presence of (pre)neoplastic lesions  of the prostate, which might be significant. The confirmation of this  hypothesis would validate the inclusion of prostate cancer screening in  the surveillance protocol of CS.",2009

We have studied the significance of the  CDH1  160C/A variant in a promoter region for familial and sporadic  forms of gastric cancer. The association of homozygote variant  160A/ A with gastric cancer was shown for patients as with familial (OR,12,3;  p,0,03) so sporadic form (OR,8,4; p,0,02). In addition it has been  shown that the genotype 2076TT is associated with risk of a gastric  cancer in a presence of a genotype  160CA for sporadic (OR,9,8;  p,0,002) and the familial form (OR,12,3, p,0,009) but does not lead  to the risk increasing in a presence of  160CC genotype. It is interest   ing that  160AC/2076TT genotype have not been found among 112  healthy controls. In summary, mutations increasing cancer risk have been shown  more frequent in MLH1 and MSH2 genes than CDH1. The genotype   160AC/2076TT of CDH1 has been certain for the first time as a risk  genotype of gastric cancer.",2009

Iran.  E Cadherin is an adhesion molecule that is thought to be involved in  gastric cancer patients. Polymorphism at position â160 C/A has been  shown to affect GC risk in some studies. Material and methods: DNA was extracted from peripheral blood cells  according to the protocols. E Cadherin polymorphism at position  160  C/A was investigated using PCR RFLP method. Result: Fifty two cases (17 gastric cancer and 35 of their healthy 1st  relatives) were included in the study. Allele Frequency was 90.4 % for  C and 9.6 % for A. 84.6 % of cases were Homozygote (CC in 43 cases  and AA in 1 case) and 15.4 % were Heterozygotes (C/A in 8 cases).  A>C polymorphism was seen in 17.3 % of cases (in homozygote or  heterozygote state). This have seen in 23.5 % of those with gastric  cancer and in 14.3 %.of healthy one with gastric cancer in their 1st  relatives Conclusion: Polymorphisms in CDH1 have inconsistent relation  with gastric cancer studies. In the present study, the CDH1â160C/A Cancer genetics (rs16260) polymorphism have higher frequency in affected cases ver   sus their healthy related subject. Variation in allelic frequency in this  study in contrast to other population studies, suggests that this SNP  may be a good marker along with other SNPs.

Our objective was  therefore to describe variabilities in CDH1 related carcinomas. Sixteen families were identified with a deleterious CDH1 mutation be   tween 1998 and 2008 in our laboratory. One mutation was found in 4  unrelated families, all others were unique. Fourteen index cases had a  gastric cancer: 9 of diffuse type and 5 unspecified. Ages at diagnosis  ranged from 21 to 63 years (mean , 38). Two index cases were free of  gastric cancer but tested because of a bilateral lobular breast cancer  at age 42 in one case, and a rectal linitis at 23 years of age in the other  case. No family history of gastric cancer was found for 5 mutation carri   ers. Associated breast cancer was reported in 3 families (2 cases were  specified as lobular breast cancer). In one family, 6 of 10 mutation  carriers underwent prophylactic gastrectomy; all showed both invasive  and in situ signet cell foci. However the oldest mutation carrier who  declined gastrectomy was clinically asymptomatic at 64 years of age.  In a second family, 13 members were tested for the familial mutation,  and 2 of the 4 mutation carriers were free of cancer at ages 65 and 49  respectively.

In 317 cases,  Rad50  revealed two variants (Q426R, Q1011R) pre   dicted to significantly disrupt protein structure or function. Q426R was  observed in two families. These exons and exon 5, the site of a Finn   ish founder mutation, were analyzed in 600 controls: none of these  variants were found, though one additional likely deleterious variant,  N981I, was observed. In 353 cases,  Mre11  revealed two deleterious mutations (R576X,  R592X) and three likely benign variants (A492D, E497K, R576Q). One  probably deleterious mutation was observed among controls: W210G  concerns the same amino acid seen in ATLD patients homozygous for  W210C. No variants of  NBN  were observed in 250 cases.

Still unsolved is the major question:  how can these virus positive tumors arise from infected keratinocytes  in the face of immunity? Infection of keratinocytes results in the production of antiviral cytokines  via the activation of type I interferon (IFN) response genes and the at   traction of the adaptive immune system via the production of pro inflam   matory cytokines, all activated after the intruding virus is recognized by intracellular pathogen recognition receptors (e.g. Toll like receptors,  TLRs). We found that undifferentiated keratinocytes, which form the  basal cell layer targeted by HPVs, express only one intracellular TLR,  namely TLR3 (sensing viral RNA). A genome wide gene expression  study of poly I:C (TLR3 agonist) stimulated normal and hrHPV infected  keratinocytes showed a significant decrease in the activation of genes  for type I IFN and pro inflammatory cytokines (e.g. MCP1/CCL2, IL1B,  IL6) in hrHPV infected keratinocytes. In addition, genes encoding anti   gen presentation and anti microbial molecules were downregulated in  hrHPV infected cells. The presence of hrHPV increased expression of  cell cycle regulators, kallikreins, heat shock proteins, and tumor pro   moting cyto/chemokines. Results were confirmed by quantitative RT  PCR as well as by ELISA for cytokine production. Our data suggest that hrHPV interferes with the regulation of innate  and adaptive immunity induced by keratinocytes.

However, prior to the establishment of the International Neuro   blastoma Risk Group (INRG) Task Force in 2004, international con   sensus on markers, methodology, and data interpretation did not exist,  compromising the reliability of decisive genetic markers and inhibit   ing translational research efforts. The objectives of the INRG Biology  Committee were to identify highly prognostic genetic aberrations to be  included in the new INRG risk classification schema and to develop  precise definitions, decisive biomarkers, and technique standardiza   tion. Methods: The review of the INRG database by the INRG Task Force  finally enabled the identification of the most significant neuroblastoma  biomarkers. In addition, the Biology Committee compared different co   operative group standard operating procedures to arrive at internation   al consensus for methodology, nomenclature and future directions. Results: Consensus was reached to include MYCN  status, 11q23 al   lelic status, and ploidy in the INRG Classification System based on an  evidence based review of the INRG database. Standardized operating  procedures for analyzing these genetic factors were adopted and cri   teria for proper nomenclature were developed. Conclusions: Neuroblastoma treatment planning is highly dependant  on tumour cell genomic features, and it is likely that a comprehensive  panel of DNA based biomarkers will be used in future risk assignment  algorithms applying genome wide techniques. Consensus on meth   odology and interpretation is essential for uniform INRG classifica   tion and will greatly facilitate international and cooperative clinical and  translational research studies.",2009

Isolation of cell free  DNA from human serum is a big challenge because only nanogram  amounts of DNA are present in one ml of serum. In this work we tested the MBD protein to isolate and enrich methyl   ated DNA already during the DNA isolation step. Selective binding of  cell free serum DNA onto immobilised MBD directly in the serum would  enable favorable concentrations of DNA for further analysis. In addition DNA binding under native conditions preserves proteins for  additional proteomic or immunological analyses.Cancer genetics Upon recombinant expression the MBD protein was attached to nickel  beads obtaining binding of 1,35 mg MBD protein per ml of NiNTA  bead suspension (50%). After optimization DNA binding capacity of  immobilised MBD was tested in buffer and human serum; using 1Âµg  of spiked in human DNA we could retrieve 30% of the DNA from se   rum and about 75% from buffer. Binding specificity towards methylated  DNA was evaluated by PCR upon methylsensitive restriction enzyme  digestion, using several known differentially methylated genomic DNA  regions. Although published, MBD did not selectively bind methylated  DNA in a range of 0.1 0.8 M NaCl,  which might be due to immobili   zation. Performing the DNA isolation from serum using a commercial  kit, 10 17ng DNA per ml serum could be isolated and using the MBD  based strategy about 5ng/ml were obtained.

Moreover, NS siRNA treated 5637 cells  accumulated mainly in the G2/M phase, whereas SW1710 cells ar   rested in G0/G1. Our data indicate that NS expression is necessary  for cell proliferation and evasion of apoptosis in bladder cancer cells,  independent of its effect on p53. In other cell lines, suppression of NS  has been reported to cause alternatively G2/M or G0/G1 arrest. Our  data suggest that the precise effect of NS on cell cycle regulation may  depend on the functional status of RB1 and CDKN2A /p16INK4A.",2009

We in   vestigated the combinatory effect of 31 inherited functional DNA poly   morphisms in genes of factors related to angiogenesis, inflammation  and thrombosis in an attempt to predict the occurrence of OSCC in  Europeans. DNA samples were isolated from blood of 162 OSCC patients and 168  healthy controls of comparable age, gender, and ethnicity (Greeks and  Germans). Polymorphisms were investigated in genes that encode:  cytokines and their receptors (IL 1b, 4, 6, 8, 10, 18, TNF Î±, Î², VEGF,  Leptin, Leptin receptor), matrix metalloproteinases and their inhibitors  (MMP 1, 3, 7, 9, 13, TIMP 2), platelet glycoproteins and coagulation  factors (GPIÎ±, GPIbÎ±, PAI 1, AGT, ACE, TAFI, Thrombomodulin, Pro   tein Z, SDF1, Factors II,V,XII,XIII and MTHFR). A series of multivariate  regression models (adjusted for age and gender) was constructed in  order to assess the contribution of homozygous or heterozygous vari   ant polymorphic genotypes upon overall, early and advanced stages  of OSCC development. The contribution of TNF Î± and IL 6 polymorphisms was consistent and  robust in all regression models. When the mode of inheritance of each Cancer genetics variant allele was taken into account, five polymorphisms emerged as  primary predictors for all OSCC stages: TIMP 2 (OR,26.33), TNF Î±  (OR,15.27), IL 6 (OR,8.33), IL 8 (OR,3.54) and IL 10 (OR,2.65).  The contribution of these five factors in the occurrence of OSCC is  highly significant. Three of them increase risk more than tobacco (8 26  times versus 6 times, respectively). Based on these findings, possible  interactive mechanisms of implicated factors leading to OSCC devel   opment and an algorithm of risk estimation will be presented.",2009

Several studies  indicate that common polymorphic variants may increase the activity of  the enzyme and have a role in human prostate carcinogenesis. Materials and methods: We have investigated the association with  prostate cancer (PC) risk of four polymorphisms in exons 2 and 3 of  CYP1B1 in a case control study of 114 PC patients and 97 control in   dividuals with benign prostate hyperplasia and normal PSA level. The  polymorphisms were genotyped by direct sequencing.

Enhancement of the efficacy of Docetaxel with Conjugated Linoleic Acid in LNcaP prostate cancer cells,P06.073,"S. Kakawand1,2","1University of Aberdeen, United Kingdom, 2Charles University, Czech Republic","Prostate cancer is among the most commonly diagnosed cancers. The  use of chemotherapy in the treatment of prostate cancer has shown  promising results in improving the overall survival rate. The taxane  docetaxel (Taxotere) has proved efficaciously in controlling tumour progression by interfering with microtubule dynamics. Currently drug  supplementation in cancer therapy has resulted in improved response,  by minimising its toxicity. The Ï 6 fatty acid conjugated linoleic acid  (CLA) has raised interest as an effective tumouricidal agent without  inducing systemic harmful effects. The present study investigates  whether CLA supplementation would enhance the efficacy of docetax   el in androgen sensitive LNCaP prostate cancer cells in vitro  and  seeks possible genetic alterations in this process. LNCaP cells were  exposed to CLA followed by concurrent treatment with docetaxel for  24 and 48 hours. The cell viability was determined by MTT assay. Re   sults showed that higher concentrations of CLA enhance the efficacy  of docetaxel at 48 hour treatment time. Based on the involvement of  NF ÎºB mediated apoptosis, four genes of this pathway were selected.  From RT PCR analysis, it was observed that CLA supplementation re   duced the expression of MAP2K4, MAX, AKT1  and FADD  compared to  the effect of docetaxel on these genes. It is proposed that CLA supple   mentation reduces the proliferatory activities of LNCaP cells possibly  by docetaxel induced stress, resulting in the net antiproliferatory activi   ties of docetaxel not being opposed. The notion that supplementation  of chemotherapeutic drugs by fatty acids render cancerous cells to  undergo cell death more efficaciously, potentially sustains beneficial  prospects in cancer therapy.",2009

","Background: 5 10% of all breast cancers stem from hereditary pre   disposition to the disease. Mutations in two major susceptibility genes Cancer genetics BRCA1 and BRCA2  account for 20% of familial breast cancers. For  the remaining 80%, genetic factors are largely unknown. Recently, a  new BRCA1 interacting protein, RAP80, was identified. RAP80 plays  an important role in BRCA1 mediated DNA damage responses by re   cruiting BRCA1 to DNA double strand breaks (DSB). Objective: To investigate whether germline mutations in RAP80  are  associated with an increased risk of developing cancer. Methods: Mutation screening was performed by CSGE and direct se   quencing. For one of the observed alterations also functional studies  were performed to assess influence on 1) Ubiquitin binding 2) RAP80  DSB localization 3) RAP80 BRCA1 complex DSB localization and 4)  Genomic instability. Results: Mutation screening from 112 index cases of Finnish breast  cancer families revealed 10 alterations in RAP80 , one of which was a  novel exonic change. This novel alteration resulted in a dysfunctional  protein product that displayed significantly reduced ubiquitin binding  and double strand break localization after DNA damage. It also im   paired both BRCA1 and ABRA1 double strand break recruitment, thus  compromising BRCA1 mediated DNA damage response signaling. A  significant increase in cytogenetically detectable chromosomal aberra   tions, particularly chromatid breaks, was also observed.

CCRC is characterized by tumor suppressor genes inactivation owing  to several mechanisms including methylation. We have conducted the  study of methylation of the genes VHL, RASSF1 , FHIT , SFRP1 , and  CDH1  in 123 CCRC for the development of renal cancer diagnostic  and prognostic criteria. Methylation was detected by methylsensitive  endonuclease BstHHI digesting and following PCR, hypermethylated  samples were confirmed using bisulphite sequencing. Aberrant meth   ylation of VHL was observed in 14.6% (18/123), RASSF1    53.7%  (66/123), FHIT    54.5% (67/123), SFRP1    34.1% (42/123), and CDH1     43.1% (53/123) cases. Methylation of at least one gene from these  was detected in 85.4% (105/123) samples. CDH1  methylation was as   sociated with tumor invasion through the kidney capsule (P , 0.024)  and metastases in the regional lymph nodes and/or distant metas   tases (P , 0.001). It was found that RASSF1 was methylated more  frequently in primary tumors with grade G2 than G1 (P , 0.047). The  genes studied could be used with some others tumor suppressors for  formation of a diagnostic panel containing the genes frequently meth   ylated in renal cancer, and aberrant methylation of the genes CDH1   and RASSF1  could indicate a primary tumor progression on different  stages of CCRC.",2009

Subsequently, we established  that the resulting PRCCTFE3 fusion product acts as an oncogenic pro   tein, both in vitro  and in vivo . In addition, we found that PRCCTFE3  acts as a more potent transcriptional activator than wild type TFE3.  More recently, a functional cDNA screen revealed that TFE3 over ex   pression renders cells insensitive to the anti proliferative effects of the  G1/S cell cycle regulator pRB. We propose that also the PRCCTFE3 fusion protein may act through a cell cycle mediated deregulation of  proliferation. In order to identify downstream transcriptional targets of  the PRCCTFE3 fusion protein, we initiated to use chromatin immuno   precipitation (ChIP). Specifically, we are employing a recently devel   oped variant of this technology, called ChIP Sequencing, which com   bines ChIP with massive parallel sequencing to identify and quantify in  vivo protein DNA interactions on a genome wide scale.

","RET is a tyrosine kinase transmembrane receptor expressed in two  main alternative isoforms: RET9 and RET51. RET transduces a  positive signal leading to survival, differentiation or migration in the  presence of its ligand GDNF, whilst in absence of the ligand, RET is  cleaved generating a proapoptotic fragment which initiates a signalling  pathway for apoptosis. Hitherto, signal transduction leading to apop   tosis is still unclear. We performed a screening to identify the interacting proteins of the  long isoform of RET, using a modified two hybrid yeast complementa   tion assay, the split ubiquitin system against a human brain expression  library. One of the proteins we identified with this method was the aryl hydro   carbon receptor interacting protein (AIP), a tumor suppressor protein  recently found mutated in pituitary adenoma. We showed that RET AIP  interaction was maintained both in cell lines of different origin (human  embryonic kidney and neuroblastoma) and in pituitary gland in vivo. In  addition, we identified the pro apoptotic domain of RET as responsible  for AIP interaction, regardless of the presence of pituitary adenoma  specific mutations. AIP and RET genes were sequenced in 28 pituitary  adenoma but no relevant mutation has been found. Finally, we showed  that AIP RET interaction does not require RET kinase activity or kinase  dependent signal transduction and it prevents the formation of AIP  survivin complex.

In  particular methylation of CpG islands in the promoter regions of a large  number of tumour suppressor genes is observed in several human  cancers. Previous studies on Retinoblastoma (RB) tissues showed  frequent hypermethylation of the DNA repair genes MGMT  and MLH1   and the tumor suppressor gene RASSF1A . Methylation specific  MLPA (MS MLPA) has been recently described as a method that al   lows the simultaneous identification of epigenetic changes at multiple  sites.

Tumour tissues showed frequent hypermethylation of MGMT (70%),  MSH6 (60%), CD44  (50%), PAX5  (50%) and GATA5  (30%). Since  these genes are involved in DNA repair ( MSH6 ), cellular differentia  Cancer genetics tion ( PAX5  and GATA5 ), and cell to cell communication ( CD44 ), their  epigenetic silencing could play an important role in RB initiation and  progression.

Here we describe a mouse KO of Sdhd  as a model for pheochromo   cytoma/paraganglioma with 30 month follow up, and as a model for  carotid body mediated peripheral ventilatory insufficiency. The absence of live homozygote ( / ) offspring indicates that complete  loss of Sdhd  results in embryonic lethality. Knockout of the Sdhd gene  did not lead to tumor development at any stage of the normal lifespan  of these mice, in contrast to the highly penetrant phenotype in humans.

Breathing in small animals is regulated by central chemoreceptors lo   cated in the ventral medulla, and the peripheral chemoreceptors in the  carotid bodies. The carotid body is essential to the peripheral ventilatory response,  and loss of SDHD may affect carotid body function.

Cooke","University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom","Worldwide, one in three cancers is skin related and the WHO expects  the skin cancer epidemic to increase. Solar ultraviolet radiation (UVR)  by inducing DNA photo lesions, has become the prime cause of most  skin cancers. These cancers could be prevented if we protect our   selves from UVR. UVR comprises three main regions: UVC is absorbed by the ozone  layer and does not affect the skin. UVB is directly absorbed by DNA  and induces different forms of lesions like cyclobutane pyrimidine  dimers (CPDs). In contrast with UVB, UVA is indirectly absorbed by  DNA. UVA is suspected to play a key role in induction of skin tumors  and may be even more important than UVB in mutagenesis. CPDs  have been found to be induced in human skin cells exposed to UVA  through a different mechanism but the mechanism of CPD induction by  UVA is not clearly identified. Most sunscreens filter out UVB absorp   tion, but they cannot block most of UVA, so they do not help to prevent  skin cancer. A better assessment of the routes by which UVA and UVB induce  CPDs in DNA, may lead to prevention of skin cancer. For this purpose  in the present study by use of the highly sensitive single cell gel elec   trophoresis (comet assay) formation and repair rate of UVA induced  CPDs versus UVB induced CPDs was compared. Despite seeing a 10 fold greater dose of UVA, UVB induction of CPD  was significantly greater.

There is moreover increasing evidence that this  factor has additional functions in tumor progression. We have investi   gated the effects of siRNA mediated down regulation (knockdown) of  Slug in prostate cancer cell lines. Among the prostate carcinoma cell lines, PC 3 and PC3 16 subline  (kindly provided by the Homburg DPKK group) show the moderate and  highest expression of Slug. Therefore, Slug knockdown was performed  in PC 3 and PC3 16 cells. In each line, efficient down regulation at the  mRNA and protein level was achieved.Long term knock down of Slug  expression induced a severe decline in cell proliferation in both cell  lines, with a prominent G0/G1 arrest in PC3 16 cells. Apoptosis was  slightly enhanced in PC 3 cells only. SNAI2 siRNA treated cells did  not tolerate detachment from the culture plates, probably due to down   regulation of integrin Î±6Î²4. Moreover, suppression of Slug expression  strongly abolished invasiveness of PC 3 cells. Finally, knock down of  Slug expression disturbed both the microtubule and actin cytoskele   tons resulting in grossly enlarged cells with a jellyfish like phenotype.  Together, these data suggest that the most pertinent function of Slug  in the prostate cancers that express it, is to act as a regulator of cell  adhesion and cell shape maintenance.",2009

Aim: The aim of the present study was to study polymorphisms in  SRD5A1, a gene related to androgen metabolic pathway in converting  testosterone to its more potent biological form, dehydrotestosterone  (DHT),and their association with HCC. Methods: 300 HBV positive HCC male patients and 2000 male Chi   nese population controls were recruited in this study. Using the In   ternational HapMap Phase II data on the Han Chinese (CHB) cohort,  3 tagging SNPs (rs248807, rs11738248, rs824811) were selected by  spectral analysis. Genotyping of these three SNPs was performed us   ing Allele Specific Tm shift PCR method. Results and conclusion: The genotype frequencies of rs248807,  rs11738248, rs824811 followed Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (p>0.05).  The SNP rs11738248 was significantly associated with HCC  (X2,10.069, P,0.007) while the association for SNP rs248807 was  modest. However, the SNP rs824811 was not in association with HCC  (X2,0.54, P,0.763). All the result suggests that SRD5A1 gene may as   sociate with the development of HCC in men. We previously showed  that SRD5A2 isoenzyme was associated with HCC.

The functional relevance of this process is highlight   ed by pathologies such as chronic inflammation and cancer, wherein  occurrence tightly correlates with a dysregulation in mRNA stability.  Nonetheless only an handful of the regulatory factors involved in this  mechanism have been identified. Among these, Tristetraprolin (TTP) is  the prototype of a family of RNA binding proteins with unusual zinc fin   ger binding domains that binds to the AU rich sequences in the 3âUTR  of the genes promoting their physiological decay. VEGF and IL 8, two  main cytokines involved in angiogenesis and metastasis, are specifi   cally regulated by TTP. Here we investigated if TTP could correlate  with tumor aggressiveness in breast cancer and if it may represent  a novel prognostic factor for this neoplasia. By quantitative PCR and  Western blot analysis we determined the amount of TTP in different breast cancer cell lines, finding a low expression in two cell lines char   acterized by high aggressiveness and metastatic potential. In these  cells loss of TTP expression correlates with increased IL 8 secretion,  probably as a result of pathologically stable mRNAs. By sequence  analysis of the gene, we identified some genetic polymorphisms which  may be associated with TTP disappearance and performed both func   tional analysis and association studies in a sample of French patients  affected by breast cancer.

Three polymor   phisms have been proposed as modulators of TS mRNA transcription   al and translational efficiency: a tandemly repeated sequence (2R/3R)  in the 5â UTR, a SNP within the 3R allele and a 6 bp deletion in the 3â  UTR. Our aim was to evaluate the influence of TYMS  expression and geno   type on the clinical outcome of patients treated with 5 FU. We have analysed expression levels in healthy and tumour tissues,  the entire coding sequence in DNA from colonic mucosa, and the 5â  and 3â UTR in healthy and tumour tissues from 64 CRC patients. A statistically significant correlation was observed between tumor TS  expression levels and clinical outcome: low TS mRNA levels were as   sociated with longer disease free survival ( P,0,030) and longer overall  survival ( P,0,048), while no significant difference in TS gene expres   sion was observed between 2R and 3R genotypes. Linkage disequi   librium between the 2R/3R and the 6 bp 3â UTR polymorphisms was  detected, with a significant association between the 3RG allele and the  6 bp 3â UTR deletion allele. These results are in agreement with the growing evidence that the  control of TS may require multiple mechanisms acting in close coordi   nation with one another and with the suggestion that TYMS  genotyping  alone cannot predict response to 5 FU.",2009

","Irinotecan is metabolized to active form which is further conjugated  and detoxified by the UGT1A1 enzyme. The severe toxicities in pa   tients who receive irinotecan are related to its genetic variants, and  the serum total bilirubin (BIL) levels are useful for the prediction of  adverse reactions to irinotecan. However, the relationship between the  specific UGT1A1 genotype and BIL levels has not yet been confirmed.  Then, we studied 443 cases with no history of liver dysfunction to ex   plore their relationship. Genomic DNAs were extracted from peripheral  leukocytes after the informed consent was obtained. The assays for  genotyping the polymorphisms in the UGT1A1 (*6, *27, *28, *60) were  based on either Invader assay or direct sequencing. The frequencies  of *28 and *60 variants were much lower than those published results  for whites, while the frequencies of *6 and *27 variants were much  higher. Furthermore, 89% (24/27) subjects with hyperbilirubinemia  had *6, *28 or *60 variants.

","Purpose. We investigated a panel of uveal melanomas (UM) for the  presence of allelic losses at some chromosomal regions where struc   tural abnormalities had previously been found, and the methylation  status of tumor suppressor genes supposed to be involved in UM  pathogenesis. Methods. Loss of heterozygosity (LOH) at chromosomal regions 1p36,  1p31.3, 3p25.3 (VHL), 3p21.3 (RASSF1A), 3p14.2 (FHIT), 3q26.3  (TNFSF10), 9(p21.2 p21.3) (CDKN2A), 10(q23.2 q23.3) (PTEN),  13q14.2 (RB1) was investigated by PCR based microsatellite analysis  in 107 uveal melanomas. Samples were also analyzed for the methyla   tion status of VHL, RASSF1A, FHIT, CDKN2A and RB1 by methyla   tion sensitive restriction enzyme PCR. Clinical and histopathological  parameters were analyzed together with genetic abnormalities. Results. Monosomy 3 was detected in 48 of 107 tumors, and showed a  significant association with the presence of epithelioid cells (P<0.0001)  and ciliary body involvement (P,0.001). Methylation analysis discov   ered frequent methylation of RASSF1A (26 patients, 24%), predomi   nantly in UM without monosomy 3. LOH at all 1p markers was found in  25 samples and a statistically significant association with extrascleral  invasion of the tumor was determined (P,0.01). We detected infre   quent hypermethylation of CDKN2A and LOH at 9p21.2. Conclusions. We suggest that deregulation of the RASSF1A may be  involved in tumorogenesis in a significant proportion of uveal melano   mas. We point out an association of large scale 1p deletion with extra   scleral invasion of tumor, which is found to be independent of mono   somy 3. Inactivation of CDKN2A and RB1 with promoter methylation or  LOH is not the major mechanism of the pathogenesis in UM.",2009

Up to now, only three large rearrangements involving  the promoting area of the gene have been described in the litterature.  In this study, we characterize 18 large rearrangements in this promot   ing region from French families with a zoom in dedicated array CGH  (3107 oligonucleotides) and sequence the breaking points. We found 11 never described events from 6kb to 238kb.

Two  families have a rearrangement described in the literature (14kb and  37kb). A deletion to exon 2 was recurrent in 3 families. Two involved  only the promoting area of the gene and not the coding sequence (5kb  and 209kb). The analysis of the breaking points revealed some redundant break re   gions which could improve the understanding of those events.

Experimental Design: We genotyped 7,782 Polish breast cancer pa   tients and 6,233 controls for seven founder mutations in BRCA1 and  CHEK2 . Results: Of the 7,782 women with breast cancer, 1091 had one muta   tion (14.0%) and 37 had two mutations (0.5%). Compared to controls,  the odds ratio for a BRCA1 mutation in isolation was 13.1 (95% CI 8.2  to 21). The odds ratio was smaller for BRCA1 mutation carriers who  also carried a CHEK2 mutation (OR , 6.6; 95% CI 1.5 to 29), but the  difference was not statistically significant. In contrast, the odds ratio for  women who carried two CHEK2 mutations (OR , 3.9; 95% CI 1.5 to  10) was greater than that for women who carried one CHEK2 mutation  (OR , 1.9; 95% CI 1.6 to 2.1).

This is the first report  on preliminary results of high risk BC cases in Armenia where the inci   dence of the disease is the highest in the South Caucasian region. In  2008, BC cases with family history or with early onset of the disease  (before age 40 y.o.) consisted 6.3% and 25%, respectively, of all BC  cases, with an increasing incidence of the latter during last two de   cades. In our pilot study we recruited 46 high risk BC cases (18 familial  cases, 3 breast and ovarian cancer cases, 5 bilateral cases, and 20  early onset cases). Using SSCP screening method, we have found 2 BRCA1 missense  substitutions in 2 patients (Q356R, S694L) and one synonymous  BRCA1 polymorphism in other 2 patients (L771L). This is the first  report of S694V variant previously not reported in other populations  in contrast to Q356R and L771L. It is notable that all carriers of the  BRCA1 changes were early onset cases with no family history of BC.

This mutation was character   ized by high resolution oligonucleotide array CGH technology which  estimated the size of the deleted region and helped to find the break  point. Precise determination of the size and identification of the break  point were obtained with a specific PCR and the deleted sequence  was different from previous reports. Moreover, analysis of transcripts  revealed the only skipping of exon 3. Since this deletion is in frame,  the deleterious impact is largely discussed in the literature. Despite a  limited number of cases in this family, the segregation data seemed to  be consistent with a causal effect of the mutation. In addition to conventional DNA diagnostic testing by sequencing,  familial breast cancer patients can benefit from searching for large  rearrangements in the BRCA2  gene.

Data on life expectancy, breast cancer risk, efficacy of  prophylaxis and medical costs were obtained from published lit   eratures. The cohort simulation started with 25 year old women and  projected direct medical costs and outcomes over patients lifetimes.  Effectiveness was measured as life years gained (LYG). Only direct  medical costs (breast cancer prophylaxis and treatment of breast  cancer I IV stages) were included, assessed from health care payer  perspective and reported in PLN (1 EUR, 4.5 PLN in 2009). 5% and  3.5% discount rate was used for cost and effectiveness, respectively.

","Introduction: We started the first characterization of hereditary breast  and ovarian cancer risk in north eastern Romania, searching for muta   tions in the cancer predisposition genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 in high  risk families. Patients and methods: We identified and recruited 15 hereditary breast  and ovarian cancer (HBOC) families, with at least 3 cases of epithe   lial breast or ovarian cancer within the same family line. All patients  agreed by written informed consent. DNA was extracted from periph   eral blood. The entire coding sequence of both genes was analysed  using amplification and Sanger sequencing. BRCA1 was screened for  large deletions and duplications by MLPA. Multiplex PCR was used to  screen for certain mutations recurring in different populations. Results: We observed a recurring BRCA1 mutation in exon 20,  c.5266dupC. This mutation was found in two different HBOC families,  with different breast/ovarian cancer familial history and without any ap   parent degree of relatedness. The C duplication at position 5266 from initiator ATG creates a stop  codon at position 5484, truncating the BRCA1 protein upstream of the  C terminal BRCT domain. This domain is responsible for molecular  interactions with BRCA2 and p53, and is involved in transcriptional ac   tivation. Its deletion can be considered responsible for functional loss  of the BRCA1 tumour suppressor in cancer cases. Conclusions: This outcome, the first one in Romania, could open the  way for a population study to determine the frequency of c.5266dupC  in the Romanian population, and for an eventual founder effect. This  could also develop in Romania the oncogenetic approach and follow  up of BRCA mutations bearers.",2009

In total, pathogenic mutations have been identified in  154 families (33%). The spectrum of these mutations comprises non   sense (BRCA1: 21, BRCA2: 3), frameshift (BRCA1: 30, BRCA2: 56),  splice site (BRCA1: 7, BRCA2: 2), substitution (BRCA1: 5, BRCA2: 6)  and large deletions (BRCA1: 22, BRCA2: 2). Overall, the incidence of  large deletions was found to be approximately 5% in the patient group  screened to date, accounting for approximately 15% of the total muta   tion incidence. Variants of unknown significance were identified in 28  families and of these, 6 were present with a pathogenic mutation.

While the MMR genes MSH2 and MLH1 account for a majority of  HNPCC cases, the involvement of the MSH6 gene is continually ris   ing. Altogether, MSH6 mutations account for 5 10% of kindreds in  which MSH2 and MLH1 mutations are excluded. In contrast to HNPCC  families linked to MSH2 or MLH1 mutations, the families associated  with MSH6 mutations often display diverse and less typical clinical  features, such as early age at onset and high microsatellite instability  (MSI). Therefore, MSH6 mutation families are less likely to fulfil diag   nostic criteria such as the Amsterdam II criteria (AC II) and the revised  Bethesda guidelines (rBG), and are being underdiagnosed.

Clinical geneticists use  MSI tests when a family history is suspected for Lynch syndrome. To  increase the detection of Lynch syndrome, also pathologists select pa   tients with colorectal or endometrial cancer for MSI testing in case they  are diagnosed younger than 50 years or have a second Lynch associ   ated cancer younger than 70 years (Gut 2005). Methods: Index patients under suspicion for Lynch syndrome by a clin   ical geneticist (n,885) or a pathologist (n,406) were tested for MSI.  When MSI high, these patients could opt for germline mutation analy   sis in MLH1 , MSH2 , MSH6  and/or PMS2.  Results: Comparison of the group of patients under suspicion for Lynch  syndrome by clinical geneticists or pathologists showed a comparable  mean age at diagnosis of 49 Â± 12 versus 48 Â± 13 years (p,0.7), the  percentage of MSI tests performed in a colorectal cancer (others main   ly endometrial cancer) was 77% versus 96% (p<0.001), and right sided  colon cancer 69% versus 65% (p,0.9). MSI high was present in 16%  (144/885) and 18% (74/406) of the tests (p,0.38). MSI high tumors  were explained by the presence of a germline mutation in 58% and  40% (p,0.09), and by hypermethylation of the MLH1  promoter in 21%  and 26% respectively. Conclusion: These results underscore that family history taking con   tinues to be important for the detection of Lynch syndrome, but that  MSI testing based on age only is an excellent alternative, reducing  workload for clinical geneticists substantially.Cancer genetics00",2009

The remaining 15 cases resulted wt by sequencing  and 6 of these were not analysable by commercial kit (6/15, 40%).  Our results show that sequencing is the most reliable technique to  detect kRAS mutations. The commercial kit has an elevate rate of fail   ure (48%) and gives two false negative results. kRAS mutation status  might allow the identification of patients who are likely to benefit from  anti EGFR agents and avoid a costly and potentially toxic administra   tion of this treatment in nonresponder patients, that can be treated with  a different therapy.",2009

APC sequencing revealed a heterozygous  deleterious mutation within exon 15 (c.2099del, p.Asp700AlafsX18).  This mutation was inherited from his father who presented an attenu   ated form of FAP diagnosed at age 54. Analysis of APC in an index  caseâs brother detected, unexpectedly, another mutation of unknown  biological significance, affecting the same nucleotide (c.2099A>C,  p.Asp700Ala).

Since then, many  studies have been done to analyse the distribution of mutations in in   dividual populations and to determine the function of the gene and a  diagnostic approach to FAP. Here the APC gene was studied with re   spect to the occurrence of small mutations and large rearrangements  in 300 unrelated Polish FAP families. Ninety seven mutations were  identified in 164 families. Out of these mutations, 80 were small muta   tions, including 58 small mutations that were first identified in the Pol   ish population (42 novel and 16 described previously). An increased  frequency of mutation c.3927_3931delAAAGA was observed in 10% of the Polish group. Seventeen large rearrangements were found in  29 families.

In this study we will report on the first systematic  investigation of the APC gene mutations. Methods: Patients with FAP were enrolled into this study through re   ferral to our genetic counseling clinic. For genetic tests genomic DNA  was extracted from the 10ml of peripheral blood. Specific primers were  used to amplify coding regions of the APC gene. Amplicons was bidi   rectionally sequenced. Results: 25 probands was registered with the mean age of diagnosis  28.91and 64% male and 36% female. 52% had an autosomal domi   nant pattern of inheritance and 48% had negative familial history. 3  nonsense, 3 missense and 2 sense mutations were found.

Cytogenetic abnormalities  identify groups of patients with different time to progression and overal  survival. There are two main risk groups recognized. Low risk patients with nor   mal karyotype or 13q deletion as a sole abnormality have excellent  prognosis. High risk patients with 11q deletion and particularly 17p  deletion do not respond to conventional therapy and tend to have a  rapidly evolving disease.

Never   theless AML with none of the classical genetic changes do exist and  one can assume other genetic events in these cases leading to dif   ferent expression of the disease. Therefore we analyzed AML without  recurrent aberrations for possible candidate genes by array CGH. Methods: Bone marrow from cytological and immunophenotypical  confirmed AML patients was analyzed by conventional cytogenetics  (GTG Banding), FISH and PCR methods for typical aberrations indi   cated by WHO. DNA from inconspicuous samples was hybridized on  Affymetrix SNP 6.0 Arrays featuring 1.8 million markers, SNPs and  CNVs (copy number variations), one half each. The majority of gains  and losses detected by Affymetrix genotyping console 3.0 were CNVs  and excluded in our study. Results: About two thirds of the AML samples show at least one do   main carrying a potential tumor associated gene. These include, for  example, ZBTB16, IL1R2 or EPS8, which are important for regulation  of apoptosis, cell cycle progression, and signal transduction. Chromo   somal changes leading to the deregulation of the involved pathways  may potentially be causative for the development of AML.

Conventional karyotyping demonstrated a t(12;15)(p13;q25) confirmed  by whole chromosome paints. ETV6 break apart FISH proved an in   volvement of this gene. 3Â´RACE PCR was performed to characterize  the unknown 3Â´end of the fusion product.

Results: RACE PCR and sequencing analysis identified NTRK3 (neu   rotrophic tyrosine receptor kinase 3) as in frame fusion partner of the  ETV6 gene. NTRK3 transcripts encode either catalytically active pro   teins or truncated isoforms that lack the intracellular kinase domain.  The ETV6 NTRK3 transcript fuses ETV6 exons 1 through 5 with exons  13b and 14b of a truncated NTRK3 isoform and encodes a protein that  contains the amino terminal HLH domain of the ETV6 protein and C  terminal amino acids 529 612 of the NTRK3 protein.

This study assessed whether interleukin 10 (IL 10)   1082A/G,  819C/T and  3575T/A, tumor necrosis factor Î± (TNF Î±)   308G/A and transforming growth factor Î² (TGF Î²) c10T/C genetic  polymorphisms influence the incidence and outcome of diffuse large  B cell lymphoma (DLBCL). Patients and methods. The study included 94 patients with DLBCL  and 60 ethnically matching controls with no lymphoma in family. Ge   notyping was performed with ARMS PCR, RFLP and Taqman allelic  discrimination assays, respectively. Results. In DLBCL group IL 10  819CC genotype was more (Ï2, df,2,  p,0.0035) and TNF Î±GG less frequent (Ï2, df,2, p,0.0052) than in  controls. There was no significant difference in the incidence of re   lapse, presence of bulky disease and prognostic group according to  International Prognostic Index (IPI) in DLBCL patients with different  IL 10, TNF Î± and TGF Î² genotypes, excluding patients with TGF  Î² c10TT who were the most often scored as âlow IPIâ (better prog   nosis) (Ï2, df,6, p,0.0146). Patients with IL 10  1082GG (Logrank  test, p,0.0307), IL 10  3575TT (Logrank test, p,0.0404) and TNF Î±   308GA+AA (Logrank test, p,0.0184) had longer disease free inter  Cancer genetics0 val (DFI) than patients with other IL 10  1082,  3575 and TNF Î±  308  genotypes. Also, patients with TNF Î±  308GA+AA had better overall  survival (OS) (Logrank test, p,0.0371) than patients with TNF Î±   308GG. Conclusion. Homo  and/or heterozygous carriers of high IL 10 and  TNF Î± producer alleles were more susceptible to DLBCL (IL 10   819CC, TNF Î±  308GA+AA), but they had better DFI (IL 10  1082GG,  IL 10  3575TT, TNF Î±  308GA+AA) and OS (TNF Î±  308GA+AA).

Regulation of the leukemia associated oncogene and  developmental regulator EVi1 by all trans retinoic acid (A tRA),P06.173,"S. Bingemann , R. Wieser","Department for Human Genetics, Vienna, Austria","The EVI1 gene codes for a zinc finger protein with important roles  in embryonic development and in myeloid leukemogenesis. It is tran   scribed into several mRNA species with variable 5â ends. One of these  mRNA variants, MDS1/EVI1, gives rise to an EVI1 protein with an ex   tended N terminus and with functions partially different from those of  the shorter EVI1 protein type. The other EVI1 5â end variants are most  likely translated into the same protein, i.e. the short EVI1 protein vari   ant, but their variable 5â UTRs can be expected to affect the regulation  of protein expression. So far all trans retinoic acid (ATRA) is the only  known physiological regulator of EVI1 in mammalian cells. Using the teratocarcinoma cell line NT 2, we have investigated the in   duction of EVI1 by ATRA. Time course analyses showed that ATRA  rapidly induces the EVI1 mRNA in NT 2 cells. A maximum is reached  after approximately 48 hrs, except for the MDS1/EVI1 mRNA, which  was noticeably induced only after 48 hrs. This response was already  detectable with as little as 10 nM ATRA and affected all EVI1 mRNA  variants, albeit to variable degrees. Using reporter gene assays, an  ATRA responsive region of ~200 bp was identified within exon 1a of  EVI1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) experiments confirmed  the binding of retinoic acid receptors RAR and RXR to a retinoic acid  response element (RARE) in this region. We conclude that the EVI1 gene is a direct target of retinoic acid sig   naling and that its regulation via this pathway is mediated through an  intragenic RARE.",2009

Outcomes of the modulation of htERt gene expression in  promyelocytic leukemia as a model,P06.175,"E. Miri Moghaddam1, A. Deezagi2, Z. Soheili2",1National Institute for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB),"Zahe   dan university of Med, Zahedan, Islamic Republic of Iran, 2National Institute for  Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (NIGEB), Tehran, Islamic Republic of  Iran. Telomerase is a ribonucleoprotein complex. It consists of two main  components, telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) and telomer   ase RNA (hTR). High telomerase activity is present in most malignant  cells, but it is barely detectable in majority of somatic cells. The di   rect correlation between telomerase reactivation and carcinogens has  been made hTERT a key target for anti cancer therapeutic studies.  In this study, we evaluated the ability of the new generation of short  interfering RNA (siRNA) to modulate telomerase activity in the human  promyelocytic leukemia cell line (HL 60). Data showed that transient  transfection of the cells by hTERT specific siRNA resulted in %97.2 Â±  0.65 down regulation of the hTERT mRNA content. Whereas hTERT  protein level in treated cells were suppressed %49 Â±3.47 at 24 hours  post transfection. The results of Telomeric Repeat Amplification Proto   col (TRAP) showed that telomerase activity was reduced %86.6 Â±1.99.  Moreover, unlike most previous reports, the pattern of telomere re   striction fragment (TRF) length did not show a significant difference in  treated cells compared to the control samples. Furthermore inhibition  of the cell proliferation rate was about %52.8 Â± 2.3 and the apoptotic  index of leukemic cells was %30.5 Â± 1.55. In summary, inhibition of  hTERT exerted a direct antiapoptotic function in HL60 leukemic cells  which was independent of telomere length. It promises the develop   ment of new generations of drugs for cancer therapy.",2009

Incorporation of  deaminated nucleotides such as ITP or dITP into DNA or RNA can in   crease the frequency of base substitution mutation or alter their struc   tures. Also, it has been suggested that presence and accumulation  of these rough nucleotides can lead to genetic instability which is the  perquisite of different types of diseases or cancers. Inosine triphos   phate pyrophosphates (ITPase) encoded by ITPA  gene, is responsible  for protecting the cells by omitting deaminated purines from the free  nucleotide pool. The objective of this study was to examine the pos   sible dysfunction of ITPA  gene activity as an important factor in genetic  background predisposing to chromosomal disorders and malignancies  such as Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML). We studied ITPA   gene expression in CML patients and our results showed a significant  reduction of ITPA  gene expression in CML patients in comparison to  controls. Also two unusual variants of ITPA  transcript in addition to  expected transcript were detected in some CML samples. These un   usual variants were cloned and sequenced and their protein structure  predicted using bioinformatics software. It revealed that theses vari   ants have nucleotide deletions in their ORF region. The results of their  protein prediction showed that their proteins donât have the efficiency  of catalytic activity. According to decreased expression of this gene in  patients and presence of these unusual variants; it seems the function  of ITPase has been altered in CML patients.Cancer genetics0",2009

Here, we report that somatic mutations in the Janus kinase 1  (JAK1 ) gene, which encodes a cytoplasmic tyrosine kinase that non   covalently associates with a variety of cytokine receptors and plays  a nonredundant role in lymphoid cell precursor proliferation, survival  and differentiation, occur in individuals with acute lymphoblastic leuke   mia (ALL). JAK1  mutations were more prevalent among adult subjects  with T cell precursor ALL, where they accounted for 18% of cases,  and were associated with advanced age at diagnosis, poor response  to therapy and overall prognosis. All mutations were missense, some  predicted to destabilize interdomain interactions controlling the activity  of the kinase. Three mutations that were studied promoted JAK1 gain  of function, and conferred interleukin 3 independent growth in Ba/F3  cells and/or interleukin 9 independent resistance to dexamethasone  induced apoptosis in T cell lymphoma BW5147 cells. Such effects  were associated with variably enhanced activation of multiple down   stream signaling pathways. Leukemic cells with mutated JAK1  alleles  shared a gene expression signature characterized by transcriptional  upregulation of genes positively controlled by JAK signaling. Our find   ings implicate dysregulated JAK1 function in ALL, particularly of T cell  origin, and point to this kinase as a target for the development of novel  anti leukemic drugs.",2009

Montazeri","National Institute of Genetic Engineering&Biotechnology(NIGEB), Tehran, Is   lamic Republic of Iran","One of the major problems in treating cancer cells is that they can  acquire drug resistance (so called Multidrug Resistance: MDR). There  are several mechanisms responsible for MDR. One of the most impor   tant is the overexpression of ABC transporter genes. One of the most  extensively studied genes involved in MDR is multidrug resistance pro   tein 1 (MRP1). We have shown that the overexpression of this gene is  associated with the MDR in Iranian leukemic patients. However, MRP1  gene amplification could not be identified in any of those patients. An   other mechanism is the influence of the MRP1 gene polymorphisms on  the expression level of the gene. We aimed to investigate the possible association between the expres   sion level of MRP1 and occurrence of MDR in leukemic patients. Fur   thermore, we wished to test the hypothesis that MRP1 polymorphisms  would be predictive of MDR in patients with acute leukemia. mRNA  level of MRP1 was determined in 111 patients with acute leukemia  (including 52 patients with AML and 59 patients with ALL) by quan   titative real time RT PCR and compared to the type of response to  chemotherapy.

We found that high expression of MRP1 was associated with  MDR phenotype in both AML and ALL patients. There was no effect of  a particular genotype on the expression level of the MRP1 gene. This  could show the lack of dependency of any of these genotypes on the  chemosensivity in this group of patients.",2009

Fluorescence in situ  Hybridization Results of chronic  Lymphocytic Leukemia Patients,P06.187,"T. Bulakbasi Balci1, O. Ozer1, Z. Yilmaz1, H. Ozdogu2, F. I. Sahin1","1Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department of Medical Genetics,  Ankara, Turkey, 2Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department of Adult  Hematology, Ankara, Turkey","Cytogenetic abnormalities are found in 40 50% of chronic lympho   cytic leukemia (CLL) patients. Conventional cytogenetics is a basic  method for detecting various abnormalities in CLL. However, conven   tional cytogenetic analysis is sometimes not successful or does not  yield abnormal metaphases because of the low mitotic index of the  malignant cells. Fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) analysis is fre   quently used to increase the detectability of chromosomal aberrations,  since nondividing interphase cells can be analyzed in a rapid, sensitive  and accurate way by this method. We evaluated the common recur   rent chromosomal aberrations in 68 CLL patients by FISH analysis in  different combinations of the probes 11q22.3 (ATM) (n, 62), 13q14.3  (13S25) (n, 58), CEP12 (n,22) and 17p13.1 (TP53) (n,42). Of the 68  patients analyzed by FISH, 35 (51.5 %) had at least one aberration.  Five patients (7.35%) had two abnormalities and one patient (1.5%)  had three abnormalities. The most frequent aberration was 13q14 de   letion (45.8%), followed by trisomy 12 (27.3%). In 12 patients, all four  probes were analyzed and 10 (83.3%) patients were found to have at  least one abnormality; suggesting that analyzing all four probes might  be a better approach in evaluating CLL patients. Chronic lymphocytic  leukemia (CLL) has a highly variable clinical course and the genetic  abnormalities underlying this heterogeneity are frequently being inves   tigated. Along with the clinical markers, molecular cytogenetics is a  valuable tool to help predict the individual prognosis of the patients.",2009
the importance of complex chromosomal rearrangements in  evolution of patients with chronic myeloid leukemia,P06.188,"R. Mihaescu1, G. Cristina1, S. Elena2","1University of Medicine and Pharmacy, Timisoara, Romania, 2West University of  Timisoara, Romania","Background: Chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) is one of the most ma   lignant diseases studied because of the chromosomal aberration in  bone marrow cells of patients in chronic phase of CML. During pro  gression of the disease from the chronic to the accelerated phase (AP)  and/or blast crisis (BC), clonal evolution with secondary numerical and  structural aberrations is frequently observed. These secondary chro   mosomal aberrations are demonstrable in 80% of cases and consist in  some abnormalities being +19, +21, +7, +8, +Ph. The aim of our study was to investigate complex chromosomal rear   rangements found in the bone marrow cells of 25 patients with CML  by cytogenetic and molecular methods; to determine the chromosomal  parts which are involved in complex chromosomal rearrangements  during progression of the disease. Methods: Among 52 patients studied 25 patients were with CML and  complex chromosomal rearrangements (15 males and 10 females).  The study took place between 2002 2008. Chromosomal preparations  were made by standard techniques and G banding with Wrightâs stain.  We defined as a complex karyotype more then two chromosomal ab   normalities and/or more than three breakpoints. In some patients we  performed further molecular analyses using real time RT PCR. Results: Variant Ph translocations were found in 12 patients, the rest  of them had a classical Ph translocation associated with additional  structural aberrations. The most frequent chromosomes involved into  complex chromosomal rearrangements were found 11(x3), 17(x6) and  19(x3). Conclusions: Complex chromosomal rearrangements are associated  with poor prognosis and the genetic mechanisms are playing a role in  the progression to the blastic phase of CML.",2009

We investigated cytogenetic follow up features  of chronic myeloid leukemia patients who developed abnormalities in  Ph negative cells during imatinib treatment. In a cohort of 251patients with Ph positive CML treated with  Imatinib,5%(n,11) developed clonal chromosomal abnormalities in  Ph negative cells. The median interval of the first anomaly observa   tion was 15months(range;9 36months), thus, 5patients demonstrated  complete CR, 4patients had major CR, and 2patients had minimal CR.

Bulakbasi Balci","Baskent University Faculty of Medicine Department of Medical Genetics, An   kara, Turkey","Multiple myeloma (MM) is a disease originating from plasma cells with  low proliferative index. Plasma cells begin DNA synthesis and cell divi   sion in only advanced stages of the disease. MM is heterogeneous in  its clinical and genetic properties and cytogenetic studies are valuable  diagnostic tools in the disease diagnosis and follow up.

As in other hema   tological malignancies, cytogenetics is becoming a major prognostic  parameter in myeloma. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is  more sensitive than conventional cytogenetics for recognizing chro   mosomal changes. OBJECTIVE: To investigate the clinical signifi   cance and the prognostic role of 17p13 deletions and t(4;14)(p16;q32)  in MM patients. METHODS: We analyzed the prognostic value and  the clinical implication of FISH testing in 21 MM patients treated in  our clinic between January 2006   May 2008. Patients were tested  to detect 17p13 deletions and t(4;14). RESULTS: The positive rates  of 17p13 del and t(4;14) were 43% (9 patients) and 38% (8 patients)  respectively. Four patients (19%) had both two abnormalities and 13  patients (62%) had at least one abnormality. Time to progression and  overall survival was significantly shorter for patients with both t(4;14)  and 17p13 del, than those with del 13 alone (16.6 vs 23.5 month).  The risk ratio for t(4;14) was greater than for del 13 (2.4 vs 1.4) in  a multivariable analysis and they are relatively independent negative  factors for response to therapy. CONCLUSIONS: Interphase FISH is  a sensitive method to investigate the cytogenetics of MM. Del 17p13  and t(4;14)(p16;q32) can be used to predict treatment response and  prongnosis. Identifying high risk patients for more aggressive therapy  is a criticat step for improving their clinical course.

Rosanda, C. Panarello, C. Morerio",IRCCS Istituto G," Rearrangements involving IGH gene on chromosome 14q32.3 are well  known in mature B cell malignancies and have been more recently  described in BCP ALL. IGH translocations are usually reciprocal and  bring genes on other chromosomes into close apposition with the IGH  locus, where their expression is deregulated due to the presence of  potent B cell specific transcriptional enhancers. A two year old girl was  diagnosed with an ALL common type and treated according to AIEOP  ALL 00 Protocol. Death occurred after four months due to haemato   logical toxicity. Cytogenetic analysis of PB and BM blasts revealed a  t(11;14)(q24 â¼32;q32). FISH analysis with IGH break apart probe con   firmed the rearrangement of the IGH locus between chromosomes 11  and 14. Cloning by LDI PCR localized the breakpoint on chromosome  11q24.1 within the intronic region 1 of BC089451, a non coding gene.  Quantitative real time PCR showed over expression of BLID mRNA,  located 14Kb downstream the BC089451 gene. BLID codes for a pro   tein containing a BH3 like domain essential for apoptosis. FISH stud   ies performed with 11 close BACs to confirm the breakpoint junction  identified a 585Kb deletion on der(11), with complete SORL1 loss. The  functional consequence of BLID over expression due to IGH enhancer  juxtaposition is currently unknown. Mutational analysis of BLID BH 3  like domain is ongoing. The translocation to the Ig locus may result not  only in deregulated expression of the incoming oncogene, but also in  mutations due to the action of the Ig somatic hypermutation mecha   nism. In our case, a mutation of BLID in BH3 domain could result in a  protein not inducing apoptosis.",2009

We analysed 461 CLL pa   tients and an equal number of sex and age matched controls using  PCR followed by digestion with restriction enzymes. The odds ratios  (OR) and P values were calculated by logistic regression analysis. As  chromosomal aberrations are important prognostic markers in CLL,  we paid particular attention to 133 patients with the favourable cyto   genetic aberration del(13q) as sole aberration and 69 patients with  the unfavourable cytogenetic aberrations del(17p) and del(11q).

The KRAS gene is an onco   gene that has established to play a fundamental role in the colonrec   tal cancer therapy. It has been widely attested that novel therapeutic  agents, based on monoclonal antibody targeting the epidermal growth  factor receptor (EGFR), are effective only in a subset of patients. Acti   vating mutations in the KRAS gene are found in 30 40% of colorectal  tumours and are associated with poor response to anti EGFR thera   pies. Thus, the KRAS mutation status can predict which patient may  or may not benefit from anti EGFR therapy. For this reason in 2007  the European Medicines Agency granted a conditional marketing au   thorization for EGFR therapeutic agents intended for the treatment  of metastatic colon carcinoma with non mutated KRAS (Doc.Ref. EMEA/405113/2007). This decision led to the requirement of a KRAS  mutation test in the clinical practice and underlined the need for an  easy to operate test that generates quality assured, clinical grade re   sults. In this work we describe an inter laboratory validation involving  two laboratories and Applied Biosystems for a KRAS gene sequencing  protocol.

However, their  relation to patient clinicopathological characteristics have remained  largely unclear. We have sequenced exon 1 (containing codons 12 and 13) of the  KRAS gene in 101 EC and 5 EH samples. The mutational frequency was 16 / 101 (15.8 %) in EC cases and 2  / 5 (40 %) in EH cases. None of eight nonendometrioid EC samples  contained a mutation and have not been included in the following com   parisons. In EC, KRAS mutation was assocaited with grade one (6 /  18; 33.3 %; p , 0.04) and was more frequent in patients staged I/II (15  / 82; 18.3 %) and in tumors that had not infiltrated the myometrium (3 /  12; 25 %) compared to patients staged III/IV (1 / 11; 9.1 %) and tumors  that had invaded the myometrium (13 / 81; 16 %).

The test is based  on PCR in the presence of a wild type KRAS suppressor (mutant en   riched PCR), followed by hybridization of PCR products to teststrips  presenting a parallel array of allele specific oligonucleotide probes.  The performance of the StripAssay was evaluated on DNA obtained  from cultured cell lines, from formalin fixed paraffin embedded (FFPE)  tissue and from stool. Using serial dilutions of DNA from various KRAS  mutated tumor cell lines into normal DNA, each of the 10 mutations  was shown to be detectable at levels as low as 1%. DNA samples containing various proportions of mutated KRAS were  analyzed by the StripAssay in direct comparison to real time PCR, di   deoxy sequencing and pyrosequencing. While all methods correctly  identified samples containing 25% mutated DNA, dideoxy sequencing  and pyrosequencing failed to detect levels of 12.5% or lower. Both the  StripAssay, as well as real time PCR, unambiguously identified 10%,  5% and 1% of KRAS mutated DNA in the presence of excess wild type  DNA. The simultaneous detectability of 10 different mutations with excellent  sensitivity will make the StripAssay a very useful tool for the assess   ment of the KRAS mutation status in cancer patients.

Aim Of The Study: In cervical cancer of HPV infected women the  ATM,p53,EGFR,HER 2/TOP2A genes,are involved and affect the out   come of the disease. Recently two human telomerase gene locus,the hTERT (5p15.2)and  hTERC( 3q26)play a critical role. Patients: Twenty women 22 51ys were transferred to Cytogenetic unit. All they had a family history of breast/ovarian cancer and they had a  chronic cervical inflammation. They got a new PAPtest looking for the presence of oncogenic HPV  infection. Methods: Peripheral blood lymphocytes(PB )were cultured using  standard techniques.Thirty GTG banded metaphases were analyzed  (ISCN2005). For FISH we used 2 panel probes(1)LSI HER 1,HER2/ TOP2A/ CEP17,LSI p53,ATM(VYSIS). (2)hTERT(5p15)/EGRI(5q31)and hTERC(3q26),C MYC(8q24),SE  triple color probe(KREATECH). Two hundred interphase nuclei were counted for any single probe in  all. Results: High riskHPV16/18 was detected in the 2youngest pts,the in   termediate risk 35/39in10 and the low risk type 6/11in 8. The karyotypes looked normal.

Conclusions: (1)The presence of amplified genes in the PB lympho   cytes  suggest that there are malignant circulating cells. (2)During their 2ys follow up none has developed a definite cancer so  a permanent oncogenic stimulus or other co factors are required for  neoplastic transformation. (3)The gains of 5p15.2 and 3q26 are interesting given the presence  of the hTRand hTERT  genes,which can be the target for amplification  during the transformation of human malignacies.",2009

","Cromosomal aberrations and genes instability are two factors related  to the genetic instability of cancer cells. A  loss of tumor suppressor  function of p16 and p53 are the most common event leading to the  development of human cancers. Cromosomal abnormalities with lung  cancer may provide a valuable clue to the identification of target loci  and successful search for major genes. The aim of this study was to  investigate alterations of p16 and p53 genes and chromosomal aber   rations in patients operated on for small cell and non small cell lung  cancer by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and cytogenetic  studies. We performed cytogenetic analysis by G banding in 18 cases.  FISH with p16 and p53 gene probes were used on interphase nuclei to  screen the lung. We observed a high frequency the loss of p16 gene  in 44% and p53 in 39% of our cases with LC. Structural aberrations  predominated and usually consisted of deletions, breaks and fragilities  of various chromosomes. Chromosomes 3 and 1 were found to be  most frequently involved in structural abnormalities followed by chro   mosomes 6, 9 and 8. Otozomal aneuploidies were also observed to be  most frequent. Expressed FSs were a significantly higher frequency of  seven FS at 3p14, 1q21, 1q12, 6q26, 8q22, 8q24 and 9q13.  Our data  confirmed that DNA damage and genomic instability may be contribut   ing factors to the mutation profile and development of lung cancer. The  smokers who developed lung cancer also express a high frequency  the loss of p16 and p53, and the chromosomal aberrations.Cancer cytogenetics",2009

However, the significance of additional chromosomal  aberrations has not been considered. For detection of the 1p36 and 19q13 deletion and other chromosomal  rearrangements in oligodendroglial cells, we performed dual color  interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (I FISH) with locus spe   cific DNA probes (Abbott Laboratories), 200 isolated whole cell nuclei  (prepared from fresh non fixed tumor tissue) were analyzed for each  probe. We examined 35 patients with histologically confirmed oligodendrog   lial tumors (10x oligodendroglioma, 19x anaplastic oligodendroglioma,  6x anaplastic oligoastrocytoma). Deletion of 1p36 and 19q13 region  was detected in 28 cases (80%). In 12 of them combined deletion was  found as a sole cytogenetic abnormality. Median of progression free  survival (PFS) in this group was 47 months and only one patient died.  In other 16 cases additional chromosomal rearrangements typical for  high grade gliomas were proved. In these patients significantly worse  PFS was conferred (27 months, 6 patients died). Genetic studies increase our understanding of oligodendrogliomas.  Although, deletion of 1p/19q was shown as a powerful favourable  prognostic marker, our study demonstrates that prognosis is influ   enced by additional chromosomal aberrations. Further comprehensive  whole genome analyses of larger series with sufficient follow up are  needed to prove real prognostic significance and nonrandomness of  these aberrations.

In general, diagnosis is done at age of 12 month in  bilateral cases and at age of 18 months in unilateral cases. Leukocoria,  strabismus, unilateral mydriasis and heterochromia are the presenting  clinical characteristics. Sixty percent of cases are nonhereditary and  unilateral, 15 percent are hereditary and unilateral and 25 percent are  hereditary and bilateral. There are few cases of monozygotic twins  with retinoblastoma. In the present study we analyzed monozygotic  twins with retinoblastoma in which only one of them was affected. DNA  from leukocytes was obtained with conventional methods. Monozy   gosity was confirmed through GeneScan. Cytogenetic analysis was  performed with conventional methods. FISH analysis was done with  the cDNA LSI RB1 probe in leukocytes and oral cells of both twins and  their parents and in retinal tissue of affected twin. FISH analysis in 500  cells of affected twin showed: a) two copies of the RB1 gene in 20% of  retinal tissue and in 92% of leukocytes; b) one copy of the RB1 gene  in 56% of retinal tissue and in 8% of leukocytes and c) no copies of  the RB1 gene in 24% of retinal tissue.

As p53, c  Erb and c Myc mutations have been considered as molecular changes  typical of cancer cells, their presence, if any, in histopathologically free  tumour margins, could be of great importance for the recurrence risk  evaluation. The aim of this study was to determine the incidence of  p53, c Myc and c Erb mutations in tumour margins, considered normal  from a histologic point of view. DNA was obtained from 40 mucosa  specimens, confirmed by a pathologist as free of neoplastic cells. P53  mutations were studied by PCR SSCP, and sequencing, while differ   ential PCR was used for the detection of c Myc and c Erb B2 amplifica   tion. A relatively high incidence of genetic lesions was detected: 11 out  of 40 patients (27.5%) harboured p53 mutations, 5 (12.5%) had c  Erb  B2, and 7 (17.5%) had c Myc amplification. A close follow up of these  patients is planned. Local and distant spread has been a major challenge for a success   ful cancer treatment. It is considered that verification of tumour free  resection margins by conventional histopathological examination is  not sufficient. Molecular analysis of margins, targeting cancer genes,  could enable the selection of OSCC patients at higher risk for tumour  recurrence.Cancer cytogenetics",2009

All this dis   eases seems to be connected with a genetic background which is pre   disposing to the development of the disease. Because diabetes and  hypertension are the first two causes for ESRD and rennin angiotensn  system has a important role in pathogenesis of this affection, ACE  polymorphisms, specially ACE I/D have been extensively studied. Aim: The aim of the present study is to evaluate the contribution of  ACE I/D polymorphism to the risk of development of ESRD in diabetic  and non diabetic Romanian population. Material and method: Clinical data and blood sample were collected  from 321 Romanian type 1 diabetic patients, after inform consent. The  patients were divided in three groups 1 healthy controls (119 patients),  2 ESRD due to other causes except diabetes (119 patients), 3 ESRD  with diabetes (83 patients). Genomic DNA was extracted from periph   eral blood leucocytes using commercial kits and the ACE I/D polymor   phism was assessed by PCR RFLP. Results: The sample population is in Hardy Weinberg equilibrium.  The DD genotype was found in 36,13% in non diabetic subjects and  32,25% in diabetic subjects comparative with 31,09% in healthy con   trols. The ID genotype frequency was 49,57% in healthy controls,  48,75% in non diabetic patients with ESRD and 53,01% in diabetic  subjects with renal insufficiency.

Chun Yi1","1National Health Research Institues, Zhunan, Taiwan, 2Academia Sinica, Taipei,  Taiwan","Many dichotomous traits for complex diseases are often involved more  than one locus and/or associated with quantitative biomarkers or envi  ronmental factors. Incorporating these quantitative variables into link   age analysis as well as localizing two linked disease loci simultaneous   ly could therefore improve the efficiency in mapping genes. Previously,  we proposed a robust multipoint Identity by Descent (IBD) approach  to estimate a disease locus using affected sib pairs with incorpora   tion of a quantitative covariate. In the present study, we extended this  approach to simultaneously estimate two linked loci using different  types of affected relative pairs (ARPs). We showed the efficiency was  enhanced by localizing two disease loci simultaneously and by using  relative pairs than using affected sib pairs alone after incorporating a  quantitative covariate through parametric or non parametric modeling.  In addition to help identify factors associated with the disease and to  improve the efficiency in estimating disease loci, this extension also  allows us to account for heterogeneity in risk ratios for different ARPs.  The collaborative study on the genetics of alcoholism (COGA) data  released for GAW14 was used to illustrate the application of this ex   tended method. The quantitative variable âmaximum number of drinks  in a 24 hour periodâ was incorporated into the linkage mapping when  searching for two linked disease loci simultaneously using affected  relative pairs. This example illustrated that the efficiency in estimating  disease loci was enhanced by incorporating a quantitative covariate,  by using all relative pairs as well as by mapping two linked loci simul   taneously.",2009

Cur   rently, the apolipoprotein E (APOE) Îµ4 allele is the sole identified ge   netic risk factor for sporadic AD (sAD) but the underlying mechanism  is not understood. One hypothesis to explain how the Îµ4 allele might  affect increase AD risk in humans relies on an interaction between  APOE and its receptors. Particularly, the low density lipoprotein recep   tor related protein (LRP1) is the main APOE receptor in the brain. LRP  mediates clearence of Î² amiloid aggregates of which lead to the for  mation of senile plaques, a pathological hallmark of AD. Consequently,  any variations in LRP gene will lead to a defect in clearance of LRP  high affinity ligands, as the LRP associated protein gene (LRPAP1).  Taken together, these data suggest that LRPAP1 could be involved  in the clearance of Î² amyloid, and genetic variation at this gene could  modulate the rate of plaque formation. The association of the C766T  polymorphism in exon 3 of the LRP gene with AD is discussed contro   versially. Here, we analyzed this LRP variation and the association of  intron 5 LRPAP1 (37 bp insertion/deletion) polymorphism in a number  of sAD patients and controls from the same white population (Southern  Italy). No statistically significant differences were found in LRP1 and  LRPAP1 genotype and allele frequencies between the AD sample and  controls.

Genomic DNA was extracted from whole blood by salting out  method. The polymorphism was analyzed using polymerase chain re   action (PCR)   restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) assay.  Genotype and allele frequencies and their associations with CAD risk,  demographic factors, and smoking status were investigated. The percentages of the CC, CT, and TT genotypes were 34.3%,  10.4%, 55% for the patients and 46%, 8.2%, 45.6% for the controls,  respectively. There was no significant association between the APOC3   482C>T polymorphism and plasma triglyceride levels in the studied  population. (OR,1.39, %95 CI,0.89   2.18, P, 0.131).",2009

The corresponding central  pressure waveform can be derived from the measured radial wave   form. The shape of this wave contains information on cardiac contrac   tility and the size, speed and shape of wave reflection, which are in  turn determined by factors like arterial stiffness. A number of PWA pa   rameters including the augmentation index are associated with classi   cal cardiovascular risk factors and events. We have measured a range  of PWA phenotypes in samples from two island isolates; the Orkney  Isles in Scotland (540 subjects) and the Croatian island of Korcula  (480 subjects). All samples were genotyped at 318,000 SNP markers  using Illumina beadchips. Association tests were performed separately  in the two populations using a genomic kinship method to correct for  the close relationships among participants. Meta analysis of these  data identified seven separate genomic regions showing novel associ   ations (up to P , 3 x 10^ 8), with one or more of the PWA phenotypes,  including central augmentation pressure and time delay from incident  to reflected wave.

Family based study designs have not been the design of  choice mainly because of the reduced power of the orthogonal based  association tests. Association testing in family data can be performed  under alternative methods, as the Measured Genotype test that has  been shown to outperform orthogonal based tests. Therefore, asso   ciation designs based on family data can prove to be of more value  than assumed, especially for replicating and/or following up results  from population based association results. Here, our main aims are to evaluate the performance of association  designs using either population based data only or combining both  population and family data in a multi stage approach. A two stages  association study is designed. The first stage uses population data  to identify the set of SNPs positively associated to the trait at a given  nominal significance. These positive SNPs are tested for replication  in a second stage that uses either population or family data.

In humans, tachykinins and their receptors  are expressed in many of these cells and have been shown to be  involved in airway hyperresponsiveness, broncoconstriction, edema,  and mucus secretion. The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association be   tween eight single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) of two tachyki   nin genes, TAC3  and TAC4,  and asthma susceptibility.

We conducted a meta analysis of 24 studies on common FLG muta   tions and AE involving 6448 AE cases, 26787 controls and 1993 AE  families as well as 17 studies involving 3138 cases, 17164 controls  and 4 family studies including 1511 affected offspring on asthma. Odds  ratios (OR) for case control studies ranged from 1.69 to 11.56 with an  overall OR of 3.39 (95%CI,2.73 4.23), while family studies showed  more homogeneous results.

While strong effects for the compound phenotype âasthma + AEâ with  an OR of 3.29 (95%CI,2.84 3.82) were observed, there appears to be  no significant association with asthma in the absence of AE. This meta analysis summarizes the strong evidence for a high risk for  AE conferred by FLG null mutations, and refines the risk profiles of  FLG alleles suggesting an association with both more severe disease  and a dermatologist diagnosis. The results clearly indicate that FLG  null alleles are a robust risk factor in determining genetic predisposi   tion to asthma, and suggest that FLG deficiency might help define the  endophenotype of asthma linked with eczema.",2009

We compared clinical course of asthma among  children with different genotypes of BclI and Tth111I polymorphisms of  the GR gene. In children with difficult asthma we investigated exon 2  of the GR gene by sequencing. Methods: Study group consisted of 485 children (age 2 17) with  asthma; control group consisted of 151 healthy children. The BclI and  Tth111I polymorphisms were detected by PCR RFLP.

These levels are influenced largely  by genetic factors, with a heritability ranging from 20 40%. However,  only some polymorphisms in the fibrinogen structural genes have been  reported, which explain a small proportion of the genetic variability. Material and methods: we performed a Genome Wide Scan (GWS) for  fibrinogen levels in 21 families from the GAIT project using 500 micro   satellites scattered throughout the genome. We fine mapped 2 regions  that showed a clear linkage signal with fibrinogen levels with extra  SNPs. (1.195 SNPs on Chromosome 12, and 667 SNPs on Chromo   some 17). Analyses were performed in male and female separately. Results: We found one significant linkage signal on chromosome 12  (LOD,2.1; nominal p, 0.00094), and one on chromosome 17, only de   tected in females (LOD,3.2; nominal p, 0.00003). 2 SNPs, localized  on the TCF1  gene, showed a statistically significant association with fi   brinogen levels on chromosome 12. This gene codifies for Hepatocyte  Nuclear Factor 1 implicated on transcription of alpha and beta chains  of fibrinogen. 8 SNPs have shown a statistically significant association  with fibrinogen levels on chromosome 17. Conclusion: Looking at these results, TCF1  is postulated as the re   sponsible gene for the linkage signal on chromosome 12. On chromo   some 17, we have enclosed a 10 Mb region which contains several  interesting hormone related genes which could explain the female  specific signal in this region.",2009
selection and migration as possible causes of failure of case  control study replications,P08.19,"C. G. F. de Kovel , B. P. C.

Stimulated by a recently described geographic  cline in odds ratios, we investigated fifteen sets of at least seven rep   licates of the same allele disease case control studies and found a  striking pattern: odds ratios generally decline with increasing frequen   cy of the marker allele. The OR even flips from risk to protective in  seven out of fifteen sets. We investigated whether this could be a sampling artefact or the re   sult of population processes, such as drift, selection or migration. Drift  appears unlikely to have created these patterns. Both selection and  migration can cause the observed pattern, but only in specific circum  stances. When populations differ in allele frequency and disease prev   alence, population admixture could occur, but we could not find how  this would cause such a general pattern. Exploration of existing SNP datasets confirmed that no general pro   cesses of drift and migration of European populations produce such  patterns. This suggests that disease alleles experience specific pro   cesses that do not apply to the majority of random SNPs The observations should warn investigators that non replication or  even a reversal of the OR is possible  especially if the allele frequency  of the marker in controls is larger than that of the original publication   and need not invalidate the initial observation.",2009

GERD is characterized by the reflux of stomach acidic contents to  esophagus. Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) such as omeprazole are  the most effective agents available for the treatment of GERD. Cy   tochrome p450 2c19 (CYP2c19) enzyme is responsible for metabo   lism of omeprazole. Two common polymorphisms of cyp2c19 (G>A  substitutions at codons 212, 227) decrease the enzyme activity.

Although social and psychological factors contribute to addiction,  genetic factors explicitly weigh in. To understand the role of genetic  variations in vulnerability to drug addiction, the nature of population  genetics has to be characterized by identifying the single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) in candidate genes and performing associa   tion studies. Here, we investigated the SNPs in the coding regions of  the fatty acid amide hydrolase (FAAH) gene which encodes the prin   cipal endocannabinoid inactivating enzyme. A missense mutation in  this gene, c.385C>A, has been reported to contribute to the functional  alteration in the endocannabinoid system. Although a link between this  polymorphism and drug abuse among white ancestral subjects has  been reported, the specific allelic frequencies often vary in different  populations. Hence, to explore this hypothesis in Malaysian subjects,  we conducted a case control study which included 80 drug addicts and  80 healthy controls. DNA sequencing analysis revealed a significant  (p<0.01) association between the 385A/385A genotype and drug ad   diction amongst Malaysian individuals. In addition, using high resolu   tion melt analysis several other novel SNPs within this gene were also  uncovered. One of these novel FAAH SNPs resulted in the substitution  of an amino acid residue in the Src homology 3 binding domain (SH3).  Transfection experiments have demonstrated that this proline rich re   gion deleted amidase was enzymatically inactive. Collectively, these  findings support the concept that genetic mutations in FAAH may con   stitute important risk factors for functional abnormalities in the endog   enous cannabinoid system and drug addiction.",2009

The most severe complication is progressive renal amy   loidosis (RA). FMF is caused by a number of mutations in the MEFV  gene located on chromosome 16p, encoding pyrin protein, which nor   mally acts as a mediator in control of inflammation. Molecular genetic  analysis significantly improves early and correct diagnosis of FMF, and  allows to commence lifelong treatment of affected individuals with col   chicine. Frequency of the mutations of MEFV gene is extremely high in  Armenian population. We have reported about the molecular diagnos   tics of more than 10000 FMF patients in Armenians. In our FMF patients the colchicine largely prevents the development  of attacks and renal amyloidosis (RA). Adequate colchicinotherapy  delays RA progression in FMF/RA patients. In a few cases the effect  of colchicine remains controversial. We confirm, that genotyping is  assisting in prediction of the response to colchicine treatment. FMF  homozygous patients for M694V mutation present a more severe phe   notype and show a limited response to colchicine at a nephrotic stage  of RA. In contrast, FMF patients with other genotypes still have a good  chance to ameliorate of the nephrotic syndrome and to maintain renal  function. Conclusion:  According to our results, the genotyping is recommended  for all siblings of FMF patients and to search for other autoinflamma   tory periodic fever syndromes among patients with specific clinical  symptoms but without MEFV mutations.",2009

We simulated  a disease conditional on the known phenotype structures in these ped   igrees under a variety of inheritance models in which one variant in a  given gene region influences the trait to some degree. The results of our study showed the in virtually every situation, the full  likelihood based methods outperformed the simpler âdata structure  motivatedâ tests. In truth we never know the true analysis models, so  we noticed that the power of a joint test of linkage and association  was robust to model errors (so long as the analysis model is overly  determined), the test of association conditional on linkage can have  difficulty parsing the signal from LD and linkage satisfactorily under  certain analysis options, owing to the nonorthogonality of those pa   rameters. A simulation based as well as formal analytical description  and explanation will be presented, along with discussions of bias cor   rection methods to restore the validity of this family of powerful and  highly sensitive tests.",2009
Analytic approaches to power estimation for linkage analysis of  large pedigrees,P08.41,"G. R. Svischeva , T. Axenovich","Institute of Cytology and Genetics of Siberian Branch of the Russian Academy  of Sciences, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation","The variance components method is widely used for linkage map   ping of quantitative trait loci. Estimation of power for this method is  based on asymptotic approximation of distribution of likelihood ratio  statistics to a non central chi squared distribution described by a non  centrality parameter (NCP). Therefore, evaluating the power can be  reduced to an estimation of the NCP. For small pedigrees, the NCP  can be analytically expressed by simple formulas. For large pedigrees,  analytical formulas cannot be deduced because the expectation of the  test statistics must be estimated for all possible genotype vectors, the  number of whose grows exponentially with increasing pedigree size.  Recently Williams and Blangero (1999) and Rijsdijk et al. (2001) have  suggested ways of approximating the NCP by the sum of NCP values  for all pairs of relatives. Expectation of the NCP for any related pair  may be calculated analytically. The effectiveness of this approach was  demonstrated for small pedigrees. We have investigated using this ap   proach for analysis of large pedigrees. We have compared two ways  of the analytical NCP approximation showing their equivalence, and  investigated the accuracy of the analytical NCP estimation for three  large pedigrees and for wide set of models of quantitative trait inheri   tance. We have demonstrated that sample size estimated by the NCP  approximation was slightly overstated (up to 8 %) as compared with  sample size calculated through the exact NCP value. This overestima   tion was the same for large and small pedigrees. So, a special correc   tion could be introduced to obtain unbiased estimation of the NCP.",2009

","MÃ©niÃ¨reâs disease (MD) is a disorder of the inner ear characterized  by episodes of vertigo, tinnitus and fluctuating sensorineural hearing  loss. Most MD cases are sporadic but 5 15% of patients are familial  following an autosomal dominant mode of inheritance with incomplete  penetrance. The genetic cause of the disease remains unknown. We  have previously identified a candidate region for MD on 12p12.3 from  a linkage analysis in three large Swedish pedigrees. Interestingly, af   fected individuals of two families share a single haplotype within the  linked region, suggesting a possible ancestral mutation. To further clarify the role of chromosome 12p in MD we genotyped 15  Swedish families with familial cases of the disease. We analyzed 11  polymorphic marker loci over a 2Mb region in samples from affected  individuals and healthy control subjects. The results revealed asso   ciation of 5 polymorphic marker alleles to MD (P<0,05). Moreover, a  core haplotype spanning 700 kb showed strong association with the  disease (P,0,0041).

In this study we analyzed 2940 geno   typed and phenotyped individuals in a large pedigree including more  than 23000 members in 18 generations. The pedigree was derived  from an isolated Dutch population, where genetic heterogeneity is ex   pected to be low and linkage disequilibrium to be extensive. Complex segregation analysis confirmed high heritability of adult  height, and suggested involvement of a major gene in the control of  height in this population. The estimates obtained from complex seg   regation analysis were used to perform parametric linkage analysis.  Parametric linkage analysis indicated at least four suggestive and  three genome wide significant loci. Significant peaks were located at  the chromosome regions 1p32.2 (LOD score , 3.35), 2p16.3 21 (LOD  score , 3.29) and 16q24.1 24.2 (LOD score , 3.94).

","The diagnosis of rare inherited diseases is becoming increasingly dif   ficult as an increasing number of affections appears to have multigenic  inheritance. Multigenic inheritance applies for the recessive progres   sive ataxias, for which 12 genes have been identified. We used ho   mozygosity mapping of patients with recessive ataxia and born from  consanguineous parents, as a guide for identification of the defective  locus. Patients from 97 families were analysed with GeneChip Map   ping 10K or 50K SNP Affymetrix microarrays. We identified six families  homozygous for regions containing the ARSACS  gene, two families  homozygous for the ataxia telangiectasia gene, two families homozy   gous for the AOA 1 gene, and one family homozygous for the AOA2   gene. A mutation was identified in all families homozygous for the AR  SACS , AOA1  or AOA2  loci, and in only one of the two families homo   zygous for the A T locus. The family without a mutation in the ATM  gene was not reminiscent of A T, as alpha foetoprotein was normal in  all 4 patients who had onset of ataxia at 8 years and absent reflexes.  However, the LOD score in favor of linkage for the 11q22.1 q23.1 re   gion was 3.2 and no other region of the genome was consistent with  linkage for this family, suggesting that a second ataxia gene is present  in this interval. While the use of homozygosity mapping was very ef   fective at pointing to the correct ataxia gene, it also suggests that the  majority of recessive ataxia cases are caused by mutations either in  the recently identified genes or in genes yet to be identified.",2009

the role of Y chromosome in male susceptibility to ADHD and  schizophrenia,P09.002,"E. Stergiakouli , H. Williams, K. Langley, A. Thapar, M. Owen","Cardiff University, Cardiff, United Kingdom","Many psychiatric disorders display distinct sex differences. Men are  more likely to be affected by neurodevelopmental disorders, such as  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and schizophrenia.  ADHD is a childhood disorder characterised by inattention, overactiv   ity and impulsiveness. The disorder affects males more than females  at a ratio of 4:1. In schizophrenia, the age of onset in men is signifi   cantly earlier (21 years) than for women (25 years). The disorder is  more severe in male patients and they generally have more negative  symptoms. To elucidate the genetic causes of sex differences we choose to study  the Y chromosome. Y chromosome variants appropriate for U.K. pop   ulations were genotyped in a sample of 210 cases with ADHD, 310  cases with schizophrenia and 700 U.K. controls. Although our case  control study did not reveal any association of Y chromosome hap   logroups with either ADHD or schizophrenia, a modifying effect of Y  chromosome on ADHD was shown. Scores of performance IQ and full  scale IQ were found to be increasing as Y chromosome haplogroups  became more recent evolutionary.

","Objective. Adiponutrin ( PNPLA3 ) is a predominantly liver expressed  transmembrane protein with phospholipase activity regulated by fast   ing and feeding. Recent genome wide association studies identified  adiponutrin to be associated with hepatic fat content and liver func   tion, indicating that adiponutrin might be involved in hepatic lipoprotein  metabolism. We aimed 1) to elucidate the association of common vari   ants within adiponutrin and parameters of lipoprotein metabolism and  2) with liver function in up to four independent West Eurasian study  populations including up to more than 6000 individuals. Methods. This study is based on the population based Bruneck Study  (n,800), the population based KORA F3 Study (n,1644), the SAPHIR  Study (n,1738) from Austria based on a healthy working population,  and the Utah Obesity Case Control Study (including 1037 severely  obese individuals (average BMI 46.0 kg/m2) and 827 controls from the  same geographical region). Results. We observed a strong recessive association of a common  nonsynonymous variant within adiponutrin (rs738409, exon 3) with  age  and gender adjusted lipoprotein concentrations which was not  caused by an impaired liver function: homozygote carriers of the mi  nor allele had on average 8.75 mg/dL lower total cholesterol levels  (p,0.00006), 7.79 mg/dL lower non HDL cholesterol levels (p,0.0004),  4.91 mg/dL lower LDL cholesterol levels (p,0.007) and 9.01 mg/dL  lower triglyceride levels (p,0.006). Moreover, the rs738409 variant is  strongly associated with the liver enzymes ALT and AST, following a  recessive model. Discussion. In conclusion, our study suggests that  adiponutrin is related to processes of lipid and energy metabolism with  a special focus on apolipoprotein B containing lipoproteins, as well as  hepatic dysfunction.",2009

The main limitations of these  studies are an impossible direct comparison of risk alleles/haplotypes  due to different marker sets used and their insufficient sample size.  To deal with these problems we imputed the genotypes for Hapmap  SNPs for samples used in studies by Breen et al. (2006) and Gaysina  et al. (2008).

Several variants in the complement cascade genes (comple   ment factor H [CFH], C2, C3, CFB) have been reported to associate  with age related macular degeneration (AMD). Of them, a member  of the complement alternative pathway, CFH, represents the highest  risk. Since properdin is also an important protein in this pathway, we  analysed whether DNA variants in the properdin gene at Xp11.4 are  associated with AMD. Methods. The coding region and splice sites of the properdin gene  were sequenced in a total of 223 Finnish patients with AMD (151 spo   radic cases [68% women] and 72 familial cases [71% women]). Con   trols were 86 age matched non AMD patients (81% women) with no  large drusen and no or minimal focal pigmentary abnormalities. Results. A total of four single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) were  detected in the properdin gene. Three of the SNPs ( D55H in exon 3,  D299N in exon 7 and P394S in exon 9) were infrequent (in 5 patients  and controls in total). The fourth SNP, rs1048118 in exon 10, was more  frequent, but was not associated with AMD either in men or in women  in our preliminary analyses. Conclusions. None of the variant in the properdin gene was associated  with AMD, suggesting that properdin, though a member of alternative  pathway, does not play as important role as CFH in the pathogenesis  of AMD.Complex traits and polygenic disorders",2009

Alcohol is primarily degrad   ed by alcohol dehydrogenase (ADH) and genetic variations affecting  the rate of alcohol degradation were found in ADH genes. We designed a classical case control association study for 5 poly   morphisms in Class 1 ADH genes: ADH1B Arg47His (rs1229984),  ADH1B RsaI (rs2066701), ADH1C HaeIII (rs1693425), ADH1C EcoRI  (rs1789920), and ADH1C Ile349Val (rs698). We recruited 303 men with  ICD 10 alcoholism diagnosis (112 Russians, 91 Tatars, 100 Bashkirs  from Volga Ural region of Russia) and matched control groups typed  for the above mentioned gene variants using PCR RFLP technique. We observed all SNPs to be in strong linkage disequilibrium in con   trols, cases and the overall sample in all studied populations. Haplotype analysis of 2 SNPs in ADH1B  gene showed significant asso   ciation of ADH1B*Arg*T  haplotype with alcoholism (p<0.05, OR,1.60)  in Russians. Analysis of 3 polymorphisms in ADH1C  gene revealed  that in Tatars the frequency of individuals carrying ADH1C*T*G*G   haplotype was significantly higher in the group of alcoholics compared  to healthy controls (p<0.05, OR,4.93). In Bashkirs the frequency of  haplotype ADH1C*G*G*A  was significantly increased in patients with  alcoholism compared to control individuals (p<0.05). Further analysis  demonstrated association of this haplotype with the risk of alcoholism  in Bashkirs (OR,12.20). Our findings indicate the contribution of ADH1B  and ADH1C  genes to  susceptibility for alcoholism in three populations form Russia.

These genes  encode proteins thought to be involved in the regulation of posttransla   tion processing of filaggrin (FLG), the strongest identified genetic risk factor for eczema  to date. We sought to clarify the individual risk of eczema conferred by the  SPINK5 polymorphism rs2303067 and a previously described inser   tion in the 39 untranslated region of KLK7 and to examine potential  epistatic effects between these variants and FLG mutations. We examined the effects of these polymorphisms and FLG in 486 Ger   man families, 287 German and 418 Irish/English eczema cases (n for 3 genes: 1191  vs 4544 controls). We then additionally studied the SPINK5 polymor   phism and FLG mutations in 1583 eczema patients from the ALSPAC  study (n for 2 genes: 2774 vs 10,607 controls). No association was seen with the SPINK5 or KLK7 variants in the  case control analysis; however, a weaker effect was observed for the  SPINK5 variant with maternal transmission in the family study. No in   teractions were seen between the polymorphisms in KLK7, SPINK5, and FLG. The SPINK5 420LysSer mutation confers a risk of eczema when ma   ternally inherited but is not a major eczema risk factor. The KLK7 in   sertion appears to confer no risk of eczema.

Despite many studies over the last decades,  the etiology of ADHD remains unknown. Eight large ADHD affected  families were recruited for this study. These families were recruited  in a multicenter collaboration study conducted by three clinical units  of child and adult psychiatry (University of Trier, Homburg/Saar, and  Wuerzburg). They comprised of 191 individuals, of which 95 were af   fected with ADHD. Fine mapping of the significant loci reported in a recent paper (Ro   manos et al, 2008) of a genome wide linkage study of the eight large  familes was carried out. Using genetic data derived from related indi   viduals within each of the large families, an attempt is made to identify  predisposing chromosomal regions in these families. From the preliminary results, in one of the large families, a 20 cM in   terval on chromosome 18 was narrowed down to 18q11  18q21. All  affected individuals in this family share the same haplotype. ADHD is believed to be a complex, polygenic disease in which many  genes of small effect contribute to disease susceptibility. However,  there may be monogeneous Mendelian inheritance in large families.  Currently, interesting candidate genes in the narrowed down region of  chromosome 18 are being selected for further functional studies.",2009
A 2.2mb microduplication in 1q42.2 including DISC  in 2  brothers with autism and mild mental retardation,P09.018,"A. Crepel1, J. Breckpot1, J. Fryns1, J. Steyaert2, K. Devriendt1, H.

","A growing number of copy number variations (CNV) are detected in  individuals with neurodevelopmental disorders. However, the interpre   tation is not always straightforward. We describe the identification and delineation of a 2.2Mb microdupli   cation in 1q42.2 in 2 brothers with autism and mild mental retardation. The duplication was detected by Array CGH with clones from the 1 Mb  BAC/PAC clone set (Sanger Institute Hinxton, UK). The aberration was  further delineated to 2.2Mb with a full tiling BAC array. By means of  quantitative real time PCR (qPCR) the breakpoints of the duplication  were mapped and segregation in the family was investigated. qPCR  was used to screen 260 patients with autism for DISC1  duplications. The 2.2Mb duplication was present in the proband, his affected brother  and the apparently unaffected father and paternal grandmother. Since  this duplication was not present in 1577 Belgian persons, it was con   sidered as a rare variant. Within this region the most interesting gene  with respect to autism is DISC1  (disrupted in schizophrenia 1 ) since  it is known to be involved in schizophrenia and has recently been as   sociated to autism and bipolar disorder. A group of 260 patients with  autism was studied for the occurrence of DISC1  duplications, but no  additional duplications were found. This study is a typical illustration of the difficult interpretation of causal   ity of a rare variant in neuropsychiatric disease. We conclude that the  DISC1  duplication is a rare variant that probably confers susceptibility  for autism in the current family.Complex traits and polygenic disorders",2009
Role of serotonin transporter promoter length polymorphism in  autism: A south African population based study,P09.019,"Z. Arieff , M. Kaur, H. Gameeldien, M. Davids","University of the Western Cape, Bellville, South Africa","The serotonin transporter promoter length polymorphism (5 hydroxy   tryptamine transporter length polymorphism, 5 HTTLPR) has long  been implicated in autism and other psychiatric disorders. The use of  selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) have shown to have  a positive effect in treating some symptoms of autism. The effects of  these drugs vary in individuals due to the presence of S or L alleles  of 5 HTTLPR. Studies performed on various autistic populations have  found different allele frequencies for the L and S alleles. In the present  study, allelic frequencies and genotypes of 110 South African (SA) au   tistic individuals (21 African, 48 Mixed and 41 Caucasian) were deter   mined and compared with the matching SA ethnic control populations.  The S/S genotype was found to be highly significantly associated with  all the SA autistic ethnic populations namely, Caucasian, Ï2 , 11.078;  Mixed, Ï2 , 18.512 and total group, Ï2 , 46.712 (df , 2; p < 0.001).

We observed that a significant proportion of females diagnosed with  AITDs display extremely skewed X chromosome inactivation (XCI) ra   tios in their blood cells (Eur. J. Hum. Genet. 14; 791 97, 2006). âLoss of  mosaicismâ for X linked gene expression could be the first step of the  cellular events that lead to the breakdown of self tolerance in females.  We propose that co inheritance of two distinct events on the X: muta   tions that cause skewed XCI, and heterozygosity for non synonymous  polymorphisms in as yet unknown but critically important genes could  contribute to autoimmune processes. This hypothesis was tested with  a custom made Affymetrix 5K microarray that we designed, which con   tained all known coding SNPs on the X, as well as intronic SNPs with  high heterozygosity ratios. In addition, 166 autoimmunity associated  autosomal SNPs (Nature 447; 661 78, 2007; Nat. Genet. 39; 857  64, 2007) were printed on the same microarrays. 84 female patients  and 248 female controls with known XCI profiles were genotyped.  The strongest associations were at nonsynonymous SNPs in TFDP3  [OR: 3.44(95% CI:1.62 7.29; p,0.00067)], ZMAT [OR: 2.22(95% CI:  1.23 3.66; p,0.003)], and C1GALT1C1 [OR:2.59(95% CI:1.16 2.59;  p,0.006)].

The role of  CNVs in bipolar disorder (BD) has been largely unknown, in contrast to  other common neuropsychiatric disorders, such as autism and schizo   phrenia, where a clear role for CNVs has been established in multiple  publications. The objective of the current study is to determine whether large  (>100kb) and rare (found in <1% of the population) CNVs play a role  in the susceptibility to BD. We performed a genome wide survey for CNVs in 1697 BD patients  and 2806 healthy controls from the Wellcome Trust Case Control Con   sortium, using the Affymetrix 500K array. The total burden of CNVs was not increased in patients when com   pared with controls. These results are in contrast with those obtained  for schizophrenia patients analysed with the same methods in other  studies, including those in our department, where we found an excess  of CNVs >1Mb in size, when compared to both to the bipolar patients,  or the same group of controls. These results suggest that large rare CNVs may not play a substantial  role in developing BD, unlike their confirmed role in schizophrenia and  autism. This probably reflects the complex nature of the underlying  genetic components leading to susceptibility to BD, involving many  genes and genetic variants. CNV platforms with higher resolution and  quality should be used to investigate the role of smaller CNVs in BD.",2009

Although the main driving force of the disease is an aberrant immune  response, several other pathogenic mechanisms must also be in   volved. In order to describe at a network level the alterations provoked  by a gliadin insult on the intestinal mucosa of patients, we compared  expression profiling results of biopsies from active and treated pa   tients (long term effects of gliadin), and of biopsies from gluten free  diet treated patients that were incubated in vitro with or without gliadin  (acute effects). Results: Integration of the 1.647 and 96 significantly  altered transcripts identified in the long term and acute experiments into potentially pathogenic networks, suggests important dysfunction  of processes related to cell cell communication, intracellular signaling,  ubiquitin proteasome system, cell cycle and apoptosis and extracel   lular matrix.

Conclusions: Our study reconstructs the participation of different bio   logical networks in the development of the intestinal lesion in celiac  disease. Comprehensive analysis of expression profiling results at the  network level provides a more accurate picture of the events that lead  to the disease, and could guide towards novel functional candidates  responsible for genetic susceptibility, helping to avoid negative results  derived from candidates that were selected on the basis of altered  expression levels in single gene approaches.",2009

In order to replicate our positive association study, we conducted TDTs  in an independent series of 160 European families with CL/P. The  same FAF1 variant as in our first study was genotyped. In the replica   tion, FAF1 showed positive tendency for association only in the CPO/ PRS subgroup (p,0.09). Pooling together our 500 patients reinforced  the earlier association, giving a more stringent p value of 0.001 for the  CPO/PRS subgroup. In order to identify other genes contributing to  the occurrence of this multifactorial condition, we are testing in parallel  association of IRF6 and SATB2, two cleft genes, to the cleft condition  in our 500 patient cohort. Preliminary results suggest that, contrary to  FAF1, IRF6 predisposes to CL/P, but not to CPO. This illustrates the benefit of testing greater number of patients in  complex diseases in order to well delineate the true predisposed sub   groups. Moreover, it confirms that FAF1 and IRF6 play a role in the  occurrence of isolated complex clefts, but most likely in distinct path   ways.",2009

Two large deletions  were found in two cases each, but in no controls (Fisher Exact Test  p,0.02): a deletion at 22q11.2 known to be a susceptibility factor for  schizophrenia, and a deletion on 17p12, at 14,0 15,4Mb. The latter is  known to cause hereditary neuropathy with liability to pressure palsies  (HNPP). Another large deletion affects neurexophilin ( NXPH2 ), a gene  that interacts with neurexins. NRXN1  was also disrupted by deletions  in one case and three controls (0.2% vs 0.1%, p,0.5). One large duplication on 16p13.1, between 15,0 and 16,2Mb, was  found in three cases and six controls (0.6% vs 0.2%, p,0.13). It has  been previously implicated as a susceptibility factor for autism by Ull   mann et al (2008). The largest duplication, of 5Mb, was in a schizoaf   fective case and involved the Prader Willi/Angelman Syndrome critical  region, and is a known susceptibility factor for autism.

There is a re   markable overlap between these loci and those known to be involved  in other inflammatory disorders. We aimed to expand the number of samples and single nucleotide  polymorphisms (SNPs) tested in this GWAS. We expanded our co   hort to 4,200 cases and 10,500 controls, originating from four Euro   pean populations and genotyped for the Illumina 550K tag SNP set.  We are currently integrating the data and performing a meta analysis.

","Association between Coeliac Disease (CD) and SNPs in the 4q27 re   gion, containing the KIAA1109, TENR, IL2 and IL21 genes was de   tected in British coeliac cases and controls and confirmed in Dutch and  Irish collections [van Heel et al. 2007]. To better understand how this region is involved in susceptibility to  CD, five SNPs were studied in Italian 407 CD cases and 406 controls.  The Combination Test [Jannot et al, 2003] was applied to select the  subset of SNPs showing the most significant difference in the geno   typic distribution between patients and controls. The best discrimina   tion is obtained though the joint information of 3 SNPs, one located in  KIAA1109, the other two on each side of IL21. The range of the relative  risks of the 3 SNP genotypes is very impressive, one genotype confer   ring 9 times more risk than the least at risk. Our result strongly sug   gests that several genes in 4q27 are involved in CD susceptibility. The  probable role of KIAA1109 and IL21 is also supported by expression  studies showing a difference of mRNA levels between CD cases and  controls for these two genes. The importance of the 4q27 region in auto immunity is well estab   lished. The difficulty of identifying causal genotypic variations is illus   trated by the problems encountered in disentangling the HLA compo   nent of most auto immune diseases. The modelling of the 4q27 region  is likely to also be a long quest, not to mention the added complexity of  uncovering its interaction with other genes involved in the pathological  pathway(s).",2009

","Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) is characterized by  airflow limitation that is not fully reversible. Smoking is a major environ   mental risk factor for developing COPD, but not all smokers develop  COPD. Linkage studies have shown that the chromosomal 8p23 re   gion, where the defensin repeat region is located, is linked with sus   ceptibility to airflow obstruction. The beta defensin CNV is polymor   phic between individuals and therefore the dosage of these defensin  genes/proteins varies. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the diploid beta de   fensin copy number associates with COPD. We developed a real time PCR assay to quantify the number of beta  defensin repeats in this region. For this purpose we generated 4 con   catemeric constructs with 1 copy of DEFB1  and a particular number of  DEFB4  copies, which ranged from 1 to 4 copies. Using these controls  as standards, the number of defensin repeats could be accurately de   termined in DNA samples. The diploid beta defensin copy number was determined in 110 severe  COPD patients, 149 age matched smoking control individuals, and  121 adult control individuals. The severe COPD group had a mean  diploid beta defensin copy number of 5.1, the two control populations  had a mean copy number of 4.3. The T test P values comparing the  COPD patients with the control populations were 4*10 14 and 8.2*10  8 respectively. The distributions in the two control populations were  equal (P value , 0.8). A strong association between the diploid beta  defensin copy number and the diagnosis of severe COPD was thus  found with an Odds ratio of 5 (95% CI 2.57 8.78).",2009

It represents a major risk factor for recurrent  urinary tract infections. VUR is considered a complex trait and among  possibly many implicated genes may be several that influence infec   tious agent defense. Therefore it may be plausible to assume an as   sociation between VUR and genetic variations in genes with antimicro   bial functions, Such genetic variations may not necessary contribute to  the development of VUR but may affect the course of the disease. This  study analyzed DEFA1/DEfA3 G3400A variation in the alpha defensin  locus for possible association with VUR. Genotyping was done in 178 children diagnosed with primary congeni   tal vesico ureteric reflux and in 300 healthy controls with no medical  record of reflux.

However the frequencies of both variants did not differ significantly  between tested groups.. Our results indicate that G3400A variation in the DEFA1/A3 alpha de   fensin locus may be associated with VUR. Such variations in alpha  defensins may increase the susceptibility of patients with VUR to uri   nary tract infections and are probably not involved in the development  of VUR itself. Further analysis that would include other elements of a  complex structured alpha defensin locus are needed to validate a pos   sible role for alpha defensins in patients with VUR.",2009

In the present study, we examined the impact of the KDR gene His   472Gln polymorphism on elite athlete status, endurance performance  and muscle fibre type composition. Four hundred and seventy one  Russian athletes were prospectively stratified into four groups accord   ing to event duration, distance and type of activity, covering a spectrum  from the more endurance oriented to the more power oriented. KDR  genotype and allele frequencies were compared to 603 controls. To  examine the association between KDR and fibre type composition,  vastus lateralis muscle biopsies were obtained from 45 physically ac   tive healthy men and 23 all round skaters. In addition, 76 competitive  rowers performed incremental endurance exercise to allow analysis  of genotype associations with exercise responses. We found that the  frequency of the KDR 472Gln allele was significantly higher in endur   ance oriented athletes compared to controls (36.8% vs. 27.4%, P ,  0.0006). Absolute and relative VO2max were significantly greater in  the KDR 472Gln allele carriers compared with the His/His homozy   gotes of male and female rower groups, respectively.

Human obesity is a multifactorial syndrome influenced by  both environmental and genetic factors. Among gene variants found to  be involved in body weight regulation and development of obesity, par   ticular attention has been paid to polymorphisms in genes related to  adipogenesis, energy expenditure, and insulin resistance. We explored  the association of genetic polymorphisms of: PPARG2,Pro12Ala; adi   ponectin (ADIPOQ  11391G>A and 11377C>G) ; IL 6 174G>C; es   trogen receptor (ESR1alfa TA): APOE ; ACE (I/D); MTHFR 677C>T;  LPL (PvuII+/ ), with clinical variables: gender, age, BMI, and biological  variables: triglycerides, cholesterol, HDL, LDL, CRP, homocysteine,  glucose, in 105 healthy young subjects, (20 35 y) of Croatian origin. Methods. Genotyping of PPARG2, IL 6, ACE, LPL was performed by  PCR RFLP, APOE, MTHFR, ADIPOQ, by real time PCR and ESR1alfa  by capillary electrophoresis. Associations were performed of alleles,  genotypes and haplotypes with biological variables. Results. BMI was increased (>25) in 23% of subjects. Increased cho   lesterol values (>5.0 mmol/L) were found in 23% of subjects, LDL  (>3.0 mmol/L) in 23%, triglycerides (>1.7 mmol/L) in 11.4% of sub   jects.

We then genotyped 79 tagSNPs to fine map the genomic  regions defined by the associated SNPs. The region with the strongest  association signal (pcombined,6.23x10 10; OR:1.52), is on chromo   some 7q22.1 and is located in the gene Reelin (RELN), a gene known  for its role in neuronal migration. Evidence for allelic heterogeneity was  found in this region. We confirmed expression of RELN in the inner  ear and in stapes footplate specimens. Consequently, we genotyped 7  SNPs in this region in 4 additional small European populations (1095  samples total). Several SNPs replicated in the populations separately.  However, the power of these populations is small, but when combining  all 4 populations, 6 of the 7 SNPs replicated again in the same direc   tion as in the previous populations (pcombined,5.25x10 6).

We found a chance corrected agreement rate of 78% for primary and  combined headaches, of 91% for frequency of migraine and of 95% for  frequency of tension type headache (P<0.001). Regarding clinical implications, ICHD II, by creating new subgroups,  allowed the decrease of the uncertainty of probable headache diag   nosis. The ICHD II criteria may have relevant clinical implications but do not  change remarkably epidemiological results.

Substance misuse is thought to be influenced by multiple genetic and  environmental factors. The genetic predisposition presumably consists  of several genetic risk factors with small individual effect. The dopami   nergic pathway is a part of the brain reward system, therefore the do   pamine receptors are the main candidate genes of addiction. Our aim  was to determine specific dopaminergic risk and/or protective factors  in the background of heroin addiction. In our case control study 300 heroin dependent subjects and 555 sex  matched healthy Caucasian (Hungarian) individuals were genotyped  for polymorphisms of the dopamine D2 receptor (DRD2), dopamine  D4 receptor (DRD4), dopamine transporter, and the catechol o methyl  transferase genes.

The minor A1 allele of the TaqIA polymorphism  was increased (p , 0.0014) and the A1A1 genotype was two times  more frequent (p , 0.0076) among the cases. Also the minor B1 (A al   lele) of TaqIB polymorphism was associated with heroin dependence:  both B1 allele and B1B1 and B1B2 genotypes were overrepresented  among heroin users (p , 0.0007, p , 0.0036, respectively). However,  the TaqID allele  and genotype frequencies were not significantly dif   ferent between the case and the control groups.

Biopsies from non obese non hyperandro   genic and metabolic stable adolescents were used as controls (N,6). Results: IRS 1 and IRS 2 expression was significantly different in  cases versus controls (p<0.01). GLUT 4 expression did not show dif   ferences between the groups. HDL cholesterol was significantly lower  in hyperandrogenic compared to PCOS girls (p<0.05). There were no  significant differences between both hyperandrogenism groups in the  prevalence of insulin resistance indexes and metabolic syndrome. Conclusions: Overexpression of IRS 1 and IRS 2 was persistently  detected in the overall sample of hyperandrogenic girls compared to  controls.

","Sepsis is the most common cause of acute lung injury (ALI), organ  dysfunction and death in critically ill patients. The Toll/NF ÎºB signaling  pathway has a key role in the immune response to infections. Variants  in two genes encoding for interleukin 1 receptor associated kinases  (IRAKs) modify the immune response to pathogens and associate with  increased risk for severe complications during sepsis. Based on gene  expression data, showing up regulation of IRAK3 in both animal mod   els of sepsis and in septic patients, here we  explored whether common  variants of this gene were associated with susceptibility and outcomes  in severe sepsis. We re sequenced 23 kb non repetitive regions of the  gene in 32 Spanish samples, and selected a set of 7 tagging SNPs  (tagSNPs) that efficiently captured common variation in the popula   tion. To test the association, tagSNPs were genotyped in 214 severe  sepsis cases and 336 population based controls using the MassAr   rayÂ® iPLEX Gold (Sequenom Inc.). One tagSNP showed a significant  association with ALI ( p,0.005), and remained significant after multiple  testing adjustments. Indirect testing of untyped alleles revealed two  correlated SNPs ( r2,0.85) from the 5â flanking region of the gene as   sociated with ALI (permuted p,0.02), that were validated by further  genotyping and direct testing ( p<0.05). A TRANSFAC based explora   tion predicted one of them ( 1464A/G, MAF,0.25) to be located within  a human mouse conserved FOXP3 transcription factor binding site.  This supports that common variation in IRAK3  gene might be a novel  determinant of severe sepsis outcomes.

The disease is endemic  to rural Tibet, China; North Korea, and Siberia. Early investigations had  led to the hypothesis that the disease was due to dietary factors, due  to deficiencies in certain essential nutrients in high plateaus. However,  supplementation of the deficient trace minerals conducted by others  has had no positive effect on affected persons. Our group has be   gun investigations to the possibility that genetic elements may also be  involved with possible environmental effects in utero . Pedigree stud   ies were conducted on 200 individuals in nuclear families with clinical  symptoms. Patients observed ranged from 6 to more than 60 years.  KBD was diagnosed when an affected person had persistent pain,  restricted mobility, or deformity of the knees, ankles, elbows, wrist, in   terphalangeal joints, hips, or shoulders, in the absence of trauma. Pre   liminary analysis suggests KBD having an autosomal recessive pat   tern of inheritance in most families with a possible higher penetrance in  women. Occurrence of the disease exhibits familial aggregation while  suggesting the form of inheritance polygenetic, and due to multifacto   rial factors. Initial studies further suggests that deficiencies in selenium  and iodine may not be causal, but markers of an underlying condi   tion of extreme oxidative stress brought on by reactive oxygen species  acting to inhibit proper mesenchymal cell and bone development by  apoptosis.

Hoogendijk2","1Department of Medical Genomics, VU University Medical Center, Amsterdam,  The Netherlands, 2Department of Psychiatry, VU University Medical Center,  Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Major Depressive Disorder (MDD) is a psychiatric disorder with high  public health significance: it is currently the leading cause of disease  burden in western civilization and the fourth cause on a global scale.  People suffering from MDD show persistent dysphoria and additional  cognitive symptoms. Various theories about the causes of MDD exist and a genetic compo   nent is recognized in most of them. However, in complex disorders it is  a challenge to discover high impact mutations and polymorphisms. A genetic region that has been investigated in relation to neuropsy   chiatric disorders is serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region  (5 HTTLPR). Serotonin itself has been implicated in the cause of MDD  and thus regulation of serotonin availability by the serotonin trans   porter provides a region of interest. The 5 HTTLPR has a long vari   ant and a short variant, where a deletion has taken place. Within the  deleted region a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) can be found,  rs25531. This SNP has also been investigated in relation to psychiatric  illnesses, including MDD. Many of these studies are limited by a small  sample size and might therefore not find verifiable associations. In this study we use the MDD cohort (3840 samples) of the genetic as   sociation information network (GAIN) to unearth possible associations  between MDD and the 5 HTTLPR.  The region consists of repeats and has a high GC content. For deter   mining a long or short genotype we use fluorescent primers to amplify  the region and separate products with capillary electrophoresis. MspI  was used to distinguish different genotypes of rs25531.",2009

The association study design was used: 38 SNPs from 10  genes and regions between them of IL10 gene cluster were analyzed  in 522 unrelated patients and in 356 healthy control subjects. All sub   jects were individuals of Caucasian origin living in Estonia. Patients  were divided into two groups according to diagnosis: comparison of  allelic frequencies was performed between control group and MDD  patients (n,313), PD patients (n,209), and the whole patient group  (n,522). Both MDD and PD groups included âpureâ phenotypes as well  as phenotypes comorbid to other mood and anxiety disorders. SNPlex  Genotyping System was applied for genotyping, following association  and haplotype analyses with Haploview program. Association analysis  of 38 SNPs revealed the most prominent relationship between MDD,  PD, and the whole patient group and SNP (rs1539243) in IKBKE gene  (inhibitor of kappa light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells, kinase  epsilon) (allelic p values 0.02, 0.0009, and 0.0011, respectively).

We studied  the association of these SNPs in 175 Indian women who carried fe   tuses affected with NTDs and 332 unaffected fetuses (control). We  also measured maternal plasma folate, vitamin B12 and homocysteine  concentrations. Folate deficiency was observed only in 6% of mothers  who carried NTD fetuses. There was no association of maternal MTH   FR SNPs with plasma folate, vitamin B12 or homocysteine concentra   tions in cases, while in controls; TT genotype at C677T was associated  with significantly higher homocysteine concentrations. Frequency of the risk allele T at the C677T polymorphism was 0.13 in  mothers with NTD fetuses and 0.14 in controls, while that of the risk  allele C at the A1298C polymorphism was 0.36 in mothers with NTD  fetuses and 0.47 in controls. The 677T allele in mothers was not associated with NTDs in the off   spring (p,0.68) while the 1298C allele was more frequent in mothers  who had unaffected offspring (p,0.002). 1298C allele was noted to be  preferentially transmitted from mother to offspring in 75% of cases and  80% of controls, while 677T allele was preferentially transmitted from  mother to offspring in 60% of cases and 56% of controls. There was  no significant association between the above MTHFR polymorphisms  and NTDs in the offspring.

In this study, we therefore focused on dietary composition as a specific  trait related to obesity and we determined, whether genetic variations  in leptin (LEP), leptin receptor (LEPR), ghrelin (GHRL), adiponectin  (ADIPOQ), interleukin 6 (IL6), proopiomelanocortin (POMC) and mela   nocortin 4 receptor (MC4R) underlie specific native food preferences  and obesity realated anthropometric parameters. METHODS: The total of 409 individuals of Czech Caucasian origin  were enrolled into this study and the 7 day food records and parallel  7 day records of physical activity were obtained from the study subject  as well as anthropometric measurements. In a subset of study sub   jects, plasma levels of adiponectin, leptin and soluble leptin receptor  were measured. RESULTS: Independenty on the BMI of the individuals, common varia   tions in leptin and leptin receptor genes were associated with specific  eating patterns, mainly with respect to timing of eating. Diastolic blood  pressure was significantly associated with the common variation in the  leptin receptor gene as well as with the ratio of soluble leptin receptor  and leptin plasma levels. In multivariate analysis, common variations  in LEP, LEPR, POMC and MC4R genes expressed an independent  prediction role for percentage of body fat.

Fracture,  the clinical outcome of osteoporosis, is also dependent on genetic fac   tors, with a heritability of about 25 35%. The objective of the pres   ent study was to describe genetic epidemiological aspects of osteo   porosis, as family history may predict the disease risk in otherwise  healthy women. 62 patients were studied, mean age of 51 years, just  before or soon after menopause. 2/3 of the women who had mothers  with osteoporosis developed this disease too, which proves that the  maternal parent with osteoporosis represents an important risk fac   tor, unfortunately not possible to influence. About 1/3 of these women  had vertebral osteoporosis, half of them having 1 or more vertebral  fractures. Osteoporosis was developed in more than 2/3 of the cases  in which menopause was settled before the age of 45. Thus, settling of  menopause before this age is a very important cause for the release  of physiopathological mechanisms of osteoporosis. A parental history  of fracture confers an increased risk of fracture that is independent of  bone mineral density, suggesting that there is another shared compo   nent, which influences bone fragility.

An association study performed in a large cohort of Italian POF  patients and controls revealed the presence of a risk haplotype sig   nificantly associated to the disorder. Significant association was also  demonstrated in a cohort of German POF thus confirming the role of  the gene as risk factor for POF. The Diaph2 protein belongs to a large family involved in actin cytoskel   eton remodeling. We investigated the role of Diaph2 in actin dynamics  of human ovarian follicles by eliminating its function by RNAi. We used  granulosa cell line (COV434) and primary cells, able to respond to hor   monal stimulation. In COV434 expressing Diaph2, actin cytoskeleton  forms long filopodia distributed along the cell surface. Diaph2 knock   down caused a strong reduction in the number and in the length of  filopodia. In granulosa primary cells, treatment with follicle stimulating  hormone (FSH) induced changes in cell morphology and cell to cell  interactions. This process was abolished when RNAi depleted Diaph2.  These results suggest that Diaph2 is involved in actin mediated cyto   skeleton reorganization occurring after hormonal stimulation.

","Objectives: To identify SNPs in the MHC region which are associated  with PsA using a high density map. Methods: 909 individuals (422 cases and 487 controls) were genotyped  for 2299 SNPs in a 5 Mb region on chromosome 6 encompassing the  MHC region, using Illuminaâs MHC Panel Set. The patients were from  two well established centers with an expertise in PsA. A stratified case/ control analysis was conducted on each SNP separately to test for al   lelic association with PsA. A Breslow Day test was used to determine if  the odds ratio estimates differed between the two populations. Results: 17 SNPs from 13 regions were associated with PsA (p values  < 10 5); we report the results for these SNPs, noting their location rela   tive to genes, and their linkage disequilibrium (LD, based on r2) with  each other. SNPs rs2734922 (between HLA H and HLA A), rs1150735  (between RNF39 and TRIM31), rs11965214 (KIAA1949), rs3130933  (between TCF19 and POU5F1), rs879882 and rs887468 (both be   tween POU5F1 and HGC27), rs2523619 and rs2442719 (both be   tween HLA C and HLA B; the latter tags HLA C*0802), rs6936035 (be   tween HLA B and MICA) and rs2516470 (between MICA and HCP5)  were associated with PsA, however, none were in strong pairwise LD.  In a subset of controls who have also been genotyped for HLA Cw6,  we observed that rs12191877 and rs3906272 are in LD with this allele  (r2,0.69 and 0.60, respectively).

Genetic studies of TNFÎ±  polymorphisms in PsA have produced different results that may reflect  differences in the ethnic background [3]. Objectives The aim of this study was to investigate two TNFÎ± most  studied polymorphisms in PsA patients from Romania. Methods 45 unrelated well diagnosed patients with PsA (25/20 F/M)  and 109 healthy unrelated organ donors (46/63 F/M) were typed for  TNFÎ±  308G/A (rs 1800629) and  238G/A (rs 361525) polymorphisms  by TaqMan SNP Genotyping Assay C_7514879_10 and C_2215707_ 10 respectively (Applied Biosystems, USA). Results The observed genotypes for the TNFÎ± 308G/A polymorphism  (1AA, 6GA, 38GG in cases, respectively 4AA, 24GA, 79GG in controls)  and for the TNFÎ± 238G/A polymorphism (0AA, 5GA, 40GG in cases,  respectively 0AA, 5GA, 102GG in controls) showed no departure from  Hardy Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). The same results were obtained when only B27 negative cases and controls were analyzed. Conclusion The present study shows no departure from HWE in PsA  patients in Romania, and no potential association of any investigated  allele with the susceptibility to this disease, although a larger number  of patients may be required to verify this conclusion.

","A missense C1858T single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the  PTPN22  gene recently emerged as a major risk factor for human auto   immunity. PTPN22  encodes the lymphoid tyrosine phosphatase LYP,  which forms a complex with the kinase Csk and is a critical negative  regulator of signaling through the T cell receptor (TCR). The C1858T  SNP results in the LYP R620W variation within the LYP Csk interaction  motif. LYP W620 exhibits a greatly reduced interaction with Csk and  is a gain of function inhibitor of signaling. Here we show that LYP con   stitutively interacts with its substrate Lck in a Csk dependent manner.  TCR induced phosphorylation of LYP by Lck on an inhibitory tyrosine  residue releases tonic inhibition of signaling by LYP. The R620W varia   tion disrupts the interaction between Lck and LYP, leading to reduced  phosphorylation of LYP and ultimately to gain of function inhibition of  T cell signaling.",2009

RBD is known to produce a violent dream acting  out behaviour and, thus, represents a risk of injury for both RBD affect   ed individuals and their bed partner. The prevalence of RBD is 0.38%  in the general population and 0.5% in the elderly population. Several  studies have shown that there is an up to 90% male predominance  in this disease, which suggests a potential link to chromosome X. To  date, no genetic studies have been reported for RBD. Strong evidenc   es lead us to think that there might be a strong relationship between  RBD, Parkinsonâs disease (PD) and Lewy Body Dementia (LBD). We  followed this hypothesis to build an interactome of the genes shared  by PD and LBD, using experimentally demonstrated human protein  protein interactions available online. Using this interactome as a basis  for the mechanism that may underlie RBD, we selected 25 candidate  genes, according to different criteria: 1) genes carrying known muta   tions in either PD or LBD; 2) genes that have strong interactions with  genes carrying known mutations in either PD or LBD; 3) genes impli   cated in other neurodegenerative disorders; and 4) genes located on  chromosome X. These candidate genes are currently being screened  for mutations in a cohort of 100 RBD patients, which constitutes one  of the first attempts to elucidate the genetic mechanisms underlying  RBD.",2009

The peak region includes the Abelson Helper In   tegration Site 1 (AHI1) and a putative gene for a human specific hypo   thalamic mRNA BC040979. Here we densely map the most probable candidates in this area, per   forming a finer mapping of the originally identified linkage peak. The  strongest single SNP and haplotype association lies within a 500 kb  genomic region (135.6 136.1 Mb) encompassing the AHI1 gene and  the BC040979 locus, supporting the role of AHI1 as a susceptibility  gene to SCZ. Interestingly the second highest significant subregion is  immediately downstream and includes PDE7B and MAP7 genes. Resequencing of a 10kb region within AHI1 in ethnically defined popu  Complex traits and polygenic disorders lations suggested that the gene has undergone a selective sweep in  Europeans, in agreement with previous studies.

In order to  identify stroke susceptibility variants, we aimed to study 250 single  nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), which had been associated with  several processes involved in IS such as inflammation, fibrinolysis, co   agulation, hypertension, coronary heart disease, angiogenesis, lipid  metabolism or diabetes. Methods: A case control design was used to analyze 250 SNPs in 183 genes  in a Spanish population comprising 270 IS patients with an occlusion  in the middle cerebral artery territory and 270 matched controls, free  of neurovascular and cardiovascular disorders and familiar history of  stroke.

In this study, we aimed to characterize the rela   tionship between SSAT dysregulation and suicide behavior. To this end,  we measured SSAT expression levels in the ventral prefrontal cortex  (VPFC) of suicide completers (n,20) and controls (n,20) and found  them to be significantly down regulated in suicide victims (p,0.007). To  identify the basis of the regulation of SSAT expression, we performed  an association analysis of 309 SNPs with SSAT transcript levels in 53  lymphoblastoid cell lines from the CEPH collection. We then exam   ined the methylation status of the SSAT promoter region in suicide  completers and control subjects whose SSAT brain expression had  been measured. We found no evidence to support a role for SNPs in  controlling the level of SSAT expression. SSAT promoter methylation  levels were not different between suicide completers and controls and  did not correlate with SSAT expression levels. In addition, we found  no indication of a genetic association between suicidal behavior and  SNPs located within the SSAT gene. Our study provides new results which show that dysregulation of SSAT  expression does play a role in suicide behavior. However, our data do  not support any association between rs6526342 and variation in SSAT  expression or suicidal behavior.Complex traits and polygenic disorders",2009

Methods: A randomized controlled trial was undertaken. Individuals  with inflammatory disease requiring azathioprine treatment were ran   domized (50:50) to receive standard prescribing or TPMT genotyping  to inform prescription. The primary endpoint was stopping azathioprine  secondary to adverse drug reactions (ADRs). Secondary endpoints  included reduction in severe neutropenia, prediction of other ADRs,  quality of life and drug efficacy. An economic evaluation was also con   ducted, Results. Following ethical approval, 333 participants (167 interven   tion: 166 standard) were recruited from 19 centres in England over 24  months.

Conclusion: Our findings support the assertion that TPMT testing is  specific (individuals homozygous for null alleles are at high risk of  neutropenia when treated with azathioprine), but has low sensitivity in  detecting individuals at risk of neutropenia. Therefore, TPMT testing is  valuable in identifying individuals at risk of neutropenia, but must be  performed in tandem with full blood count monitoring to detect individu   als at risk of non TPMT related neutropenia.",2009

Recent studies have implicated variants of the transcription fac   tor 7 like 2 ( TCF7L2 ) gene in genetic susceptibility to T2D in several  different populations. The TCF7L2 gene is a member of the T cell fac   tor (TCF)/lymphoidenhancing factor family of high mobility group box  containing transcription factors involved in the Wnt signaling pathway.  This pathway is a key component to the regulation of cell proliferation  and differentiation. The aim of this study was to determine whether  variants of this gene are also risk factors for T2D developments in  northwest of Iran (Azerbaijan). We genotyped two of these polymor   phisms (rs12255372 and rs7903146) in an admixed sample of 100  patients with T2D and 100 controls. Study were performed using poly   merase chain reaction restriction fragment length polymorphism as   say to investigate the association of rs12255372 (G/T) and rs7903146  (C/T) polymorphisms of the TCF7L2  gene with T2D. These variants  in TCF7L2  seem to be associated with an increased risk of diabetes  among persons with impaired glucose tolerance. The risk conferring  genotypes in TCF7L2  are associated with impaired beta cell function  but not with insulin resistance. These data suggest that inherited or ac   quired changes in TCF7L2  expression or function are mechanistically  involved in causing type 2 diabetes mellitus.",2009

This  study examines the association of FokI polymorphisms in the vitamin  D receptor (VDR) with schizophrenia, bipolar mood disorder (BMD). Methods: In a case control study 43 Schizophrenic, 73 bipolar mood  disorder patients and 100 healthy controls were recruited. All psychi   atric disorders were diagnosed according to DSMIV criteria. Healthy  controls had no familial history of these disorders. DNA extraction was  performed from whole blood .Vitamin D receptor gene polymorphism  (FOKI) was genotyped by PCR RFLP method. Results: The frequency of FF, Ff, ff genotypes in healthy controls were  54 %, 39% and 7% respectively. These frequencies were 58.13%, 34.8% and 6.97% in schizophrenic patients and 69.86%, 19.17% and  10.95% in BMD patients. The homozygote FF genotype was more  common in BMD patients compare to healthy controls (p,0.04). The  odds ratio between frequency of FF genotype in BMD and healthy  control was 1.97 with 95% confidence interval was between 1.04 to  3.73. There was no significant association between FF genotype and  schizophrenia (p,0.7). Conclusion: Previous studies indicated a possible biochemical mecha   nism occurring between vitamin D and mood disorders. Since VDR  FOKI polymorphism has been found to correlate with serum vitamin D  concentrations, it was expected this gene variation associate with bi   polar mood disorder as we found. Also VDR as a nuclear receptor may  contribute to psychiatric disorders via modifying of neurotransmitters  transcriptions like dopamine and serotonin.",2009

The CYP2C19*4  allele, which is  also associated with a poor metabolizer status is less characterized in  the Caucasian populations. Taking into consideration the lack of data  regarding the frequencies of these three CYP2C19  alleles in Romania,  the aim of this study was to provide a first evaluation of these alleles on  a Romanian population group. The CYP2C19  alleles were studied in  200 healthy unrelated individuals. PCR RFLP assays were employed  for the study of each CYP2C19  allele, plus an extra tetra primer PCR  assay used to randomly verify the results obtained with PCR RFLP  for CYP2C19*2  and CYP2C19*3  alleles. CYP2C19*2  was observed  in heterozygous state in 49 individuals (24.5%) and in homozygous  state in 3 individuals (1.5%), while CYP2C19*3  allele was not dem   onstrated in any individuals.

In previous genome wide linkage  studies we identified a major locus on chromosome 2q harboring the Evolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology candidate gene UDP glucuronosyltransferase (UGT1A1). The activity  of this enzyme is significantly influenced by a TA repeat polymorphism  in the promoter of the gene. In a prospective study individuals with  genotype (TA)7/(TA)7 had significantly higher bilirubin levels and ap   proximately one third the risk of CVD as carriers of the wild type (TA)6  allele. In the present study we performed a conditional linkage study to  investigate whether this polymorphism explains the observed linkage  peak and extended our analysis by a genome wide association study  on bilirubin levels in 1345 individuals. Results: After adjustment for the bilirubin variance explained by this  polymorphism, the LOD score on chromosome 2q dropped from 3.8 to  0.4, demonstrating that this polymorphism explains the previous link   age result. For the genome wide association study, the closest marker  to UGT1A1 was in the top ranking SNPs. The association became  even stronger when we considered the TA repeat polymorphism in the  analysis (p,2.68x10 53). Five other SNPs in other regions reached  genome wide significance without obvious connection to bilirubin me   tabolism. Conclusions: Our studies suggest that UGT1A1 may be the major  gene with strong effects on bilirubin levels and the TA repeat poly   morphism might be the key polymorphism within the gene controlling  bilirubin levels. Since this polymorphism has a high frequency and a  substantial impact on the development of CVD, the gene might be an  important drug target.",2009

This disorder is heterogeneous and happens due  to genetic or environmental causes or both. Mutations in the GJB2  gene have been involved in deafness in many populations. This study  aims to investigate genetic epidemiology and frequency of GJB2 gene  mutations in 45 big deaf pedigrees. Methods: In this genetic epidemiology study we have investigated 45  big deaf pedigrees concerning inheritance patterns consanguinity and  diversity of deafness severity among siblings using data collected by  questionnaires and audiograms. We examined also the frequency and  profile of GJB2 gene mutations in 45 probands using direct sequenc   ing strategy. Results: Our study revealed 73% of consanguinity in the deaf pedi   grees studied from which first cousins marriage was the more common  with the rate of 49%. The most common type of first cousins marriage  was found between first cousin who were the children of two brothers.

We used skin ultrasonography measurement of epi   dermal thickness in a series of controls and obligate carriers. 273 in   dividuals were tested by ultrasonography using a linear band probe to  determine their epidermal thickness. Variance and linear regression  analyses were carried out. Regression coefficients were used to obtain  scores of thickness corrected by age and sex. Carriers presented sig   nificant increase in epidermal thickness as compared to controls, GJB2   status explaining 50% of this variability. Results led to the development  of a screening protocol with 98% of sensitivity and 93% specificity, in  subjects aged 20 80, with a likelihood ratio of a positive test of 14 to 1.  Better results were obtained studying people in reproductive age.

Worldwide HLA class i and ii Diversity,P10.39,"N. M. Qutob , A. Manica, F.

Numerous hypotheses have been proposed to explain  how this diversity could be maintained. One such hypothesis (called  Pathogen Driven Balancing Selection) states that different alleles pro   vide protection against different pathogens. A prediction under this  hypothesis is that populations exposed to a wider variety of diseases  should be characterised by higher diversity at their HLA genes. This  prediction has recently received some support in humans when it was  shown that once past demography was accounted for, there is a posi   tive correlation between HLA class I within population genetic diversity  and the number of endemic diseases found in that area. My work involves compiling a large database of HLA allele frequen   cies from human populations worldwide, including class I and II genes.  One limitation of previous work was that a very simple measure of  genetic diversity was computed, and the different alleles were simply  considered as identical or different. Thus, my work involves using more  refined measures of genetic diversity and focuses on the residues  forming the Peptide Binding Region (PBR), as these are the expected  target of natural selection. The work indicates that the geographic apportionment of HLA diversity  is the product of both past demography and complex selective pres   sures.

Design: Splice variants mRNA expression in PBLs was detected and  measured by real time PCR using SYBR green dye. Participants: Four groups, each comprising of 30 male individuals were  included: opioid addicts, methadone maintained patients, long term  abstinent former opioid addicts, and non addicted control subjects. Findings: hMOR 1A and hMOR 1O are expressed in PBLs. However,  we did not observe PBLs expression of hMOR 1X and hMOR 1Y. The  hMOR 1A expression was reduced in abstinents (reaching 0.33 the  amount of control group), up regulated by the factor 1.94 in methadone  maintained patients and not statistically different in addicted group in  comparison to controls. The hMOR 1O expression was significantly  reduced in abstinent and methadone maintained subjects reaching  0.39 and 0.53 the amount of control group, respectively. However, ad   dicted group was not statistically different from controls. Conclusions: Deficiency in expression of hMOR 1A and hMOR 1O  splice variants measured by a suggested peripheral marker, may be a  risk factor making individuals susceptible for drug addiction. This de   ficiency reaches to nearly normal levels in opioid addicts. However,  from therapeutic point of view, we have no explanation for hMOR 1A  mRNA up regulation and hMOR 1O mRNA down regulation in metha   done maintained subjects at the moment.  keywords: human, lymphocytes, mRNA expression, mu opioid recep   tor splice variants, opioid",2009
coevolution of the repeated glutamine and proline codons in the  mammalian Huntington disease gene,P10.43,"D. Savic Pavicevic1, D. Krndija2, G. Brajuskovic1, S. Romac1","1Faculty of Biology, Belgrade, Serbia, 2Department of Internal Medicine I, Ulm,  Germany","The human Huntington disease ( HD) gene contains a CAG microsatel   lite encoding a polyglutamine tract, followed by cryptically simple re   gions encoding a proline reach region. The HD gene is evolutionary  conserved between Drosophila  and humans, but repeated CAG co   dons are seen only in the vertebrates, while repeated CGG codons are  present only in the mammals. To improve understanding of the evolu   tion of the HD gene repeated codons, we sequenced that part of the  gene in 17 mammalian species. The analysis of the obtained nucleo   tide and supposed protein sequences, as well as database sequences  of non mammalian species, led to a model that predicts the coevolu   tion of repeated glutamine and proline codons in the mammalian HD  gene. The coevolution probably resulted from interplay between mu  tational processes, such as replication slippage and point mutations,  and selection, such as purifying selection and selection on the read   ing frames in which tandemly repeated codons can accumulate. The  balance between these processes significantly differ in two regions:  replication slippage and strong purifying selection probably were the  main force for the evolution of the repeated glutamine codons, while  synonymous and non synonymous point mutation and weaker puri   fying selection drove evolution of repeated proline codons.

Some studies suggested that the length of a cy   tosine adenine (CA)n repeat polymorphism located in the promoter 1  region 970bp upstream of transcription start site (TSS) of IGF I  gene is  proportional to the IGF I expression, while some others failed to repro   duce this relationship. Therefore, we hypothesized that there may be  some other genetic variations in the IGF I  promoter region contributing  to the high activity of IGF I other than the  970 CA microsatellite re   peat. The objective of this study was to define the relevant haplotypes  of IGF I  promoter in the Chinese population.  Methods and results: One hundred and sixty male Chinese subjects  participated in this study. Three identified SNPs ( 603 T/A,  705 T/C,   1410 T/C) and the  970 CA microsatellite repeat in the IGF I  promoter  1 were selected and genotyped by restriction fragment length poly   morphism (RFLP). The results showed that three haplotypes, C 18 TT,  C 19 TT, and T 21 CA, are prevalent, and they account for almost 80%  of genotypes in the Chinese population.  Conclusion: The haplotype pattern, together with the CA microsatellite  repeat number, may be a biomarker for various cancers in the Chinese  population.

This population is  a relatively stable well defined population of the Eastern province of  Saudi Arabia where a thorough follow up system is provided to all the  patients. Methods: The records of all patients, born from January 1983 Decem   ber 2008 within SAMSO facility and diagnosed with IEM.  Results: Over the last 25 years, 165,530 infants were born and fol   lowed up at SAMSO. Among these infants, 248 were diagnosed with  different types of IEM. The over all estimated incidence was 150 cases  per 100,000 live births. 54 % of these were labeled as small molecules  disorders such as aminoacidopathy, organic acidopathy, urea cycle  disorders and fatty acids oxidation disorders. Organic acidopathy was  the most commonly diagnosed small molecule disorder (29/100,000).

Additionally, we explored how well a set of tagSNPs  chosen from the European HapMap samples data (set3) performed in  the Spanish population. These three sets were used to estimate minor  allele frequencies (MAFs) of untyped variants using TUNA software. A  high correlation between observed and estimated MAFs was found for  all three sets (R2>0.95). Differences between observed and estimated  MAFs were similar for set1 and set2 (~7%) and were much higher for  set3 (34%), being reduced by two fold (1.7%, 2.7% and 17%, respec   tively) for common variants (MAFâ¥10%). On the basis of these results,  we propose that only common (MAFâ¥10%) untyped variants of this  gene should be considered for association studies, especially when  tagSNPs are selected from a reference HapMap population. Although  functionally enriched tagSNPs sets might be a straightforward way of  exploring the association of a candidate gene with disease, their use  increase genotyping costs without improving the accuracy in predicting  untyped variants or the coverage of the gene.

To date there is no profound study of mtDNA sequence  variability among Bulgarian population. Our study is aiming at creating  a referent mitochondrial Bulgarian database by direct sequencing of  mtDNA control region (CR) in more than 300 unrelated individuals.  Here we present our preliminary results. MtDNAs of 94 unrelated Bulgarian individuals from different parts of  Bulgaria were isolated with salt extraction technique. Two hypervari   able segments (HVRI and HVRII) of approximately 870 nucleotides  within the CR of mitochondrial genome were examined by direct auto   mated sequencing on ABI3130xl. Among 94 studied individuals were identified 89 different haplotypes.  Seventy three haplotypes were defined by 81 variable sites in HVRI  and 64 haplotypes were defined by 43 variable sites in HVRII. Two  novel, unreported so far, nucleotide changes were observed: 16233  AâT and 42 TâTG. Point mutation heteroplasmy was detected at  five positions  16093, 16287, 146, 185 and 298. Mitochondrial diver   sity (D) was estimated as 0.983 for HVRI, 0.980 for HVRII and 0.998  for both regions. These values, compared with other European popu   lations (0.93 0.98), revealed very high genetic diversity of Bulgarian  population.

Genetic factors including  oncogenes and tumor suppressor genes are always involved in pro   gression of this cancer. The P53 tumor suppressor gene is believed  to have a broad role in the cell such as programmed cell death and  stop cell replicating damaged DNA which has been summarized on the  guardian of the genome.

The genetic relationship between populations was evaluated based on  both Neiâs genetic distance and Principal Component Analysis (PCA)  by Phylip Package (version 3.6) and Statistical Package for the Social  Sciences Software. Our results revealed no significant difference in allele frequencies of  the three microsatellite markers between the panmictic population of  Bucharest and the slight isolated population from Prahova Valley. Genetic distance analysis and PCA showed closer genetic kinship to  Greek population, as well as Slavic population from Poland. Intercultural exchanges and intense trading activities between old  human populations from Romania (Thracians) and Greek population  groups, who established colonies on the west coast of the Black Sea  (nowadays East Romania) during the 7th 8th centuries, may explain  our findings. The Slavic influence may be the result of migrations of Slavic groups  across the Carpathian Danube regions during the 6th 9th centuries. These data can also be used for paternity and forensic analyses in  Romanian population.",2009
High sequence variability of exon 2 of runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) in four siberian populations,P10.72,"M. S. Nazarenko , M. V. Golubenko, L. P. Nazarenko","State Research Institute of Medical Genetics, Tomsk, Russian Federation","The runt related transcription factor 2 (RUNX2) is the principal osteo   genic master switch, which acts as regulator of osteoblast differentiation  and skeletal morphogenesis. Mutations of RUNX2 gene were shown  to cause cleidocranial dysplasia (OMIM 119600). Itâs also believed that  this gene is a candidate for osteoporosis. To date, a few reports about  polymorphisms in the RUNX2 gene have been published describing  population prevalence of repeat length variants in glutamine and ala   nine stretches and nearby SNPs. We employed PCR RFLP and DNA  sequencing to screen genetic variations within the exon 2 of RUNX2  gene in DNA samples of Russians (n,96), Yakuts (n,96), Tuvinians  (n,96) and Buryats (n,96). In total of 15 chromosomes with gluta   mine stretch variants (16Q, 30Q and 32Q) were detected in our study.  Two mutants (16Q) were found among Russians. One 32Q allele and  one 30Q allele were identified in Yakutia and Tuva, respectively. The  most abundant sequence variability was registered in Buryatia. From  the 96 individuals genotyped, there were a total of 11 glutamine tract  variations, including ten 32Q alleles and one 30Q allele. All RUNX2  variants were heterozygous for a mutant allele and a wild type al   lele. We revealed two Tuvinians with novel variant NM_001924630.2:  c.467C>T (NP_001019801.2: p.A156V). The frequencies of alleles  and genotypes of common 18 base pair deletion of polyalanine tract  and rs6921145:G>A were also established in our study. These results  suggest that there is considerable sequence variability of exon 2 of  RUNX2 gene in ethnically diverse Siberian populations.Evolutionary and population genetics, and Genetic epidemiology",2009

The family and tribe are the basis of the so   cial structure and Saudis are cognizant of their heritage, their tribe, and  their extended and nuclear family. Consanguinity and other factors,  including environmental factors, have played a significant role in accu   mulating genetic disorders, some very rare ones, at a higher frequency  in the Saudis. We conducted three National studies over a period of  twenty years to screen the entire country for common single gene dis   orders (including sickle cell gene, Î±  and Î²  thalassaemia, glucose  6 phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency) and multifactorial disorders  (including diabetes mellitus, obesity, and hypertension). Over 60,000  samples were screened and gene frequencies of these disorders were  obtained. In addition, studies conducted in other institutions reported  several inborn errors of metabolism, chromosomal, mitochondrial and  somatic cell disorders (cancers). Several disorders, rare in other popu   lations, occur at a high frequency in the Saudi. The genetic basis of  several of these disorders has been unveiled and very interesting pic   ture has emerged for the common disorders, where mutations specific  to Saudis and rare in other populations form the basis of several of  the common disorders. The natural history of several of the disorders  has been investigated and a wide range of clinical diversity has been  identified. Steps have been adopted towards primary prevention.

This disease is caused by the expansion of a (CAG)n located in the  ATXN2, that encodes a polyglutamine tract of more than 34 repeats.  Lately, alleles with 32 33 CAGs have been associated to late onset  disease cases. Repeat interruptions by CAA triplets are common in  normal alleles, while expanded alleles usually contain a pure repeat  tract. To investigate the mutational origin and the instability associated  to the ATXN2 repeat, we performed an extensive haplotype study and  sequencing of the CAG/CAA repeat, in a cohort of families of differ   ent geographic origins and phenotypes. Our results showed (1) CAA  interruptions in ATXN2 alleles, regardless of its pathogenic nature,  and that (2) CAA interrupted alleles in the range 33 44 repeats shared  an ancestral haplotype with pure expanded alleles; (3) an intragenic  SNP based haplotype, C C, common to all SCA2 families regardless  of its interruption pattern, origin or phenotype; and (4) higher genetic  diversity in European SCA2 families, suggesting an older European  ancestry of SCA2. In conclusion, we found a shared ancestral ATXN2  haplotype for pure and interrupted expanded alleles, with strong impli   cations in mutation diagnosis and counseling. Our results indicate that  interrupted alleles, below the pathological threshold, may be a reser   voir of mutable alleles, prone to expansion in subsequent generations,  leading to full disease mutatio",2009

","Introduction: Spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) is one of the most com   mon autosomal recesive neuromuscular disorder. It has a prevalence  of between 1 in 6000 and 1 in 10,000 live births in Caucasian popula   tions. The epidemiology of SMA in our country was not published yet.  In retrospecitve study we examined patients with clinical diagnosis of  SMA in order to estimate the prevalence of SMA. Material and Methods: Molecular genetic analysis was performed  for patients with a clinical diagnosis of SMA, whose blood samples  was sent to our laboratory during the 10 years period (from 1998 until  2008). PCR/RFLP analysis was used to detect homozygous deletion  of the SMN1 . MLPA analysis was found to be an efficient method for  detecting copy numbers of SMN1  and SMN2 . Results: After screening by PCR/RFLP analysis 75 out of 158 patients  had homozygous SMN1 deletion. Exons 7 and 8 were homozygously  deleted in 58 patients (77%), while 17 (23%) showed deletion of only  exon 7. In one SMA patient, MLPA revealed 1 copy of SMN1 . In one  family, 2 sibilings with SMA and 1 non affected showed only homozy   gous deletion of SMN2 . Additionaly, homozygous deletion of SMN2   was detected in the mother, whereas her daughterâs lack both copies  of SMN1 . The prevalence of SMA was estimated at 3.94/105 on Sep   tember 30st 2008 . Conclusions: The prevalence is comparable to previously reported  data in other Caucasian populations. Due to complexity of SMA ge   netics, testing of additional family members should be suggested and  offered when appropriate.",2009

Telomere length is linked to age related  diseases, with shorter telomeres associated with an increased prob   ability of mortality from infection or heart disease. Our aim was to de   termine the decrease rate of telomere length over a time period of ten  years and whether this decrease rate was influenced by age, sex and  smoking behaviour. Research design and methods: We compared relative telomere lengths  (RTL) in 510 sample pairs from the longitudinal population based Bru   neck study, which were collected in 1995 and ten years later in 2005.  RTL were determined by a high throughput real time genotyping assay  and by applying various mathematical models. Results: Rate of change in RTL was highly variable among individuals.  Mean telomere length decreased over ten years by 20.4% (95% CI:  16.8   24.1; p<0.001). The RTL attrition rate was highly correlated with  the starting RTL in 1995 (r,0.743, p<0.001) and showed differences  between males and females. By contrast, smoking behaviour seemed  to have no influence on telomere lengths. Conclusions: Our findings underscore the complexity of telomere dy   namics and highlight the importance of taking measurement errors into  consideration when interpreting uncommon findings. Our methodology  proved to be a reliable and replicable tool for a rapid determination of  relative telomere length with a low amount of input DNA. The most  striking observation was that age dependent RTL shortening was pro   portional to RTL at baseline examination.",2009

Usher syndrome type II is the most common form of Usher syndrome.  Although 3 genes are known as disease causing, USH2A  is the major  involved gene. It encodes two isoforms of the protein usherin. This  protein is part of an interactome that plays an essential role in the de   velopment and the function of the stereocilia of inner ear hair cells. In  the photoreceptor, usherin is located at the periciliary region between  extern and inner segments. This gene contains 72 exons over a region  of 800 kb. Although numerous mutations have been described, the  c.2299delG mutation is the most prevalent in several populations. Its  ancestral origin was previously suggested with the identification of a  core haplotype restricted to 250 kb in the 5Â´ region of the gene. Be   cause we extended the haplotype analysis over the 800 kb region with  a total of 14 intragenic SNPs, we could define 10 different c.2299delG  haplotypes showing a high variability but with the conservation of the  previous described core haplotype. An exhaustive c.2299delG/control  haplotypes study suggests that the major source of haplotype vari   ability in USH2A  gene is recombination.

Here we have analyzed the two exons of the gene and the data we  present suggest that AVPR1B has been subjected to natural selection  in humans. In particular, analysis of exon 2 strongly suggests the ac   tion of balancing selection in African populations and Europeans: the  region displays high nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate  frequency alleles, a higher level of within species diversity compared  to interspecific divergence and a genealogy with common haplotypes  separated by deep branches. This relatively unambiguous situation  coexists with unusual features across exon 1, raising the possibility  that a nonsynonymous variant (Gly191Arg) in this region has been subjected to directional selection. Although the underlying selective pressure(s) remains to be identi   fied, we consider this to be among the first documented examples of a  gene involved in mood disorders and subjected to natural selection in  humans; this observation might add support to the long debated idea  that depression/low mood might have played an adaptive role during  human evolution.",2009

Methods: We estimated the heritability of vitamin B12 levels in 1063  female twin pairs (262 monozygotic twin pairs and 801 dizygotic twin  pairs), aged 18 to 80 years from the TwinsUK Adult Twin Registry.  Structural genetic modeling was used to determine the influence of  genetic and environmental factors on vitamin B12 variation. Results: Genetic factors showed to account for 52% (95%CI, 45 58%)  of vitamin B12 variation. The variance in vitamin B12 levels was ex   plained by additive genetic and non shared environmental factors, with  the additive genetic variance estimated to 52% (95%CI, 45 58%) and  the non shared environmental variance to 48% (95%CI, 41 54%). Conclusions: Vitamin B12 levels were shown to be highly heritable and  here we report the first heritability estimation for vitamin B12 levels.  The high heritability obtained for vitamin B12 levels is suggesting that  further genetic analysis have to be considered in order to identify ge   netic variants responsible for vitamin B12 variation.",2009

Previous studies have proposed that  the observed R1b1b2 frequency cline is due to a population expansion  from an Iberian Ice age refugium after the LGM (Malaspina et al. 1998;  Semino et al. 2000). In this study, we explored the phylogeography of the human Y chro   mosome haplogroup R1b1b2 by analyzing more than 2,000 males  from Europe. The haplogroup defining marker M269 (Cruciani et al.  2002), and two additional internal markers (U106 and U152, Sims et al  2007) which identify internal branches (R1b1b2g and R1b1b2h) were  analyzed. The paragroup R1b1b2*(xR1b1b2g, R1b1b2h) and the hap   logroups R1b1b2g and R1b1b2h showed quite different frequency dis   tribution patterns within Europe, with frequency peaks in the Iberian  Peninsula, northern Europe and northern Italy/France, respectively.  The overall frequency pattern of R1b1b2 haplogroup is suggestive of  multiple events of migration and expansion within Europe rather than  a single and uniform spread of people from an Iberian Ice age refu   gium.

We have focused our study on the department of FinistÃ¨re,  the most western territorial unit of Brittany, and its administrative and  historical areas. To explore the diversity of the Y chromosome, we ana   lyzed a total of 348 unrelated males using a combination of 23 biallelic  markers and 12 microsatellite loci. The molecular analysis revealed  that 82.2% of the Y chromosomes fell into haplogroup R1b, placing  FinistÃ¨re within the Western European landscape.

Promoter polymorphism  368 c/t of the acetyl coA carboxylase  2 gene ACACB influences activity and nuclear protein binding in  HepG2 cells,P11.002,"A. K. Lee , T. Kyriakou, S. D. OâDell","Nutritional Science Division, London, United Kingdom","Acetyl CoA carboxylase 2 (ACC2) catalyses the formation of malonyl  CoA, a key regulator of fatty acid oxidation. Increased ACC2 activity  would reduce fatty acid oxidation because malonyl CoA inhibits entry  into mitochondria via carnitine palmitoyltransferase I (CPTI). The tran   scriptional regulation of the ACC2 gene ( ACACB ) is complex and in   volves many factors which may be tissue specific. In liver, it has been  established that promoter P II controls transcription of the ACACB   gene and sterol regulatory element binding protein 1 (SREBP 1)  regulates expression. We studied the functional impact of a single  nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the promoter region  368 C/T  (rs16939972) in HepG2 cells in the presence of SREBP 1a. The  368  C/T SNP was selected as the closest to known SRE sites, validated  on dbSNP and occurring at a frequency of over 0.05 in the CEPH  population (MAF,0.25). The promoter construct carrying the  368 T  allele showed 1.35 fold lower activity than the construct carrying the   368 C allele. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed  the  368 T allele has a higher affinity for nuclear proteins than the  368  C allele, suggesting the  368 C/T SNP may bind to a repressor. EMSA  competition experiments using unlabelled oligonucleotides containing  transcription factor binding motifs, showed that the  368 C/T SNP may  bind to C Myb, GATA and/or glucocorticoid receptor (GR) proteins. In  conclusion, the data suggest the ACACB   368 C/T polymorphism is  a regulatory SNP that affects promoter activity in HepG2 cells in the  presence of SREBP 1a and alters nuclear protein binding affinity.",2009

Allele specific PCR  using Snapback primers is a closed tube intramolecular method that  does not require fluorescently labeled probes. Only two PCR primers  are required, with the addition of a short tail of nucleotides on one  primer that results in an intramolecular hybridization probe. Genotyp   ing is performed by high resolution melting of the hairpin. Rapid cycle  PCR enables selective amplification of minority alleles by lowering the  extension time to 0 second. Using a carousel LightCyclerÂ® or LS 32  (Idaho Technology), this requires less than 25 minutes. High resolu   tion melting is then performed on an HR 1 or LS 32. The detection  sensitivity of point variants is up to 1 in 1000.

A hallmark of the scien   tific process is the reproducibility of published outcomes, and yet com   paring the results of microarray studies has proven difficult. Although  experimental results of global gene expression measuring may identify  common genes, each research group will typically produce different  list of statistically significant differentially expressed genes, which calls  into question the reliability and validity of each gene list. There are two  general approaches to integrating microarray studies: meta analysis of  the primary data by merging data from multiple studies, and compara   tive analysis of the published results (i.e., gene lists). The application  of conventional meta analysis to raw microarray data is complicated  by differences in the type of microarray used, gene nomenclatures,  species, and analytical methods. An alternative approach to combin   ing multiple microarray studies is to compare the published gene lists.  However, manual combining data from published gene lists is often a  very tedious and time consuming task. In order to address these is   sues, we have developed a web based platform, called NeuroMiner to  house and integrate the results of published microarray experiments  from selected neurodegenerative diseases (Alzheimerâs disease, Hun   tingtonâs disease, Multiple sclerosis, and Down syndrom).

Still it is not frequently elaborated because  it possesses drawbacks in fragments resolution and mapping of the  identified differentially methylated loci. AIMS generates significant  numbers of PCR products, thus the mode of DNA fragments detection  has to be optimized to achieve appropriate resolution and easy map   ping to the genome. We have achieved single nucleotide resolution by  capillary electrophoresis (CE). At the same time CE does not generally  provide preparative option, thus sequencing the bands in order to iden   tify the genomic locations of the fragments has to be substituted by  another approach. Knowledge of exact nucleotide length of a predicted  or practically obtained AIMS product allows its in silico identification  in genomic context. In order to utilize this option we have designed  specific software, AIMS in silico , which predicts all possible outcomes  of AIMS and labels the fragments of certain lengths with unique se   quence descriptors allowing their genomic positioning. Elaboration of  this AIMS bioinformatics CE approach allows rapid characterization of  normal and cancer methylomes, assessment of tissue specific meth   ylation, identification of novel genes prone to abnormal methylation  in cancer, and rough evaluation of the cancer methylome landscapes  for different types of disease. We present the results obtained on  paired (tumor/control) breast tissue samples, control peripheral blood  samples and extraembryonic tissues in order to demonstrate the valid   ity and potentials of our approach, and describe novel cancer related  genes identified in breast cancer.",2009

","Cardiovascular malformations (CVMs) have a higher incidence in pa   tients with NF1 microdeletion syndrome, compared to classical NF1  patients, presumably owing to haploinsufficiency of the genes lying in  the deletion interval. Searching for CMVs candidate genes inside the  deletion, we focused our attention on three genes, CENTA2, SUZ12  AND UTP6. Whole mount in situ hybridization (WISH) on mouse em   bryos showed high expression of Centa2 in heart at 9 10 dpc, and  of Suz12 in the atrium around 10 dpc, suggesting their involvement  in heart development and CVMs onset. RT PCR analysis on zebraf   ish embryos showed Centa2 and Suz12 expression in oocytes and  throughout all the analyzed stages (8 cells 120 hpf). Centa2, but not  Suz12 was also present in adult heart. We thus carried out WISH ex   periments on zebrafish embryos to characterize Canta2/Suz12 spatio  temporal expression profiles. At 24 hpf we observed a diffuse Centa2  specific hybridization signal in the cephalic and medial portion of the  embryo, which becomes stronger starting from 48 hpf.

We recently reported that the large 3âUTR of CDK5R1  contains regulatory elements affecting transcript stability. Many mi   croRNAs (miRNAs) target sites have been predicted by PicTar soft   ware. We evaluated the expression of nine pre miRNAs, among the  20 miRNAs predicted to bind CDK5R1, in six cell lines. Among the ex   pressed miRNAs, we observed that five of them present a high number  of target sites with a free energy < 20 kcal/mol. A Real Time PCR of  the above miRNAs showed an inverse correlation between miR 107/ miR 103 levels and p35 expression, suggesting a negative effect of  the two miRNAs on CDK5R1 expression. We overexpressed miR 107  by transfecting the specific precursor in neuroblastoma SK N BE cells  and observed a 75% reduction in p35 expression, while the transfec   tion of anti miR 107 led to a 2.3 times increase of p35 in comparison  to the control. The obtained findings indicate that miR 107 regulates  CDK5R1/p35 expression. Itâs worth to be noted that under expression  of miR 107 has been implicated in the acceleration of AD. Experiments  on the other miRNAs of interest are in progress. Luciferase constructs  will be used to validate the predicted miRNA target sites in CDK5R1  3âUTR. Our findings on CDK5R1 regulation by miRNAs allow us to  hypothesize that a new pathogenetic miRNA mediated mechanism  might influence the CDK5 phosphorylation activity on Tau, leading to  AD progression.",2009

More than 1500 CFTR  mutations have already been described and new semi quantitative ap   proaches have been developed to evidence gross rearrangements in  the 27 exons of the gene. These deletions account for about 1 3 % of  the CF disease. We have described 8 new rearrangements and char   acterized their breakpoint junctions. However this technique missed  the intronic region as well as the 5â and the 3â UTR part of the gene. Methods : We designed a custom Agilent 15K array on the locus CFTR.  This oligonucleotide array enable us to cover 2 Mb encompassing the  CFTR locus as well as the gene itself. We analysed positives and unaf   fected controls, 109 CF and 160 CBAVD patients with an incomplete  genotype. Results and conclusion: We evidenced the 11 deletions collected in  our laboratory as controls. We also identified 5 duplications and 2 de   letions in the CFTR gene. About the CBAVD patients, we observed 2  intronic deletions.  This custom array allow a rapid design of primers to  amplify the 5â and 3â breakpoints junctions of the variation and to obtain  the sequence permitting the characterization of the defect at the mo   lecular level.

The key test used to predict disease relapse and graft rejection  is monitoring of post transplant chimerism. The basic principle in the detection of chimerism is the utilization of  differences between recipient and donor genomes. Single nucleotide  polymorphism is the most abundant form of genetic variability in the  human genome. SNPs have proved to be particularly useful as mark   ers for monitoring chimerism after BMT, because they are stable and  unique and can be analyzed by sensitive qPCR. However, before it  becomes established method for routine chimerism monitoring, qPCR  marker set for every transplant pair should be available. The aim of our study was to design and validate a new SNP allele  specific system to supplement already existing InDel primer panel. We  present an approach for the economic in house design of SNP allele  specific qPCR primers/probe sets with locus individualized reference  system that allows accurate quantification of respective informative  locus using simple Î±Î±Ct method without standard curves. We designed ARMS primers/probe sets specific for seven biallelic SNP  loci and validated them in a population of 30 transplant pairs. Detec   tion limit of our system was 0.1%. Combination of our SNP qPCR sys   tem and InDel primers increased recipient genotype identification from  86.6% (113/127) to 96.6% (123/127) when tested in a population of all  transplant pairs.

A statistically significant overrepresentation of the genes mapping to  the flanks of the engineered interval was also found in the top ranked  differentially expressed genes. A phenomenon efficient across multiple  cell lineages and that extends along the entire chromosome, mega   bases from the breakpoints. These long range effects are unidirection   al and uncoupled from the number of copies of the CNV genes. Our re   sults suggest that the assortment of genes mapping to a chromosome  is not random.

They occur commonly in the human ge   nome, often affecting genes and potentially influencing human traits. Aim: Assess the prevalence of CNVs at the population level and their  association with multiple traits and diseases. Methods: We obtained normalized intensity data of 5,824 individuals of  the Rotterdam Study (RS), a population based cohort of elderly men  and women of Dutch origin, genotyped on the Illumina 550K array and  applied two computational methods that use intensity signals (Quan   tiSNP) and deviations from Hardy Weinberg equilibrium and informa   tion on LD patterns (Trityper) to detect both common and rare CNVs. Results: After quality control, Trityper identified 775 sites with evidence  of a common deletion, 400 of which had a frequency > 0.05. Quan   tiSNP identified 49,229 events (mapping to 26,162 genomic locations)  with an estimated false positive rate of 1 / 100,000.

My host laboratory has generated an ex   tensive map of CNV in wild mice and inbred strains. These variable  regions cover ~11% of their autosomal genome. Tissue transcriptome  data show that expression levels of genes within CNVs tend to cor   relate with copy number changes and that CNVs influence the expres   sion of flanking genes.

SNPs are used to investigate susceptibility to common diseases, yet  they explain but a small fraction of the phenotypic variance. Copy  number variation (CNV) is the most frequent structural variation in the  human genome and encompasses more nucleotides than SNPs. It is  likely that CNVs explain at least some of phenotypic variance that can   not be attributed to SNPs, but the extent of this contribution remains  unknown.

First, that DNA methylation acts to silence  macro non protein coding RNAs. Second, that macro ncRNAs act  to silence flanking genes in cis . To date, two examples of imprinted  macro ncRNAs with a silencing function are known ( Air and Kcnq1ot1 ,  reviewed in Pauler & Barlow 2006). In order to identify and character   ize new macro ncRNAs we selected imprinted regions from the hu   man genome and CIMP (CpG Island Methylator Phenotype) regions  to generate HIRTA (Human Imprinted Region Tiling Array) Chips. RNA  samples from different tissues, ES cells and from normal or tumor cell  lines are hybridized to these chips using the RETA (RNA Expression  Tiling Array) technique. In order to analyze the results from the Chips  we have developed the NORBERT (NOn  coding RNA identification  Based on Enrichment on RNA Tiling array) program. Our goals are to  test: (1) if macro ncRNAs are a common feature of imprinted regions  in the human genome, (2) if imprinted macro ncRNAs are deregulated  in cancer, and (3) if macro ncRNAs play a role in regulating non im   printed genes. We are particularly interested to test if macro ncRNAs  play a role in the gain DNA methylation of tumor suppressor genes  in tumors. Our preliminary data show that by this approach we can  identify 5 well known imprinted ncRNAs and that we are able to detect  novel macro ncRNA candidates.

Mutant  fibroblasts are associated with cell cycles extended by 50% and 33%,  respectively, when compared to w.t. cells. RPS19  mutant fibroblasts  accumulate in the G1 phase suggesting a G1/G0 arrest, whereas  RPS24  mutant cells are significantly reduced in the G2 phase. We also  observe a concomitant down regulation of the small subunit proteins  in mutant cells. The mutations result in impaired rRNA maturation and  ribosomal subunit assembly.

In transgenic mice harboring a human Î² locus,  knockout of MBD2 leads to a substantial induction of Î³ globin mRNA  (Rupon et al. PNAS , 2006). However MBD2 does not seem to act by  binding to CpG regions in the Î³ globin promoter. Here we have sought  to determine whether MBD2 is mediating its effect through associa   tion with the LCR associated remodeling complex (LARC)_a complex  that contains NURD (and MBD2) and binds to the LCR as well as the  Î³ globin promoter (Mahajan et al. PNAS , 2005). Here we have first  determined that K562 cells are an appropriate model system to study  MBD2 mediated Î³ globin repression. In particular, we have shown  that a validated siRNA targeting MBD2 leads to a 35% knockdown  of MBD2 and a corresponding 1.7 fold increase in Î³ globin in K562  cells (using qPCR and GAPDH as the internal control). In contrast, a  validated siRNA targeting hnRNP C (C1/C2), the DNA binding protein  of LARC, gave a 46% knockdown of hnRNP C but had no appreciable  effect on Î³ globin RNA levels (1.07 relative to a scrambled siRNA).  These results suggest that MBD2 mediated Î³ globin repression is not  mediated through LARC in K562 cells. We are in the process of us   ing lentiviral vectors to deliver MBD2 and hnRNP C shRNAs.

Further, we found 93% of expressed genes par   ticipating in alternative splicing when events between known exons  and unannotated exons are included. A further 1,544 events between  unannotated exons are also found. We are conducting additional ex   periments to validate these findings.Genomics, Genomic technology and Epigenetics",2009

Cruce1","1Univ Med Pharm Craiova, Craiova, Romania, 2Univ Med Pharm Victor Babes  Timisoara, Timisoara, Romania","BACKGROUND: DNA damage checkpoint is one of the surveillance  systems to maintain genomic integrity. The aim of our study was to  compare genes expression profiles in normal, premalignant and malig   nant specimens in order to distinguish differentially expressed genes  by using quantitative real time reverse transcription polymerase chain  reaction (qRT PCR). PATIENTS AND METHODS: In order to detect the gene expression  patterns we analyzed three sample types for each of our 25 patients:  specimens from diverse sites of healthy gut, adenomatous polyps and  malignant tissue. In order to asses the RNA quality we analysed the  18S and 28S ribosomal RNA bands integrity by electrophoresis. The  reverse transcription was performed using the High Capacity cDNA  Reverse Transcription Kit (Applied Biosystems). In order to evaluate  gene expression, we used Applied Biosystems validated TaqMan Gene  Expression Assays for 9 genes associated with the ATR/ATM signaling  network and transcriptional targets of DNA damage response. RESULTS: We successfully performed qRT PCR analysis showing  that a dysfunction in DNA damage response contributes to genomic  instability in colon samples. In 20 of our malignant samples we detect   ed a significantly disregulation of gene expression in six DNA repair  genes (ANKRD17, EXO1, MLH1, MLH3, MSH2, MSH3) comparing  with the normal specimens. CONCLUSION: Determination of gene expression profiles by us   ing qRT PCR is an ideal tool to improve knowledge of CRC molecu   lar pathways. However, defined gene signatures are highly variable  among studies, none of the identified expressional patterns or molecu   lar markers has been successfully validated as a diagnostic or prog   nostic tool applicable to routine clinical practice.",2009

Dergu   nova","Institute of Molecular Genetics RAS, Moscow, Russian Federation","Recently sphingomyelin synthase 1 ( SMS1 ) gene has been identified.  The enzyme SMS1 occupies a central position in sphingolipid metabo  lism: it catalyses the conversion of ceramide and phosphatidylcholine  to sphingomyelin and diacylglycerol (DAG). Since SMS1 may have a  direct impact on cell proliferation and life span by regulating the cel   lular levels of pro apoptic factor ceramide and mytogenic factor DAG  it is of a great importance to investigate the function of  SMS1  gene  in the cell. To date we have found 12 new alternative transcripts of  SMS1 gene using in silico  and in vitro  methods. Most of them differ  from SMS1  mRNA in 5â untranslated regions (5â UTR). New revealed  5â UTRs are located in front of exon I and also between exons I and  II, II and III, VI and VII. These exons were identified in SMS1 gene  earlier. We also found alternative transcripts of this gene that include  not known before exons, situated between exons VII and VIII. Analy   sis with GENOMATIX software revealed several putative promoter  regions adjacent to four new exons. Variations in levels of different  transcripts between tissues were obtained by semi quantitative RT  PCR. We presume that regulation of SMS1  gene functional activity is  provided by using alternative promoters and synthesis of alternative  mRNAs. It was shown that some of predicted open reading frames of  new transcripts encode full length SMS1 protein while others encode  C  or N terminal truncated forms of the protein. In particular circum   stances the presence of different alternative transcripts of SMS1  gene  may give rise to at least three different proteins.",2009

Girard","University Hospital Basel, Basel, Switzerland","In anesthesia two inherited pharmacogenetic diseases are of primary  interest: malignant hyperthermia (MH) due to the potentially fatal con   sequences and butyrylcholinesterase (BCHE) deficiency due to its high  incidence. MH is a dominantly inherited disorder of skeletal muscle  triggered by inhalative anesthetics in genetically predisposed individu   als. MH susceptible (MHS) patients are known to carry mutations in  RYR1 and CACNA1S genes. Because of the large gene sizes, minor  allele frequency of causative mutations of RYR1 gene as well as lack  of predominantly hot spot regions in the CACNA1S gene, the acquisi   tion of genetic information in a routine way is difficult. Mutations in the  BCHE gene can substantially prolong the duration of action of short  acting neuromuscular blocking drugs. This prolongation prevents the  patient from spontaneous ventilation for hours. We aim to maximize  the information of these anesthesia related genes in a practicable way  applying array technology. The development of the genechip included  the selection of the gene sequences, selection of the positive SNP con   trols, setup of the PCR parameters, verification of the PCR fragments,  labeling of purified PCR fragments and finally chip hybridization and  analysis. We will present the preliminary data obtained using this chip.  The resequencing based array technology enables sequencing a large  number of bases on a single chip. This resequencing array promises  a reliable, efficient and high throughput method that would improve  the analysis of these heterogeneous genes and therefore facilitate to  determinate the genetic basis of MH susceptibility and contributes to  safer administration of drugs.",2009

complete sequencing of the cFtR gene using next generation Gs FLX sequencing technology,P11.050,"L. Vliegen, J. Cassiman, H. Cuppens","Center for Human Genetics, Leuven, Belgium","Next generation sequencing technologies have been recently intro   duced. However, this technology was initially developed for whole ge   nome sequencing purposes. We have adopted this technology for complete sequence analysis of  the CFTR coding region. For a 50x coverage, only half a million nucleotides are needed for  CFTR sequence analysis of one patient. Therefore, 100 200 samples  should be pooled in order to use the full capacity of the GS FLX sys   tem. We have developed an economically feasible universal sample  tagging approach allowing the pooling of 100 samples with one set of  260 primers (60 amplicon specific primers and 200 tagging primers).  This compares to 6000 primers if amplicon specific primers are tagged  as such. Normally, each amplicon should be amplified individually and purified.  Then, the concentration of each solution is accurately determined in  order to pool all amplicons in equimolar concentrations. The universal  tagging approach resulted in a less dynamic range of the yield of the  different amplicons, so that the time consuming preparation of equi   molar solutions could be simplified. We are even further simplifying the PCR steps through the develop   ment of robust multiplex PCR reactions. Indeed, 30 amplicons should  be analyzed for the CFTR gene, and this can ultimately be only eco   nomically feasible if amplified in one, or a limited number, of multiplex  PCR reaction(s). Specifically, we have developed a robust multiplex  amplification assay in which biotinylated amplicon specific primers are  locally restricted through streptavidin/biotin crosslinking.

This can be achieved by  including CpG dinucleotides in the PCR primer sequence and delib   erately shifting the PCR bias to preferentially amplify the methylated  sequence. The methylation status of each CpG is confirmed by di   rectly sequencing the PCR product of the HRM reaction. These results  demonstrate the sensitivity of HRM analysis in detecting extremely low  levels of methylation, and the general workflow of sequencing the PCR  product following HRM methylation analysis.",2009
Rapid high throughput screening and identification of unknown DNA variation using High Resolution melt and sequencing  workflow.,P11.060,"N. Koch , N. Chen, A. Lam, G. Janaway, J. Wang","Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States","High Resolution Melt (HRM) is a recent enhancement to traditional  melting analyses that significantly increases the detail and informa   tion that can be captured. HRM requires the use of new DNA bind   ing dyes that allow a sharp melting transition of double stranded to  single stranded DNA. The HRM screening method is sensitive enough  to detect single nucleotide differences in several hundred base pairs  of sequence. We have successfully used HRM to screen for unknown  DNA variations in genomic DNA. Traditional methods of DNA vari   ant screening (dHPLC, SSCP) are more costly and time consuming  than the HRM method. HRM screening identifies samples containing Genomics, Genomic technology and Epigenetics sequence variation relative to a control sample; however, HRM does  not impart the identity of the variation, and sequencing is required to  exactly identify the nucleotide changes. Since HRM is an end point  PCR analysis technique, we further developed a workflow enabling  the product of HRM PCR to be used directly in a Sanger sequencing  reaction after a simple 100 to 200 fold dilution. The direct sequencing  approach conserves sample by eliminating another round of PCR to  generate product for sequencing. And the high ratio dilution eliminates  the need for a purification step after PCR. The fluorescent dye used  for HRM does not interfere with the sequencing reaction. To further  simplify the workflow, universal M13 tags were added to the 5â end  of the gene specific primers allowing the HRM amplicons to be easily  sequenced using a universal protocol in any high throughput sequenc   ing setting.",2009
intra intronic human minisatellite UPs29 associated with  neurological diseases regulates reporter gene activity  depending on its copy number in cell line F9,P11.061,"L. Sasina1, I. Suchkova1, K.

","Earlier we found the association of increased rate of short alleles of  minisatellite UPS29 localized in intron of CENTB5 gene with some  forms of Parkinson disease and epilepsy. The molecular mechanism  of such correlation remains mainly unclear. To elucidate this problem  we generated PCR product corresponding to âhealthyâ (900bp) and  to âdiseaseâ (400bp) UPS29 alleles. These PCR products were intro   duced into plasmid pEGFP with ROSA betagco26 promoter and fused  to reporter gene GFP. These plasmids were transfected into cells of  embryonal carcinoma line F9. Number of GFP positive cells, their  morphology and fluorescence intensity were analyzed with the help of  confocal microscopy after cultivation for 24 and 48h. Plasmids without  UPS29 served as controls. There were no signal positive cells in case  of the same but minisatellite free plasmids, though molecular analysis  shower the presence of plasmids in F9 cells. Thus an GFP expres   sion lacked in control, but appeared due to presence of UPS29 in con   struct. The number of GFP expressing cells depended on repeated  units number in UPS29. The most high fluorescence was observed  in neuron like derivatives of F9 cells induced to differentiate. We sup   pose that such regularity could be explained by minisatellite specific  TF binding, and as a result UPS29 served as enhancer relatively to  ROSA26 promoter. Obtained results point to possible mechanism of  regulatory function of intra intronic and other non protein coding re   peats as additional enhancers. The shortening of one of minisatellite  allele will lead to gene expression decrease and further to pathology. Acknowledgement. The work was supported by RFBR grant 08 04  12167",2009

This assumption is now being challenged through the analysis of the  mRNAs produced from mutant alleles, leading to the realization that  a higher proportion of polymorphisms affect splicing. In our study, we  analysed the colocalisation of exonic SNPs in LAMA2  gene related to  the MDC1A form of congenital muscular dystrophy with exonic splicing  enhancers (ESEs). Then, we searched the effect of allelic change on  ESEs efficacy. The LAMA2  sequence was searched for ESE motifs  using the web based tool ESEfinder. Exons were screened for se   quence motifs likely to be recognised by the SR proteins SF2/ASF,  SC35, SRp40 and SRp55. Matching sequences are scored and only  scores above thresholds are predicted to act as ESEs. Results showed  the presence of 2709 ESEs in the 65 coding exons of LAMA2 gene;  this number was reduced to 480 significant ESEs after applying the  thresholds values filter. Secondly, the analysis of published sequence  variations in LAMA2  gene showed the presence of 41 exonic SNPs, 18  of them colocalize with the identified significant ESEs, representing a  fraction of about 44%. In addition, the allelic changes in 5 synonymous  or non synonymous SNPs can abolish or create an ESE suggesting  their potentially functional role in LAMA2  gene expression.

In this study  we investigated methylation pattern in JMJD1A  promoter region in pa   tients with unknown infertility. Methods and materials: In this study we prepared testicular biopsy from Iranian azoospermic  infertile men for investigation of methylation status of 5Â´ region of JM  JD1A  gene. Tissue sample of 5 obstructive azoospermic patients were  used as normal controls. MS  PCR (Methylation Specific PCR) was set  up to study methylation status in the promoter region. Results and discussion: Patients with non obstructive azoospermia and infertility showed dif   ferent pattern of methylation compared to normal controls. In brief,  100% of controls showed only unmethylated allele. In patient group, 3  patients (10%) showed only methylated allele. 2 patients ( 7%) showed  both methylated and unmethylated alleles.

Identification of functional SNP and putative PPRE sites in promoter of human malonyl coA carboxylase gene (mLYcD),P11.067,"A. K. Lee , T. Kyriakou, S. D. OâDell","Nutritional Science Division, London, United Kingdom","Malonyl CoA decarboxylase (MCD) catalyses the degradation of malo   nyl CoA to acetyl CoA. Malonyl CoA is an intermediate in fatty acid  synthesis and a potent inhibitor of carnitine palmitoyltransferase 1  (CPT1). CPT1 transfers long chain fatty acyl CoA (LCFA CoA) to the  mitochondria for Î² oxidation. Reduced activity of MCD would lead to  elevated LCFA CoA in the hypothalamus, which signals energy surfeit  and leads to inhibition of feeding. We proposed that genetic variation  influencing expression of the MCD gene ( MLYCD ) could influence body  weight through an effect on energy intake. It has been established that peroxisomal proliferator activated receptor Î± (PPARÎ±) activates tran   scription of rat hepatic MCD via two of the three PPRE sites identified  (PPRE2 and PPRE3). We have identified the putative PPRE sites in  human by alignment with the rat sequence. Promoter deletion analysis  in HepG2 cells with overexpression of PPARÎ±/RXRÎ± (retinoid X recep   tor Î±) showed that PPRE1 and PPRE3 were functional in human. We  also studied the functional impact of the closest single nucleotide poly   morphism (SNP)  379bp C/G (rs880088) to the putative PPRE sites  in HepG2 hepatocytes and GT1 7 hypothalamic neurons in transient  transfection studies. No significant difference in promoter activity was  found between the alleles in HepG2 but the  379 G allele showed 2.1  times greater activity than  379 C allele in GT1 7 cells. Electrophoretic  mobility shift assays (EMSAs) revealed that the  379 G allele binds  to nuclear protein(s) only from GT1 7 cells. In conclusion, the data  suggest the MLYCD   379 C/G polymorphism is a regulatory SNP that  affects promoter activity in GT1 7 cells.",2009

HOCTAR  is the first tool for systematic miRNA target prediction that utilizes the  same set of microarray experiments to monitor the expression of both  miRNAs (through their host genes) and candidate targets. We applied  the procedure to 178 human intragenic miRNAs and found that it per   forms better than currently available prediction softwares in pinpointing  previously validated miRNA targets.

Romeo","Medical Genetics, S.Orsola Malpighi Hospital, University of Bologna, Bologna,  Italy. ","Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) mutations have an important effect on the  development of many genetic diseases, and are believed to play a role  in aging and cancer. Most mammalian cells contain hundreds of mito   chondria and each mitochondrion is endowed with several copies of  mtDNA. However, an individualâs mitochondrial asset may not always  be uniform. After an mtDNA variation arises, it may be maintained, lost  or amplified to different levels. As a result, cells and tissues, but also  single mitochondria, may harbor both wild type and mutant mtDNA, a  condition known as heteroplasmy. In order for an mtDNA mutation to  show a phenotypic effect, a certain threshold of heteroplasmy must be  reached. Therefore, it is extremely important not only to qualitatively  detect a mutation but also to provide an adequate and efficient quan   titative analysis of heteroplasmy. Here we compare six different meth   odologies for their capacity to evaluate, capture and quantify different  heteroplasmy levels. We also considered the issue of the potential  bias introduced by preferential amplification during polymerase chain  reaction (PCR).

We propose a novel maximum  parsimony based method for reconstruction of human mtDNA phylog   eny. Briefly, the method consists of three successive stages: identi   fication of potential homoplastic mutations; analysis of potential ho   moplastic mutations and identification of true homoplastic mutations;  identification of back and parallel mutations. The method designed  was implemented in mtPhyl. This software package allows rapid and  comprehensive analysis oh human complete mtDNA sequences. Apart  from maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree reconstruction it performs  different types of searches; analyzes mutation features; exports list of  particular mtDNAs mutations into Excel table; defines mitochondrial  haplotype; calculates coalescence time of clusters; estimates the ef   fect of natural selection; makes reference list and downloads human  mtDNA complete sequences from GenBank. mtPhyl represents a  timely advance, since the advent of cheaper sequencing methods has  generated an excess of sequence data, and there is an urgent need to  perform their automatic analysis.

Here, we suggest extending the HGVS nomenclature guidelines with  new description formats facilitating unambiguous and more detailed  descriptions of most complex sequence variants. These include: 1)  nested changes supporting descriptions of changes within inversions  and duplications, 2) composite changes supporting concatenation of  inserted sequences, 3) new duplication types describing changes in  orientation. One advantage of this extension is that the differences  and similarities between complex variants can be derived easily from  the new descriptions. In addition, this extension is expected to provide  sufficient flexibility and consistency to limit the proliferation of alterna  Genomics, Genomic technology and Epigenetics tive interpretations giving rise to ambiguous descriptions of complex  variants. The consistent specifications of the new description formats  should allow easy implementation in sequence variant nomenclature  checkers (e.g. Mutalyzer, http://www.LOVD.nl/mutalyzer).

Routine testing strategies require the use of  Southern Blot or Long Range PCR but technical difficulties, due to  the presence of very large expansions and wide somatic mosaicism,  greatly reduce the sensibility of present gold standard techniques. In  order to simplify the diagnostic procedure for DM2, we developed a  Tetraplet Primed PCR (TP PCR) for a fast discrimination of positive  and negative patients. We validated the sensitivity of this technique  analyzing 87 MD2 positive and 76 MD2 negative individuals, previous   ly characterized by Long Range PCR. The specificity of the TP PCR in  the identification of (CCTG)n expanded alleles was evaluated testing  37 DM1 patients with different (CTG)n expansion. Our results show  that TP PCR is a fast, reliable and flexible technique, with a specific   ity and a sensitivity of almost 100%, with no positive or false negative  results.

Point mutations or complete duplications of the ZRS have been shown  to cause ectopic expression of SHH in the anterior limb bud, leading  to autosomic dominant preaxial polydactyly (PPD2, MIM #174500) in  humans, mice, cats and dogs. We present here our analysis of the SHH locus in three large French  families with isolated PPD2. Two families have full penetrant point mutations in the ZRS, 297G>A,  334T>G (according to the original numbering by Lettice). Bioinformatic  analysis revealed that these point mutations are located in highly con   served predicted transcription factors (TFs) binding sites for SOX9  and PAX3. Those TFs are simultaneously expressed with SHH in the  mouse developing limb bud at the time of digit patterning, and have  been respectively involved in polydactyly and limb development de   fects. Analysis of the third family revealed possible linkage with SHH locus,  but no point mutation or copy number variation of the ZRS could be  detected by sequencing and QPCR. CGH array revealed no anomaly  at SHH locus or in any other genomic region. We then sequenced five  other highly conserved candidate regions around SHH that contained  conserved TFs binding sites concerning TFs of interest: no mutation  was detected. We hypothesize that another nearby regulatory se   quence or an undetected position effect between ZRS and SHH could  be responsible for this familial case.",2009

TSA is based  on temperature induced protein denaturation, monitored using an en   vironmentally sensitive dye, such as SYPRO Orange, that is naturally  quenched in a stable, aqueous solution. As the temperature increases,  exposed hydrophobic regions will bind the SYPRO Orange dye, lead   ing to a proportional increase in fluorescence that is measured using a  real time PCR instrument. The inflection points of the resulting fluores   cence/temperature plot are used to compare different test conditions,  and the extent of the observed temperature shift is considered to be  representative of the stability of the protein in certain solution condi   tions. TSA data have been obtained from the whole range of Applied  Biosystems Real Time PCR Systems; including the 7900 HT, 7500  Fast and StepOnePlusTM Real Time PCR Instruments. TSA has wide  ranging applications, including high throughput screening for unknown  ligands and protein inhibitors, protein substrate interactions, and con   centration dependent stabilisation conditions. In addition, TSA benefits  protein crystallography studies, for determining the concentration of a  compound that will provide maximal stability in order for a protein to  reach maximum occupancy.

","Genetic reporter systems are popular tools for studying many process   es that take place in eukaryotic cells, e.g. transciriptional regulation,  mRNA processing, etc. Usually, dual reporter enzymes, an experiman   tal reporter and a normalizing standard, are used in one experiment to  minimize an interassay variation caused by differences in transfection  efficiency and cell viability. Consequently, the results are expressed  as the reporter enzyme activity normalized to the activity of internal  standard. Assuming that the same amount of reporter genes is always  used in one experiment, the ratio of its expression (and thus ratio of  enzyme activities) should be a constant. No correlation is supposed  between the ratio of reporter activities and the number of transfected  cells or the activity of the reporters. However, in our experiment, there  is a correlation between the ratio of reporter activities (luminescence  of different luciferases) and the experimental reporter activity. Using  one mixture of reporter and standard gene contructs for transfection of  different amounts of cells, we obtained ratios of luciferases activities  strongly correlated to the firefly luciferase activity (r , 0,84; p < 0,001).  This effect was specific for the particular construct since neither the  construct with shorter insert of the same type nor the reporter gene  containing plasmid without any insert showed this effect.

Abundance and orientation bias of retroelements in mammalian  genes,P11.105,"N. V. Tomilin, N. V.

In mammalian genomes retrolelements of L1 family are known to be  strongly underrepresented in GC rich gene rich regions but their abun   dance and orientation in introns of genes is poorly studied. Here we  analyzed abundance and orientation of major families of retroelements  in introns and promoters in eight large groups (>300 genes each) of  coexpressed human and mouse genes. We found that human Alu  and mouse B1 repeats are overrepresented in introns and upstream  regions of all studied groups of genes with significant bias for their  inverse orientation in groups of the widely expressed (housekeeping)  genes. L1 elements are underrepresented in all studied groups of  genes especially in the upstream regions and only ~30% of L1 is found  in direct orientation. LTRs are also underrepresented in all groups of  human and mouse genes with only 15 30% of their copies present  in direct orientation suggesting strong selection pressures operating  during evolution on retroelement content of promoters and introns of  human genes. Purifying selection of LTRs, L1 elements and some Alu  repeats in direct orientation is apparently a consequence of their nega   tive effects on normal transcription and/or splicing. Accumulation of  Alu and B1 in the housekeeping and some tissue specific genes may  be caused by positive selection of complex genome rearrangements  facilitating transcription.",2009

Exon rearrangements in the gene constitute an important class of  the mutations. In our study we performed a commonly used semiquan   titative multiplex PCR assay for detection of rearrangements of Parkin  exons. The assay essentially compares relative amounts of template  DNA in a PCR reaction, thus allowing identification of templates that  deviate from the expected number in a diploid genome. In order to  detect these rearrangements, several exons are PCR amplified simul   taneously, allowing comparison of relative amplification of exons in dif   ferent samples. The co amplified exons serve as internal standards  for quantification. The amount of PCR product is directly related to the  number of template molecules as long as PCR is terminated within the  exponential phase of amplification. Each PCR for a given combination  of exons results in a typical pattern of peak heights for normal control  DNA, thus producing reference ratios between the peaks. Because  rations are compared, extraneous factors are expected not to interfere  with detection of rearrangements. Our study resulted in identification of several exon deletions in the Par  kin gene. We noted that for optimal detection of rearrangements, care   ful attention must be made to several factors:  all the fluorescently la   beled primers in a combination should be labeled with the same dye;   height of exon peaks reflecting extent of amplification should be very  similar for the different exons (less than 10% difference);  quality of the  DNA samples should be high.",2009

An example of a discontinu   ous schema for a 25 mer will be 7 matches in the beginning of the  read followed by 11 charcters followed by 7 matches (effective W,14).

Chen","Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, United States","Profiling gene expression in embryonic stem cells (ESCs) requires  technology that allows the use of very small samples, yet has the ca   pability to analyze the expression of many mRNAs simultaneously.  A three step workflow including reverse transcription, multiplex pre   amplification, and singleplex PCR in TaqManÂ® Arrays was used. We  demonstrate that multiplex preamplification based TaqManÂ® real time  PCR can be used to profile gene expression in limited starting ma   terial or single cells. A total of 384 genes which are believed to be  functionally associated with maintenance of the undifferentiated em   bryonic stem cell state were studied in mouse embryonic stem cells  (mESCs), differentiated embryoid bodies (mEBs), and embryos. Three  endogenous control genes, Ctnnb1, Actb and Gapd were used to con   firm the uniformity of the PreAmp reaction and to normalize RNA in   put. Preamplification of starting cDNA molecules enables detection of  low expressers from nanogram amounts of total RNA input and even  single embryonic stem cells. A novel subset of differentially expressed  mRNAs was established, which can be used as biomarkers to distin   guish the pluripotent state from cells that have undergone differentia   tion.

Exploiting the Full Potential Of sequence t race Files For  structural Variation,P11.116,"O. Lancaster , G. A. Thorisson, A. J. Brookes","University of Leicester, Leicester, United Kingdom","Structural variation and copy number variation (CNV) are recently rec   ognized to be extensive in the human genome. Examples identified so  far typically range in size from 5 200kb and encompass many genes  which play fundamental roles in both disease and evolution. The im   pact of structural variation on genome function and disease is likely to  be substantial. Currently known structural variants have been identified by a range of  technologies   both experimentally and in silico. However, these ap   proaches are very inefficient at detecting rarer, shorter (<10kb) and  lower similarity variants. The reduced costs of sequencing and new  high throughput technologies mean there has been an exponential  growth in the raw primary data used to assemble genomes. These  publically available and extensive data will carry immensely detailed  information about structural variation, but systems need to be provided  to mine this knowledge. We have therefore developed a dedicated computational tool that  utilises raw sequence data from the worldâs total public dataset of trace  files to reveal and allow visual exploration of small (and large) struc   tural rearrangements. Methods of analysis include; i) trace depth analysis, ii) discordant trace  end alignment, iii) trace file source filtering, iv) similarity of match con   siderations   all linked to a powerful graphical browser with extensive  tuning options and connections to many other forms of genome an   notation. This tool will benefit many research areas, such as primary genome  polymorphism analysis, disease association studies, and investiga   tions into the genomic mechanisms of cancer development.",2009

For example,  chromosomal inversions are associated with Angelman Syndrome,  Hemophilia A and other abnormalities. We used the SOLiDTM high throughput sequencing technology with paired end tags to sequence  three HAPMAP genomes NA18507 (Yoruba male, 6x), NA19240 (Yo   ruba female, 14x), and NA12878 (CEPH female, 12x). We developed an analysis pipeline to detect the occurrence of struc   tural variations in our samples compared to the reference genome. A  deletion, an inversion or a translocation is defined by its two break   points while an insertion by a sole breakpoint. The supporting evi   dence for occurrence of breakpoints is scored for each base pair in the  genome. The regions corresponding to local peaks of the scores are  called as candidate breakpoint ranges and bridged to form full struc   tural variants. Each breakpoint range is then scanned for coverage  of normal mate pairs to identify a sub range with the lowest normal  mate pair coverage as the most probable breakpoint locations, and to  differentiate homozygous structural variants from heterozygous ones.  The supporting evidence of all inversions can be visually inspected  using SOLiDTM Alignment Browser (SAB). The output of this pipeline is  compared with other in house and external tools, and the results from  PCR validation.

In animals, DNA methylation normally involves the  modification of cytosine residues at the 5 carbon position. One popular  method to study DNA methylation is to treat the sample with bisulfite.  Bisulfite converts cytosine to uracil residues, but methylated cytosines  are not affected.

Patients with  either none or only one mutant allele were analysed with multiplex  ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Sequencing was em   ployed for the study of 50 control samples. Results: MLPA allowed us to find one novel mutation in heterozygosis  (p.Gln841Lys) in exon 16 of the ABCA4  gene. This variant was lo   cated in the target site of the probe. Thus, a lower peak was shown in  the pattern of peaks of the MLPA. The p.Gln841Lys mutation was not  found in 100 control chromosomes. Neither deletions nor duplications  were found.

","Alagille syndrome (AGS) is an autosomal dominant multisystem di   sorder involving primarily liver, heart, eyes, face and skeleton. Muta   tions in JAG1 are associated with the majority of cases of AGS and  haploinsufficiency is the pathogenic mechanism most involved. At the  beginning, the genetic testing used in AGS was based on point muta   tion scanning methods and on FISH to identify JAG1 deletion with a  detection rate of 70% and 5% respectively. Later, on 2006, mutations  in NOTCH2 (<1%) were identified in AGS patients. In the last years,  the technological advances, associated to cost and time reduction, led  to an improvement of molecular analysis of this inherited syndrome.  From 2002 to now on, 38 patients with clinical diagnosis of AGS were  referred to our laboratory. We identified 31 mutations (82%) by JAG1  sequencing: 6 missense, 13 frameshift, 9 nonsense and 3 splice site  mutations. Subsequently we performed JAG1 MLPA on remaining ne   gative cases. We found a partial deletion (from exon 22 to 26) and a  complete deletion in another patient. The remaining five cases were  analyzed by NOTCH2 sequencing and no pathogenic mutations were  found. The total detection rate for JAG1 analysis was 87%. So, the  ânewâ method of direct sequencing analysis has replaced the âoldâ mu   tation scanning protocol and MLPA, leading to detection also of par   tial deletion of JAG1, had âovercomeâ FISH.

Clinical picture is vari   able, major contributors to morbidity arise from bile duct paucity or  cholestatic liver disease and severe heart disease. The syndrome is  caused by dominant mutations in jagged1  gene ( JAG 1 ), which en   codes a ligand in the Notch signaling pathway. We present clinical, histological and molecular data of the patient with  Alagille syndrome with early development of liver failure and previ   ously not described mutation in JAG1  gene. The patient was born 3G/3P; his birth anthropometry was according  to gestational age. Due to congenital heart defect (coarctation of aorta  and peripherial stenosis of pulmonary arteries) and cholestatic liver  disease Alagille syndrome was diagnosed at the age of 3 months.  Cholestasis was rapidly progressive and the liver failure developed at  the age of 5 months. Child died at the age of 7 months due to the liver  insufficiency. Histological findings from liver biopsy revealed infantile  giant cell hepatitis. Due to unusual clinical course of the disease mo   lecular study of JAG1  gene was performed.

The overall power to rule out genes of both the STR and SNP methods  is very similar, with an average of 11.17 genes (69.82%) and 11.54  genes (72.14%) respectively, taking only into account those families  with 2 or more affected genotyped individuals. Twice as many homo   zygosity alerts were obtained with SNPs, but the ones in common with  the STR analysis matched the mutated genes in all 4 fully character   ised control families. Our study allows discarding many genes and prioritising the mutational  screening of the remaining ones, based on homozygosity. Both indirect  approaches give similar results when discarding genes. A diagnostic  method for arRP and sRP families is proposed, which maximises the  probability of reaching a successful molecular diagnosis for each fam   ily, making a more rational and cost effective use of resources by  means of computer automation and the combined use of STRs and  SNPs.",2009

In Â½Q1_ this study, four molecular markers: D11S2179,  D11S1787, D11S535, D11S1343 are genotyped in 19 unrelated fami   lies from different regions of Iran. . Amplified products by PCR method  were separated using denaturing PAGE gels. In all families, segrega   tion of alleles was according to Mendelian inheritance, and affected  chromosomes were distinguishable from unaffected ones. All carriers  and affected patients were diagnosed accurately. Thus, this method is  effectively useful in prenatal diagnosis of AT. We also investigated mt DNA deletions and haplogroups in AT patients.  In this study, 24 Iranian patients suffering from AT and 100 normal con   trols were examined. mt DNA examined by 6 primers for existence of  mitochondrial deletions.

The disorder  is caused by mutations of PKD1 and PKD2 genes. PKD1 gene is the  main locus, which is responsible for 85% of ADPKD cases and severe  disease course. Screening of PKD1 gene is complicated by its high  variability and presence of genomic duplications. Currently, 818 se   quential variants have been published in PKD database (http://pkdb. mayo.edu), which includes polymorphisms as well as causal muta   tions. Finding of the best method for PKD1 mutation analysis and iden   tification of its new variants are the main aims of this work. 78 patients were screened in non duplicated PKD1 region. Another  12 patients were analysed within the whole gene. To find the most ef   fective screening method, several detection techniques were tested:  direct sequencing, heteroduplex analysis, denaturing gradient gel  electrophoresis and high resolution melting. From all techniques used, HRM is the fastest and most reliable method  for detection of PKD1 mutants. So far, 32 probably causal mutations  have been revealed: 11 nonsense mutations, 14 missense mutations,  4 frameshift mutations, 2 deletions without frameshift and 1 intronic  mutation. 25 mutations have not been reported yet. Determination of localization and type of mutations in PKD1 gene and  their genotype phenotype correlation will improve DNA diagnostics to   gether with assessment of clinical prognosis. At the same time, the  results could help to reveal the mechanism of ADPKD pathogenesis.  Within this study, HRM is the most suitable method for screening of  PKD1 gene.

Mutations in BEST1   cause several retinal disorders including Best disease; autosomal  dominant vitreoretinochoroidopathy; and autosomal recessive be   strophinopathy (ARB). ARB is consequent upon biallelic mutations in  BEST 1  and thought to represent the null phenotype. OBJECTIVES: To investigate the trafficking and chloride electrophysi   ology of mutant ARB bestrophin 1 isoforms. METHODS: Chloride channel function was measured by whole cell  patch clamping in transiently transfected HEK293 cells, the standard  system for this analysis. Cellular localisation was determined by im   munofluorescence in transiently transfected MDCKII cells which had  been polarized on membrane supports to provide an epithelial model  system. RESULTS: We have now identified 13 mutations in 10 families with  ARB suggesting that this is an under recognised phenotype. ARB  associated mutant bestrophin 1 isoforms had an altered intracellular  localisation, showing a perinuclear reticular pattern typical of the endo   plasmic reticulum (ER). Whole cell patch clamping demonstrated that  all 9 ARB mutants investigated had a significantly reduced chloride  conductance compared to wildtype channels. CONCLUSIONS: Mutant ARB isoforms of bestrophin 1 are not cor   rectly trafficked to the cell surface and appear to be retained within  the ER, thus providing an explanation for the lack of chloride specific  currents. We hypotheses that ER associated degradation (ERAD) of  mutant bestrophin 1 isoforms is the disease mechanism underpinning  ARB.",2009

We had failed to  clone the breakpoint junctions by a combination of QFM PCR and  long range PCR, an observation inconsistent with a simple recombi   nation mechanism. Here, we unraveled the complex structure of the  triplication by CGH: the triplicated ~605 kb segment is followed by an  inverted segment of ~90 kb, the latter being normally located >100 kb  3â to the former. This greatly facilitated the task of characterizing the  breakpoint junctions. Examination of the junction sequences enabled  us to decipher how the triplication was generated. The duplication of  the ~605 kb segment plus the inverted ~90 kb segment was gener   ated first, explicable by the model of microhomology mediated, break  induced serial replication slippage (3,4). The triplication was then  generated through non allelic homologous recombination between the  duplication carrying chromosome 7 sister chromatids during meiosis.

Patients present with a progressive cardiac disease with dilation and  thickening of the pulmonary, aortic or mitral valves often leading to  death before 5 years of age. Studying six GD families, we mapped the  disease locus gene on chromosome 9q34.2 and identified four distinct  misense mutations and a nonsense mutation in the A Disintegrin And  Metalloproteinase with Thrombospondin repeats  like 2 gene (ADAMT   SL2). The ADAMTS like subfamily comprises proteins homologous to  the ADAMTS ancillary domains but lacking the protease domain and  hence lacking catalytic activity. Their functions are yet unknown. Using  a yeast two hybrid screen, we identify Latent TGFÎ² Binding Protein  1 (LTBP1) as a partner of ADAMTSL2. We also found a higher level  of active TGFÎ² and an enhanced level of phoshorylated SMAD2 in  GD fibroblasts allowing us to conclude at an enhanced TGFÎ² signal   ling. Following this initial study, we have collected the samples of 18  additional GD families and identified ADAMTSL2 mutations in 6/18  comprising 4 novel mutations.

Functional analysis of chronic pancreatitis associated 5â  regulatory variants in the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor  (sPiNK1) gene,P12.035,"A. Boulling , J. M. Chen, C. FÃ©rec","INSERM U613, Brest, France","Introduction: The SPINK1 gene, which encodes the pancreatic secre   tory trypsin inhibitor, is one of the major genes predisposing to chronic  pancreatitis. To date, a dozen of variations have been described in the  5â regulatory region (RR) of SPINK1 but their functional effects remain  unknown. The aim of this study was to systematically characterize all  these currently known 5â RR variants. Method: The wild type 5â RR of SPINK1 was firstly cloned into the  pGL3 Basic Luciferase Reporter Vector. All the 5â RR variations in the  SPINK1 gene were then introduced into the pGL3 SPINK1 construct,  respectively, by means of site directed mutagenesis. SPINK1 promoter  activities were determined in human pancreatic Colo 357 cells. Func   tional relevance of some variants was further evaluated by EMSA. Results: The 5â RR variations can be divided into three categories in  terms of luciferase expression, which correlated well with clinical find   ings. The variants that caused a decreased expression often show  consistent disease association among different studies whilst those  that had no effect on expression often show equal allele distribution  between patients and controls. The variants that caused an increased  expression are, in fact, in cis with a known disease causing mutation.  EMSA assay demonstrated that variations located in well defined regu   latory motifs affected protein DNA interactions. Conclusion: This work was the first to assess the functional impact  of the 5â RRâs SPINK1 variations. Our finding clarified the role of the  diverse SPINK1 5â RR variants in the etiology of chronic pancreatitis  and resulted in a better understanding of the genotype/phenotype re   lationship.",2009

In view of the rarity of the disorder and  the high rate of inbreeding in Lebanese, we assumed an autosomal  recessive trait inherited from a common ancestor. Indeed, genome   wide linkage analysis resulted in a single region on chromosome 8q22  with homozygosity by descent in the patients, comprising the Cohen  syndrome (CS) gene, VPS13B . We identified a novel homozygous  splice site mutation that activates a cryptic acceptor site in exon 52.  CVG and deafness have never been reported in CS. This may reflect  a variant of CS. Alternatively, there may be an overlap of genetic con   ditions: Offspring from consanguineous parents may be homozygous  for mutations in unlinked genes. Deafness and CVG could be caused  by mutations in different loci. However, our linkage data do not sug   gest another causative locus. Another mutated gene or modifier locus  may segregate in cis  and be responsible for deafness and CVG, but  no deafness locus maps to our 8q22 region. In contrast, the frequent  association of CVG with mental retardation suggests that it may be a  rare manifestation of CS. The mapping approach conducted here can  serve as a paradigm in rare recessive phenotypes: The prevalence of  homozygosity for the causative mutations can also be high in families  without  documented consanguinity, due to a distant common ancestor,  especially in small populations with a high rate of inbreeding.",2009

","Hypoplastic left heart syndrome (HLHS) consists of a heterogeneous  group of cardiac malformations with various degrees of underdevelop   ment of the left heart aorta complex. It is one of the most severe con   genital heart diseases and itâs usually lethal during early infancy. Most  hypotheses formulated to explain the pathogenesis of HLHS assume  that there is a primary anatomic/genetic abnormality which results in  low flow through the left heart and it is the diminished flow that ulti   mately leads to growth failure of the left sided structures. The molecu   lar causes of HLHS are unclear. A recent report of mutations in basic  helix loop helix (bHLH) transcription factor HAND1 found in hearts  with HLHS has suggested that in hypoplastic human hearts HAND1  function is impaired. Because of the profound implication of this find   ing, we attempted to replicate it using peripheral blood samples from  46 patients and 8 different cardiac samples obtained from 5 patients  with HLHS who underwent cardiac surgery. Newborns and children (25% female) with HLHS undergo a complete  evaluation to determine the type of defect and the potential presence  of extracardiac defect. The mean age at surgical intervention was 8  days old. We sequenced the entire HAND1 gene starting from genom   ic DNA extracted from peripheral blood lymphocytes and from cardiac  samples. No evidence of germline or somatic mutations was found in  this study. Germline and somatic mutations in HAND1 do not seem to be a fre   quent cause of abnormal cardiac development at basis of HLHS.

The inheritance of these disorders is  complex: MHS1 shows a dominant inheritance pattern, MmD a reces   sive inheritance pattern, while CCD can be inherited both in a reces   sive and in a dominant fashion. Additionally, maternal allele silencing  of RYR1  may complicate this picture. MHS1 and CCD, though allelic  disorders, do also share some specific mutations. To date, over 250  different pathogenic mutations are known, of which less than 8% clear   ly is an inactivating (nonsense/splice/frame shift) mutation. Recently, we have implemented sequence analysis of all 106 exons  of RYR1  and its splice sites in MHS, CCD and MmD. We have identi   fied 16 likely pathogenic alleles, of which two clearly are inactivating.  Of these 16 alleles, 11 are novel mutations, and 1 allele harboring  three missense mutations has been found in four families not known  to be related. In one CCD patient, a mutation well known in MHS1  (p.Arg614Cys) and a splice site mutation (c.14364+1G>T) were ob   served in trans orientation. These data indicate that mutations specific  to the Dutch population exist. The complexity of the inheritance and the obvious reduced penetrance of MHS make the determination of  the pathogenicity of missense mutations and the subsequent counsel   ing of patients challenging.",2009

To date, 11 different mutations in  14 unrelated patients have been reported in the X linked  SMC1A gene.

Located  on chromosome Xp21.1 CYBB  gene encodes the Î² subunit of cyto   chrome b558(gp91 phox), spans 30 kb, contains 13 exons. We have investigated 12 unrelated families with Chronic granuloma   tous disease. The search for CYBB  gene mutations was performed by  direct DNA sequencing analysis. The analysis of CYBB  gene showed 7 new and 3 reported mutations  on 12 chromosomes. The CYBB  gene total deletion was registered on  2 chromosomes, novel c.27delG   on 1 chromosome, novel c.226delC    on 2 chromosomes, novel c.177C>A (p.Cys59Stop)   on 1 chro   mosome, novel c.565_568delATTA   on 1 chromosome, c.676C>T  (p.Arg226Stop)   on 1 chromosome, c.935T>G (p.Met312Arg)   on 1  chromosome, novel c.1167delG   on 1 chromosome, novel c.1524_ 1527delGACT   on 1 chromosome, novel c.898 1ntG>A (IVS8as  1ntG>A)   on 1 chromosome.

Conclusions: The findings of this study encourage our assumptions  about the triallelic transmission of the syndromes associated with pe   riodic fevers, on the basis of the identification of 3 mutated alleles in  2 different genes. The third mutation in the gene MEFV could play an  epistatic role, modifying the spectrum symptoms of HIDS. Our data  suggest that the study of a HIDS and FMF wider population would be  important not only to clarify the genetic heterogeneity of this group of  syndromes, but mainly to establish a new diagnostic and therapeutic  approach to these patients.",2009

This  autosomal recessive disorder is caused by mutations in the FBP1  gene, which encodes for fructose 1,6 bisphosphatase 1 (FBP1). Al   though FBP1 gene mutations have been described in FBP deficient  individuals of various ethnicities, there has been limited investigation  into the genetics of this disorder in Arab patients. This study employed  five consanguineous Arab families, in which seventeen patients were  clinically diagnosed with FBP deficiency. Seven patients and six carrier  parents were analyzed for mutations in the FBP1 gene. DNA sequenc   ing of the FBP1 gene identified two novel mutations in these families.  A novel six nucleotide repetitive insertion, c114_119dupCTGCAC, was  identified in patients from three families. This mutation encodes for a  duplication of two amino acids (p.Cys39_Thr40dup) in the N terminal  domain of FBP1. A novel nonsense c.841G>T mutation encoding for a p.Glu281X truncation in the active site of FBP1 was discovered in  patients from two families. The newly identified mutations in the FBP1  gene are predicted to produce FBP1 deficiency. These mutations are  the only known genetic causes of FBP deficiency in Arab patients. The  p.Cys39_Thr40dup is the first reported amino acid duplication in FBP  deficiency patients. We conclude that this study provides a strong ra   tionale for genetic testing of FBP deficient patients of Arab ethnicity for  recurrent or novel mutations in the FBP1 gene.",2009

Allele *2 showed de   creased promoter activity resulting in lower expression and decreased  monocyte binding capacity for IgG compared to wild type allele *3. Material and methods: We analysed a distribution of the FcRn  gene  VNTR polymorphism in 202 samples of general Czech population,  61 common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) patients, 21 X linked  agammaglobulinemia (XLA) patients, and 5 individuals with low IgG  but normal IgA levels, using PCR. Fisher exact test was used for sta   tistical analysis. Results and discussion: The allele *2 was significantly more frequent  in patients with primary hypogammaglobulinemia compared to general  population (11.5% v.s. 6.2%, p,0.02). While its frequency in CVID pa   tients did not differ from controls (8.2%, p,0.28), significantly more car   riers of this allele were detected among XLA patients and patients with  low IgG and normal IgA levels (16.7%, p,0.02, and 30.0%, p,0.02,  respectively). More data are needed to better characterize a potential  role of the FcRn  gene VNTR polymorphism in disease manifestation  in particular subgroups of patients with primary defects of antibody  production.

The attach   ment of palmitoleic acid by the O acyltransferase PORCN prepares  Wnt signaling molecules for the transport through the Golgi apparatus  for secretion, signal gradient formation, and receptor binding. We have replenished the scope of known mutations considerably by  analyzing PORCN in 24 novel patients: i) In sporadic cases PORCN is affected primarily by nonsense mu   tations whereas large deletions encompassing various neighboring  genes are mostly familial. ii) The missense mutations known so far almost exclusively exchange  highly conserved amino acids in transmembrane domains or in the  lumenal loops. iii) To override the consequences of lethal PORCN mutations, male  patients are somatic mosaics or show more than one X chromosome.  Females, survive either due to extreme skewing of X chromosome  inactivation, which is particularly evident in familial deletions, or they  appear to be likewise somatic mosaics.",2009

The  gene responsible for fragile X syndrome, FMR1 , contains an unsta   ble repeat sequence of (CGG)n that when expanded causes the syn   drome. PCR is a fast and effective method for the diagnosis of (CGG)n  repeat number. However, PCR methods traditionally were only useful  for repeat sizes in the lower premutation ranges (up to 70 100 repeats)  because amplification becomes increasingly difficult as repeat number  increases. Recently, a commercial kit by Abbott has become available  that has overcome such problem, as it amplifies products in all the pre   mutation ranges (up to 200 repeats) and full mutation ranges (over 250  repeats). The analysis and sizing of the fluorescence labelled prod   ucts generated using the Abbott fragile X kit require a genetic analy   ser (sequencer). This equipment is expensive and not all laboratories  have access to one. As an alternative, we have successfully tested the  Qiaxcel system of Qiagen.

In a previous study, we ap   plied Multiplex Ligation dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) to  characterize large rearrangements in the alpha  and beta globin gene  cluster. Several new deletions and duplications were found, however,  the exact breakpoint sequences are still unknown. To facilitate confir   mation by breakpoint PCR and to gain more insight in the mechanisms  causing these rearrangements we decided to determine the precise  location of breakpoints. Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) measures DNA  copy number differences between a reference and a patientâs genome  sample thereby detecting and mapping deletions and duplications.  We used high resolution tiling arrays with 135,000 probes spaced at  a density of ~15 bp to map the breakpoints to an interval that can be  validated by PCR and sequencing. The array was hybridized to a set  of 55 thalassemia patients who were found to carry a deletion in the  alpha  or beta globin gene cluster. The fine mapping results were used  to design breakpoint PCRs and resulting fragments were sequenced  to determine the precise breakpoint.",2009

Most of the mutations  in the F8 gene are detectable using genomic sequencing analysis.  However, deletions of one or more exons or encompassing the entire  gene can go undetected, especially in heterozygous females. Recently, MLPA has been broadly applied to gene mutation screening to detect exon deletions and duplications. Different deletions were de   tected using MLPA assay on 25 patients affected by severe haemophil   ia A, resulted mutation negative by sequencing analysis. Traditional  PCR failed to amplify one or more exons in some of these patients and  we decided to use the MLPA test in order to confirm the conjectured  deletions: 7 deletions were revealed in haemophiliacs patients and we  identified the carrier status in 2 female. F8 mutational screening could be improved by adding MLPA to se   quence analysis and MLPA is a helpful tool in order to define the status  of carriers in female relatives of haemophiliacs with deletions of one or  more exons of F8 gene. It is to underline the importance of performing  a molecular analysis in females suspected haemophiliacs carriers: the  main obstacle to their counselling is the impossibility to demonstrate  a heterozygous status because of the amplification of the exon/s that  is/are present on the normal X chromosome. So, the only way to make  a definitive diagnosis is to detect the mutation in F8 gene and MLPA  provides an important tool for the detection of its complete mutational  spectrum.",2009

Here we present a Hungarian family, in which the 31 year old proband  has pronounced progressive spastic paraparesis, increased deep ten   don reflexes and pyramidal sings in the lower limbs.

The mutation underlying HD is the expansion of the  polymorphic CAG tract in the first exon. Despite intensive research,  molecular pathology of HD has not been fully understood. In this study,  threading method is used is to model the huntingtin protein. By us   ing the VMD programme, various glutamine expansion mutations  are created and changes in the protein structures are analyzed. The  most convenient five models of huntingtin indicated the dominance  of Î± helices. Where Î± helices are less common, long turns, coils and  Î² sheets are recognized. In addition to that, mutant proteins with ex   panded glutamines are created in silico  and their structures are com   pared to the most probable huntingtin structure, 1WA5_B. According  to the results, mutant proteins with 33 38Q did not show any signifi   cant change, however 39 or more glutamines caused conformational  changes like lengthened and increased turns and coils and shortened  Î± helices. In this situation, protein may gain non covalent interactions  within itself or with other proteins and aggregate in the form of twisted  Î² sheets. These changes may render the protein more prone to prote   olysis. In this way, toxic protein fragments carrying the glutamine tract  are favored. On the other hand, usual proteolysis may not take place,  which may cause toxicity by increasing the half life of the protein. Also,  conformational change may lead to misfolding and aggregation of the  proteolysis resistant protein in the cell. Thus, conformational changes  in the mutant huntingtin give some clues about the neurodegenerative  pathways in HD.",2009
somatic instability of cAG repeats in Huntingtonâs Disease: role  of oxidative DNA damage and Base Excision Repair,P12.092,"A. Goula1, D. Wilson2, Y. Trottier1, K. Merienne1","1IGBMC, Strasbourg, France, 2NIA/NIH, Baltimore, MD, United States","Huntingtonâs disease (HD) is a neurodegenerative disorder, caused by  CAG repeats extension encoding a toxic polyglutamine expansion in  the huntingtin protein. Instability of the HD mutation leads to age de   pendent and tissue specific somatic expansion. Interestingly, the brain  region preferentially degenerating, the striatum, is highly unstable,  while the disease spared cerebellum is rather stable. Recently, the  glycosylase Ogg1 , which initiates Base Excision Repair (BER), was  shown to promote somatic instability, suggesting that oxidative DNA  damage and BER drive this process. We show that oxidative DNA damage is specifically increased at the  CAG expanded locus in R6/1 HD mice. Surprisingly, levels of oxidative  lesions are similar in striatum and cerebellum, and in young and aged  tissues. Thus, accumulation of oxidative lesions at the CAG repeats  is neither tissue  nor age dependent, indicating that oxidative DNA  damage at the CAG expanded locus is necessary but not sufficient  to trigger somatic instability. Protein levels and activities of major BER  players were analyzed in the striatum and in the cerebellum of R6/1  mice. We show in particular that FEN1, the flappy endonuclease in   volved in Long Patch BER (LP BER) subpathway, is much less active  in the striatum than in the cerebellum of R6/1 mice. Using chromatin  immunoprecipitation, we finally show that POLÎ² is specifically enriched  at the CAG expanded locus in the striatum of aged R6/1 mice, but  not in their cerebellum.

It is  mostly sporadic; the etiology is unknown in about 25% of cases. In this  study, we investigated the genetic causes of idiopathic sporadic prena   tal generalized edema. In a series of 12 patients, in whom in utero gen   eralized skin edema or hydrops fetalis had been diagnosed, three lym   phangiogenic genes, VEGFR3, FOXC2 and SOX18, were screened.  In three of the patients, we identified a mutation: two in VEGFR3 and  one in FOXC2. Two of the mutations were de novo and one was either  de novo or non penetrant inherited. In these patients, the generalized  edema resorbed spontaneously, either in utero or after birth. In the  two individuals with a VEGFR3 mutation, edema remained limited to  lower limbs. Therefore, mutations in the VEGFR3 and FOXC2 genes  account for a subset of patients with unexplained in utero general   ized subcutaneous edema and hydrops fetalis without family history  of lymphedema. These data expand our understanding of the etiology  of these phenotypes and suggest that lymphangiogenic genes should  be screened for mutations in sporadic patients diagnosed with fetal  edema.",2009

","Hepcidin (gene HAMP , 19q13) is a protein which is supposed to regu   late iron uptake or recycling through binding to the iron export protein  : the ferroportin (gene SLC 40 A1, 2q32).It is secreted by the liver and  considered as a key iron regulatory hormone linking the liverâs âiron  sensorâ to bowel absorption. High iron storage induce the expression  of hepcidin and thus the decrease of absorption. The Molecular de   fects of its gene are associated with a class of hyperferritinemia called  hemochromatosis type 2b (OMIM : 606464). We have screened the  HAMP gene in patients displaying abnormal iron parameters not linked  to a mutation in HFE or SCL40 A1 genes. We found two new mutations  in the promoter : c.  153 C>G and c.  188 C>T. The first variant affects  a binding site for BMP which was described to control hepcidin promot   er activation. Functional studies of other mutations located in this bind   ing site confirmed itsâ functional importance (G. Legac and J. Rochette,  personal communication).The second one was found several time in  patients originated from Africa and screened for iron metabolism dis   orders. As it was recently published [J. Mol Med, (2008) 86:531 540],  the proximal part of the promoter plays a crucial role in the regulation  of hepcidin expression. These observations could represent natural  variants of hepcidin expression allowing to understand the regulation  pathway of this gene and consequences of its perturbation.

In developed countries, alcohol explains the majority  of the CP cases, followed by âidiopathicâ causes which account for  about 20% of the cases. Mutations in five genes, the cationic tryp   sinogen ( PRSS1 ) gene, the pancreatic secretory trypsin inhibitor  (SPINK1 ) gene, the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regu   lator ( CFTR ) gene, the calcium sensing receptor ( CASR ) gene and the  chymotrypsinogen C ( CTRC ) gene, have been found to be associated  with CP. In order to determine the relative contribution of these genes  in idiopathic CP (ICP), we recruited 239 patients who have developed  the disease before 20 years. Methods: Coding regions of each gene were analyzed by either dena   turing high performance liquid chromatography, high resolution melt   ing or direct sequencing. Quantitative fluorescent multiplex PCR was  performed to screen genomic rearrangements. Results: Some 50% of the ICP patients carried at least one mutation  in one of these genes. First, about 30% of the patients carried at least  one mutation in the CFTR  gene including the IVS8 T5 variant, and  10% of the patients were compound heterozygotes (mild/mild or se   vere/mild). Moreover, the p.N34S polymorphism of SPINK1  was found  in about 15% of patients and 14 patients carried one mutation in the  CTRC  gene. âGain of functionâ mutations in the PRSS1  gene (11/239)  and CASR  mutations (4/239) were rarely found. Finally, 27 patients  were trans heterozygotes. Conclusion: These results demonstrated that about 50% of the pa   tients labeled as ICP had, in fact, a genetic defect, and revealed the  complex nature of ICP.",2009

Sinke","Department of Genetics, Groningen, The Netherlands","Incontinentia pigmenti (IP) is a rare neurocutaneous X dominantly  inherited disorder, prevalence approximately 1/50,000. Besides skin  and neurological abnormalities, there is ophthalmologic and dental  involvement. The skin abnormalities appear in three stages, starting  in the neonatal period. After childhood hypopigmented lines are left.  Skin abnormalities follow the lines of Blaschko. IP is observed almost  exclusively in girls, affected boys die in utero. Female patients show  extremely skewed X inactivation in DNA isolated from blood. Rare sur   viving male patients are mostly mosaics or have an XXY karyotype. IP  is caused by mutations in the IKBKG gene (kinase of inhibitor of kappa  light polypeptide gene enhancer in B cells gamma, also called NEMO ),  on Xq28. Mutation scanning of IKBKG is complicated by the presence  of a flanking pseudogene, identical to the functional IKBKG gene only  lacking exons 1 and 2. In most IP patients the causative mutation in  IKBKG is a deletion of exons 4 10. This mutation can be identified by  a specific PCR reaction. If no deletion is detected all exons are se   quenced following specific amplification of the functional IKBKG gene  by long range PCR. We screened 79 index cases, 9 were males. We  identified the classical deletion in 37 female patients. In addition, we  identified 11 different mutations in 11 female patients. In only 9 patients  with extremely skewed X inactivation no mutation was identified. In  none of the male cases a mutation was found. In 30% of cases the  deletion appeared de novo.

Presently she has moderate gait  ataxia which worsens episodically and in association with vertigo. Ex   amination revealed moderate truncal and limb ataxia. The 23 year old  maleâs (P2) symptoms started at age 12 with imbalance, 2 years later  dysarthria and episodic diplopia occurred. Examination revealed ocu   lomotor apraxia, nystagmus, dysarthria, distal atrophy and spasticity of  the legs, increased reflexes, pyramidal signs, truncal and limb ataxia.  The 54 year old male (P3) has a progressive imbalance since the age  of 40. Now he has oculomotor apraxia, truncal and limb ataxia, and  parkinsonian symptoms. All patients had increased AFP and cerebellar  atrophy. Sequence analysis of the SETX gene in all patients revealed  novel mutations: P1 had homozygous R1606X mutation resulting in  premature termination of gene translation before the helicase domain.  P2 was compound heterozygous for the L2155W and R2444C muta   tions in the helicase domain. P3 had homozygous T1854A mutation  localized close to the helicase domain. In conclusion: patients with mu   tations resulting in dysfunction of helicase domain have earlier age of  onset and more severe clinical symptoms.

TMPRSS6   mutations have been reported in several patients with iron deficiency  anemia refractory to oral iron therapy (IRIDA), an autosomal recessive  disease characterised by low serum iron, low transferrin saturation and  inappropriate high level of plasma hepcidin. Here we report 8 novel  cases from 6 families with TMPRSS6 mutations. Four patients were  compound heterozygotes for 2 missense mutations targeting different  subdomains (families I,II,III). Two brothers (family IV) were homozy   gous for a frameshift deletion. Finally, in two patients (cases 7,8) the  mutation was found in only one allele. A large range of serum hepcidin  concentration was found in different patients. All patients but two broth   ers (family II) were not sensitive to oral iron supplementation and had  received IV iron which resulted in an increase in the serum ferritin and  almost complete correction of the anemia. After a course of IV iron,  the response was usually sustained, with hemoglobin levels reaching  near normal values for several months. This observation supports the  idea that in the presence of abnormally elevated hepcidin levels, a part  of infused iron is sequestered in macrophages then is subsequently  slowly released and utilized by the erythropoietic cells. Our results  suggest that IRIDA is a relatively benign genetic disease provided ap   propriate therapy is given to the patients.

It is characterized  by follicular hyperkeratosis of the skin developing into patchy scarring  alopecia and loss of the follicles of the hair, eyelashes, and eyebrows.  Associated eye symptoms include photophobia in childhood and/or  blepharitis and corneal dystrophy. Due to the clinical heterogeneity  of KFSD the definitive diagnosis is often challenging. KFSD closely  resembles other disorders where abnormal keratinization is involved  such as keratosis pilaris atrophicans faciei (KPAF), atrophoderma ver   miculatum (AV) and ichtyosis follicularis with atrichia and photophobia  (IFAP). The question remains whether these syndromes are simply  variations of the same entity or truly independent. Although an X linked pattern of inheritance has been confirmed in two  different families, the existence of a rare autosomal dominant variant  has been postulated. Linkage and recombination analysis in a large  Dutch family identified two key recombinants mapping the KFSD locus  to Xp22.11 p22.13. Towards identification of the causative gene, we  studied the large Dutch family and together with some other families  with a clinical diagnosis of KFSD using new molecular tools. 1M SNP  arrays were used to refine the locus to a 2.9 Mb region and to ex   clude the involvement of large deletions and duplications.

Renal functions are reduced,  ultrasound shows kidney calcifications. Analyzing a HPRT1 gene of the patient, we have identified a novel  splicing mutation c.27+2T>C in intron 1 (IVS 1+2T>C). The influence  of mutationÂ´ impact to mRNA splicing was evaluated by cDNA analy   sis. Sequencing of cDNA containing exons 1,2 and a part of 3, prooved  defective splicing of mRNA. Mutation c.27+2T>C abolishes the natural  donor splice site and an alternative splice site within intron 1 is used  (r.27_28ins49). The protein translated from the mutated RNA is pre   dicted to contain only 26 amino acid residues. However, according to  our results, the majority of mutated mRNA undergoes nonsense medi   ated mRNA decay and the defective protein is not synthesized.

Lysinuric protein intolerance (LPI) is an autosomal recessive disorder  of cationic amino acid transport at the basolateral plasma membrane  caused by mutations in the SLC7A7  gene encoding y+LAT 1 protein.  The active amino acid transporter consists of the light subunit y+LAT 1,  which determines the substrate specificity as the heavy subunit 4F2hc  guides the complex to the membrane. 4F2hc also regulates other cel   lular functions including cell activation, proliferation, survival and apop   tosis. We reported previously that y+LAT 1 protein with LPI missense muta   tion is carried to the plasma membrane, while frameshift mutants are  cytoplasmic. Also, truncated y+LAT 1s lacking part of C terminal tail are  correctly localized while larger deletions remain subcellular. However,  the y+LAT 1 4F2hc interaction occurs regardless of the targeting muta   tions. In the current study, we use C terminal deletions of y+LAT 1 to  study their dimerization using flow cytometry FRET and the effects of  their expression on the cells. Our results indicate that the interaction of y+LAT 1 and 4F2hc within  the cell is not disrupted by any of the deleted y+LAT 1 proteins. The  localization of the small deletions is similar to the wild type, whereas  proteins lacking more than 60 amino acids remain cytoplasmic. Trans   fection of C terminally deleted y+LAT 1s results in reduction of y+LAT  1 CFP expressing cells compared to transfection of wild type y+LAT 1.  In addition, expression of truncated y+LAT 1 affects cellular viability,  which may be due to scavenging of 4F2hc by the mistargeted cyto   plasmic y+LAT 1, leading to shortage of 4F2hc in the plasma mem   brane and reduced cell proliferation compared to the cells expressing  normally targeted 4F2hc.",2009

All Finnish patients share  the same homozygous mutation c.1181 2A>T (c.859 2A>T) in the  SLC7A7  gene. Altogether 51 mutations have been found worldwide  but the Finnish founder mutation has not been detected in any other  population. The main symptoms of LPI comprise protein aversion after  weaning, failure to thrive, muscle hypothonia, osteoporosis and hepa   tosplenomegaly. However, some findings vary markedly even in the  same family, and may include severe renal and pulmonary complica   tions, such as end stage renal disease and alveolar proteinosis. Some  patients suffer from normochromic anaemia with poikilocytosis and an   isocytosis and immunological problems with leukopenia and deficien   cies in T  and B cell functions. We have used microarray technology and quantitative real time PCR  to find out which other genes than SLC7A7  may affect the phenotype  of the patients. The gene expression profiles were obtained from the  peripheral whole blood cells. We found systematic up regulation of  genes encoding proteins participating in erythropoiesis, heme synthe   sis, erythrocyte membrane structure, transport, enzymatic functions  and blood group antigens. Down regulated genes encoded e.g. inter   leukins, interleukin receptors, chemokines, regulators of complement  activity and histocompatibility complex proteins.

Mal de Meleda (MdM) is a rare form of palmoplantar  keratoderma (PPK) with autosomal recessive transmission. It is char   acterized by diffuse erythema and hyperkeratosis of the palms and  soles. Recently, mutations in the ARS (component B) gene ( ARS,  MIM: 606119) on chromosome 8q24.3 have been identified in families  with this disorder. Objective. Clinical and genetic investigation of a consanguineous fam   ily from Northern Tunisia with transgressive palmoplantar keratoderma  closely resembling the Mal de Meleda phenotype. Methods. A family with six members, among them two were affected  individuals, was recruited for this study. Mutation screening of the ARS  gene was performed by direct sequencing and haplotype analysis  using 2 microsatellite markers (D8S1836 and D8S1751) flanking the  ARS gene. Results. No mutation was found in the coding region and exon intron  junctions of the ARS gene within the explored family. This genetic ex   clusion of the ARS gene was confirmed by haplotype analysis and Lod  score calcul. Conclusion. This is the second Tunisian Family with âMdM likeâ pheno   type.

Gardner, L. Vandeleur, M. Corbett, J.

We recently showed mutations  in UPF3B, an important member of this pathway, caused syndromic  and nonsyndromic mental retardation (MR). To assess the impact of  UPF3B null mutations and identify relevant genes regulated by NMD,  we performed expression profiling using RNA isolated from control and  patient lymphoblastoid cells using Affymetrix Human Exon 1.0 ST ar   rays. Compared to controls, 633 genes were significantly de regulated  in patients (30% up, 70% down, false discovery rate , 10%), including  down regulation of UPF3B. Hence, NMD is only partially compromised  in the absence of UPF3B as its own PTC containing mRNA is degrad   ed. Comparison with previous microarray studies from UPF1, UPF2  or UPF3B knock down cell lines in human, fly and yeast generated  minimal overlap. Such low correspondence indicates these studies do  reflect the situation of a real knock out or reflects differences in the  tissue types and platforms used. Among the significantly de regulated  genes identified in patients with mutations in UPF3B, ARHGAP24 was  highly up regulated. ARHGAP24 is a negative regulator of Rho GT   Pase and has role in regulating cell polarity. We show that PC12 cells  over expressing ARHGAP24 failed to differentiate into neuronal like  cells upon treatment with nerve growth factor. We have identified the  bona fide targets of the UPF3B dependent NMD pathway and suggest  up regulation of ARHGAP24 contributes to the phenotypes seen in pa   tients with MR due to mutations in UPF3B.Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders",2009

Clinically,  the patients present a heterogeneous spectrum which can be multi  systemic (e.g. neonatal lactic acidosis, Leigh syndrome) or with distinct  symptoms (e.g. ataxia, myopathy). RCC I is composed of 45 different  subunits. The high number of genes involved is making the search for  the molecular basis of RCCI deficiency difficult. In routine diagnostics  the causal mutations can be identified in less than 10% of the pediatric  patients with RCCI deficiency. Methods: A high throughput molecular genetic screen for the RCCI  encoding genes was established. 92 families with isolated RCCI de   ficiency and previous exclusion of common mtDNA mutations were  investigated by DNA melting profile analysis using an Idaho LightScan   ner. To analyze genotype phenotype correlations a clinical question   naire was developed based on the guidelines issued by the working  group on pediatric metabolic disorders. Results: We have screened 59 genes coding for the subunits and as   sembly factors of RCCI. Causative mutations have been identified in  16% of patients which were inconspicuous in routine diagnostics. A  single variant was identified in 30% of additional samples and in 54%  of samples no mutations have been found yet.

Hepatosplenomegaly as well  as pulmonary and vertebral aspergillosis with destruction of thoracic  vertebrae D5 D7 characterized the clinical picture at admittance in  our hospital. The suspicion of X linked CGD was confirmed by absent  respiratory burst and the presence of the genetic mutation (4. exon,  c.271C>T, p.R91X). Despite prolonged therapy, the patient continued  to present pulmonary and vertebral aspergillosis.

To summarize our experience in the field of neurogenetics we provide  the investigation of mutations associated with various NS dysfunction  in patients with Huntingtonâs disease (HD) and Charcot Marie Tooth  (CMT) disease. HD is a common disorder of central NS caused by expansion of CAG  repeats in the IT15. CMT is a heterogeneous group of peripheral NS  diseases with more than 20 involved loci. The most common types of  CMT are due to mutations in PMP22  and Cx32 . Analysis of CAG , CCG  and del2642 of IT15 gene polymorphisms  has been performed in patients with HD. We have provided the  screening of PMP22 duplications/deletion and Cx32  point mutations  in CMT patients. 35 HD probands had expanded allele of IT15 ( 39  52 CAG repeats) . The significant differences in sex determined insta   bility of CAG repeats inheritance have been revealed. The associa   tion between del2642 and the age of HD onset has been analyzed.  PMP22  duplications were found in 21 CMT families. We also detected  the heterozygote PMP22 gene deletion in two patients with specific  HNPP phenotype. Mutation screening of Cx32 revealed 2 brothers  with Arg22Gln mutation.Our data showed the association between dif   ferent types of IT15, PMP22  and Cx32  genes mutations and specific  abnormalities of the NS.

The COL4A1  gene was analyzed by sequencing analysis and a de  novo  missense mutation was found: c.3707G>A (p.Gly1236Glu). This  mutation is likely pathogenic as it is a mutation that changes a highly  conserved Gly residue within Gly Xaa Yaa repeats in the triple helix  domain. Changes in this conserved element are likely to impair the tri   ple helix formation during collagen assembly.

Multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification refines  molecular diagnosis in pseudoxanthoma elasticum,P12.136,"L. M. Costrop1, O. M. Vanakker1, P. Coucke1, L. Martin2, N. Chassaing2, I.  Pasquali  Ronchetti3, A. De Paepe1","1Center for Medical Genetics, Ghent, Belgium, 2Department of Dermatology,  Angers, France, 3Department of Biomedical Sciences, Modena, Italy","Background: Pseudoxanthoma elasticum (PXE) is a recessive disor   der characterized by oculocutaneous and cardiovascular manifesta   tions, due to mineralization of elastic fibres. The disorder is caused  by mutations in the ABCC6 gene, encoding an ATP dependent trans   membrane transporter. By conventional methods, more than 200 mis   sense and nonsense mutations have been described, and the current  ABCC6 mutation detection rate accounts for 94% of disease alleles  in our cohort. Remaining disease alleles can be partly explained by  middle sized deletions, which can be missed by direct sequencing. We  aimed to optimize ABCC6 analysis by screening for such deletions us   ing multiplex ligation dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Methods: We performed MLPA in a cohort of 35 out of 331 biopsy  proven PXE patients, in whom only one or no mutations were detected  after screening for the frequent multi exon 23 29 deletion and direct  sequencing of the ABCC6 coding region and exon/intron boundaries. Results: Ten deletions were observed comprising five different multi  exon deletions and five novel single exon deletions. Conclusion: For this cohort, we demonstrated that approximately 25%  (10/41) of currently undetected ABCC6 disease alleles can be identi   fied using MLPA, yielding mutation detection rates of over 95 % in our  PXE population. Our results demonstrate that the majority of PXE mu   tations are situated in the ABCC6 gene and indicate that the involve   ment of another gene locus in classic PXE is unlikely. These results  improve the efficacy of familial screening and genetic counseling in  PXE. Therefore, we propose MLPA as a valuable additional screening  method in the molecular analysis of the ABCC6 gene.0 Molecular basis of Mendelian disorders 0",2009

Large deletions encompassing from one exon to the complete Factor  8 (F8) gene account for about 5% of the causal mutations of severe X  linked hemophilia A leading to an absence of factor VIII. MLPA analy   sis was performed in 38 DNA unrelated Belgium patients with severe  hemophilia A after a negative genetic testing for intron 22 and 1 inver   sions. DNA of 3 unrelated symptomatic female carriers presenting with  factor VIII deficiency in the absence of a family history or in absence of  paternal investigation were also included.

Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) studies have become a widely  used tool for identifying genetic variants that affect gene regulation. For  identifying such eQTLs we crossed five inbred mice (C57Bl/6, Balb/c,  CAST, CBA and LP) to form a heterozygous but identical F1 generation  and isolated DNA and RNA from ear and retina, respectively. Then, we  screened 20 different retinal disease genes for heterozygous cSNPs  applying PCR and sequencing. To determine allelic expression differ   ences based on the identified cSNPs, we applied Pyrosequencing as   says on RT PCR amplified retinal cDNAs. The results were calibrated  for equimolar ratios by used genomic DNA as a control. Using the Pyrosequencing technology, a highly accurate method to  detect allele specific expression differences, we have seen in 4 dif   ferent genes an allelic imbalance. In one of those genes we can see  the allelic imbalance already on the genomic level suggesting a copy  number variation. In another gene, we were able to detect a mutation  within this gene that leads to a premature termination codon leading to  downregulation of the mutant transcript due to the nonsense mediated  decay.

In both families we investi   gated: 1) the copy number of SMN2 gene; 2) the amount of the full  length SMN mRNA; 3) the amount of PLS3 mRNA. The SMN2 copy  number resulted the same (4 copies) in the unaffected sister and her  affected brother, while 5 copies were detected in the other unaffected  female. The amount of full length SMN mRNA is quite low and com   parable between asymptomatic and symptomatic subjects. Finally, the  amount of PLS3 mRNA is comparable between all the subjects stud   ied. Altogether these results suggest that other factors then full length  SMN and PLS3 could be important SMA phenotype modifiers.",2009

Several types of  SMA have been described depend on age when accompanying clini   cal features appear. The most common types are acute infantile (SMA  type I, or Werdnig Hoffman disease), chronic infantile (SMA type II),  chronic juvenile (SMA type III or Kugelberg Welander disease), and  adult onset (SMA type IV) forms. SMA is diagnosed with detection of  homozygous deletions of SMN1 (exon 7   8 or exon 7) gene in mo   lecular level. Objectives: It is aimed to conduct molecular analysis of exon 7 and 8  of SMN gene in sixty five subjects of SMA (66 patients). Materials and methods: PCR RFLP method is used for detection of  homozygous exon 7   8 deletions. PCR SSCP method was used ei   ther to identify for intragenic mutations and especially compound het   erozygotes or to confirm some SMA patients homozygous deletions  detected by RFLP. Conclusion: In this study, 94 % (62/66) of SMA patients including all  types were found homozygous for exon 7 and 8 deletions with RFLP  method. The rate of homozygous deletions determined was 94.7%  (18/19) in type I patients, 96% (22/23) in type II and 90% (18/20) in  type III.

The  whole genome Sub Megabase Resolution Tiling Array (SMRT array) is  capable of identifying microamplifications and microdeletions at a res   olution of 100 Kb. Other different techniques, such as MLPA or FISH,  are traditionally employed to detect these chromosomal alterations. In  this study we show the utility of the SMRT arrays to provide precise  information about the size and breakpoints of DNA copy number gains  and losses. Methods: We present a patient with unexplained mental retardation  and a male normal karyotipe 46, XY. MLPA kit (from MRC Holland)  technique was carried out. A SMRT array, (from Wan Lam Laboratory  at the BC Cancer Research Centre) analysis was performed to confirm  and describe the alteration. Results: MLPA study showed a 14q deletion of about 1.5 Mb. The 14q  specific probe of MLPA kit was deleted. The SMRT array analysis of  the specific 14q32.33 region confirmed this microdeletion and allowed  us to exactly describe its size into 2.20 Mb. Conclusions: The SMRT array study confirms a small deletion of 2.20  Mb unless than 1.5 Mb previously detected by MLPA. SMRT array  arises as an effective technique to detect DNA microvariations and  provides more information about their size and precise breakpoints.",2009

Background: Truncating point mutations in SPG11/spatacsin are the  major cause of autosomal recessive spastic paraplegia with thin cor   pus callosum. Recently genomic rearrangements were also involved. Methods: 45 unrelated patients with spastic paraplegia with thin cor   pus callosum +/  mental retardation or cognitive delay were screened  using direct sequencing and MLPA. Results: 25 different SPG11 point mutations, 18 of which were novel,  were identified in 16 patients (36%). All mutations but one introduced  premature termination codon in the protein sequence and were com   patible with a degradation of the corresponding mRNA by the non   sense mediated mRNA decay. The remaining mutation was a mis   sense variant which alters a highly conserved amino acid of the pro   tein and was found associated with a truncating mutation. In addition,  MLPA analysis detected heterozygous SPG11 micro rearrangements  in two patients who already had a single heterozygous point mutation.  Analysis of the affected relatives and parents when possible showed  that the mutations segregated with the disease and that heterozygous  compound mutations were inherited each from a healthy parent. Only  two patients out of 16 had homozygous mutations; the remaining 14  patients had heterozygous compound mutations. Finally, we identified  new missense polymorphisms that did not segregated with the dis   ease. Conclusions: These findings expand the SPG11 mutation spectrum  and highlight the importance of screening the whole coding region with  both direct sequencing and a quantitative method. Rare missense polymorphisms are frequent in SPG11, complicating  interpretation of diagnosis.",2009

SMA patients are classified  into 3 groups, type I (the most severe), type II (the intermediate form)  and type III (the less affected) according to age of onset, achieved mo   tor abilities, and life span. SMN2 is the SMN1 highly homologous copy  that is considered as a modifier of the disease. We estimated the SMN2 copy number in 536 unrelated SMA patients  from different Spanish centres. We employed the Multiplex Ligation  dependent Probe Amplification (MLPA) technique, which includes a  mixture of specific probes for the SMA locus. The majority of the type I patients showed two copies of the SMN2  gene (209/261,80%), type II patients presented mainly 3 SMN2 copies (126/150, 84%), whereas 91% (114/125) of type III patients have 3  (67%) or 4 (24%) SMN2 copies. These results confirm that SMN2 cop   ies are strongly related to disease severity. However, the correlation is  not absolute (i.e. 36 type I patients showed three SMN2 copies and 9  type III patients had two copies). This study performed in a large cohort  of subjects, allowed us to improve the genetic characterisation of the  SMA locus. Moreover, it will be useful to define a subtype of patients  (i.e. those with three SMN2 copies and different SMA type) to further  investigate the functional copies of SMN2 and possible modifiers of  the phenotype.

Genetic diagnosis of TRAPS consists usually of  sequencing of exons 2 4 of TNFRSF1A  gene. However, mutations  which cause TRAPS have been also found outside these exons; there   fore, a system that would offer complete genotyping of the TNFRSF1A   gene would be highly advantageous. We are currently developing an  answer to this need using a new, high throughput technique, for simul   taneous detection of both known and novel point mutations (SNPs and  pathogenic mutations) and of large scale genetic rearrangements in  the TNFRSF1A  gene. This system, called EMMA (enhanced mismatch  mutation analysis) is based on electrophoretic heteroduplex analysis  (HDA) and semiquantitative multiplexed PCR by multi capillary elec   trophoresis. The EMMA (Fluigent, France) mutation detection method  is an alternative to dHPLC and sequencing. It combines all the ad   vantages of the screening before sequencing  strategy: high through   put, major reduction in sequencing costs and high productivity. The  presence of both point mutations and long range rearrangements has  a âsignatureâ that can be associated with quantitative and objective  numerical criteria. The analysis of electrophoregrams can be fully au   tomated; a feature that for the rare TRAPS case is less imperative, but  will be very useful for high throughput screening of clinically important  genes with more prevalent SNPs and pathogenic allele variants.",2009

About  200 COL3A1  mutations have been reported. Mutations in TGFBR1   and TGFBR2  cause the Loeys Dietz syndrome (LDS) type II (MIM  #610380), presenting with vEDS major signs and without cardinal fea   tures of originally described LDS.

Kalenderova, V. Mitev;   Department of Medical Chemistry and Biochemistry, Medical University, Sofia,  Bulgaria. William Beuren syndrome (WBS) syndrome is an autosomal domi   nant disorder clinically characterized by supravalvular aortic stenosis  (SVAS), multiple peripheral pulmonary arterial stenoses, elfin face,  mental and statural deficiency, specific dental malformation, and in   fantile hypercalcemia. The genetic cause of WBS is a contiguous gene deletion of several  genes on chromosome 7q11.23. The severity of clinical symptoms and  particularly mental retardation may be related to the size of the dele   tion (the number of genes involved). Recently developed for research  purposes Multiplex Ligation dependant Probe Amplification (MLPA)  method provides a possibility to detect copy number changes (dele   tions and duplications) along a single or a number of genes. We suc   cessfully applied MLPA probe mix P245 A1 Microdeletion syndromes  to genetically diagnose a patient with clinically suspected WBS. The  obtained results showed undoubted a reduction of gene dosage for  the 3 specific WBS probes: two within Elastin(ELN) gene and one in  (LIMK1) gene, both localized in 7q11.23. The detected deletion in our  patient was associated with multiple peripheral pulmonary stenoses,  supravalvular aortic stenosis, moderate mental retardation, cognitive  problems associated with attention deficiency and hyperactivity. Facial  dismorphology was also present: thick lips, machroorchidism, micro   gnathia. The MLPA analysis proved to be useful in routine genetic diagnosis of  microdeletion syndromes and particularly William Beuren syndrome.",2009

Recently, we showed that TRIM50 acts as  an E3 ubiqutin ligase. TRIM50 is hemizygous in the Williams Beuren  syndrome (WBS), a contiguous genetic disorder, caused by a 1.5 Mb  deletion at 7q11.23 that include about 25 genes. Although some of  the WBS phenotypes have been associated to some of the deleted  genes, the contributions of the remaining genes, including TRIM50, to  the multiple defects are still undetermined. To get insight on its role and  to identify putative TRIM50 interacting peptides we performed fluores   cence and electronic microscopy and mass spectrometry. We founded that TRIM50 protein localizes in highly mobile, labile and  dynamic cytoplasmic bodies. CLEM microscopy showed that it local   izes in the multi vesicular structures similar to the autophagosome and  notably it colocalizes with LC3, a specific marker of autophagosomes.  Consistently, nano LC MS/MS identified a number of putative TRIM50  interacting proteins known being implicated in the proteasome and  autophagy. Among them we showed that TRIM50 interacts with P62/ SQSTM1, an essential protein involved in the autophagic flux. p62 is  able to transfer misfolded and ubiquitinated proteins to the autopha   gosomes for degradation and as TRIM50 is an E3 ubiquitin ligase, we  can speculate that TRIM50 ubiquitinates its substrates that are, then,  shuttled to the autophagosome for degradation via TRIM50 p62 com   plex. These results show an unexpected role for TRIM50 on protein degra   dation pathways. We anticipated that the haploinsufficiency of TRIM50  could account for a consistent part of WBS phenotype through the ac   cumulation and/or abnormal degradation of TRIM50 substrates. Metabolic disorders ",2009

So far, more than 300 AGLA  missense mutations have been described. However, numerous amino  acid exchanges appear to have only mild effects on enzyme activity  reduction. Bioinformatic tools cannot reliably predict the effects of these changes  and inevitably need to be supported by enzymatic measurements.  Therefore, a rapid screening procedure for all AGLA mutations will be  invaluable for this purpose. To solve the limitations of all routine meth   ods we developed an in vitro model based on the overexpression of  AGLA mutants using a HEK293 cell system. Using fluorescence en   zyme activity assays we are able to determine the activity of mutant  enzymes compared to the wildtype. This procedure has shown that  the following mutations, which are described in the literature or have  been found in our screening programs for Fabry have to be interpreted  as SNPs and not clinically relevant AGLA mutations: D83N, S102L,  S126G, R220Q, R252T. Tools for the systematic in vitro evaluation of newly detected mutations  are also of high value for the evaluation of the consequences of new  therapeutic strategies, e.g. using pharmacological chaperones (PCs)  such as 1 Deoxygalactonojirimycin (DGJ).

It belongs to a subfamily of hep   tahelical G protein coupled receptors that have a common structure  consisting of seven transmembrane segments, three extracellular and  three intracellular loops, an extracellular amino terminal domain, and  an intracytoplasmic carboxyl terminal tail. We examined the frequency  of TSHR  mutations among patients with permanent primary congenital  hypothyroidism and in the general population of Republic Bashkorto   stan (Russia). We enrolled 63 patients with primary congenital hypothyroidism who  identified through newborn screening.  We investigated all 10 exons of TSHR gene and detected 3 mutations  including one well characterized substitution R450H and two new het   erozygous mutations. Those 3 patients had markedly elevated TSH levels concomitant with  low peripheral thyroid hormone levels and a reduced thyroid volume as  determined by ultrasonography. This constellation of clinical findings  warranted the diagnosis of congenital hypothyroidism. In one case was detected a heterozygous mutation R450H in the  TSHR gene. Nagashima et all. are reported that the R450H mutants  demonstrates a slightly impaired receptor function. Also was found heterozygous mutation C1318A which resulted in a  L440I substitution of the TSHR protein. A novel heterozygous cytosine to thymine transition at nucleotide posi   tion 1591 in 10 exon (R531W) was found in the third case.

In this study, we describe a new splice site mutation in the DGUOK   gene and the clinical, radiologic, and genetic features of these DGUOK  patients. This new DGUOK  homozygous mutation (c.444 62C>A) was  identified in three patients from two North African consanguineous  families with combined respiratory chain deficiencies and mitochon   drial DNA depletion in the liver. Brain MRIs are normal in DGUOK  pa  tients in the literature. Interestingly, we found subtentorial abnormal  myelination and moderate hyperintensity in the bilateral pallidi in our  patients. This new mutation creates a cryptic splice site in intron 3 (in Metabolic disorders position  62) and is predicted to result in a larger protein with an in  frame insertion of twenty amino acids. In silico  analysis of the putative  impact of the insertion shows serious clashes in protein conformation:  this insertion disrupts the Î±5 helix of the dGK kinase domain, rendering  the protein unable to bind purine deoxyribonucleosides. In addition, a  common haplotype that segregated with the disease in both families  was detected by haplotype reconstruction with ten markers (microsat   ellites and SNPs), which span 4.6 kb of DNA covering the DGUOK   locus.

Methods. A 43 year old female, with arterial hypertension, was remitted  to our clinic because of a suspected diagnosis of hypertrophic cardio   myopathy. Clinical, electrocardiographic, echocardiographic, plasma  alfa galactosidase A activity and genetic study was made of all avail   able relatives. Results. The index case echocardiogram shown left ventricular hyper   trophy mainly of posterior lateral wall (16mm). Her adolescent son had  been diagnosed of erythromelalgia, with cutaneous lesions consistent  with angiokeratomas and suffering for intense pains in his feet and  hands (the mother had suffered the same pains in her youth). The son  also presented mild left ventricular hypertrophy (13mm, postero basal wall). A probably FD with the classical form of the disease was sus   pected in both, due to a low plasma alfa galactosidase enzymatic ac   tivity. Moreover, her aunt and her cousin, diagnosed of a mild FD form,  presented the A143T mutation in alpha galactosidase A gen (GLA).  We suspected that the mutation A143T in the GLA was responsible for  the disease in the new cases. However, the genetic analysis showed  that they were not carriers of the A143T mutation but they presented  the mutation IVS5+2T>C previously associated with the classic form  of FD. This intronic mutation was no present in the patient with the  A143T mutation. Conclusion. In this family we described two mutations previously asso   ciated with FD, but with available data we think that the pathogenicity  of the A143T mutation must be revaluated.",2009

Familial cases suggest autosomal dominant inheri   tance. Two recent studies have identified mutations in the SLC2A1   gene, encoding the GLUT1 glucose transporter, in patients with PED. Objective: To study a family with monozygotic twins presenting with  PED, learning disability and childhood absence epilepsy (CAE) at age  5 years. Patients and Methods: In both patients, aged 9, PED episodes oc   curred daily and improved rapidly upon intake of isotonic beverages.  The EEG showed generalized paroxysmal 3 Hz spike wave discharg   es; seizures improved with ethosuximide. The CSF/serum glucose ra   tio was low at 0.4 in both children. The 10 exons of the SLC2A1  gene  and their corresponding exon/intron junctions including splice sites  and branch points were PCR amplified and sequenced. Results: The new mutation c.G493A was identified in exon 4 of SL  C2A1 , leading to a p.Val165Ile substitution in GLUT1 protein, in the  two siblings but not in their parents. The replaced valine residue is  highly conserved in evolution. The mutation was not present in one  hundred unrelated healthy Spanish individuals. An identical mutation  described by others in the paralogous GLUT2 is known to markedly  reduce glucose uptake.

The  homozygous GSD III T531M mice appeared normal at birth. Glyco   gen highly accumulated in the liver of the 20 week old homozygous  GSD III T531M mice was observed. The mice carrying the homozy   gous E609X stop codon mutation in the GBE1 gene showed perinatal  death. The heartbeats in some homozygous GSD IV E609X mutation  fetus stopped at around 10.5 days of gestation, and the histopathology  studies from the fetus revealed no glycogen accumulated in the wall  of heart chamber and liver primodium, however glycogen is significant  accumulated in these regions at the same stage of wild type fetus. In  the new born GSD IV E609X mice the diastase resistant PAS positive  material was observed in the liver and cardiomyocytes.

Hereditary folate malabsorption: case report and response to  treatment with folinic acid,P13.24,"L. Russell , A. Karalis, S. ABISH","McGill University Health Centre, Montreal, QC, Canada","Draft #6 Hereditary folate malabsorption (HFM) is a rare autosomal recessive  disorder in which folic acid cannot be absorbed from the gastrointes   tinal tract or transported from the blood stream into the brain. As a re   sult, patients present with failure to thrive, megaloblastic anemia, and,  without treatment, progressive neurologic deterioration. A defective  folate transport protein (Proton coupled folate transporter, PCFT) was  recently identified as the cause of the disorder. Less than 20 cases of  HFM have been reported in the literature, most of them female. We  report another case in whom treatment with folinic acid resulted in im   proved growth and stabilization of neurologic status. A 12 month old girl, product of consanguineous parents, was referred  for evaluation of seizures and occipital calcifications. Despite these  findings, her development was normal. The past medical history  was significant for failure to thrive and for megaloblastic anemia at 3  months of age that responded only partially to treatment with folic acid.  CSF 5 methyltetrahydrofolate, a folate metabolite, determination was  <2 nmol/L (normal 40   187 nmol/L), consistent with the diagnosis of  HFM. Initiation of treatment with IM folinic acid resulted in dramatic improve   ment in her growth parameters and stabilization of her neurologic sta   tus, despite the fact that CSF levels never reached the reference range  of the testing laboratory. To date, she has had no further seizures and,  aside from mild language delays, has exhibited normal growth and  development. These results emphasize the importance of accurate di   agnosis and early treatment in patients with this disorder.",2009

The clinical penetrance and frequency of complications of HH is a  subject of controversy. The present study aimed at assessing the HFE  mutations (C282Y, H63D and S65C) in western Romanian patients  with liver disease of diverse aetiologies suspected of iron overload. A  total of 21 patients, all Romanian residents hospitalized with clinical suspicion of iron overload and liver disease, were assayed for C282Y,  H63D and S65C mutations, serum ferritin, transaminases, and viral  hepatitis markers. Overall, 9 out of the 21 patients (42.86%) were  found harbouring mutations in the HFE gene: four C282Y homozy   gotes (19.0%), one compound heterozygote C282Y/H63D (4.8%), one  single heterozygote C282Y (4.8%), two single heterozygotes H63D  (9.5%), one single heterozygote S65C (4.8%), and 12 wild type cases  (57.1%).

Hirsutism  results from the interaction between the androgen level and the sensi   tivity of the hair follicle to the androgen. The pathophysiology of IH is  presumed to be associated to SRD5A activity and generally related to  an alteration of androgen receptor function. IH can lead to the meta   bolic syndrome, visceral obesity, dyslipidemia, insulin resistance, and  hypertension. With the aim to identify genes involved in the pathogenesis of this dis   order, we investigated the expression profile of 190 genes involved  both in the androgen biosynthesis and metabolism, and other genes  coding for products active in the insulin pathway. The analysis was  done in skin genital fibroblasts of 5 idiopathic hirsute women and 2  related controls. The array gene signature in the hirsute patients iden   tified 4 differentially expressed genes, 2 up regulated and 2 down  regulated (FCâ¥Â± 1.5).

","LAT2 (SLC7A8) is a polytopic membrane protein that after covalent  association with 4F2hc (or CD98, SLC3A2) forms an heterodimeric  amino acid transporter. LAT2 4F2hc induces system L transport activ   ity in the plasma membrane of most of the epithelial tissues (kidney,  intestine, brain...). LAT2 4F2hc plays a role in the vectorial trans  epi  thelial flux of neutral amino acid (re)absoption, particularly important  for cystine. To further study the physiological relevance of LAT2 in vivo , we gener   ated a knockout mice model from ES cells. Mice model deficient in  LAT2 presents around 85% of lethality (n,200) despite there are no  differences in weight and basic behavior compared to the wild type  animals (studied up to 8 months of age). We also generated an antibody that allows us to check the absence  of LAT2 in the majority of the tissues where it is expressed. We also  confirmed the basolateral location of LAT2 in the epithelial cells by im   munohistochemistry with the same antibody. In addition to these preliminary results, we are analyzing amino acid  content in urine and plasma, examining the histopathology of all tis   sues and evaluating different behavior parameters in the knockout  mice. All these studies aim to increase our understanding about the  physiological role of LAT2 and its functional cooperation with TAT1 and  LAT1 4F2hc, both transporters implicated in the (re)absorption in the  kidney and intestine.

Methods: Non randomized, open label, uncontrolled, single group as   signment study with eligibility criteria similar to protocol ALID 014 02  but without limitations on age. Two girls (7 years) and a boy (7 years)  with Hurler syndrome were enrolled. Patients received intravenously  AldurazymeÂ® at a weekly dose of 100 U/kg for 84 (boy) and 56 weeks  (girls). Criteria of evaluation: urinary glycosaminoglycan excretion  (GAGe), vital signs, the investigatorâs global assessment. Results: The GAGe decreased 56%, 33% in the girls, 71% in the boy,  the reduction being associated with clinical benefit in the girls. In the  girls a decrease in liver and spleen size was evident.

An epidemio   logical study of MPS in Taiwan using multiple ascertainment sources  was undertaken, and incidences of different types of MPS during the  period of 1984 to 2004 were estimated. We compared our data with  previous reports in different populations. The combined birth incidence  for all MPS cases was 2.04 per 100,000 live births. MPS II had the  highest calculated birth incidence of 1.07 per 100,000 live births (2.05  per 100,000 male live births), comprising 52% of all MPS cases diag   nosed. The birth incidences of MPS I, III, IV, and VI were 0.11, 0.39,  0.33, and 0.14 per 100,000 live births, respectively, which accounted  for 6%, 19%, 16%, and 7% of all MPS, respectively. No cases of MPS  IIID, IVB, VII or IX were ascertained during the study period. Overall  incidence of MPS diseases in Taiwan was consistent with that reported  in Western populations. In contrast to the higher incidence of MPS I  in most Western populations, this study showed a higher incidence of  MPS II in Taiwan.

","Mucopolysaccharidosis (MPS) IIIC is an autosomal recessive lyso   somal storage disorder caused by a deficiency in heparan acetyl CoA:  alpha glucosaminide N acetyltransferase (HGSNAT). This is localised  to the lysosomal membrane and catalyses a transmembrane acetyla   tion in which the terminal glucosamine residue of heparan sulphate ac   quires an acetyl group, thus forming N acetylglucosamine. The char   acteristic feature is the deterioration of the central nervous system,  but other symptoms may include coarse facies, developmental delay,  macrocrania and motor retardation. Only recently has the gene for  MPS IIIC been identified. HGSNAT  is localised to chromosome 8p11.1  and contains 18 exons. The cDNA codes for a product of 635 amino  acids which is predicted to contain a cleavable signal peptide at its  N terminus, 11 transmembrane domains, and up to 5 N linked glyco   sylation sites. We and other groups have since sequenced 45 different  disease causing HGSNAT  alleles in MPS IIIC patients. 19 of these are  missense mutations, although these are yet to be functionally anal   ysed. Furthermore, certain biochemical properties of HGSNAT, such  as its active site, remain uncharacterised. In this study, a number of  mutations known to occur in MPS IIIC patients have been introduced  into the cDNA of HGSNAT . The expression of these HGSNAT  deriva   tives in cell culture and the analysis of their protein levels and activity  have been performed to examine the effect of the tested mutations on  HGSNAT function. This research will aid in detailing the biochemical  characteristics of HGSNAT activity, and thus the molecular basis of  MPS IIIC.",2009

The content of mtDNA of patients liver, fibroblast and muscle  biopsies was quantified by qRT PCR. The activities of respiratory chain  complexes (RCC) were measured spectrophotometrically in various Metabolic disorders tissues. BN PAGE from liver and muscle biopsies was performed, fol   lowed by in gel activity assays. Results: Sequence analysis of POLG1 gene revealed compound het   erozygosity for the most commonly found mutation p.A467T in exon 7  and a novel splice site mutation c.1251 2A>T in intron 6 resulting in an  in frame skipping of Exon 7.

Most folate responsive mild homocysteinemia is due to homozygos   ity for a common C677T polymorphism in methylene tetrahydrofolate  reductase that produces a thermolabile enzyme (tMTHFR). Approxi   mately 10% of whites are homozygous for tMTHFR. As compared to  the general population, persons with hyperhomocysteinemia have a  6.8 time greater risk of peripheral arterial disease, 2.5 time greater risk  of stroke, and 2 time greater risk of heart disease. Case presentation. A 5 year old female was admitted for asymptom   atic thrombocytopenia and leucopenia discovered to an occasionally  laboratory exploration. Her grandfather died due to mesenteric throm   bosis and the patient presented in the neonatal period septicemia with  left temporo mandibular arthritis that recovered with ankylosis and left  mandibular hypoplasia. Clinical exam revealed splenomegaly without  hepatomegaly. Laboratory tests confirmed thrombocytopenia (41.000/ mmc) with leucopenia (2300/mmc) and bone marrow aspirate analysis  excluded a hematological disease. Abdominal Eco Doppler revealed  the absence of flux in portal vein and portal cavernoma was confirmed  by angio MRI. AT III, C protein, S protein were in normal range but  homocysteine level was increased. Genetic analysis detected homo   zygous C677T mutation in tMTHFR.

Direct sequencing of all 21 exons within ATP7B  gene revealed that four WD patients are heterozygotes or compound  heterozygotes bearing three previously reported mutations: P767P  fs, H1069G and K832R (considered by some researches a polymor   phism).

One of these  chemicals is a DNA methyl transferase inhibitor called 5 Azacytadine  (5 Aza). A potential downstream effector (Î³ globin repressor) of 5  Aza is a protein called Methyl Binding Domain protein 2 (MBD2). We  sought to determine whether knockdown of MBD2 by siRNAs in hu   man erythroid cells would result in induction of Î³ globin mRNA. This  information could used to develop more targeted Î² thalassemia drugs.  To this end, an MBD2 specific validated siRNA was transfected into  K562 erythroleukemia cells and the levels of MBD2 and Î³ globin com   pared to cells transfected with a scrambled siRNA control by using  qRT  PCR. MBD2 levels were knocked down to 0.65Â±0.23 and Î³ globin  levels were increased to 1.70Â±0.46. In contrast, the largest Î³ globin mRNA increase obtained after exposure of K562 cells to 5 Azacyta   dine was 7.36 fold  seen after a 3 day exposure to 15 Î¼M of 5 Aza.  These results suggest that MBD2 siRNAs can indeed induce Î³ globin  at significant levels. The DNA binding site of MBD2 is not clear. We  sought to determine whether MBD2 was mediating its repressive activ   ity via LARC. To this end siRNAs against C1C2 shRNP, the DNA bind   ing protein of LARC, were transfected into K562 cells and C1C2 and  Î³ globin levels measured as discussed above. C1C2 levels were de   creased to 0.54Â±0.16, whereas levels of Î³ globin remained unchanged  (1.07Â±0.25).

Using the traditional DNA cloning methods, which include  usage of restriction endonucleases and DNA ligase, have many limita   tions including unavailability of unique restriction sites in both insert  and vector. LIC (Ligase Independent Cloning) methods have been  developed to overcome such problems, they use different enzymes  to generate long enough âsticky endsâ that can hold insert and vec   tor together. Reparative mechanism of cell can join the nicks in both  strands and final construct can be formed. Here we describe a simple method for the cloning of PCR products  without the need for restriction enzyme and any post enzymatic treat   ment. PCR products containing phosphorothiate bonds are used to  create complementary single stranded overhangs on both insert and  vector by a post PCR iodine treatment. These single stranded over   hangs are designed to allow directional cloning without using any en   zyme (Enzyme Free cloning). After hybridization and transformation step construct can be isolated from cells. Our procedure is faster than  the existing cloning strategies and also is highly efficient, directional  and reliable. Besides that since two different cohesive ends are used,  the orientation of the insert in relation to the vector can be controlled.  Flexibility in choice of vector and insert makes this method exception   ally suitable for high throughput cloning. This characterization is par   ticularly useful for ensuring that a DNA fragment is directionally cloned  into the correct reading frame for protein expression or for the creation  of fusion proteins.",2009

Both of these systems may lead to complexities, such as oncogen   esis, toxicity and possibility of triggering immune responses as well  as various genomic rearrangements in the host. Therefore, in order  to guarantee the result of a gene targeting experiment with high prob   ability, it is important to identify those potential sites within the human  genome, where the integration of a transgene is not harmful to host  and the transgene can be expressed efficiently. This approach is done  by means of a human genomic library, in which the plasmids carry vari   ous overlapping segments of human genomic DNA (3 5 Kb) next to the  previously cloned transgene (reporter gene). In order to target various  locations of the genome, the linear forms of total recombinant plasmids  derived from the amplified genomic library (at least 4 x 105 recombinant  clones) will be used to transfect a human cell line, where a homolo   gous recombination mediated integration of the plasmids into the ge   nomic DNA is expected. Subsequently, the transfected cells, isolated  in selective media, will be screened for the expression of the trans   gene. Any of cells with successful transgene expression and normal  growth will be candidate and subject for mapping of the corresponding  integration sites of the transgene.

The telomeric survival motor neuron gene (SMN1)  is the SMA disease gene, and the centromeric gene (SMN2) is the  main modifier of the disease severity. Recent research suggests that  valproic acid (VPA), a commonly used epilepsy drug, may be able  to upregulate expression of SMN2 gene and to slow progression of  the disease. Since 2003 we were involved in combined clinical trial  of VPA + carnithine treatment in SMA patients. Over 60 SMA patients  were collected and studied so far with at least half of them being en   rolled in the trial. Liver functional activity is monitored and SMN2 gene  copy number is determined by means of real time PCR. Nerve activ   ity testing was performed by means of electroneuromyography. Also  the patients were tested on presence of (c.681 G>A) polymorphism in  CYP2C19 gene contributing to VPA metabolism and thus to efficacy  of treatment. Highly positive curative effects including general health  improvements and progress in motion abilities were registered in SMA  patients especially of the II type.

Higher efficiency of TA clamp modified single stranded  oligonucleotides in targeted nucleotide exchange is not  correlated to a lower intracellular degradation,P14.21,"M. Wuepping, D. Kaufmann","Institute of Human Genetics, Ulm, Germany","Specific single stranded oligonucleotides can induce targeted nucleo   tide sequence correction in an eukaryotic genes in vitro  and in vivo .  Our model for investigating the reasons for the low correction rates  achieved with this method is the correction of a point mutation in the  hypoxanthine guanine phosphoribosyl transferase (hprt) gene in the  cell line V79 151. Using single stranded phosphorothioate modified  oligonucleotides the correction rates of this hprt mutation were low but  always reproducible. One reason for low exchange rates may be a  very fast intracellular degradation of the oligonucleotides. Therefore  we compared the exchange rates of different 3Â´  and 5Â´ end modi   fied oligonucleotides with their degradation rates. TA repeat (clamp)  modified oligonucleotides showed higher correction rates than those  with a GC clamp and 5Â´ clamps induced higher correction rates than  clamps at the 3Â´ end. Experiments on the stability of the most effective  5Â´ TA and 3Â´ TA clamp modified oligonucleotide indicated a very rap   id cleavage and the occurrence of shortened oligonucleotides in the  presence of cytoplasmic and nuclear extracts. The phosphorothioate  modified oligonucleotides were more stable, but their correction rates  were lower. We suggest that there is no direct correlation between the  biological stability of the full length oligonucleotides and the exchange  rates achieved.",2009

We report a 13 year old girl with the clinical diagnosis of TSC in   cluding skin, brain and kidney lesions and additionally an increasing  number of cafe au lait spots. Molecular analysis revealed a de novo  TSC2 mutation and a NF1 mutation inherited from the mother. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2, hamartin and tuberin, respec   tively, form a complex and inhibit the mammalian target of rapamycin  (mTOR) in the correspondent signalling pathway. The drug rapamycin  has been shown to suppress mTOR signalling which is activated in  renal angiomyolipoma due to TSC mutations. The patient has been  treated with rapamycin for six months in order to reduce angiomyolipo   ma volume prior to organ preserving renal surgery. The achieved sig   nificant reduction of tumour volume allowed partial nephrectomy and  complete AML resection. As an additional benefit, cognitive functions  improved as a consequence of decreased epileptic activity. NF1 is caused by loss of function mutations of the NF1 gene encod   ing neurofibromin, a RasGAP. In NF1 deficient human tumours, Ras  and mTOR are activated through cross talk of Ras/MAPK and PI3K/ Akt/mTOR signalling pathways.

The aims of the project  are to develop an integrated diagnostic platform mainly dedicated to  Rheumatoid Arthritis (RA) and Multiple Sclerosis (MS) in a first stage  by combining Lab On Chip technology, DNA microarray genotyping,  microelectronics, mobile devices, intelligent algorithms and wireless  communications. MS and RA are two progressive autoimmune diseases and are causes  of disability in young adults. Considering the social relevance of MS  and RA, it is extremely important to improve the timing and confidence  of the diagnosis. According to this vision the POCEMON project can be  a real milestone for the improvement of life style of many patients. In a first (discovery) phase, we are performing a case/control whole  genome association study, mostly centered to identify HLA (Human  Leukocyte Antigens) and other potentially relevant susceptibility genes  for the two diseases. For the discovery phase of RA, we are using a  homogeneous North European population (with 800 cases and 800  controls). The discovery is then followed by a confirmatory phase,  where the âbestâ SNPs are evaluated in a second independent sample  (2000 cases affected by RA or MS respectively and relative controls),  from three separate cohorts. The genotyping phase for RA, using Illumina HumanCNV 370, is con   cluded. Plink 1.05 is used for QC of genotyping data, single marker  association analysis and permutations. The analysis is ongoing.

The UKGTN promotes the development and use  of clinical testing criteria for single gene disorders to ensure clinical  appropriateness of newly available DNA tests offered to the National  Health Service. Following a strategic decision to develop testing criteria  for the commoner high volume conditions, two workshops of experts  were organized in 2008 to formulate clinical testing criteria for CF (or  CFTR related disorders) and FraX (and related disorders). For CF, 7  different clinical scenarios (fetal echogenic bowel; symptomatic child;  adult with bronchiectasis; pancreatitis; absent vas; carrier testing; re   productive donor) and for FraX, 5 scenarios (learning disabled male  child; female; adult; FXTAS; POF) were separately considered, and  criteria developed. Most dovetail to relatively tight clinical definitions  of the target population (eg. bronchiectasis must be CT scan proven  with a not normal sweat test and/or appropriate bacterial flora; fetal  echogenic bowel must be âas bright as boneâ as an isolated anomaly  and with obvious other causes excluded; ovarian failure must be at  <40yrs). However, it is clear that whereas the role of CF testing is to  make a diagnosis, and criteria could rationalise requests, FraX testing  is largely used as a first line exclusion test where rationalisation is  less applicable.

Pinson,"Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France",The identification of mutations in the NF1 gene causing type 1 neuro   fibromatosis (OMIM 162200) is still presenting a considerable amount  of work mainly because of the large size of the gene and the restricted  number of recurent mutations. The high frequency of NF1 which affect  1 in 3500 individuals lead us to choose two complementary methods  for NF1 gene analysis:   the multiplex ligation dependant probe amplification (MLPA) for the  large deletion and duplication detection (P081 and P082   P122C1)   and the automated denaturing high performance liquid (dHPLC)  screening method. The MLPA method was validated by the detection of 19 known large  NF1 gene deletions. We also tested 39 different mutations that would  interfere with the MLPA results. The dHPLC was optimised for a rapid screening of the 60 exons and  the splice junctions of the NF1 gene. The dHPLC conditions were vali   dated by the detection of 260 known variants located in two thirds of  the NF1 exons. We also evaluated the sensitivity of dHPLC for somatic  mosaicism mutation. The sensitivity was evaluated in a MLPA/dHPLC analysis of a panel of  150 unrelated french NF1 patients with at least two consensus diag   nostic criterias.Seven large deletions were first detected by P081/082/P122C1 MLPA  (6 total and 1 partial).

Physicians prescribing these  tests and biologists receiving the samples need to know which tests  are available, where they are performed and whether the identified  laboratories meet quality standards. To fulfil this need, www.orpha.net   was launched ten years ago to set up a database of clinical laborato   ries in the field of rare diseases. The data collection covered 1 coun   try in 1997, 15 in 2003, 26 in 2006 and 38 in 2009. This major effort  was enabled thanks to resources from the EC DG for public health.  In collaboration with the EuroGentest NoE, information on quality  management has been added over the past three years. To obtain  information on genetic testing in Orphanet, it is possible to search by  disease name or by gene (symbol or name in English) in addition to the  traditional search by name of laboratory or professional. The informa   tion provided on laboratories includes data on quality management.  Currently, 1308 laboratories offering tests for 2991 diseases are reg   istered on the Orphanet database. The test offer differs greatly from  one large country to another: Germany (1940 diseases), France (1630  diseases), Italy (1110 diseases), UK (845 diseases) and Spain (740  diseases). Medium and small sized countries have a test offer ranging  from 3 to 956 diseases.

After preliminary testing, two programs (Seqscape  and Seqpilot) met our minimum diagnostic requirements and were  subjected to a variant analysis of over 2,000,000 bp of bi directional  sequence (ie. over 4,000,000 bp in total). Both programs had a bi di   rectional false negative rate of 0%, but also have the potential to fail to  alert the user to variants located in a single direction (ie. variants un   der primer sequences or miscalls due to incorrect assignment of base  spacing). Additional features important to a diagnostic laboratory such  as electropherogram peak statistics, a mutation database, audit trail  capacity, a client server application, and the ability to de convolve het   erozygous indel mutations into two alleles are provided by the SeqPi   lot software.

","Introduction: AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome (AS) is a monogenic recessive disor   der featuring an array of clinical manifestations: systemic fibrosis and  multiple organ involvement, retinal degeneration, hearing loss, child   hood obesity, diabetes mellitus, dilated cardiomyopathy, and pulmo   nary, hepatic, and renal failure. Currently, 300 individuals with AS have  been identified in 44 different countries. AS is caused by mutations  in the ALMS1 gene, which comprises >224 kb of genomic DNA, 23  exons and encoding a predicted 461.2 kDa protein with unknown func   tion. CGC Genetics is the reference laboratory for AlstrÃ¶m Syndrome  International. Here we report our experience and contribution for the  identification of new AlstrÃ¶m patients. Method: In 2004 2008, we received 52 samples for ALMS1 gene anal   ysis from 8 different countries, from patients with clinically established  diagnosis and also from patients clinically suspected for AS. Our ap   proach for the molecular genetic testing was the complete sequence  analysis of exons 10 and 16, plus a portion of exon 8. Results: Causative mutations (missense) were identified in 13 patients  in both alleles and also 6 new nonsense mutations. In 6 patients we  found a causative mutation only on one chromosome. Conclusion: Being a rare disorder and not commonly known, AS is  most probably underdiagnosed, has delayed diagnosis or is even mis   diagnosis. Genetic test allows an earlier diagnosis of the disease. Ef   forts are being made to increase the detection rate by detecting large  deletions.",2009

Until now 12 genes (BBS1 BBS12) have  been involved in 70% of the families, indicating that additional muta   tions in known BBS genes and new BBS genes remain to be identified.  Previous studies* have pointed out, by different methods (homocigos   ity mapping, comparative genomics and gene expression analysis), a  total of 19 potential candidate BBS genes. One of them was PDE6B  (Rod cGMP specific 3â,5â cyclic phosphodiesterase beta subunit), this  gene (4p16.3) codifies for the primary effector enzyme in the photo   transduction cascade in the rods, and it is implicated in congenital sta   tionary night blindness and recessive retinosis pigmentaria. We analyzed the coding sequence of the PDE6B gene in 16 BBS fami   lies. In the probandus of the families, we found 7 sequence variants,  one in homozygous state (p.V320I, c.958A>G), and six in heterozy   gous state, including a novel missense variant (p.G352V, c.1055T>G),  a nonsense variant (p.T305T, c.915G>A) and several intron sequence  variants with no consequences in the splicing process (IVS9 117 C>T,  IVS18+63 G>A. IVS11+21C>T and IVS22+11A>G) The familial segregation and the nature of the variants showed that  they are no disease causing mutations. So, we concluded that PDE6B  is not, at least in the studied BBS families, a gene implicated in the  Bardet Biedl syndrome. Supported by grants from FIS PI060049 *Nishimura DY et al. 2005.

BBS is genetically hetero   geneous with 14 genes identified to date, which account for ~75% of  affected families. BBS1 and BBS10 each account for ~20% of the mu   tational load, BBS12 for about 8% whereas each of the other genes  accounts for â¤5% of the cases (or even for BBS11, 13 and 14 each in  a single family). The genetic heterogeneity is a burden for identifying mutations as the  full sequencing of the BBS coding sequences implies >150 amplicons  and is time consuming with routine techniques of diagnostic labora   tories. We analyzed a cohort of 174 families, using various strategies, includ   ing SNP array for initial homozygosity mapping of candidate loci. The  latter can in some cases detect consanguinity unknown to the family.  Mutations have been identified in 135 families (78%) whereas 39 fami   lies (22%) have no mutation detected and are explored for undetected  mutations (deletions, promoter) and new gene identification. We have  recorded 83 mutations in 11 BBS genes, of which 30 mutations are  novel, confirming the high level of private mutations in this very hetero   geneous condition and highlighting the difficult task of routine mutation  identification in the perspective of genetic counseling for the families.  We pinpoint the absence of BBS11 mutations, leaving this gene linked  to BBS through a single missense mutation reported in one family,  while several other mutations are responsible for the very different  phenotype of limb girdle muscular dystrophy (LGMD2H).",2009

The Hutterites are a  genetically isolated population of 40,000 individuals derived from 89  common founders. Thus, we assessed the known BBS loci for evi   dence of identity by descent from a common ancestor. Genotypic in   formation from his three unaffected sibs was used to rule out regions of  homozygosity in the patient present due to chance. Initially, microsatel   lite markers flanking the known BBS genes were used and segregation  analysis made them unlikely candidates. Genome wide analysis using  a 10K SNP micorarray identified two regions of homozygosity present  in the patient but absent in his sibs. One of the regions included the  BBS2 gene on 16q21, initially ruled out using microsatellite analysis.  Sequence analysis identified the splice variant c.472 2A>G; RNA anal   ysis confirmed aberrant splicing. These findings demonstrate a pitfall  in using microsatellite markers in homozygosity mapping: homozygos   ity at a locus can not be excluded in the presence of heterozygosity at  a closely flanking microsatellite marker.

Four large pedi   grees dating back to the 19th century were obtained: a pedigree with  carriers for LQTS1 (n,55 persons), LQTS2 (n,76), LQTS3 (n,179)  and CPVT (n,178). All persons in the pedigrees had a 100 % or 50%  probability of carriership. All cause mortality was compared to the gen   eral Dutch population in similar time intervals (SMR). Results: For LQTS1; there was significant excess mortality in males  (SMR 1.9, CI 1.2 2.9), especially in the age categories 1 9 years (SMR  3.4,CI 1.3 7.4). For LQTS2 patients there was significant excess mor   tality between 5 14 years (SMR 4.8, CI 1.3 12.3).

The disease is usually caused  by mutations in desmosomal genes (desmoplakin,desmocollin 2,des   moglein 2,plakophilin 2 and plakoglobin), which have been associated  with left ventricular involvement. Material and methods: Clinical, familial and genetic (direct sequenc   ing of five desmosomal genes) study of a Spanish group of no related  patients with ARVC was done. Results: A novel splice site mutation in intron 11 of desmocollin 2 gene  (IVS11+2T>C) was detected in a 44 year old ex professional pole  vault jumper who had suffered a cardiac arrest while jogging. This  change was absent in 100 caucasian healthy controls and a truncation  of the protein in exon 11 was predicted. His baseline electrocardio   gram showed negative T waves in right precordial leads. The echocar   diogram showed left ventricle dilation (56 mm) and systolic dysfunc   tion (ejection fraction:45%), and mild global right ventricle dilation with  hypo  and akinetic areas in the outflow tract. A cardiac defibrillator was  implanted and a single appropriate intervention was recorded five years  later. At family screening, the mutation was found in his asymptomatic  70 year old father, who showed left ventricular dilation (60 mm) with  systolic dysfunction (ejection fraction:50%), and mild right ventricular  dilation with doubtful areas of hypertrabeculation and hypokinesia. Conclusions: Only 5 ARVC related mutations have been previously  described desmocollin 2. Most of them have left ventricular involve   ment, as we found in our two carriers.

The genetic screening of the four desmo   somal genes known to be involved in ARVC (plakophilin 2, desmo   plakin, desmoglein 2 and desmocollin 2) identified the heterozygous  missense mutation R49H in the desmoglein 2 gene. This mutation is  located in the highly conserved cleavage motif RXK/RR that is recog   nized by pro protein convertases and is thus predicted to prevent ef   ficient pro desmoglein 2 maturation. The mutation was absent in both  parents, and we demonstrated that it was a de novo mutation. To our  knowledge, this is the first description of a de novo mutation in ARVC.  Appearance of a de novo mutation in the desmoglein 2 gene (that is an  essential component of desmosome that mediates cell to cell adhe   sion) provides compelling genetic evidence for the involvement of this  gene in ARVC. The recognition of de novo mutations has important im   plications, including for clinical practice, since individuals with sporadic  ARVC caused by a de novo mutation can transmit the disease gene  to 50% of their offspring.

M.  van Langen","Academic Medical Centre, Amsterdam, The Netherlands","Introduction: By presenting two cases, we illustrate the implications  of consanguinity in families with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM),  with respect to patient care and DNA analysis techniques. Case reports: Case 1: A man with HCM due to the c.2609G>A muta   tion in MYH7 died suddenly at age 43. His wife was asymptomatic, but  because she was a second cousin of the proband, we performed DNA  analysis on her. She carried the same mutation. DNA analysis in their  asymptomatic 5 year old son showed homozygosity for this mutation.  At cardiologic exam, he had severe signs of HCM and is now carefully  followed at a paediatric cardiology department. Case 2: The son of an asymptomatic consanguineous couple (first  cousins) had a myectomy because of obstructive HCM at age 10 and  ICD implantation at age 17 because of ventricular tachycardia. Using  DHPLC, no mutations were identified in MYH7, MYBPC3 and TPM1.  Because this boy had the same family name as the man in case 1,  we performed sequence analysis to see if the c.2609G>A mutation  in MYH7 could be detected. The mutation was found to be present in  homozygous state, which had been missed by DHPLC. Conclusion: These cases illustrate that in consanguineous families with  HCM, presence of a pathogenic mutation in both persons of a couple  must be considered, with the subsequent possibility of homozygosity  in their children. (Presymptomatic) DNA analysis is recommended for  at risk consanguineous partners and young children who are at risk for  homozygosity.

Methods: Clinical study and phenotypic characterization of probands  and family members of eight Spanish families where K600fs was de   tected. Results: We found 21 carriers in 8 families from a region of Galicia.  Penetrance >90% in >30 years and cosegregation was found in all  families. Mean maximal wall thickness was 20mm. Morphology of  hypertrophy and late enhancement localization at cardiac MRI was  reproducible in several families. Carriers were in NYHA II and left  ventricular outflow tract obstruction was present in 4 patients. Left  atrium dilation and early atrial fibrillation (AF) were present in 9 and  6 carriers, respectively.

The sequences were aligned  upon the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS) and any  incompatibilities were recorded as numerical changes in homoPoly   meric C Tract (PCT), single base substitutions (SBS), insertions and  deletions (Indels). Nucleotide substitutions were found to make up the  majority of the mutations, rather than indels. We drew significantly  high transition rate (81.8%) versus lower frequency of transversions  (18.2%). 12 polymorphisms were identified in this study which had not  been published in the MitoMap database. PCT changes at position  303 309 were detected in 83% of our samples.

","Syndrome of Long QT (LQTS) is among arrhythmia disorders of the  heart that causes of sudden cardiac death in young individuals. As yet,  most of investigations have focused on nuclear genome for finding of  genetic defects in this disorder, but some of the cases with LQTS can   not be explained by mutations of identified genes. On the other hand,  it has been reported that the activity of ion channels in cardiomyocytes  is sensitive to ATP level. It prompted us to focus on the mitochondrial  DNA and monitor the point mutations of genome which are probably  the cause of respiratory chain defects and reduced ATP generation. We  searched about 55% of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) by temporal  temperature gradient gel electrophoresis (TTGE) and DNA fragments  showing abnormal banding patterns were sequenced for identification  of exact mutations. In 39 patients (33 familial and 6 sporadic cases),  for the first time, we detected 35 mtDNA mutations which 8 were novel  (23%) and 27 (77%) have been reported in other mitochondrial dis   eases. Our results showed that theses mutations in LQTS patients  were higher than normal controls (P<0.0001) and number of mutations  in LQT patients with syncope is higher than patients without syncope  (P<0.001). As the mitochondrionâs ATP synthesis is important in heart,  it is possible that mutations and their accumulation in mtDNA could  constitute a predisposing factor that in combination with environmental  risk factors may trigger the arrhythmia disorders and may be the link  between this syndrome and dysfunctions of mitochondria.",2009

Objective: This study aims to report the spectrum of LQTS mutations  in Sweden, as well as genotype phenotype correlations. Knowledge of  founder mutations or certain subdiagnostic criteria for different muta   tions will facilitate the molecular genetic analysis, thereby reducing the  turn around time and cost.  Methods: Twohundred consecutive, unrelated patients referred for  LQTS genetic testing will be evaluated. Coding sequences and splice  sites of the five genes, as well as alternate transcript exon 1B of KCNQ1   and KCNH2 , will be screened for genomic variants by denaturing high  performance liquid chromatography (dHPLC) and DNA sequencing.

The origin of DCM is  heterogeneous but genetic transmission of the disease accounts for  10 35% of cases. We present a large three generation family in which  DCM inherits as an autosomal dominant trait. Six family members  have DCM, with the age of diagnosis ranging from five months to 52  years. The youngest one was initially diagnosed with non compaction  cardiomyopathy (NCCM) and died at the age of five. Three additional  young children died of suspected heart problems. We mapped the  phenotype of this family to chromosome 15 and subsequently identi   fied a missense mutation in alpha tropomyosin (TPM1), leading to a  p.D84N amino acid substitution. Tropomyosins are sarcomeric, thin  filament proteins that play fundamental, structural and regulatory roles  in skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. The far majority of mutations in  TPM1 are associated with hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) and  few with DCM. Our mutation has not been described before and was  not detected in 400 control chromosomes. It co segregates with all  clinically affected family members, and is predicted, using existing  atomic and protein models, to weaken the binding of tropomyosin to  actin. In conclusion, DCM causing mutations in TPM1 are associated  with a divers phenotype including also lethal, early onset forms. The  screening of patients and families with these forms of DCM for TPM1  is therefore warranted.",2009

Mutations in more than 11 genes, mostly  encoding sarcomeric proteins, are known to cause HCM. Variability in  clinical expression is thought to be caused by the action of currently  unknown modifying factors. Current consensus partially explains the  variability in clinical expression by the effect of additional, secondary,  mutations in sarcomeric genes. To analyse whether a complex HCM genotype is an important modifier  of disease severity in HCM we completely analysed 11 HCM genes in  a large cohort, homogeneous with respect to primary HCM causing  mutation. Methods: We analysed the complete coding regions of MYH7, MYB   PC3, MYL2, MYL3, TNNT2, TNNI3, TNNC1, ACTC1, TMP1, TCAP   and CSRP3 in a large cohort of patients with a truncating MYBPC3   mutation as primary HCM defect.

Results: no additional mutational âburdenâ was seen in the group with  severe HCM compared to the group with milder HCM. Conclusion: Contrary to general consensus, the severity of phenotypic  expression of HCM is not primarily dependent on the modifying effects  of secondary sarcomeric mutations.

Methods and Results: Cardiologic screening with electrocardiogra   phy, echocardiography and physical examination of 169 relatives  from 46 unrelated NCCM probands revealed familial cardiomyopathy  in 34 families (74%), including NCCM, HCM and DCM. Seventy four  percent of the relatives newly diagnosed with cardiomyopathy were  asymptomatic, explaining that 54% of familial disease remained unde   tected by ascertainment of family history prior to cardiologic screening.  The molecular screening included analysis of 17 genes yielding 29  different mutations in 23 probands (41%); 18 adult and five children.  Fifteen single mutations and one double mutation on the same allele  were transmitted in an autosomal dominant mode.

The observation of a transient alteration of the  ECG repolarization with a torsades de pointes episode 9 days after a  surgical stress suggested a Takotsubo cardiomyopathy. After transient  normalization of the ECG, congenital LQTS was diagnosed on the ba   sis of a persistent QT prolongation.

Three recent case reports suggested that both LQTS and Takotsubo  syndrome may be causally related but no mutation in the LQTS genes  have been identified yet.In conclusion, we describe a patient with Ta   kotsubo uncovering a congenital form of LQTS.

Not only  nonsense mutations, but also missense and even translationally silent  mutations can lead to alternative splicing events. In the DMD gene,  the identification of a mutation introducing a premature stop codon in  patients with a milder (Becker like) phenotype than expected (Duch  enne like) is a pointer of such mechanisms. The rescue of the pheno   type results from the partial elimination of the truncating mutation from  dystrophin mRNA by skipping of an in frame exon. A large fraction of  these mutations are supposed to exert their effects by disrupting the  activity of Exonic Splicing Enhancers (ESEs), but repression of splicing  may also be due to the creation of an Exonic Splicing Silencer (ESS).

LGMD2A is caused by mutations in the CAPN3  gene  (15q15) that encodes the muscle specific protein, calpain 3 (p94). LG   MD2A is the most frequent form of LGMD in many European coun   tries. Until now, more than 300 pathogenic mutations have been found in the  CAPN3 gene. We performed analysis of the CAPN3 gene in LGMD2A  patients at both the mRNA level using reverse transcription PCR or at  the DNA level using PCR and direct sequencing. We screened 138  unrelated patients with preliminary diagnoses of limb girdle muscular  dystrophy for mutations in the CAPN3 gene. 39 patients (28%) were  found to carry mutations in the CAPN3 gene. We detected 16 pre   viously reported mutations and 3 novel mutations (c. 802_945del, c.  1783_1788del, p.Q619X). Our results show that mutation 550 delA is the most frequent CAPN3  defect in Czech LGMD2A patients (53 %). In total, 33 % of the patients  with mutation in the CAPN3 gene are homozygous for c.550delA, and  64 % carry it at least on one allele.

Since FacioScapuloHumer   al muscular Dystrophy (FSHD) is an inherited myopathy characterized  by altered splicing of mRNAs encoding muscle specific proteins, we  have studied the splicing pattern of FXR1 mRNA in myoblasts and  myotubes of FSHD patients. We show here that FSHD myoblasts dis   play an abnormal pattern of expression of FXR1P isoforms. Moreover,  we provide evidence that this altered pattern of expression is due to  a specific reduced stability of muscle specific FXR1 mRNA variants,  leading to a reduced expression of FXR1P muscle specific isoforms.  Our data suggest that the molecular basis of FSHD not only involves  splicing alterations, as previously proposed, but may also involve a  deregulation of mRNA stability. In addition, since FXR1P is an RNA  binding protein likely to regulate the metabolism of muscle specific  mRNAs during myogenesis, its altered expression in FSHD myoblasts  may contribute to the physiopathology of this disease.",2009

It affects various organs including skel   etal muscle, heart, brain, eye, endocrine, and gastrointestinal systems.  It is characterized with progressive muscle weakness and wasting and  difficulty in muscles relaxation after contraction (myotonia). It is caused  by an excessive number of CTG repeats at chromosome 19q13.2 13.3  region. It has four subtypes. These are classified as; premutation, mild, classi   cal and congenital. These subtypes are named according to changes  in repeat numbers. In a normal person CTG repeat number can go up  to 35. Trinucleotide repeat number between 35 and 50 is not attributed  to a disease condition though they are not stabile and are inherited  from one generation to the next.

The mo   lecular basis of DM1 lies in the instability of a CTG repeat in the 3â  UTR of the DM1 protein kinase gene. Small expanded DM1 alleles  are usually unstable and often increase in number in successive gen   erations. Here we evaluated the risk on expansion of an additional  22 pre  (37 50 CTG repeats) and 41 protomutation (50 80 repeats) in  relation to sex and repeat length in DM1 transmitting parents for 63  DM1 parent child pairs (33 males, 30 females).

For the transmitting males, 23/33 (70%) repeats expanded to  a full mutation upon transmission, whereas 5/33 (15%) repeats were  stable and 5/33 (15%) slightly increased. For the transmitting females,  these values were 5/30 (17%), 17/30 (57%) and 6/30 (20%), respec   tively. When the results were subdivided by repeat length, only one  (1/8, 13%) transmitting male gave rise to a full mutation in the offspring  in the premutation range, and 9/11 (82%), 6/6 (100%) and 7/8 (86%) Molecular and biochemical basis of disease in the protomutation ranges, 51 60, 61 70 and 71 80 repeats, respec   tively.

Hu2","1University Medical Center Groningen, Groningen, The Netherlands, 2Peking  University Health Science Center, Beijing, China, 3Medical College of Georgia,  Augusta, GA, United States","Background: Evidence from candidate gene studies suggests that  obesity may modify the genetic susceptibility to hypertension, type 2  diabetes and dyslipidemia. Gene obesity interactions are expected to  result in different heritability estimates at different obesity levels. Method: The present study included 1260 monozygotic and 842 di   zygotic twins (meanÂ±SD age: 37.90Â±9.85; range: 19.14 81.36) from  the Chinese Twins Registry. Outcome measures were systolic blood  pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), fasting glucose and  triglycerides. Structural equation modeling was used to test whether  body mass index (BMI) interacted with latent genetic and environmen   tal effects on the outcome measures. Results: Genetic influences on triglycerides increased with BMI  (p<0.001), which resulted in a higher heritability estimate at higher BMI  levels. However, the environmental influence on SBP, DBP and fasting  glucose increased with BMI (p<0.001), which resulted in lower heri   tability estimates at higher BMI levels. This was confirmed by strati   fied analysis in twin pairs concordant for normal weight (BMI<25kg/m2)  and twin pairs concordant for overweight (BMIâ¥25mg/m2). Heritabilities  were 12 percentage points higher for triglycerides, whereas 29, 7 and  6 percentage points lower for SBP, DBP and fasting glucose, respec   tively, among twins concordant for overweight relative to twins concor   dant for normal weight. Conclusion: Our results suggest that the expression of genes influenc   ing triglyceride levels can vary as a function of obesity status. The  substantial increase in the genetic contribution to the total variance in  triglyceride and decreases in SBP, DBP and fasting glucose may prove  valuable in aiding gene finding efforts.",2009

Replication of polygenet   ic disease associations has often revealed false positive findings and  overestimated effects in initial reports in the past. Therefore, this study  aimed to replicate the association of the variant rs2237895, which was  originally found in an Asian population and assesses its effect on type  2 diabetes in a case control study of 2.697 KORA participants (1230  cases/ 1467 controls). We further extended our analyses to the gly   cemic traits in a population based sub sample of 1092 fasting KORA  participants. Results of our analyses confirmed the minor C allele as  risk variant for type 2 diabetes (OR,1.12 [1.00,1.25]; p,0.049). This  association could be ascribed to the association in men (OR,1.16  [1.00,1.35]; p,0.040). Assessing effects for metabolic parameters, sig   nificantly increased fasting glucose levels were found for the C allele  of rs2237895 (beta estimate,1.39 mg/dl; p,0.01) in men, supporting  affection of pancreatic beta cell function by variants in KCNQ1 leading to type 2 diabetes by means of impaired insulin secretion. However,  mechanisms remain unclear and absence of the effect in women has  to be elucidated in further studies.

When  the pathway is impaired, insulin resistance appeared and finally type  2 diabetes develops. Methods: The SNP polymorphisms located in regulatory region of se   lected genes implicated in insulin signal transduction as well as the  expression level of these genes were analyzed. The study was per   formed in type 2 diabetes patients with and without insulin resistance  (assessed by HOMA IR) and in healthy subjects. Expression rate and  SNPs were tested in genes: PIK3R1  (rs3756668, rs1862162), PTPN1   (rs16989673) and SLC2A4  (rs5417, rs5418).

Results: PIK3R1  and PTPN1  exhibited correlation between HOMA IR  and expression level (R, 0,5485 and R, 0,5257, respectively). Gene  expression level compared between tested groups revealed significant  difference in  PIK3R1  expression rate (p,0,0172), furthermore we were  close to achieve statistical importance for G/G carriers of rs3756668  and expression level of PIK3R1  (p,0,06).

","Arterial hypertension (AH), either essential or secondary, is an impor   tant issue in childhood for its short  and long term cardiovascular mor   bidity. The frequency of arterial hypertension in children was estimated  at the level of 1 5% of the population. Renal diseases are the most  frequent causes of AH in children, but essential hypertension can also  be detected early in life. Among the many potential causes of second   ary hypertension are renal parenchymal disease, occlusive renal arte   rial disease, adrenocortical abnormalities, and pheochromocytoma. It  is important for blood pressure to be checked regularly (at least once  every year) in healthy children and adolescents and at every medi   cal visit in those belonging to at risk categories (family history of AH,  low birth weight, obesity, etc). Essential hypertension is a multifactorial  disease in wich both genetic and enviromental factors play important  roles.

RodrÃ­guez","Servicio de Salud del Principado de Asturias, Oviedo, Spain","Purpose Inherited and acquired risk factors contribute to the development of  the atherosclerotic lesion and its most serious clinical manifestation,  myocardial infarction (MI). Studies with human tissues and animal  models have suggested a role for matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) in  atherosclerosis, and several functional polymorphisms in the MMP 1   gene have been linked to the risk for MI. The aim of this study was to  evaluate the association between three promoter polymorphisms and  early MI in a Spanish cohort. Methods We performed a case control study with 261 unrelated male patients  who had suffered an early MI and 194 healthy matched controls. All  participants were smokers and younger than 60 years. The genotypes  for the three MMP 1  promoter polymorphisms ( 1607 1G/2G;  519 A/ G;  340 T/C) were determined through restriction enzyme digestion  of a PCR fragment (PCR RFLP). Comparison of allele and genotype  frequencies of individual polymorphisms and haplotypes was carried  out using the chi square test (SHEsis software). Results Allelic and genotypic frequencies of individual polymorphisms did not  differ between patients and controls. Statistical analysis of the hap   lotypes showed that the combination  16072G/ 519G/ 340T, present in  3.4 % of controls, had a higher frequency among patients (p,0.005;  OR,2.4; CI,[1.27 4.55]). Moreover, the haplotype  16071G/ 519G/  340T showed higher frequency in controls (p,0.02; OR,0.68; 95 %  CI,[0.49 0.94]). This haplotype is the combination of alleles with a de   scribed less transcriptional activity. Conclusion Our results confirmed and extended the previously reported associa   tion between MMP 1  promoter polymorphisms and MI, proving that its  action could be through the instability and rupture of the plaque.",2009

Previous studies reported a population tendency  for hypercholesterolemia, one of the main factors contributing to the  development of atherosclerosis (AT), considered the primary cause of  CAD. Apolipoprotein E has a key role in plasma lipid metabolism, given  its function as a ligand for cell surface receptor mediated uptake of  lipoproteins. Polymorphism in the apolipoprotein gene ( APOE ) results  in three major isoforms encoded by three codominant alleles (E2, E3  and E4). With the purpose of establishing the pattern of variation at the  APOE locus and determining its association with lipid profile, we stud   ied a random sample of 298 unrelated, apparently healthy individuals  of Azorean origin. In nearly 50% of the sample total cholesterol (TC)  was above 200mg/dl; in 25% of the individuals LDL cholesterol (LDL  C) was higher than 130 mg/dl. Allele frequencies were 0.0833, 0.8317  and 0.0850 for E2, E3 and E4, respectively. Genotype frequencies  were higher for E3*E3 genotype (66.1%); genotype distribution dis   played conformity with Hardy Weinberg expectations. No differences  in allelic frequencies were found in comparison with other Caucasian  populations, namely with mainland Portugal. E3*E4 individuals pre   sented the highest cholesterol levels. Analysis of variance performed  with the most represented genotypes (E2*E3, E3*E3 and E3*E4) re   vealed a clear association between the genotypic composition and TC,  as well as LDL C, thus confirming in this population, the role of APOE   as one of the genetic determinants of AT.",2009

Heme oxygenase (HO) leads to the generation of free iron, carbon  monoxide, and bilirubin. A length polymorphism of GT repeats in the  promoter of human HO 1 gene shows difference transcriptional activ   ity which modulate the transcription of the gene in vascular cells. The  aim of this study was to assess the association of the length of (GT)(n)  repeats in the development of coronary artery disease (CAD). METHODS:We screened the allelic frequencies of (GT)(n) repeats  in the HO 1 gene promoter in 59 patients who underwent coronary  angiography. Because the distribution of numbers of (GT)(n) repeats Genetic analysis, linkage ans association was bimodal, based on previously studies we divided the alleles into 2  subclasses: class S included shorter (<27) repeats, and class L includ   ed longer (> or ,27) repeats. Multivariate logistic regression models  including standard coronary risk factors revealed that the genotypes  were significantly related to CAD status . In this study, the patients with  shorter GT repeats were less likely to have CAD.

Two variants, CYP2C9*2  and *3, have reduced cata   lytic activity. We studied the impact of these variants on the activity  of the renin angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS) in two cohorts of  hypertensive subjects. The GENRES Study consisted of 219 hypertensive Finnish men, aged  35 to 60 years, who were treated with four different antihypertensive  monotherapies for four weeks. Baseline laboratory values were mea   sured at the end of the first placebo period. The cohort with treatment  resistant essential hypertension (TREH) consisted of 170 females and  145 males who completed a captopril challenge test (CCT) and had no  interfering medications. Allele frequencies for CYP2C9*2  and *3 in both cohorts correspond to  reported Caucasian frequencies. In the GENRES group, CYP2C9*1*3   genotype was associated with lower baseline plasma renin activity  (PRA) and serum aldosterone levels compared with CYP2C9*1*1  gen  otype ( P,0.0008 and 0.009, respectively).

Mures. Material and methods. We carried out a case control study on 144  patients and 73 healthy controls. Anthropometric measurements, bio   chemical assays were undertaken, fasting insulinemia was measured  by ELISA, and insulin sensitivity was assessed by the QUICKI indices.  Genetic analysis was done by PCR followed by restriction enzyme di   gestion with Hha I, BstU I and Ava II. Results. Regardless of their type, the increase of the number of predis   posing alleles on the three studied loci associates with a significantly  increased risk to develop the syndrome (chi2 for trend , 7.99, df , 1, p  , 0.0047), and the risk was highest in the presence of the TT + PP/PA  + QQ/KQ genotype combination (OR , 4.31, p, 0.015). Conclusion. Our results confirm the small but additive effect of certain  predisposing gene polymorphisms as part of a polygenic system in the  development of the common metabolic syndrome, though individual  gene combinations can be presumed and other gene interactions like  epistasis seem also plausible.",2009

A group of 190 men with CAD diagnosed by coronarography at age  <60 years was recruited. LVSI was recognized when the left ventricular  ejection fraction value was below/equal 40%. Patients were divided  into 4 subgroups according to the LVSI and hypertension occurrence:  105 patients qualified to have normal systolic function (44,8% hyper   tensive) and 85 patients qualified to have LVSI (47,1% hypertensive).  The MTHFR and APOE (apolipoprotein E) genotypes were ascer   tained by PCR RFLP methods. tHcy and FA levels were measured by  immunochemical methods. The differences in distribution of MTHFR  genotypes were studied in CAD patients in relation to the APOE33  genotype, hypertension and LVSI cooccurrence. The subgroup of normotensive subjects with LVSI, as compared to the  rest of patients, was characterized by the 2,6 fold higher frequency of  677TT homozygotes (p<0,05) and the higher tHcy level (15,5 Â±13,2  Âµmol/L; 12,0 Â±5,4 Âµmol/L; respectively; p,0,04).

Familial cases cover 10% of cases and a  model of autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance  and genetic anticipation has been proposed. Mutations in the gene  BMPR2  have been described as responsible for 90% of familial cas   es, despite the fact that only 20% of the relatives of mutation carriers  develop the disease. For idiopathic pulmonary arterial hypertension,  mutations in the BMPR2 gene have been described in a 9 26% of  cases. These data support the hypothesis of the existence of other  genes involved and the environmental effect on the development of  this condition. Vasodilators such as nitric oxide (NO) and prostacyclin, along with pro   longed overexpresion of vasoconstrictors such as endothelin (ET 1),  not only affect vascular tone but also promote vascular remodelling.  Both have been implicated in the pathogenesis of PAH. NO is an endothelial derived relaxing factor that is synthesized from  L arginine by nitric oxide synthase.

","Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) plays a critical role in the  maintenance of cardiovascular homeostasis. Extensive research has  aimed at identifying ACE genetic variants responsible for variation in  enzyme plasma concentrations and associated with human diseases.  These efforts have been hampered by the extensive linkage disequi   librium across the gene and the identity an location of the functional  polymorphism(s) is at presently unknown. Here, we characterize the sequence variation and haplotype structure  of the ACE gene region surrounding the Alu insertion/deletion (Alu I/ D) polymorphism in 4 human populations. We observed high levels  of nucleotide diversity, an excess of intermediate frequency alleles  and, at least in African populations, a higher level of within species  diversity compared to interspecific divergence. Analysis of haplotype  genealogy indicated the presence of two major clades separated by  deep branches with a coalescence time older than 1.5 million years. All  these features strongly suggest the action of balancing selection and  we verified that the selection signature is restricted to the gene region  surrounding the Alu I/D. Our data therefore imply the presence of a functional polymorphism in  the Alu I/D region and illustrate the contribution of evolutionary models  to classic SNP phenotype association approaches by providing infor   mation about the localization of candidate functional variants.",2009

It is well known that  HDL cholesterol concentration is regulated by physical activity concen   tration. OBJECTIVES: To study an association between PPAR alpha  gene polymorphism and lipid and glucose levels, physical activity and  body mass index (BMI) in children from families with a history of CVD.  STUDY POPULATION: 58 children (average age 13.2Â±0.53) and ado   lescents with family history of CVD. METHODS: We have evaluated  physical activity index per week and per day. Lipid spectrum in all  patients was determined by enzyme linked immunoassay. In all pa   tients we detected glucose concentration and BMI. Molecular testing of  PPAR alpha gene polymorphism (L162V) was performed by PCR. RE   SULTS: Among 58 children and adolescents, 53 of them had LL geno   type and 5 had LV genotype. Frequency of L allele and V allele were  estimated to be 0.96 and 0.04, respectively. In children carried LV gen   otype, we detected a higher level of cholesterol (5.08Â±0.08, 4.82Â±0.13  mmol/l) and lower triglycerides level (0.84Â±0.04 vs 1.49Â±0.116 mmol/l)  compared to children with LL genotype. We determined correlations  between cholesterol and LDL level (r,0.82) in children with LL geno   type and between physical activity intensivity and glucose level (r,  0.84) in children with LV genotype.

FH is most commonly caused by muta   tions in LDLR gene. About 6% are located near a slice junction or with   in intron, predicted to affect the correct splicing of the mRNA. A total of 11 potential splice site mutations, were found in the âPor   tuguese FH Studyâ. Six alterations, five of them novel, needed fur   ther investigation. RT PCR of LDLR mRNA isolated from fresh blood  mononuclear cells of each patient was performed to test the effect  of the alteration on splicing. Three of these variants (c.1060+1G>A,  c.2140+1G>A, c.2547+1G>A) caused exon/exons skipping; c.190+4  insTG caused retention of two nucleotides of intron 2, and c.818 2G>A  caused retention of 10 nucleotides of intron 5. One variant could not  be tested experimentally, but it almost certainly affect splicing because  disrupts the invariant GT donor spice sites (1845+1delG). All these  alterations lead to a premature termination of the protein which means  that the protein coded by the affected allele is smaller and has no func   tion, most possible is degraded within the cell. To correctly estimate  the number of transcripts that are not correctly spliced, real time PCR  should be performed. This will be the next experimental step. It is important to functional assay the effect on splicing of the altera   tions found to prevent genetic misdiagnosis of FH patients and to de   termine the severity of the disease.",2009

The aim of this study was to investigate a possible association between  the polymorphisms C282Y and H63D of the haemochromatosis ( HFE)  gene and the prevalence of PD in Southern Italy. These variants of the  HFE gene cause an iron overload disorder, known as hereditary hae   mochromatosis. Contradictory evidence exists on the role of the HFE  variants as risk factors for PD. The HFE protein is thought to interact  with the transferrin receptor (TFR), lowering its affinity for iron bound  transferrin  (TF).

These disorders link to more  than 20 genetic loci. These diseases are often caused by expansion  of triplet repeats encoding polyglutamine tracts. Parkinsonâs disease  (PD) has been related to mutations associated with SCAs. The aim of  this study was to investigate a selected group of familial PD patients  and healthy controls through genetic analysis of SCA2 and SCA17  genes. The patients did not carry either SNCA (A30P, A53T, E46K) or  UCH L1 (I93M) mutations and were negative for LRRK2 G2019S and  I2020T. Eighty five PD unrelated patients with autosomal dominant inheri   tance, belonging to southern Italian families with at least three affected  members over three generations , and 100 controls were analyzed for  CAG expansions in the SCA2 and SCA17 genes. PCR products, am   plified with fluorescent primers spanning the SCA expansions, were  separated onto a capillary ABI3130XL sequencer and analyzed by the  software Genemapper. SCA17 mutations were detected in 2 (2.3%) of the examined patients,  whereas no cases were positive for SCA2. Neither SCA17 nor SCA2  expansions were identified in controls. The size of CAG repeats in  SCA17 was small (43 44 repeats, usually associated with reduced  penetrance) Our results show that SCA17 is a rare genetic cause of PD in our pop   ulation. However, after exclusion of genetic mutations of other known  PD genes, SCA17 should be taken into account for the molecular diag   nosis of familial PD with autosomal dominant inheritance.",2009

Different risk factors  and mechanisms may lead to a final common pathway of cardio respi   ratory compromise. Mutations in the gene coding for the alfa 1 subunit  of the neuronal voltage gated sodium channel ( SCN1A ) gene, have  been described in families with generalized epilepsy with febrile sei   zures plus (GEFS+). Mutations in genes coding for ion channels have  also been associated to cardiac channelopathies. SUDEP is the most  important direct epilepsy related cause of death, and it has been sug   gested that some of these deaths may be due to cardiac arrhythmias.  The neuronal voltage gated sodium channel may have a role in pace   maker function of the sino atrial node and blocking this channel slows  the heart and increases heart rate variability. The SCN1A  gene was analyzed in a three generation GEFS+ family  with two SUDEP cases. In this family, different epileptic phenotypes  were present: Dravet syndrome, Doose syndrome and febrile seizures  plus. Bi directional sequencing of SCN1A  revealed a new mutation  (M1427T) in the patient with Dravet syndrome. This mutation is located  in domain III, between transmembrane segments S5 and S6.
